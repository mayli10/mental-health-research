Usually I’ll take a subway line that drops me several blocks from my office instead of the one that literally goes right to the front door. I love the city cause it’s so easy and fun to walk for like ever and ever! ,False,False

I used to walk \~45 minutes to/from work, and even that modest distance was enough to wear holes in the heels of my shoes and socks. That was the skinniest year of my life...walking must have burned a lot of calories without exploding my appetite the way running does now. And I discovered a lot of new music that way haha",False,False
