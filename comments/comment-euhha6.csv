I dont even know you but I know enough that self loathing and pity never got anyone (including me) anywhere.  I dont know if you have a kid or a pet but at least you have patients and a husband. You have people that depend on you. you can’t implode yet, there are still people that need you.   I’ve also had a lot of trouble with my family regarding explaining how I feel and have come to the conclusion that the best thing they can do is just tell me they support me. I don’t know what your going through but I just want to say I support you. Good luck out there.",False,True

Either way I can’t help focusing on trends of him always wanting to hang out/fuck when my weight is low. Dropped weight = more attention!!  I know know know know know there’s no logic behind me dropping 4 pounds that probably no one can notice and him hitting me up. But alas, here I am.  Fuck I’m lonely and scared to have feelings for a guy again.",False,False

I’ve decided that instead of attempting to explain to my husband how I feel and what I need (and then be disappointed again when I spell things out and nothing changes), I’ll just succumb fully to the ED and maybe he’ll figure out that I’m really not ok. At least there’s less of a chance of feeling like he just doesn’t give a shit.    I’m good at listening to my patients and making them feel safe and cared about.",False,False

Good day at the gym, got 5x5 305lb squat. Average age at my gym is around 50 so it feels good to flex in the boomers. Read quite a bit today and felt good for it. Highlight of the day was taking a nap with my cat post workout. Feels good man. No problems with food today, some diet soda was involved but that’s alright.   I am very good at knowing us history, comes easy to me and i love reading about it.  Physically I’m abnormally good at bench press. Can get 285lbs at 200 lb body weight. (Am 6ft 2in)",False,True
