It made me feel terrible and stressed out and sad and broken but also calm and relieved and sane. Just having a label on things has helped me move forward. I hope this helps you too ❤️,False,False

My family still avoids the word, even after two years of being diagnosed and a long-ass stay in residential treatment after almost fucking dying of anorexia. It drives me insane. I'm glad you finally got confirmation that it's real and valid, and I hope it gets better for you &lt;3",False,False
