Yeah, I'm going to hang onto them for now because they'll fit again if I gain the weight back (I would like to recover eventually) but this may be a good time to go thrift for some new jeans!",False,True

The baggy crotch thing is the worst though. It sounds like the older pants were ready to go anyway, I hope some good comes your way soon and you score some new rad jeans!",False,False

The one thing that does make me feel better is that most of them are jeans I either got for free, bought on sale/thrifted, or have owned since I was in high school (I'm 23!), and the two pairs I most recently bought do fit me still, if not just loosely enough that I need a belt. The pants that don't fit at all right now are mostly pants that were already stretched out to the point of sliding down after a few wears, even if they fit the first wear out of the dryer.",False,True

I should be happy, but I didn't want to have to go buy more pants..",False,True
