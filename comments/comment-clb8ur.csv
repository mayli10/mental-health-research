I am working on beating my binge/restrict cycle right now and, you're right, the binge urge is like a screaming child! Thank you for the advice.  ""Ok. Maybe later but not unless you're good and you can't have it all, that's greedy"" haha",False,False

I'm so proud of you. No joke, even if it feels silly, I swear ""parenting yourself"" is one of the best ways to heal things like this. I struggle with BED myself-so bad I got WLS at 18 try to stop it-but one of the most effective things for me has been this method of treating my cravings like kids having tantrums.   They need soothing, they need reason, they need understanding. They don't need their parents laughing at their outburst of emotion ^((...or did just my parents do that?)). But once you've done all that, all you can do is just ignore it as best you can and say ""okay, the answer is still no, but I think we need some time to calm down"". Giving into binging.... it's like laughing at and ignoring a distressed child without even asking why they're so worked up, dismissing it as ""oh they're just tired but fighting sleep"". I know kids are silly, they get mad over the most ridiculous things, but it's important they know they're heard and understood, or that they're parents at least care about them enough to try to understand there feelings. This method is commonly used for PSTD and C-PTSD too. Our urge to binge really is like a spoiled kid begging for another chocolate bar when they literally ate one. I really cannot think of a better analogy of BED than the ""spoiled cranky kid with no concept of self-control"".  And honestly, when can't seem to care about yourself, it helps a lot to work through your problems via an imaginary kid. You wouldn't do it for yourself, but you'd do it for them.",False,False
