Technically if you had other eating disordered behavior that didn’t qualify as AN or another dx I guess you could have both. But what is more likely is that you used to not meet criteria for AN and now you do, or the clinician was previously unsure/didn’t have enough info and now has enough where they can dx AN. Regardless my guess is that they just didn’t delete the old dx from the computer system (which has no idea about classification rules). I work in this field so I have some idea of how medical records work in this regard - hope this helps!",False,False
