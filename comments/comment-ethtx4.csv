I've been suffering from persistent depression and suicidal ideation since about thirteen years of age, only in the last three years have I started to worsen noticeably, which doesn't seem to fit.

Unfortunately, it is very expensive and until I have a job, not really a viable option for me.   Generally, I have been drinking my calories. Dairy and meat are the most nauseating things to me atm, so I've had a lot of vegan protein shakes and soy/almond milk. I've been trying to switch to regular soda just to get calories in that way, but that's an avoidance food for me, so it's not been very successful. Then at night, I typically have a bowl of plain rice or plain pasta. Something bland like that.   I am taking a multivitamin, so hopefully, that picks up some slack. I'll also look into free clinics, hadn't even considered that to be an option. Thank you.",False,True

But you can fight this. The fact that you cared enough to tell someone proves it to me. If you have a primary care physician, make sure that they know that this isn't your eating disorder coming back (by not eating, you are ironically still intuitively eating at this point, which points to a neurobiological cause), but that you're literally actually unable to eat and really depressed.",False,False

I'm not a medical doctor but I have a few ideas of substances, many of them legal, that could help. (the obvious one, but it's illegal where you are (even if you're in a legalising state), is parts of individuals of *Cannabis* species.)  The obvious thing to ask is, are there foods you can comfortably get down? I find a strawberry seems to unreliably drive hunger for me. Do you normally tolerate cow's milk? Are you at least attempting to take a multivitamin every day so you don't drain down your micronutrients as fast, and if so, are you succeeding in that?",False,False
