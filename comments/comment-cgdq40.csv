It‚Äôs the best :)    Oh also, I was totally kidding when I questioned the gag reflex convo.. pretty sure everyone knows why that came up!!!    Hope things keep going well!!",False,False

The other day I legit almost threw up bending over to pick up something. I had to swallow it back down! In front of a cute guy too. It was fun.  Yeah I think it‚Äôs important to share with partners. The way they handle your ED says so much about whether or not you can rely on them for support. And sometimes the way people deal with things are vastly different, which leads ultimately to incompatibility. so it‚Äôs a good barometer for compatibility if you ask me.   Aww it sounds like your current bf is a good one. Even if he misunderstands and you guys end up arguing, at least you know it‚Äôs out of love. I hope you guys continue to be happy and well ‚ô•Ô∏èüòä  Don‚Äôt apologize! I love comments like this. It means so much when I get to hear about how peoples lives and how they really feel about things. It makes the world feel less lonely and cold. So thank you for writing. Yesss I‚Äôm actually seeing him later! We went to breakfast this morning too. I feel like a giddy schoolgirl lol",False,True

I think shedding light on it keeps it from festering within anymore than it already has. Honestly, it‚Äôs not ‚Äòbad‚Äô in the sense that it‚Äôs anything to be ashamed of. But yes it is completely harmful and just shitty.   I‚Äôm glad you‚Äôve been able to talk about it too, and hope you are getting better by the day.",False,True

Honestly, the big reason EDs are still so hard to ""cure"" is because there's so little talk about it- and even when there is, it's often very generalized and inaccurate. So, great, GREAT job!! I hope your date went amazing, and I hope you're doing well. ‚ô•",False,False

Hopefully he took it well and will be understanding and respectful about it.   I‚Äôve always tried to keep it up front in relationships (casual hookups, absolutely not!) but I always take relationships really seriously and want to be able to share my real self with them. But sometimes it doesn‚Äôt go great - like my first serious boyfriend was super concerned, but instead of being there for me, he‚Äôd always police what I ate, (even if he didn‚Äôt say anything, he would always be watching) and it made it a lot worse. He seemed to think I could just ‚Äúget over it‚Äù or stop at will. Ugh.  And another guy I told early on, barely acknowledged it - when I first told him, he just nodded and changed the subject. Then if it ever came up, he‚Äôd ignore it or act like he didn‚Äôt hear it. Really annoying.    I told my current bf super early on, but only bc when we first got to know each other (we were co-workers, it wasn‚Äôt a date) he talked about his ex a lot and she‚Äôd had an eating disorder for the 5 years they were together, so I could obviously relate. And he‚Äôs been really great about being exactly the right kind of support, and definitely seems to understand it - like he never makes any comments/compliments about my weight, he‚Äôll tell me how he loves my eyes, my hair, my skin, personality. It‚Äôs nice. But then sometimes he‚Äôll be convinced something I‚Äôm doing is bc of ED and it‚Äôs totally not, but just bc his ex did it and he thinks he knows. It ends up starting stupid fights and that‚Äôs extremely irritating.    Lol, sorry for the long comment, just kind of got me thinking. But congrats on telling your date - hope it continues to go well :)",False,False

I feel like every time I share my ED with someone I get stronger and feel better about it. It's like this huge, dark, scary thing in my head, but once I say it out loud it's not so bad. I mean, it is still bad, but telling someone means you have one less person to hide it from and one more person to support you.",False,False
