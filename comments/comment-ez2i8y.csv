I asked my sister if she felt like he was being mean to her and she said no and that he's just like that, so I told her I'm not a fan of him if he's around I won't be (and that if she gets sick of her friends she has plenty of other people who love her!)  The girl wasn't at school today which was nice, but I am gonna ask her abt it because you're right it does sound kinda sus  Thanks again!! &lt;3",False,True

I don't think he should be invited to your house. If he take it badly and harasses either of you at school, you should take it up with an administrator because then that's happening on school grounds. But this dude just sounds totally bad for both of you.  As far as that girl, yeah I'm getting red flags for compulsive liar. 50 surgeries... you should ask her about what kind of surgeries they were, then google the recovery time for them and see if that shit makes any sense at all.",False,False
