Its part of the reason I developed an ED in middle school. When i gained weight last year, they would always remind me like ‚Äúooh you‚Äôre getting chubby look at your cheeks. Come look at her cheeks [insert older brothers name]‚Äù or ‚Äúeating all that pizza really caught up to you huh.‚Äù I know its a mix of jealousy with playfulness because they‚Äôd still remind me that im beautiful and shit, but it definitely ruined my self esteem and body image.",False,False

My dad used to tell me that I should stop eating so much sweets because in a few years I'll be wanting to lose all that extra weight on my hips. I had a normal BMI back then but was already restricting, which he didn't know (and still doesn't). He pinched the fat on my hips and said that I should stop wearing those tight stretch-jeans because they make my figure look horrible and my legs huge. What he didn't know until he went shopping with me... It wasn't the jeans, it was my legs (because of a medical condition). But he kept commenting that I could lose that extra fat on my hips by walking/jogging, being more active (which isn't true), while my ribs were/are already showing. But as soon as I lose 2-4lbs, he says something like: ""Did you lose weight? You look so thin, you should eat more.""   I am still confused.",False,False
