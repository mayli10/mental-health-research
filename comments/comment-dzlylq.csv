I can look in the mirror and kinda dissociate from it or be ‘proud’ cause it’s “a badge of honor” but really I just live in black skinny leg jeans and oversized sweaters with a tight camisole under so I’ve got some structure to stop me from feeling my body doing waves as I walk.   There’s really nothing more discouraging than the skin sometimes. Taking a picture with friends? Make sure your arm isn’t pressed against your side and watch for the waddle neck. Everything is wrinkly and puckered. If I could afford the surgery costs they would have to move my belly button up 4 inches at least.   Idk how my boyfriend bangs me.,False,False

There’s literally nothing I can do to hide spillage from my loose skin and the bra band. I wear a tight camisole everyday day and I try to keep it pulled higher so it’s less but then there’s just spillage over the cami. It’s not that it’s a poorly fitting bra, there’s just no volume under the skin and for whatever reason there’s still D cup tits that need support so this is just my life.",False,False
