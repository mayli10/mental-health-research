I feel like I’m gaining on 700cals a day. I’m at my GW and I have a “do not go lower than this point” number... but honestly I just dropped another 300cals from my daily budget. And I don’t know how I deviated so far from the plan to eat at maintenance when I’m at my GW to fuck it let’s drop her lower and see what happens. ,False,False

I relapsed hard a few months ago, finally got a thigh gap, and nothing. I'm still the same piece of shit I was before the thigh gap, if I gain and lose it I'll still be the same.

When you reach your goal weight you just want to be even smaller. When I realized I reached my first goal weight I immediately wanted to lose another 15 lbs. Instead I buckled down and focused really hard on reaching maintenance calories. There was no way I would allow myself to become even more sick than I already was when I could only assume that I would feel exactly the same when I reached my next goal.",False,False
