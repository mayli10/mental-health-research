I also refer to a day when i go over 1000 calories as a binge even tho it was not one. Dude its fine, you cant gain weight from one day, your body needs more time to turn the excess calories into fat. Also dont forget that one lbs of fat consists of 3500 calories. Therefore in order to gain one lbs you would have to eat your daily maintanance rate PLUS 3500 calories. Also water retention is a thing dude. So no worries",False,False

Your total for the day is 1200 which is still low. You might have some water weight if you low restricted a lot prior to this but that will go away quickly (so don't weigh yourself!). Don't stress about it, you're going to be okay ðŸ§¡",False,False
