In a weird way it is kind of a relief to hear I'm not the only one who had period issues because of anxiety. I am hoping it will work out for me as the last time I tried the pill was ten years ago as a teen, and maybe it would work better for me now.",False,False

I’m very lucky in that I didn’t get any side effects (apart from one but I don’t think it’d b helpful to mention it), and it’s perfectly safe to take nonstop. Anxiety fucked w my periods massively a few years ago and they were so painful I could barely walk wout crying but I’m so grateful for cerelle lol  Good luck sweets im rooting for u and ur bod",False,False

I am on the low end of normal weight and I have had three periods this month with only a few days off in between. My hormones are so messed up due to my anxiety I do not know what else to do. It is part of why I want to get underweight to avoid periods because they are so horrible.,False,False

Hating ur chest is a BIG ass mood. I’m 34G (UK) and am a size 10 everywhere else on my body so I look like SHIT and I’m sexualised everywhere in whatever clothes I wear. I want to wear babydoll dresses and not have my tits make me look like a cone  Also if your body reacts ok to hormonal bc I take the mini pill constantly and don’t have periods and it’s..... breathtaking,False,False
