My faves are the lime and black cherry. The orange was really tasty but i legit HATED the mango one. And i adore mango so that was disappointing. I tried the diet orange vanilla coke and it tasted like flavored medicine i dont think it translates to diet flavors. I know they came out with more a blueberry and a strawberry guava and u bet ur ass i cannot wait to get my grimy little paws on them.,False,False

I honestly can't tell much of a difference) and mango. I am obsessed with the orange vanilla coke zero. I'm one of the people who like the flavor of diet coke as opposed to that cola kind of flavor so I'm usually not wild about coke zero products at all but I really do love it. The guava strawberry was good? but probably not good enough for me to be interested in buying it again,False,False
