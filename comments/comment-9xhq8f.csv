And I don't even have the extra inch you do! I have literal, visible, and grabable fat at that weight but because the number sounds low to taller people they just don't get it.   There are totally people out there who find you hot though! Though you are completely right that it helps to love and find yourself attractive first.   Happy to talk with you through the bad feelings if you like :)",False,False
