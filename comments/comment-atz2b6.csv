I used to feel attractive at a healthy weight and did a bunch of nude modeling/menâ€™s magazine lingerie type work... now I look back at my old photos that I was once so incredibly proud of and Iâ€™m horrified at how huge I look (and also horrified that anyone can Google me and see my body like that). My BDD has gotten so bad that I havenâ€™t left my house THIS YEAR even though Iâ€™m almost at my LW. I donâ€™t know what I look like. Some mirrors make me look thin; others make me look wide. I donâ€™t trust other people to tell me the truth; I sure as fuck donâ€™t trust myself. Ugh.,False,False

(She once commented that shes in the 190s so that's how I know). Meanwhile I'm like girl please wear clothes that fit you as you are probably a 14.
