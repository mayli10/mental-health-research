I say this because Iâ€™m in the same place. I started a new job at the beginning of September and Iâ€™ve had to take all my skirts in twice, but I donâ€™t see a difference.   People tell me itâ€™s visually obvious and that yes, my coworkers probably have noticed. And I know that they way Iâ€™ve been restricting that there is no way I could have lost LESS than 2 lbs a week so I mathematically have lost at least 20 lbs and that itâ€™s probably closer to 25 or 30.   But.   I just DO NOT see a difference. I just DONâ€™T.   Fuck. This stuff sucks. From one crazy person down here with you, I can say that Iâ€™m so so sure this is evident to others and Iâ€™m so sorry you are hurting :( ðŸ’•",False,False
