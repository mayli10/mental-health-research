I feel like guys in my life are between 150-190lbs. They weigh so much more than me but they appear my size , just 2-4 inches taller. And they think every normal sized girl weighs 120 . It‚Äôs the number I always hear when they try to guess a girls weight. I feel like when A guy gains or loses 5-10 pounds you can‚Äôt see any difference. On a girl it can make a huge difference on some body types. I‚Äôve learned that weight doesn‚Äôt always line up with how a girl actually appears. I‚Äôm always meeting girls who weigh less than me but look bigger. To men, in their mind, if they weighed 120, they would look like a skeleton so that‚Äôs their idea of a really skinny weight. Girls think of 100 as really skinny , because I think it‚Äôs part of the culture we grew up in.",False,False

Nearly every guy at my work estimated me at my lowest as 120 and the way they said it is like it‚Äôs so small. But then nearly the same week my best friend (a girl) said I‚Äôm like 105. I swear, damn men and 120",False,False

That happened to a friend of mine who was also right on the border. Donating blood when you‚Äôre very light can be quite unpleasant and harmful. She just didn‚Äôt want you to get hurt.,False,False

Even though I‚Äôve had my ED for years and years and know that someone 5‚Äô tall weighing 100lbs is about the same as me being 130, they *sound* so much smaller than me that it must be true!  Also, unless they‚Äôre a career changer or PhD-level practitioners I wouldn‚Äôt expect most therapists to be too great with numbers.

My therapist commented on how skinny I was and asked me about my BMI, I said 16 and she was saying that I should gain weight blah blah.  Next time she asked me ""How much do you weigh again? 55 kilos?""  No, I'm 1.58m tall, that would be BMI 22. She was off by 15 kg and she was worried about me being underweight.
