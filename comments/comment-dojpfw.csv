Most people who restrict love to eat lots of volume to fill them up which makes total sense. I on the other hand get all my calories from string cheese and peanut butter. I hate feeling full, makes me feel like I‚Äôve binged (even if I know full well it was 45 cals of vegetables that filled me) and so triggers me to purge.",False,True
