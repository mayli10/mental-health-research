If I go to a thrift store 10 times (once a week) I might find something I want 3 of those times and something absolutely fantastic once. But I’m not bothered if I don’t find anything worth it. If that’s not your (sugar free) jam then I totally respect not wanting to spend time doing that! I also thrift in a nicer area so the chance of finding a gem is much higher.,False,False

I've heard about them, but I'm not sure if there are actually any which have worked out. Basically you post what you're getting rid of and give a description of the kind of stuff you're looking for.
