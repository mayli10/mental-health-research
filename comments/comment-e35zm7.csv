I felt that way a few years ago when I was at my highest weight and my sister kept getting thinner. I mean she was so thin people asked if she was okay all the time. They only asked me when I'd stop eating so much.    It seemed so easy for her as I struggled with binge eating my pain and loneliness. Now things have shifted as my sister never learned how to eat healthy and manage calories, and I had to learn those things through fighting with my weight. Now she looks to me for weight loss tips and all I tell her is to eat fruits and vegetables. I do not want her taking on my restrictive habits.   Weight loss is temporary. Most people do not maintain weight loss long-term. So their weight is likely to change a few months or years from now. It is hard to see a bunch of thinner people but in my mind I understand weight can change. It is not forever, and it helps me feel less overwhelmed with comparing myself to others. Sending good thoughts your way.",False,False
