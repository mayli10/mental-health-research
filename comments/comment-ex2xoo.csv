Usually itâ€™s a once in a while thing Iâ€™ll use if I feel my digestive tract is misbehaving. But like any laxative itâ€™s best to use in moderation even if itâ€™s gentler than some other things out there! Personally it is not addictive but I canâ€™t speak for everyone. Take care of yourself! :-)",False,False

They're stool softeners and not laxatives and therefore are safer to use when you have an ED.,False,False

Like the other user said, you can steep the tea for less time or maybe just have a couple sips. Once wonâ€™t get you dependent, but it might hurt, they just suck like that. Iâ€™d be careful of using it any more than that tho. Also I think Walmart &amp; Amazon both have PEG ðŸ’œ",False,False

Iâ€™m very scared of becoming dependent, I just need some sort of relief.  I will definitely look into that kind, hopefully they have it at the drugstore or Walmart. I have never heard of it I donâ€™t think... thank you for your help, I really appreciate it!",False,True

I guess I meant I didnâ€™t want to buy tablets, I suppose because drinking a cup of tea would be harder for me than just taking a tablet or two, if that makes sense. The fear of becoming addicted is a big one for me.   I may try it and do half the time. Iâ€™m very scared but at this point I just want some sort of relief. Thank you for your help!!",False,True

As you eat more, they will strengthen again!   I think the active laxative in that tea is senna, which is a stimulant laxative. Those trigger your digestive muscles to contract, so they canâ€™t get strong on their own, which is why itâ€™s so easy to become dependent. From personal experience, senna can be extremely painful.  I suggest PEG (polyethylene glycol 3350). Itâ€™s an osmotic laxative which works by retaining water. Itâ€™s what was given to everyone when I was in residential care. Itâ€™s just a powder that you mix with water &amp; has no taste, you can use it daily and not develop dependency. And itâ€™s not painful at all. Itâ€™s not as strong as senna but it does work &amp; is consistent.  I really hope something works for you!",False,False

Is it something you've been able to talk with your doctor about to get their recommendations? Just be aware that the 'laxative teas' basically are...laxatives? I mean, they usually contain senna which is a natural laxative. It irritates your colon, forcing the muscle to contract. So, it's something to be careful with as with any stimulant laxative (which it sounds like you are).  If you decide to try it, my suggestion would be to steep the tea for even less time than the box suggests, just to see how your body reacts. I tried a senna tea once when I was desperate and it caused a lot (a lot) ((a lot)) of pain for me, but I don't know how common a reaction that is. It was certainly effective in getting my colon unstopped! Best of luck as your body finds it's way back to equilibrium &lt;3",False,False
