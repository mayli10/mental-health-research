I mean, exercise can be great and all, but if you're spending hours in the gym and then taking selfies to show how perfectly curved your recovered body is, something is still off.

I wanted to show another side of it but my LW pictures triggered me into the grave especially compared to current pics so...that was a wash.  NED seems to be for people who say they're recovered but are still seen as goals by society. I know it's probably not all that but it's depressing. It's triggering.
