I had been on sleeping tablets in the past for very bad anxiety. 2 years at a very low dose that was monitored, all was fine and well and my doctor decided it would be best for me to stop using them completely out of the blue.   I was hesitant but agreed to try and eventually came off of them but still suffered from lack of sleep. Three years down the line a traumatic incident happened and I needed the medication because I was having flash backs at night causing horrific panic attacks and was given a very small supply and told to make them last. My doctors reasoning was that they can become addictive over time so it's better to avoid them completely. (Again, he had no problems for 2 years?)   I find this logic flawed especially in cases where the patient is very distressed and has been open about self medicating to relieve their symptoms. Some medications may/do have the potential to become addictive, sure. You know what has a serious chance of becoming an addiction? Alcohol and harder drugs.  Unfortunately in these cases the person is not in a healthy mind space and will do anything they can to self sooth. It would be much safer to have that person receive a monitored and controlled dose of a needed medication than to gain access to an unregulated substance and have control over their own dosages or frequency of use.   That's very sad to hear, I think we all have stories of someone turning to something much more dangerous in place of their medication. Sadly a lot of those people don't make it out the other side of their addiction. I think it's an issue that should be looked at broadly, it's not exactly a black and white topic but sadly some doctors do approach it as such.",False,False

Could be a painkiller, an anxiolytic, a sleeping pill, a mood stabilizer, whatever. But modern medicine says ‚Äújust handle your shit without it‚Äù which isn‚Äôt possible for many people so they turn to alcohol.
