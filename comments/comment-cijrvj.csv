You can also call CPS, because this would fall under the category of a child not getting medical treatment for a serious and life threatening illness. Calling the NEDA hotline may be helpful to help you explore other options.",False,False

Some people just don't fucking get it until it's either too late or nearly too late.,False,False

Also def agree on the medical neglect.   OP,  I am so sorry you went through this. your parent is extremely ignorant and it’s not your fault.",False,False

Take things one day at a time...might help to generally ignore her for a bit. At least, that’s what I did. Just checked out of home life and even though my parents still make shitty comments, it doesn’t hurt as much.",False,False

No one listens to someone vomiting and copies that.",False,False

At many states, you can check yourself in to a mental health facility at 15 or 16. For many others, if a doctor thinks you’re well aware enough to count as a “mature minor” you can make certain decision about your medical care. Can you get to a doctor and tell them? You can also reach out to child protective services (can be a mixed bag but can be helpful). I had cps involvement when I was a teen because someone else called when my mom refused to let me get psychiatric care. It was classified as neglect.   Stay strong!",False,False

Patents: you are responsible, just be normal. Us: ok thanks I am cured. -.-   People is so ignorant. And don't worry this is not ""am example"" that your sister will imitate.",False,False
