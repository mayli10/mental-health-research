People with OCD often feel that if they deviate from a ritual something bad will happen. I track, and measure, and plan on the premise that if I just do it “right” I will feel ok. I’ll feel calm. And when the bathroom scale has a mind of it’s own or when I find out my tracking was slightly off...there’s a sense of not-right-ness that causes disproportionate emotional distress.  Emotions often aren’t logical &lt;3 but they do generally resolve. A therapist at one (non ED) residential place told me “Let it come and go like ocean waves. Don’t hold it in, don’t push it away.”",False,False
