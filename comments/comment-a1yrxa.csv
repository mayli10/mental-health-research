I separate everything into small baggies so I know exactly how many calories are in it and it makes me think twice about grabbing more than one baggy when I eat. I do it with poptarts occasionally too, by separating it into one poptart per bag instead of of the two it automatically gives you. ",False,False

Seems like a good thing, no? Can you just leave it in the car and deal with it later when you are feeling less emotional... bring it to a food cupboard or put it out where others will eat it?",False,False

It happens to me all the time in a binge when I'm stuffed and feel like shit but haven't finished the box of whatever ðŸ˜’  Some things you could try i guess: 1. Portion/""meal plan"" the junk into 100cal portions or whatever is comfortable and safe for you, and keep it as a treat for another time. Our polar extreme tendency to mindlessly binge or hardcore restrict is so unhelpful. You could try taking this route - of course risk is that the temptation is there  2. Keep for a future sharing time. Take the food to a study group, invite someone over and crack it open, take it to a pot luck, iunno. Sharing with others gives you the chance to enjoy the food without binging. (Do anyone actually enjoy binging tho?)   3. Get your ass comfortable with throwing it out. Yeah it's a waste, yeah it cost money. BUT. excess calories that you don't need in your body? That's pretty wasteful too. And junk like pop tarts etc is especially wasteful because it does harm to your body. (please forgive me for sounding almost 2007 pro ana :( def not my intention)  ",False,False
