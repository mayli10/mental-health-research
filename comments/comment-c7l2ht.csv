My blood sugar seemed to dip too low and I'd end up binge eating. I'm.on more days/proteins/vegetables and I feel more stable,False,False

But I’m not a doctor so  ¯\_(ツ)_/¯,False,True

I’ve been wanting to mention this to my psychologist, but I’m nervous about what she’d think and say about it. Sometimes it’s so bad I start to get weak and tingly but I don’t know if it’s from anxiety, hunger, or both. One time I had a panic attack at the dentist. I think it’s because my stomach started to growl and I didn’t want the dentist to ask if I’m hungry. At first I thought it was just a random sucky panic attack. But deep down I think I knew it wasn’t caused by nothing.",False,False
