Like i was relatively skinny and it wasn't even that bad at the time. Him and his words are one if my biggest triggers ever.,False,False

He said I had ""child birthing hips"" and much more, when I wasn't even *that* overweight. Literally since the age of 12, when you get a bit pudgy because you're a preteen, I got shit. Hated it. Ignored it because I had the mentality ""If I'm already there, then fuck it what does it matter anymore"". Finally getting out of that now I'm (or at least wanting to be) the opposite. He's a fat drunk though, so fuck him.",False,False

Not sure if it's because he had less tact when making the comments or because he's a man, but damn did he crush me more than mom. I never thought he meant to be mean/rude,  but it always seemed hurtful to me.",False,False

We both were obese and he’s vegan now and walks like 7-10 miles a day. I’m just restricting and hoping for the best.   When I get to my LW before getting pregnant last year, it felt so good to get that validation. I feel like I need to get it again.   If I don’t go back down to the number I feel like I have failed. Not like he’s ever shamed me but I want to be at an ideal weight so he can be proud of me for once.",False,False
