For those who don't know, her body was used as THE body in kpop and Korea for years, they had paper figurines of her in every store, and she wasn't allowed to rest let alone be in control of her weight. Her co-member got 2 hours of sleep a week once and they starved and exhausted her down to fucking hell, legitimately fainting on stage, breaking down and being scolded for a bite of chicken. I don't think she looked too bad during AOA's Queendom performances but her company did a fucking number on her over the years. If she was suffering with an ED nowadays and was in denial about it, I could not blame her.",False,False

I’ve always had the mindset per say, but I never acted upon it until I started watching kpop mvs. I hate that most of them are the same height as me so it just furthers the mindset of “you could like this but you don’t you fat fuck”.

Wendy, for example, was way skinny when Red Flavor came out, but these past two comebacks she's been looking a lot... I don't know what word to use besides healthier, lol. Ditto Sunmi-- she debuted quite a while ago but she had trouble gaining weight until recently. Big big difference between her appearance during Heroine and her appearance more recently during Noir and Lalalay.   And going the other way, Jihyo was on the heavier side (FOR AN IDOL calm down) at debut and she *very* gradually lost weight and got fitter without getting too skinny.",False,False

Ive been watching Bon Voyage and the number of times BTS mention gaining weight because they're on vacation is ridiculous. They also seem to be hungry all the time.

I always compared myself to them because they’re all so underweight, and I used to use it to delegitimize my own problems. Like there was no way I could possibly be sick because I wasn’t even &lt;100lbs, which tends to be a completely acceptable (though quite thin) weight for Kpop idols. I recently started seeing a therapist and told her that I was frustrated because several of the artists who publicly talk about their ed’s reach well below that, and my therapist was appalled. She informed me I would probably die, and I should never try to be that small. In my head, that was a completely normal ed weight because that’s what I’d seen, and I didn’t realize how severe it is. It’s still hard for me knowing I’ll never be that weight, but it’s really not normal at all and I’m working hard to recognize that.",False,False
