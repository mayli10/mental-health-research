We tend to focus on the negatives that people aren’t even aware of.   Just like you feel she has a future, she knows you do, too.   It sounds like you two care and love each other very much. It will hurt her to know you’ve given up on yourself.   Good luck, though. I know how this situation feels. A rock and a hard place doesn’t even begin to cover it.",False,False

I understand that it *is* very hypocritical of me to ask her about it when I myself am disordered and not recovering. But she has her whole life ahead of her; she is very diligent, hardworking, has a strong group of friends, etc. etc. I have none of those things because I gave up a long time ago. I don't want her to go through what I've gone through/am going through, which is where she'll be heading if she is disordered and continues.  Basically I don't want her to suffer, I've just accepted my own.  Anyway I really appreciate the response. You seem very insightful and I'll think all of it over",False,True

As a general “rule”, I’d say confrontations about EDs are rarely a good idea. *especially* if someone doesn’t already know you, yourself are disordered. It could also be a *huge* turn off if you aren’t also either recovering or recovered. Then she’s have someone pointing fingers and being *incredibly* hypocritical. And at that age, if there’s anything that’s going to breed spiteful and vindictive behavior- it’s *hypocrites*.   That being said, if she really is showing pretty significant signs of an ED, talking to her as your sibling would honestly not be the worst way to do it. This is probably the only relationship type I’d ever say “sure, talk to them”. The problem lies with the above. Opening up to her and empathizing with her struggles is one thing- but know that if you are encouraging her to stop, she’s going to expect you to stop, too. You cannot have both your disorder and keep your sister away from hers if she does have an ED.   Remember that she does admire you. I have little doubt that she’s open up to you if you opened up to her. There’s just that catch.",False,False
