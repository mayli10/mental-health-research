I feel like it’ll bite me in the ass. Also I did this for yesterday’s weigh in by wearing heavy clothes and drinking a good amount of water and they said I still need to at least gain 10 :/ yuck ,False,True

I think I need to explain that 10 pounds is just not realistic at all and that if I do that with no exercise, they’ll just make me hate myself even more and I’ll end up losing the weight all over again...  Thank you ❤️❤️",False,True

I can gain ten pounds in the span of a week.  Here is my secret: heavy stuff in my pockets, drinking lots of water, binging beforehand, not using the bathroom, and being on my period... and voila, I hate myself slightly more.",False,False

What would you be comfortable with?  Are you willing to go maintenance at least? Can you be more of an ally with your therapist and come to some agreement about what would be more reasonable?  If you want to avoid involuntary hospitalization, you're probably going to have to stop restricting at least on the short term. As for your parents, I think it's stupid to take away an education because you aren't able to get control of a mental illness.  If it's possible to have a level headed conversation with them, try to negotiate with their expectations of ten pounds.  Again, try to be more of an ally than an enemy on this if possible.  Good luck. ",False,False

I’m pretty sure they’re all over reacting though,False,True
