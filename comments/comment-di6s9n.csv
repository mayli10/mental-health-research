That said tough love is the only way. Babying an ED is just giving that person permission to be unhealthy. I got the I will support you through whatever you need help with that's healthy but I will not do anything that supports your unhealthy behaviors. A lot of people hate that. Addicts get the same tough love hate it. But it's the only way. If you baby someone and say that's fine hunny you dont have to eat right now we will talk later here is your phone back if it's a kid. Or I know I said we wouldnt talk anymore if you decided to keep doing these maladaptive behaviors but its o.k. right now because your suicidal so instead of calling EMS for help I will talk you through it is a huge no. Call EMS take the phone away whatever it is. The consequences of choosing to not get better have to be solid and completely there. Rock bottom has to be hit.,False,False
