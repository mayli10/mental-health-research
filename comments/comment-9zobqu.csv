Always make sure it's at least 8-10 hours after you last ate. Once the bowel movements start it normally keeps me home no more than three hours. Also do not trust farts while doing this! ,False,False

Maybe my body is just weird about this stuff...enemas also don’t work for me which seems unusual. Miralax does though",False,False

A salt flush is more a diuretic than a laxative tbh. I did a flush like a week and a half ago but nothing happened. I spent the next few days water fasting and suddenly my body was like, ""ok, ...it's game time"" so that was unexpected. ",False,False

It works within a few hours and I basically pee out ma butt for the next 24hrs.,False,False
