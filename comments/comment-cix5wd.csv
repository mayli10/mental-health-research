I personally make it with a vanilla shake so it's a blank canvas for whatever syrup I want to add that day.,False,False

I have another favorite recipe to share with equally good macros. Add to a mug:  1 scoop quest protein powder (I was using chocolate because I had it on hand but Iâ€™ll probably use vanilla next time) 1 pack Starbucks via 1 tsp cocoa powder (quality here makes a huuuuge difference, I use valrhona) 1/2 tsp baking powder (doesnâ€™t have to be exact) Some water or milk of your choice (I like Fairlife fat free for the extra protein)  Just add enough liquid until the consistency is like peanut butter,   Then microwave this for 45 seconds, give it a stir, and maybe another 20. Just eyeball it. I like to leave the center a little liquify because then it tastes like molten lava cake.  Finally, top with a swirl of fat free whipped cream.  Chocolate espresso molten lava cake for only like 140 calories and 23g protein",False,False

Iâ€™m totally gonna try it ASAP.   Premier Protein drinks are just ridiculously good... Plus, theyâ€™re fortified with a shit ton of vitamins. AND theyâ€™re somehow fairly low in both fat in carbs, so theyâ€™re a gr8 source of protein if youâ€™re scared of either/both. ðŸ˜…  I think the Caramel one is my favorite personallyâ€”and itâ€™s also super good in iced coffee!!! Cookies n Cream as well. ðŸ‘ŒðŸ‘Œ",False,False
