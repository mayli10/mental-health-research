A real damn pain to be a rough those ppl. She eats maybe 2 meals a day and then just so little like 1 pretzel with nothing on top for dinner and i'm there, could eat 5 pretzels with nutella and still be hungry but no i take one single pretzel and constantly try to distract me while eating so i can eat as slow as she normally eats and brbrebqbenqn2nqnn2 that shit is painful urgh. Feel you, i'm sorry you have to go through that too",False,False
