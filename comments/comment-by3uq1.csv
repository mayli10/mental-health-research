I've pretty much just existed since then with no real real changes. You don't need a plan or a purpose above just being happy and surviving. When I used to think about finding my purpose it just made me depressed so I stopped and now I'm just a happy worker monkey, granted a happy monkey who's striving them selves but that's another thing.",False,False

Went to school for english because i was floundering around and had to pick something and I really enjoyed it. Zero intention to be a teacher and spoiler alert: am not teacher.   I went the path of do something that makes enough money to live and feel really good about what you do. Yeah I have a part time weekend job (divorce debt) but I still am passionate about my work. Didnt figure it out till about a year and a half ago and I have zero shame for not getting the ""right"" education, working a bunch of different jobs, and being older at an entry level position.  If fashion and business is your thinking GO FOR IT. If it changes in a couple years, a couple weeks, a couple days whatever who cares just keep exploring. If I asked my high school self would haybaybay be working where she does now, the answer would be no.",False,False

It seems to me having been around for nearly 40 years that the people with the most fulfilling careers are the ones that love what they do and pursuing their dream, not what they think society or other people think they should do.   I still don’t know what I want to be when I grow up! I’ve only recently narrowed it down to a science, I’m in first year undergrad and hoping to narrow down to something more precise as I go along. I could have probably studied law or something if I’d wanted to, I was a smart kid. But I wouldn’t have been happy, and I think being happy in what you do and enjoying it is a big factor in how well you will do anyway.  Do you have a careers advice service at your school/college?  Whatever you decide, good luck!",False,False

Fashion and business are fine career paths, as are every path. Even if others say it's a waste of your intelligence to pursue those careers, you are not obligated to do things just because you could. Besides, it would be even more a waste of your life if you weren't happy with whatever career you had.  For me I just picked one career path and I'm probably sticking with it unless I'm not able to. I was more into physics in high school so I just went with it /shrug/ Part of the reasons behind my more specific career goals have to do with my ED, actually. This is really embarrassing so I'm gonna put it in a spoiler.  &gt;!It's really easy for me to just think about food in the back of my head 24/7, even if I've never binged. What works for me is grazing on my safe meals while working so my work keeps me from eating too quickly, so I have food around me a lot to keep me from thinking about it. That's why I don't want to do anything experimental.!&lt;  To be honest I don't have as much ""passion"" for my specific field as others do, probably because of my ED. I guess my passion is staying sane with an ED. Lol.  Good luck. You're only in high school and a lot of people are in college and still don't know what to do. You have time to decide :)",False,False
