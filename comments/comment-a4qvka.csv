A lot of them also come out with stuff like”my sister developed an eating disorder because of YOU and now she’s in hospital!!!!!”   Like I get that she’s parading her illness around but I’m not sure she can be held fully responsible for that and trying to make her feel guilty about it isn’t helping anyone.

Like every one of the comments or videos made about her just totally miss the point. It's either people saying ""just block her so she gets no views, maybe she'll recover then."" or ""Eugenia you're disgusting and repulsive. You're not beautiful like this, did you know that? You look horrible."" It's like people want to punish her. It's really fucked up.   There's nothing that anyone can do, and I think that frustrates the people that are very easily convinced that youtubers are their friends, or that an emotional connection to a celebrity is a two-way street. People are like ""We can't just sit here and watch her die!"" but that's literally all you can do, is sit and watch. That's the whole point of youtube to begin with! Eugenia doesn't owe anyone shit, least of all an explanation for the way she is. People are watching her die and getting entertainment out of it (heck, I am too. My eating disorder is how I relate to her and it's fascinating to see parallels). She's already giving them front row seats to her demise, and people want to both gawk at her AND force her into recovery, and ya just can't have it both ways. You're showing her that her value lies in her illness, and then telling her to stop being ill.  Of course, I hope she does find a way to recover, and I especially hope she can deal with the emotions that come from the whole world gossiping about her impending death. I hope she figures out that even if her viewership drops if she recovers, it's not an indication of her worth, it's an indictment of internet culture. ",False,False

I understand that having an ED is hard and she may not want to recover (it's our choice whether we want to or not), but you should never encouraged others to develop an ED, which is what she's doing. She says that she isn't, but if you constantly parade around showing how emaciated you are to young impressionable people then they will try to copy. Everybody knows that.
