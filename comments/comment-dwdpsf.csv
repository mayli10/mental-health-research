If people are contributing dishes then you could bring something you feel comfortable with.   For weight loss comments I’m ok with acknowledging it and then moving the convo along. If they press then, “oh, yeah, I’d just rather not talk about it. Thanks for understanding.” (The “thanks for understanding” is key here...a little social hack. Or at least, it mostly works for me.) I mean, you’re absolutely not obligated to talk about any more than you’d be obligated to talk about depression, or a UTI, or eczema. People ask silly stuff and when they’re reminded it’s rude the good peeps move on.",False,False

I’m going on a thanksgiving cruise and I’m not sure on what to do. I am recovering from a purging disorder and calorie counting helps me from relapsing. But calorie counting is a no go because I typically cook all my own foods and weigh everything.   So what I’m thinking of doing is this, filling my plate with mostly veggies and high protein foods. I don’t drink so avoiding high calorie alcoholic drinks isn’t a problem for me. But maybe you can avoid “drinking you calories”’or anything that is high in calories. Likes sodas, got chocolate, eggnog, things like that. Or at the very least limiting them.   In terms of desserts, I will gage if eating sweets is the best idea for my sanity after I eat a full meal. I don’t think I’ll immediately go to the sweets first or that will cause me to binge then potentially purge.   Lastly, I’m trying to just relax and enjoy my cruise with my husband. I know this will be hard but I shouldn’t put my ED before my own happiness and fun. I’d say the same to you. At the end of the day you are there to be with loved ones. If at some point the thought of eating is becoming too much, take a step back and interact with your family or take a walk instead. Have some fun, then go back in and try to eat.   I wish you peace and luck! I hope you make some good memories this thanksgiving.",False,False
