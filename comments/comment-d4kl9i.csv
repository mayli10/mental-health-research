My aunt has said she wishes she had my discipline and will power and asks what I do. I'm just thinking noooo you don't. I make up some shit cause I can't tell her I only eat 800 calories a day and fast as much as I can.,False,False

It really doesn’t. My friends diet like that and get so discouraged when they can’t lose weight and I’m thinking.. crash diets exist for a reason. Lol but I can’t SAY that!,False,False

My mom and all of her sisters are overweight and trying to lose weight for a cruise we're all taking together and whenever they talk about how they're struggling it's really hard for me to remember not to give them advice. It's even worse when they ask me and I have to make some shit up on the spot because I genuinely have no experience with healthy weight loss,False,False
