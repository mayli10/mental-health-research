But thank you, you as well. I know how hard it is, but don't ever give up. Please, if you can, try to minimize the amount of fasting you do and do take electrolytes if you ever do so. Hang in there! You aren't alone &lt;3",False,False

I'm already seeing a therapist for non-ED things and she knows about my issues with food but they've been sort of placed aside for now. Guess it's time to bring them up again.,False,True

I don't know about recovery but I'm ruling out fasting for a while and being more honest with my therapist... it's hard wanting to get better,False,True

It’s also common that it will lower upon standing (hypostasis I think).  I have to drink a metric fuckton of water to compensate but it is possible. After working out, you sweat out your water, so your BP can go down. It’s extremely important to drink a lot during and after to compensate for that. Getting up very slowly and gradually helps as well if it’s low.",False,False

This is a really dramatic story but I do believe a lot of it was probably the weed. Use this as an opportunity for good and maybe start seeing a therapist or getting other help. Rome wasn't built in a day and you don't need to make all the changes at once, but it seems like your psyche was telling you 'it's time'. I believe in you and know your best life is just around the corner.   &amp;#x200B;  \#drunkGigi2now (sorry im drunk)",False,False

I had EXTREMELY low electrolytes (Sodium mostly) I mean 115 when 125 is deadly, and I was literally laying in my bed turning blue, my heart was stopping, everything. I prayed that if I survived that I would start loving myself and eating properly again. I went to the hospital, got an IV (minutes away from death), stopped purging for like a week and went back to my old habits. I hope you can continue on your road to recovery...you did nothing wrong, but I'm glad you're okay. Sorry my comment is all over the place lol",False,False
