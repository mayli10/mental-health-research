There are plenty of things I /could/ cut out too, but keep them in my diet just because it's nice to have foods you look forward to.  If you're looking to make your coffee lower in calories, you could use unsweetened almond milk (45 cals/360 ml), Nutpods original dairy-free creamer (10 cals/15 ml), and some stevia or another sweetener if needed.  Really though, try your best to be kind to yourself and your body - there's nothing wrong with your coffee the way it is ðŸ’•",False,False
