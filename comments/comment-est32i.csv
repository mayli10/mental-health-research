I really think that the way people stray from the fact that weight IS cico is genuinely a bad thing -both within ED communities and outside of it. So many people think that weight has little to do with calories, or it's genetic, or it's entirely hormonal or whatever. The biggest excuse I see is medication, but I can guarantee you that the medication doesn't cause weight gain; it causes an appetite increase and/or water retention.   Within ED communities, this can cause people to restrict EVEN MORE because they feel desperate. This causes health problems and just generally makes their lives more miserable. Outside ED communities, I've seen it a lot where overweight or obese people genuinely believe they cannot lose weight, which ALSO causes a lot of health problems and will make their lives more miserable - show me a morbidly obese person who's comfortable in their body and I'll show you a liar. And then there's the ""naturally skinny"" people who just reinforce the idea that it's genetic; you're not naturally skinny, you just eat less than you realise.
