Last time, I didn’t eat for a whole week. It wasn’t like “I’m going to fast for seven days, I’m so determined!” but more just like... I didn’t feel like eating anymore. I had no desire and I didn’t really feel hungry. I eventually started eating again (obviously) but I can’t remember what exactly it was that changed my behavior.   Remember to drink lots of water — Gatorade is better, if you can. Those tiny bits of calories and electrolytes are really important. Sending love &lt;3",False,False
