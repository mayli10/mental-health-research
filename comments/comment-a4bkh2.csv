Iâ€™m always really nervous about losing lean mass because I already donâ€™t have a lot. I had a body scan done a few months ago and my lean mass, it ainâ€™t great fam. I keep looking for confirmation bias that if I undereat my body will eat the fat stores first (which I do have! 38kg lean muscle but 27% body fat)....",False,True

Someone with a lower/normal body fat will not lose that much in 2 weeks, but someone morbidly obese will definitely lose a lot!   I agree with you, you can get sustained loss of body fat with fasting, also because fat is mainly composed of water as well. ",False,False

I've done periods of 2 weeks of very low restricting and maintained solid fat loss. Granted, on the scale I'll lose like 10lbs but fat loss that stays after I return back to eating normally is only ~5lbs or so. Progress photos look more dramatic too since you look leaner without the extra water. I do think you can maintain actual loss though, as long as you don't start to think ""I lost 10lbs, I can go eat more and not worry about it now"" ",False,False
