Something similar happened to me when I was having vestibular migraines. I felt like my hands werenâ€™t my own, it was terrifying.   This could be a migraine symptom, or, if you are on stimulants, it could be something like stimulant induced psychosis. But it could also be a lack of blood flow somewhere in your brain or something more serious.   Do you have a GP you trust? I would very very strongly recommend telling them your symptoms, they can get you an MRI to make sure thereâ€™s nothing structurally wrong with your brain. Then you can work together to see if this is something that needs to be addressed chemically or what.   Iâ€™m sure itâ€™s nothing like a brain tumor, but you really donâ€™t want to mess around with things like this (brain issues or mental health). Iâ€™m not a doctor, Iâ€™ve just had a ton of brain imaging in my life because of weird stuff like this.   If you want more info about the phenomenon youâ€™re experiencing in general, look into derealization, depersonalization, and (just for more context and as an extreme example), Cotardâ€™s Delusion.   Brains are crazy things and being a human is hard - take care of yourself! ðŸ’•",False,False

If this has never happened to you before and you don't know the cause, I would strongly urge you to consider speaking to a doctor or nurse about what you're experiencing. It may not be anything serious, but if it is, it's better to catch it early.",False,False
