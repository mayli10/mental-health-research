The process of recovery isn’t linear and includes relapses like this. Your ED is changing form because you’ve recovered from one facet of the ED but not another. This is totally normal! Getting into a more positive and productive headspace this time around means identifying new rules/voices/triggers and coping with **those** since your old ED has morphed into this form instead- even if your voices and responses are softer/changing. It’s part of the process, and you’ll make it through the relapse as long as you focus on working through it, not with it :)",False,False
