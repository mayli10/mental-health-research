Yes I totally understand, like it’s so hard to have self control when your brain is screaming “FOOD FOOD!!! Must eat yummy food” at you, but I just remind myself of how if I binge on it that day I’ll just feel super bad about myself the next day and it’ll ruin my whole day. And if I really want to it something special i can savor it the next day and I have something to look forward to!",False,False

I would suggest you prepare it however you want it (e.g. w or w/o butter, condiments...etc) and then take yourself away from the rest of the loaf. Go sit in another room, put on the TV/Netflix (but don't get too distracted from the act of eating because that can make you feel less satiated). Get so comfortable that you aren't going to want to move again (e.g. tucked up in bed/on the sofa). Then watch something engaging that you aren't going to want to pause halfway.  &amp;#x200B;  Wish you all the best, friend!",False,False
