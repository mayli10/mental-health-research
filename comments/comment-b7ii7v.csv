First time I did it, I lost over 10 pounds and people were obsessing over my weight loss and commenting on how thin Iâ€™ve gotten, telling me not to lose more weight, etc.  Then, the appetite suppressing effect wore off and I started binging again. Now Iâ€™m at a higher weight then before I started the stack and I keep trying to give myself 3 weeks of caffeine free so I can start and have the effects work again but every time I restart it, the suppressing effect wears off after about the 5th day and I start to binge again :( ",False,False
