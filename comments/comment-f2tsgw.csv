Thank you for the suggestion. And I can not drink it’s just were all partying at a hotel for two nights at least and it’s just going to be an awkward situation for me being sober. I don’t drink that often but I also wish I could just enjoy my time on the weekend instead of obsessive over the calories of alcohol. I just know it’s expected of me and I’m going to feel awkward. Also my BF is VERY hyper sensitive and if I do anything abnormal (for me) ever he freaks out and thinks something is wrong. So if I just chill and be sober he’ll think I’m a buzz kill on his birthday. And his friends already don’t love me so it’ll just be another thing for them to judge me on,False,True

Ive done it before. If they’re genuine friends, they won’t question it.",False,False
