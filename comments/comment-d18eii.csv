I'll log something as 16g but weigh out 15, jUsT iN cAsE  My most calorie-dense meal MUST be breakfast, otherwise I feel like those calories are wasted bc they're ""fueling"" me through less of the day.  I have very very specific designated meal times. I can let myself deviate if I'm really dying, but not usually.  Tons of fluids before and during meals. Just to make sure I don't accidentally react to the chronic emptiness in my stomach by eating too much :/  Certain micronutrients scare me but honestly it changes depending on the day. Maybe today I'm terrified of sugars, tomorrow it's sodium, then fats. The one constant safe thing is complex carbs like oatmeal/whole grains.",False,False
