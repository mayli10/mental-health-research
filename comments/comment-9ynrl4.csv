You do you.  It's hard to tell what your goals are but it also sounds like you've work hard to be the type of you you want to be, and that you work to improve harmful habits. Just keep doing that. I suggest trying to value your own health, but it's up to you what kind of values you want to have.   Try to limit exposure to people who talk in ways that bring you down and try to think in ways that lift you up. ",False,False

I've also gone up and down quite a bit, and every time I see friends or relatives and my weight changes I feel like shit when they say something. Regardless whether my weight went up or down. I just try to keep in mind that while for us, our weight is something we constantly think about, for them, they might just be making a casual remark, like they'd comment on a hairstyle or something. It doesn't really work for me haha, I still obsessively remember everything they say and feel awful, but it helps a bit. Best of luck&lt;3 &lt;3 _you got this_ ",False,False
