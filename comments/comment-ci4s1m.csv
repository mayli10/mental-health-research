Earlier on I wanted to eat a pizza, but I ended up calculating the weight of the pizza, working out the carbs so I could work out how much water I would retain due to ingesting carbs and then working out what i'd estimate the weight gain to be :o  I ended up just feeling horribly guilty for not eating, but a lot less guilty than if I had.  I knew if I ate the pizza, it would put my weight up for a few days, and i'd probably take a few bites, and force a purge afterwards. It took a few hours to stop thinking about it, sadly I didn't eat anything, because it isn't worth the guilt or the anguish.  I survive on hot tea with a few drops of skimmed milk, black coffee or peppermint tea at the moment.  I know you feel bad, but maybe those two slices of cheese are a little bit of progress in the right direction?  ***Maybe***  you can convince yourself to ~~enjoy~~ eat a bit of fruit / veg next ?",False,False

The only weight you will gain will be from the weight of the food. Your body needs something to burn while it pumps your blood and keeps you moving. I know this is hard and these are just words , but you are valid! /hugs/",False,False
