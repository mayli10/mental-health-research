I actually thought they were the same thing. the mindful eating subreddit seems pretty dead though... I think I'll just do some googling then. thank you!,False,True

Intuitive eating literally means eating by what your body feels. Mindful eating has been shown to help you lose weight + other benefits.,False,False

I watched a video once where the women said you can't do it straight from an eating disorder because that fucks with your hunger. You have to eat at maintenance for a long time before you can trust your body to eat without weight gain.,False,False
