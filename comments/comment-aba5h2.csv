Haven't managed to recover yet but I'm currently very underweight &amp; maintaining on what should be a calorie deficit. So I'm terrified that my metabolism is totally ruined and if I ever eat normally again I'll just become obese.,False,False

So do take everything with a grain of salt. The comment you replied to has been deleted so I don't know what it says, but remember every person is in control of their bodies and it can be possible for you to stay a healthy weight and have a healthy mind.  I wish you all the luck in the world, congrats on being in recovery!",False,False

Like, morbidly? I was slightly overweight (high end of healthy BMI) before the onset of my anorexia. And now I'm being weight restored and HELP  I wish I could provide more input for the actual question here, but the facility at which I'm being treated keeps patients completely in the dark regarding weight. I have no idea how much I weigh beyond what I was just before I entered treatment five months ago.",False,False

I know I'm young but due to trauma and like 5 years of therapy I emotionally feel more like I'm 28-30 so I feel I relate more to people in that age range here who's EDs have morphed a little. I've had remission for 4 years but recently relapsed. I'm no longer a low restrictor nor do I want to be underweight but I have a lot of issues with food control and body shape. I'm also mildly athletic but mostly for the mood benefits. It's weird to be on here and not have a desire to keep losing more weight it's more a desire to maintain my ""most tolerable weight"" and never get fat. I did experience mild heart damage and lots of other issues from my previous ED stint so I'm really trying to keep this relapse moderate to mild at best. And I'm terrified of ever reengaging in bulimic behaviors because MISERY.  But sometimes I feel SO FAKE being here because I'm not SUPER sick. And I really appreciate your response because it's so relatable. ",False,False

I think I went down to about 100 lbs, gained back to 110. When I relapsed at 17, I got down to 93 lbs. I'm 5'6"", so normal weight pre-ED. I gained to 115 lbs at age 18 which was the goal, settled around 120 in college. I've weighed 120-125 since then (I'm 31). I wouldn't call myself ""shredded"" but I have a lot of muscle - I do triathlons - so I look smaller than other people my weight and height because muscle's dense.   I take birth control; I assume I'd have natural periods without it as I don't under-eat and am at a healthy weight. So, the best anecdotal thing I can tell you is I gained to a normal weight and have stayed there. I'm very scared of doing damage to my skeleton; I was dx'ed with osteoporosis at 18, and this is a chief motivating factor for me in staying at a healthy weight. I struggle with occasional binges and the F-ING THOUGHTS but mostly I choose not to engage in symptoms. ",False,False
