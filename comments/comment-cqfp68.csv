I’ve seen people freaking out about this all over the internet today and I’m just like “where is all the outrage over obese kids being raised in downright abusive environments who aren’t responsible for their own nutrition and are being slowly suffocated by their own weight?” These kids are gonna die of heart disease by thirty. Weight Watchers isn’t for kids who are normal, it’s for kids who need to unlearn dangerous behaviours around food and learn EARLY how to have a HEALTHY relationship with the nutrition they put in their bodies.",False,False
