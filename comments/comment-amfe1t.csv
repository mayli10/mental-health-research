Remember to bring some snacks for after even if you don't end up using them. This is a short term thing and you're looking out for your health.   &amp;#x200B;  I hope this encouragement helps you keep your focus on making sure you don't pass out etc. I've had to give myself similar pep-talks.,False,False

Sure I have! Havenâ€™t passed out yet...,False,False

Ended up with eating heavy protein rich breakfast and something mildly sugary before I went in (long session) and being comfortable and not passing out was worth it. You donâ€™t have to eat a huge meal - just focus on your macros being okay and youâ€™ll be safe and sound. Best of luck with the tattoo!! ,False,False

I've been wanting a new one for ages now but I've been too lazy/guilty to go, I'm so glad you're getting a design you've wanted for a while now. Maybe eat small portions of many things you like? So it's mentally satisfying but you won't feel gross? ",False,False
