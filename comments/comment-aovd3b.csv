My teeth are shot. I have two missing, they cracked due to erosion and I was too scared to go to the dentist because I knew they’d know what was up, so I packed on temp fillings and carried on. A year later had to have both pulled as there wasn’t enough viable tooth left to do a proper repair. They literally crumbled. My front teeth are permenantly discoloured, and not healthy enough to use bleach on (idk if that would even work though, as the discolouration is lower layers of tooth showing through the top enamel, rather than staining), and I’ve had to have most of my teeth filled.   I’ve screwed my metabolism. I have to take thyroid pills every day for the rest of my life, otherwise all my functions stop functioning. Im cold and tired all the fucking time, and my hair falls out in handfuls. I get palpitations if I’m even a little dehydrated. I’ll probably never have a normal satisfying poop ever again.  Also stretch marks for dayyysss, and my lips are perma-chapped.       ",False,False

I can still improve the situation, but since I don’t eat dairy or fortified processed foods, my only real option is to try to supplement with huge doses of calcium and vitamin D. It’s really hard for me to consistently take all my required supplements, and since I’m almost 30 now my bone-building years are coming to an end.  I also have a chronic gastrointestinal disease.

Already my boobs are smaller compared to my current weight on the way up. I have permanent stretch marks on my boobs and belly that will still be there if I'm ever able to actually lose some more fucking weight.   Surprisingly I've only ever had 3 cavities and not since like 7 years ago. I'm a dental hygienist so I guess my hygiene and harm reduction with the bulimia has always been on point.   Theres a lot I dont know if I have something wrong w me or not. I havent been to the regular doctor in like a year. ,False,False
