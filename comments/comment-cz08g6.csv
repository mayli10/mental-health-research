Take gummy vitamins. Maybe replace one of your junk foods with a healthier option. Add some fresh berries to your halo top. Tell yourself you can eat those Cheetos once you eat a carrot or side salad. Have a smoothie 2-3x week. Junk food is made to be addicting. Every time you swap junk food out put $1 in a jar for a reward. At the end of the month you can treat yourself to new clothes or something you’ve been looking forward to.,False,False

Then I bought some food that doesn't expire quickly  like meal bars , frozen vegetables, and canned soup. every time I bought junk food I put that same amount into savings so it was like the price doubled.  Like if I bought a pack of ensure that costed 10 dollars I put 10 in savings. So I really spent 20.  Junk food didn't seem worth it after that.",False,False

I have a mini fridge in my room for all my water/energy drinks and I just keep prepackaged shit in there to eat if i feel like dying from fasting too much.  Plus I'm a good cook who makes tasty food. I am not counting all that olive oil and butter and etc that goes into a home cooked food. I feel so much safer knowing its all calculated for me in prepacked. Plus 2 I am not standing there in pain cooking just to stress about the calories and measuring.,False,False

Disordered eating is incredibly difficult to overcome no matter how much you want it. I know from experience that you definitely want it enough and I hope you will be able to be a little more gentle towards yourself because you really do deserve to feel good ♡",False,False

I started by switching out one meal a day to something healthier and slowly go from there. I noticed that my body felt a lot better when I ate healthier so that was a nice motivation. I definitely still have something ""unhealthy"" almost daily but it helps me stay on track with my healthy meals tbh.   I guess what I'm trying to say is to make small changes instead of completely overhauling the way you eat because it will only make you frustrated and go back to ""bad"" food. There's really nothing wrong with having tasty snacks!  Also having easy nutritional things to eat really make it easier :) like cottage cheese and almonds or a snack plate with veggies and hummus and some fruits!",False,False
