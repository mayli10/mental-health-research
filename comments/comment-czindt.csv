I'm taking Lamictal cause I'm bipolar, it's given me two seizures but shit it's the only thing that helps and I'm desperate for life to be easier Haha",False,True

Or ask about mood stabilizers (which is different from your typical SSRIs :P)  Don't stress about it! Just remember CICO.",False,False

You have to eat a caloric surplus to gain, it canâ€™t just come out of nowhere. Plus itâ€™s possible that you wonâ€™t even get that particular side effect.",False,False

The reason why itâ€™s written as a side effect is because some people might eat more when their mood is improving, participate in more social situations, etc.  I started on Lexapro 1.5 years ago, and I havenâ€™t gained any weight. Actually, in the beginning I was so terrified of gaining weight that I started heavily restricting. Ended up losing 10kgs within the first two months. Have gained some of it back, but itâ€™s NOT because of the antidepressants",False,False

CICO still applies, meds donâ€™t make your body defy physics!",False,False
