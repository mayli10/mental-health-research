I'm literally torn between feeling absolutely disgusted and ashamed that I completely forgot to take them to the laundry.  Oi, allow me to say that while this was a minor fuck-up, it in no way deserves the amount of shame/disgust you feel. Please go easy on yourself ðŸ’–   It's not like you did it on purpose. Suppose you had left a bloody pad/tampon in the bathroom and your dog chewed on that (as dogs are oft to do), would you be angry? Nah, you'd be like ""Damn, dogs will literally eat anything"".",False,False

They tend to stay on walls and ceilings because that's where the insect food is :)",False,True

Youâ€™re right, though, itâ€™s probably mosquitos eating me. In the morning when Iâ€™m feeling sturdier Iâ€™ll brave the google spider results..",False,False

And when I'm trying to find out the species of spider I've seen, I just Google spiders in my state and go from there. Or if you're not in the US, then you could try looking at your country's spiders. Props to you for taking it outside! I know having a spider close to your bed can feel like an invasion of privacy haha. Most likely it wasn't a spider biting you, they don't often bite people and if they do its not usually more than once as I jecting the venom does a big hit on their metabolism so they normally don't bite unless to eat prey, contrary to what society and the media lead us to believe. If you have multiple bites it's more likely mosquitoes, fleas, gnats, or some other insect, and of course it depends where you live. Those are the likeliest culprits that we have in Ohio.",False,True

Like that is the most disgusting part of your story imo. My dog would have done the same thing, probably, and I let her lick my face! Maybe I should stop that... Anyway, sorry for the whole chain of events, but thanks for posting, it helps to share the humor in these embarrassing situations. And high five on your sobriety!  Unrelated to your post but not your username: I just had a terrifying (to me) moment with a spider. Iâ€™m lying in the dark in my bed staring at my phone when out of the corner of my eye, illuminated by the glow of my screen, I see something small sort of scurry..! Bolt up, turn on the flashlight feature, cast around, where is that little fucker?! And I see him on my headboard: a pale milky guy, with a big ol round bulbous body (I donâ€™t know the proper terms for spider parts), maybe 1.5cm wide. Stared for a moment then I caught him/her and took it outside. Iâ€™m curious to know what kind of spider it was but too scared of the google image results to look into it myself. Do you know, lover of spiders? Me, I am not a lover of spiders, and it unsettles me to know if I hadnâ€™t been suffering from insomnia, if I had been peacefully asleep, heâ€™d have been walking all in my hair and everything. I know itâ€™s ridiculous but it feels like an invasion of privacy, a bug (excuse me, a spider) in my bed... is he the reason I have all these red bites on my legs? How many nights has he been visiting me?!",False,False
