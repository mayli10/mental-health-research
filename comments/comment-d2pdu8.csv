Like, I've struggled with ED for 10 years now, I think I know better than you what I'm talking about when it comes to losing weight.   It's cute that you think your new keto diet doesn't mean you have to count calories, that's why you're still 180 lbs.   Stop telling me the key is to cut carbs or just exercise more or try this new cleanse.   Carbs aren't the devil, you can't outrun your fork, and your ""cleanse"" drink is literally just adding more calories and sugar into your diet since you just added it on top of what you already eat.   /rant over  &amp;#x200B;  Totally empathize with you. It's very frustrating. i don't think I could date anyone who wasn't extremely understanding of my ED issues.",False,False
