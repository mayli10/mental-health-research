I bet you look great in those pictures and even if you don't remember what pictures are for! They're not meant to show to everyone how good you looked, they're meant to be a keepsake for a good memory. So you had a nice time and your pics are gonna reflect that. When you show them to people 30 years from now, all they're gonna say is ""wow remember when we used to dress like that? Remember how much fun we had? Remember when *that* was in?"" Enjoy it for what it is and don't be mean to yourself. If you want to change how you look, do, but only in kind ways. ",False,False

I get really overexcited sometimes and do things I wouldn't normally do and then look back like???? I bet you look great now! Honestly if I had no shame I'd post a prom pic here for you because honestly nothing could be as bad as it lmao.  I was not very confrontational and I had no bad blood with the girl personally but I won't lie she'd never shown much bitterness until that night I was like for reallll???? ",False,False

And I appreciate the kind words and encouragement but i'm pretty sure I will never be content with those pics or the overall experience,False,True

Lmao maybe I will also look hotter in 6 years. But, I just can't believe someone was so rude and miserable that they dropped everything just to copy your look. If someone would have did that to me, I would've shoved my plate in their face and managed to get it on their dress too. Sorry not sorryðŸ˜‚",False,True

I remember getting ready and looking in the mirror like nah I can't go but it was too late. I went for the prom experience and hated it the entire time and refuse to look back at any pictures. All my friends hung around with their other friend groups and I sat at a table looking frumpy and terrible, I feel like people purposely avoided me because of how bad I looked. I didn't eat the food I paid for because I felt so huge. This girl that didn't like me copied my look for the evening and looked truly incredible and oh my lord whenever I think about it I'm filled with regret and embarassment.   It's been like... 6 years now (wtf) and it still pains me but I look much hotter now so fuck it. ",False,False

Honestly stuff like prom is overrated, in a few years you'll look back and be like ""Yeah I went to my prom, it was ok."" And that's it. Few people have a teen movie prom experience, if you had any fun at all I'd call it a win. As far as the pictures... give it a little time. I find I'm soooo much more critical of myself the more recent pictures are taken. Taken 5 seconds ago? Disgusting, delete, I'm a monster. Taken 5 days ago? Eh not so bad after all. A little time will give you more objectivity. ",False,False
