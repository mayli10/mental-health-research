I vividly remember this one time I went into a single mens bathroom because I didn't want to wait and there was a line for the women's bathroom... so a dude walks in and in a panic I slam the door in his face with my foot while he was apologizing profusely.

I was living in a block of apartments at the time.  As I am just opening my front door to leave, I see my neighbour leaving his place too. He is very large. He is wearing an ‚ÄúI beat anorexia‚Äù shirt (back then this was a kinda common ‚Äújoke‚Äù for larger people to say).

Well, I wasn't actually eating. I was trying to eat. That was at my worst when I was eating less than 500 calories per day. I didn't take a single bite the whole time he was in the kitchen, but I did only have half a bagel, so it's possible he didn't notice I wasn't eating. He did eventually figure out something is wrong with me though. I would casually say things not realizing how alarming they must have been. He wasn't very nice about it when he figured it out though. He treated me like I was an idiot for not wanting to eat.",False,False
