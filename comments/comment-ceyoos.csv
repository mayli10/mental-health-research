Like I was diagnosed with an ED when I was 16 (almost 27 now...damn I feel old) and I‚Äôm not always engaging in behaviors like I was 10 years ago but I go back to restricting and disordered eating when I‚Äôm triggered by something or going though stress as a way to cope. I don‚Äôt think it has to be an all or nothing situation.,False,False

Your hell brain chose your ED as it‚Äôs way to distract yourself from uncomfortable feelings and situations. No one who has a drug problem says ‚Äúam I really addicted or is this a coping mechanism??‚Äù It‚Äôs because it‚Äôs both at the same time.,False,False

I have periods where I eat almost completely normally, then something happens and I go back to the disordered eating because it somehow makes me less stressed about anything else. Don't be too harsh on yourself &lt;3",False,False
