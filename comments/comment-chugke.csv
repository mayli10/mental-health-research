I know personally that panic attacks can be frightening. It can make me angry with myself for succumbing to them and their silly worries. As i have aged and become more confident in the few core things that i have grown to value and be proud about me, i can put perspective onto some worries and find that panic attacks are less debilitating. I can get up and leave the room, or calm myself at a traffic light, and see the fear settle some what.   Finding the time to do what's important can mean doing it alone. Sometimes those that are close to us don't always see things the way we ourselves see them. I value those friends or family that give the space and support to be you and deal with it, and won't judge you by your nervous actions.   If you want to accomplish faster shopping them perhaps try a routine list of items that doesn't really change.  I can zoom through a reduced list of essentials in under an hour.  The flipside is i have to go out of my way to do unusual items, then find myself procrastinating and avoiding those unknowns.    Best wishes to you both.",False,False

I have to block out an entire morning or afternoon to go grocery shopping because it takes me forever.  And I need to listen to a podcast while I do it because Grocery Store Noises^tm stress me out.,False,False
