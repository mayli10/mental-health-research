I really appreciate how they’re handling her binge eating this season.,False,False

The first season was very relatable, plus I love the over-the-top campy satire they’ve got going on. But a lot of people on the internet were offended by it, I’m guessing because they don’t understand it was satire (although tbf that fat suit was pretty bad lol.) The scene with her and the cake in S1 was like a punch to the gut. So good.",False,False

This show is pretty ridiculous but a lot of it is so relatable. The scenes where patty just goes to get one bite of food and then ends up binging is just so relatable it hurts to watch. That little anxious walk around the kitchen where you’re not trying to binge but your mind is telling you to just do it is so real.,False,False
