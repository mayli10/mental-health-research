I don’t mean to be dramatic, but if I hadn’t had treatment forced on me as a teenager my life would have been cut short. Not a long life, and certainly not one I cared about preserving anyway.   I don’t feel privileged. I’m not grateful. I’m gonna judge myself anyway. ",False,False

As someone else mentioned, I don't think this is something to be grateful for, either. Compulsive overeating and binge eating can be explained via similar logic in that it makes evolutionary sense, but that doesn't necessarily make it healthy. Natural? Sure. But natural does not necessitate goodness.",False,False

It's got something to do with decreased insulin or something. They're actually studying that right now as pretty much the fountain of youth.
