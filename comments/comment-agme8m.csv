The ones that taste just as good as the Monster Zero are just as expensive, if not more :/ I order Bang off Amazon, but I can’t find it cheaper anywhere else! Bang helps em power through workouts AND my mornings. They’ve helped me with 6/7 hr drives and migraines too. :) it’s a lot more balanced approach to energy than most stereotypical energy drinks!

I don’t find the brand matters much, I’m more concerned that the flavour is good and that it’s zero calorie. ",False,False

I love it but you need to start off slow. Every brand is different from the next and they might hit you differently. ie- you can have half a scoop of one brand and be just as wired as if you took a heaping scoop of another. When i am allowing myself more calories i take more than if im fasting. If you take too much on an empty stomach prepare to throw up or have a massive stomach ache. That being said i still love the stuff. I would say pre workout if better for energy that energy drinks or 5 hrs! But because they are meant for workouts so they are also thermogenic, you may sweat even if you are laying on the couch. Also lots of them have niacin, it will make you itchy and flushed so drink lost of water with it and that usually gets rid of the effects. ",False,False
