I suffer from very dry skin as well so I: -cleanse with acure cleansing stick -exfoliate/tone with son and park beauty water or glossier skin perfector -moisturize with blue tansy oil   And nothing more ,False,False

One thing thatâ€™s somewhat helpful is gelatin facials.  I just mix some powdered gelatin and hot water to dissolve, brush it onto my skin and let it dry, then rinse it off with lukewarm water.  It smooths out and fills in the driest or cracked parts, and is soothing on raw skin.",False,False
