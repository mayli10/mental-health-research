When I binge I get my binge food and take it directly to my room as discretely as possible. My roommates probably wonder if I ever really eat because my food just sits there untouched.,False,False

I would clean tables at lunch for which the lunch lady would give me one of those individual portion boxes of cereal. I would literally organize and keep them in a drawer. I wouldn‚Äôt eat them though. I‚Äôm on the restricting end of things, never binged. I just liked feeling prepared and knowing that I had food.",False,False

In my room, in secret spots of the pantry and fridge, even in my fucking school locker and backpack. I think a lot of it came from my obsession with food and a need to have it around me to feel safe. It‚Äôs a pretty common behavior in people with eating disorders!",False,False

I hoard a bunch of safe foods - even ones that I don't really like.  And the amount of money I spend on dumb protein bars is ridiculous. When I binge, I do inevitably just go to the store and buy shitty junk food. But the idea of not having enough safe food at home in case I ""need"" something while I'm restricting freaks me out.",False,False

I shamefully avoid being in charge of that so he brings home what's on the list, and there's usually some junk thrown in. I push it all to the back of the pantry and with each grocery haul it keeps piling up. There's eventually a day where I make it all dissappear twice. I don't collect it on purpose, I really just want us both to forget about it and have it not exist, but I do know what's going to happen and can't stop it once it it's set it motion. I even get excited sometimes.",False,False

In my wardrobe I keep my binge/things I'll never eat/treats for when I hit my ""gw"" foods, in my fridge I keep my restrict foods and goddamnit I get so angry when people touch them.
