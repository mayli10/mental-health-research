I suggest adding a protein shake, itâ€™s good for you, adds ~200 extra cal depending on the brand, and there are lots of varieties and itâ€™s easy to drink and then try to put it off your mind. I had to do that today lol. Best of luck &amp; hope you feel a bit better :) brain fog sucks lol",False,False

You are still a teenager, and honestly would still probably lose if you bumped that up to 1800-2000 because you are still growing (which requires a lot of energy!), even if you don't get taller your skeleton and brain and other organs stilll require more energy than a full grown adult. You may also be tired, your hormone production could be changing, you could need electrolytes, you could be stressed... ect. Try drinking some powerade zero and make sure you get plenty of rest! If you need to up calories a bit more that is totally ok to, just do what you are comfortable with.",False,False
