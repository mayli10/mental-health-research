Then when it comes down to it, you can straight up ask her ‚Äúwhat have I done to you to make you act this way?‚Äù .... and she will literally have no answer.  2. Be passive aggressive back (yes this will be the most fun and enjoyable-but won‚Äôt really solve anything) . Whenever she makes a remark you can hit her with, ‚Äú hey do you know what projection is?‚Äù-‚Äúgood luck raising your daughter with that attitude.‚Äù - or if you want to be really rude ‚Äúwow.. you‚Äôre the perfect example of why abortion should always be legal.‚Äù (I have experience in acting like a massive cunt.)   3.
