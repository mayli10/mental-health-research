And just because you’re not “as bad” as you used to be, doesn’t mean you’re not struggling and don’t have a right to feel bad.   Just think of the progress you made in recovery. Let’s say you took ten steps forward. Now this relapse maybe set you back 3-5 steps. You’re still ahead of where you started. And you don’t have to wait until you’re back at square one to help yourself. You can pick yourself up right now  and keep moving forward and it will be way easier than it was at square one because you have tools and coping strategies that you didn’t have before. And you know they work, because if they didn’t, you wouldn’t have gotten to square 10. You’re going to be okay and you can keep recovering. And in a while when life flings more shit at you, you’ll relapse again, and then you’ll get better again when you catch yourself. It’ll happen in a cycle until you have learned enough about yourself to react differently in times of duress. This takes practice and lots of hard work! Don’t be discouraged if you’re having trouble coping right now. You’ll be okay. I promise you no one ever realized they had a problem with something and just decided “I’m going to get better” and then they never had a problem with that issue again. You’re not a hypocrite for encouraging recovery in others and struggling with it yourself. Now that you’ve seen for yourself how it’s not a one shot deal, you can make people feel less alone if they come to you and say “I was getting better but it’s bad again and I’m afraid.” You can tell them that everyone goes through them, you too, and you can share how you helped yourself get on the right path again.",False,False
