I've done as long as 21 before. Reasons not to do it:  1. After about three days you have to be really careful about maintaining your electrolytes, which is can be tricky and/or expensive to do  2. If you don't, and sometimes even if you do, it sucks. You'll have the worst insomnia of your life, and then be literally unable to move your legs even to kick the covers off in the morning. You'll be achey and sore and cold and irritable and your heart rate will be fucked up. You might even pass out.   3. Even if you do everything right, it takes your body time to get used to doing extended fasts, and your first several will suck infinitely no matter what, and you'll be too tired to exercise (if you regularly do) or even maintain some semblance of activity.  4. You will gain everything back the seocnd you refeed. Not literally, of course. But you'll suddenly. Have food weight in you again, and your body will have a lot of glycogen stores to refill, and you'll probably be at least a little dehydrated, and so the first time you eat the food weight + water weight will mask all the progress you made and make it feel like a waste. And while some of it will come back off, you will never be able to fast down to a weight and then maintain it without gaining back. You will always gain weight back after an extended fast, because of the food weight and glycogen stores. If you really go ham refeeding, you could even end up not net losing anything.  5. It's easy to go ham refeeding, but also can be dangerous. Depending on how small you were when you started the fast and how long the fast lasts, with real extended fasts you have to worry about refeeding. If you fast too long and then break your fast by just eating even a normal meal, you could literally die  6. It sucks so fucking bad the first few times and it takes so much planning and effort to ever make it not suck and you don't even really lose that much weight",False,False

You have to face the cold, hard truth that it's not working.  If you want to do something similar to this kind of fasting, I'm gonna suggest eating a tiny bit of the same thing every day just to feel like you ate something? Lol. I'm planning on doing ""fake fasting"" by eating 14-28 almonds (100-200kcal) every day and that's it. Because I can't function if I actually didn't eat... it's less about the physical aspect and more mental right? By eating \~something\~ it's like a checklist, 'I ate today'!",False,False
