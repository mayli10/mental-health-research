I’m sorry you’re going through this. It reeeeeally sucks. I know we’re not supposed to offer “tips” and you didn’t ask for any lol. I’m on my way to the supermarket to buy cake. Several slices of cake. So what could I possibly offer lol. Like you just said , I just want eat more. I know why. It gives me a sense of autonomy. It’s the one thing that I can do start to finish without having to consider another living soul. People say folks with ed’s are self absorbed. I beg to differ. We spend every waking moment worrying about pleasing this person, not upsetting that person, meeting the expectations of these people, showing up and doing what we’re told for those people. We get tired of being puppets and we express that through our bodies. Not EVERYBODY. Everyone’s ED is different. Not making any sweeping generalizations. So yeah, a binge can feel like the ultimate “Fuck you.” This is MY time. No one comes in. No one decides. It’s MY choice. MY food. Not speaking for you. Just I dunno, speaking for me and trying to relate?...So yeah, what you’re going through is hard. It’s difficult. It’s painful. And I wish you weren’t going through it. But eventually it DOES stop. I know because I’ve been there. I thought I would die hunched over a toilet years ago. But somehow it stopped. Granted, I’ve now started back up again, but I know it can’t go on forever.  It won’t! You got this. 💜",False,False
