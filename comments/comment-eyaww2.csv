The brand also has 0 cal sweetener in a LOT of different flavours, my fave rn is raspberry and they have both fruit and dessert flavours (ofc there's lots of these brands with all sorts of crazy flavours that should work well depending on what u like), it helps to give it some variety so you don't get bored. Personally I find casein/casein blend protein powder fills me up well and really help with cravings - I have a HUGE sweet tooth so it's super helpful lol. Especially if you can get stuff like birthday cake or cinnamon roll etc etc sweetener/flavouring!  Casein however can be hard on some people's digestion (in which case whey is usually better). Whey is the most common and cheapest form so it's a good place to start, it also comes in LOADS of flavours. Most protein powder tends to be abt the same calories/100g so when you choose I would look at protein % and any extra ingredients like vitamins/minerals also per 100g. Most sites will have nutrition listed per serving or scoop which is usually chosen totally randomly, one powder is a 25g serving and another is 45g while a third is 60g?? I make my shakes with low fat milk for the extra protein but other than calorie count and taste preference it doesn't make much of a difference. Some shakes will taste ok even with water if you don't mind it tasting, well, watery. It might be nice with half milk/whatever you use and half crushed ice in the summer but it's too cold for me to try rn lol  Anyway I typed wayy too much here I hope at least some of it is helpful!!",False,False

They definitely keep me satiated but at the same time I feel like I’m fasting because I’m not chewing/swallowing. I’m hoping this is just something my mind needs to get used to.   For recommendations, I’m vegan so I’ve been using primarily orgain and Vega. I like orgain a lot better for taste and calories bc I didn’t realize Vega uses cane sugar until I bought 2 tubs. Sometimes I mix in a tsp of green powder or golden milk powder for more flavor bc I use 20 oz of water for all my protein shakes even though they recommend 8. If you’re looking to mix yours with milk, I highly recommend unsweetened flax milk. It’s 25 cal per cup like cashew milk but it’s way creamier, richer, and tastes better.",False,False
