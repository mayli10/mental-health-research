And it fluctuates throughout the day and it’s so frustrating too. One minute I feel good the other I hate myself. I don’t know what I look like whatsoever and it scares me,False,False

I can look at myself and think ""I'm not really fat,  I look pretty nice"" and then 10 minutes later think the complete opposite. And I remember when I was at my lowest weight I really thought I was chubby and hated all pictures of myself and now when I look at the same photos I'm like... I was really skinny??",False,False

I can be really happy and semi confident one moment because in a mirror glance I saw something kinda decent .. then I’ll look in a reflection or something an hour later and see something gross and then I’m all panicky and grumpy. People around me half the time are probably like wtf  .....,False,False

When I look in the mirror I often see myself how I was ~35ish lbs ago, and wonder why I don’t look any different. And sometimes I feel completely dissociated from my body— idk, it’s trippy. But then I’ll see a photo taken of me, and I realize I look malnourished, gaunt and gross in a totally different way— and it’s like no matter what I can’t win. I feel so confused, I don’t know what to believe... and I have come to despise both mirrors and cameras. :(",False,False

I know I'm not as fat as I ""see"" myself in my head, if that makes sense. I can see I'm fat, but not THAT fat in the mirror. But I ""feel"" that fat on me even though I don't see it.  One of the ladies I saw in a video looks EXACTLY like how my mind ""sees"" my body. Like an exact representation (well, except white). It was kind of jarring.",False,False

It's not even my stomach, which would at least make sense. It's my face and arms and fucking everything else. I stg I look at least fifteen pounds skinnier after blegh-ing a binge than before.
