I know how distressed you're feeling right now, and I'm just so sorry. The most frustrating part is that I can't give specific advice, bc I still don't understand why this sometimes happens to me, or how/why it has stopped.   But if I were you, I might start trying to keep detailed records of maybe a. how long this has been going on, b. how many calories you're taking in every day, and c. how much your weight is declining. Make a deal with yourself that if you pass a pre-chosen threshold of duration or BMI, that you'll seek medical care. Because this situation does have the potential (as you know) to become really dangerous. If you're having palpitations, that's already not great, and you might want to track symptoms like that, too, to see if they're getting worse from day to day.  Much love to you &lt;3",False,False

I have been there, and it's truly hell on earth. Like sure, it's terrible when you're fighting the desire to eat/snack all the time, and you might even think, ""I wish I didn't care about food at all,"" but when you're actually there? Fuck. You start to feel like a tenuous survival rope is fraying. Your failsafe of ""food being appealing/tempting"" is no longer there to compel you to eat. Instead, mere survival is a chore. Which is terrifying.  Also, the whole world just sort of stops making sense. Why do people gather for meals, and why am I expected to join them? What the hell am I supposed to ""treat"" myself with when something good happens, now that I simply don't care about food? It's so alienating.    However, this feeling has always stopped after about two weeks. (Why did it stop, or start for that matter? Fuck if I know.) One time, it lasted three weeks, and I would've had to seek medical help if it hadn't stopped. Like, toward the end of that period I was fantasizing about IV drips/tube feeding, simply bc I couldn't make myself care enough to eat, but I also didn't want to die.
