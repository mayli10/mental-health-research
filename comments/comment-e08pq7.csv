(That being said it takes me like over an hour to prep one pack and it's exhausting and I don't really eat it anymore cause of that)   I basically combine every method I've seen to make them palatable and it kinda works! I rinse them for a long time while water boils, boil for 3 minutes, strain, dry with towel til BONE dry, fry until they are squeaky (and not just a little creaky, like a pan full of tortured mice squeaky). They get pretty soft and start sticking a lot. Then add my flavoring sauce (sometimes stirfry sauce, chicken salt and water, pbFIT and water, some pesto, Sriracha...) and cook them in that until they really soak it up, THEN throw it into the pan with the veggies I'm planning on having with it so all the flavors meld.   By that time they are both super soft AND I'm so fucking over it I just wanna eat them already!.. (I'm dying inside)",False,False
