However I found it very unnatural to have to down a bunch of salt water multiple times a day  to combat the side effects.. also at one point my disordered thoughts came back and I stopped. Also losing when not counting calories is still something and I was more toned during the time. But also I used to be vegetarian for 2 years and it played a role too..not to mention it‚Äôs more expensive in general. I think people should just try different things and decide for themselves, it‚Äôs cool that your parents are trying to be healthier but there is never one diet fits all so yeah.   So..

The high fat and protein keeps you satisfied longer than carbs which cause insulin changes. Also not being to eat as much processed food helped. People with addictions to carbs/sugar, obesity, or diabetes are great candidates for keto but it‚Äôs not a magic cure all.

Now, I ate a ketogenic diet short term and derived some benefits from it, but it‚Äôs not the One True Way (unless someone is dealing with severe epilepsy and their doctor has prescribed it). Unfortunately, the dogmatic folks (on any diet not just keto) tend not to respond well to the socratic method. It‚Äôs even harder when it‚Äôs at home and coming from authority figures. I‚Äôm really sorry you‚Äôre dealing with that.   I think keto offers some interesting ideas, especially for people who might otherwise tend to eat low-nutritive-value carb-heavy foods. It can even motivate people to learn more about nutrition and their bodies (though it doesn‚Äôt quite sound like that‚Äôs the case for your parents). **But as someone with a history of restrictive and disordered eating, there are aspects to keto that are actually dangerous for me.** Targeting a moderate amount of good-quality carbs seems best for where I‚Äôm at. Do what‚Äôs best for where you‚Äôre at!   *As for your questions, this is where I‚Äôm at based on what I lived and what I read:*  - overeating is possible on any diet, including keto. Put another way, one can lose, maintain, or gain weight while eating keto by adjusting macros to fit one‚Äôs goals  - what your parents may be referring to with ‚Äúcan‚Äôt overeat‚Äù is that for some people who previously ate a high carb diet, eating low-carb-high-fat seems to tweak hunger cues back into alignment with their body‚Äôs actual needs. Partly because fat is good for satiety. Partly (possibly) because they were eating crappy carbs before.  - which brings us to...not all carbs are created equal. This is partly my opinion but I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs crazy to say that X grams of carbs from Oreos is not the same to my body as X grams of carbs from lentils. To vilify all carbs when many carbs offer great nutrition and good energy to my body just doesn‚Äôt make sense to me.

Especially for stable cognitive functioning.   Why are carbohydrates themselves important molecularly, in the body? They do keep you more immediately energized and they have structural and regulatory importances. Sure your body can run on fat but you are going to be less efficient and eventually it will catch up with you and you will probably be more fatigued and possibly use less energy overall and be lacking in the efficiency of certain metabolic processes.   Also, multivitamins are no perfect substitute for eating nutritiously. One problem with multivitamins is that some of the vitamins included in them can degrade with time (basically expire), for example this is a big problem with Vitamin C. If someone completely avoids carbs they are missing out in key vitamins from vegetables and fruit, whole grains, etc. Carbs are important sources of fiber too.   It is not healthy to eat fat in excess even if you burn more calories than you eat or think your body is running on fat. A lot of people probably over consume saturated fat on carbohydrates and that has an array of health risks that could develop in time. I think keto has a good reputation because people like that you can diet while eating literally the tastiest things (bacon! Cheese!) but you still are avoiding certain food enough to where you probably ate in deficit and that‚Äôs why they still lose.   Also the funny thing is all that excess protein and fat, if you‚Äôre not in a deficit would still turn into fat like how carbs. can. The good thing with carbs is if you eat them they are quickly digested and you can quickly burn them. Carbohydrates are not at all  bad for you, they are essential. We are a species with a lineage that extends back millions of years to frugivores. We are at our base insectivores and then frugivores and then omnivores. We have no recent (within 100 million years) common ancestor who was ever a pure carnivore like how big cats and canines are specialized to eat tons of protein and fat.   The ancestors to our species have consumed carbohydrates as the primary part of their diet for a very long time, and when we evolved into humans we still paid a lot of attention to collecting carbohydrates even when we started to eat meat.   Sorry this is so long but people hyping keto like it‚Äôs really healthy is just a huge trigger for me. It‚Äôs okay if people want to do it but it‚Äôs not scientifically validated that it‚Äôs significantly better for you and I do think it‚Äôs just a type of either strict without feeling strict diet or disordered eating. Whatever you want to call it.   If it was so magical though I‚Äôm sure people would have figured it out hundreds of years ago. We aren‚Äôt the only culture and time who values skinny.",False,False
