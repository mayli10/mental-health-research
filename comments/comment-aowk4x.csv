Summer 2017 I was purging 2x daily, the worst I've ever been (debatable). I took shrooms for the first time and during the come up I felt like I was headed towards a bad trip and I felt sooooo sick. I knew that was pretty common with shrooms and most people feel a lot better after throwing up (not on purpose, just cos shrooms are fucking nasty). So I was like yolo lemme speed up the process and just purge. I started tripping as my whole ass hand was in my mouth and I realized... I enjoy this?  I like how purging makes me feel empty and clean. I enjoy the ritual drinking 40 oz of water per tiny meal, knowing I'm going to purge, cleaning the bathroom after, all that jazz. Realized it's really fucking fucked to enjoy throwing up. But had a great trip after that lmao. Wish I could say that made me want to stop or recover but it was at least enlightening.

I’m 148 now with the goal being 120 which is almost UW for my height. I started with intermittent fasting, I’d eat every other day. Then it evolved into fasting, as long as 3 days straight and break my fast with a tiny meal. But then I started to try to eat again, 1200 a day. I started throwing up every single meal for 4 months straight. I then started to b/p. A DIET made me spiral into this hell. I’m currently attempting to recover but I know the closer I get to the summer the more I’m going to restrict and over exercise especially with my job being in the restaurant industry I’m doing at least 20K steps 5 times a week. I thought when I would reach this weight I would be so happy and confident. I fit into all my old clothes now, I should be happy right? No. I still feel like a gigantic fat ass. I think it’s because my expeditions are unrealistic. I was to be short and tiny, but I have a super curvy body, my hips as my doctors would call them are “birthing hips”. No matter how skinny I’ve ever gotten, I still have bigger thighs and a big butt which to now considered attractive I guess but it’s not what I want to look like. I want to be slim and small. But it’s literally unattainable for me. It doesn’t help that I think I’m ugly as hell too and I’m obsessed with the concept that once I’m 120 I’ll be pretty.
