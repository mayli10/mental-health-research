I check calorie info in the USDA database, and so I can be pretty sure of the exact calories I'm eating. Packaged food isn't really safer. For one, the items may weigh more or less than the package states. Also, for items that are a mix of ingredients, the calories would vary depending on how much you are getting in your particular serving. Like if you were eating a trail mix made of peanuts and raisins, but the cup you poured has way more peanuts than usual, then that is more calories than a raisin-heavy cup.   You don't need calorie content in the recipe. You just need a food scale and measuring cups or spoons to weigh each component of the recipe.   I sincerely hope I am not freaking you out about packaged foods. I'm just trying to help you relax about non-packaged, because it is generally better for you and more filling.",False,False

Now all of the foods I usually cook are already saved in my recipes so I’ll just edit the amount of vegetables as I cook or if I buy a different brand of something (like a can of black beans for example) that has a different calorie count",False,False
