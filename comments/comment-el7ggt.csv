And I was raised vegetarian. It’s gotta be so much harder to go vegan when you grew up eating meat.   And I screw up all the time too don’t worry. I’ve been vegan for 6 years and I still mess up. Doesn’t make you a bad vegan or cancel your veganism. You just gotta keep going at it, don’t feel like you screwed up and won’t ever be vegan just because you caved a few times and had cake or pop tarts.    Btw unfrosted strawberry pop tarts are vegan!",False,False

The fact that you’re doing this at all speaks volumes for how much you care about animals.  Also I’d like you to know that Oreos, Swedish fish, unfrosted pop tarts, &amp; pillsbury frosting are all “accidentally vegan.” So there’s a lot of snacks you CAN have.",False,False
