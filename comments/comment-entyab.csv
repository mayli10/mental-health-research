I think it's useful as shorthand for certain groups of characteristic features (symptoms), but it falls short of describing the wide variation of experiences, even with people of one particular diagnostic group. I think relying upon diagnostic terms (referring to people who primarily utilise caloric restriction as ""anorexic"", or people who eat large quantities at once as ""binge-eaters"") can too easily facilitate stereotyping and overlooks the individuality of people's experiences. I mean, it's always more complicated than a label, right?",False,True

That’s part of why telling someone “just [do/don’t do] behavior X” is as unhelpful as telling an alcoholic “just don’t drink”. It’s also why recovery is such a long process. Someone can be physically stabilized yet still locked in a daily internal struggle.   EDs can be motivated by things other than/in addition to body-image.   Compassion and listening are always more helpful than judgement and ‘fixing’. People sometimes think they are qualified understand because, hey, everyone eats, everyone wants a ‘better’ body. A good place to start is for people to try to understand they do not understand.",False,False
