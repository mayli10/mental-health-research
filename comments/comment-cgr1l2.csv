Binge uncontrollably, get into another b/p cycle.  15:00: Come out of second b/p cycle. Parents complaining because they discovered you ate all of the lunch biscuits and ice cream, so your siblings can't have any. Feel like shit mentally and physically. Too mentally and physically drained to do anything. Craving the feeling of feeling empty for the first time.  15:30: Feel like shit because of depleted electrolytes and dehydration. Can barely focus or do anything. Realise feeling empty is uncomfortable, decide to eat some toast to reduce the feeling. Stuck between wanting to be empty and wanting to be full.  15:45pm: Everything that's happened (past and present) hits you at once and you can't cope, decide to swap to your alternative coping mechanism: Drinking!  16:30: Get absolutely smashed and continue b/p'ing, wasting alcohol and more food throughout the night.  18:00: Open up too much to friends and on forums about your problems and how your life is useless. Cry because you didn't end up achieving anything today and wasted the entire day binging and purging again. Afraid of how much weight you'll gain today.  20:00: Pass out in bed, but at least you're empty and won't be bloated in the morning.  03:00: Go through the motions of sleeplessness because of being hungry + medication.
