Iron and other vitamins are super low, and my hemoglobin is in the toilet. I rarely eat beef -- maybe every other week, if that -- and don't eat spinach because it's not really in season (joys of orthorexia on top of ""eh, food isn't super necessary""). I also refuse to take a supplement because of the GI risks, so... Yeah. Basically, my PCP is panicking, and I'm all ""cool, can't you just do an infusion so I can stop feeling overwhelmed at the world?""",False,False
