If you want to know why people were downvoting you, allow me to explain.   So, this is primarily a harm reduction sub for people who are pre-recovery. This is our space to air socially unacceptable thoughts about our EDs. When you see posts like this, you have to assume the poster is already pretty self-aware about their problems, and is usually also being at least kinda tongue-in-cheek. In light of that, telling a bulimic that bulimia doesn't work, and advising them to recover, isn't going to be received well here. Like, I guarantee the OP already knows that their ED isn't good for them, and is aware that recovery is a better option. Clearly, though, they're not ready to recover - and some of us never will be. But we still need social support to cope with this mental illness, and telling people to just recover isn't viewed as helpful....if we were looking for recovery advice, we'd say so specifically. Or go to an ED recovery forum.   I know you meant well with your comment, of course, and if EDanon is the right space for you, I hope this experience doesn't scare you off!",False,False

Even with insurance, my copay added up to two months of utility payments. The U.S. is a mess. I know systems are flooded in other countries too, but at least they're not so worm-eaten by the opportunity for easy profit. :/  Thanks for clarifying and for the kind well-wishes. ðŸ’™ I get it if you were mostly just talking about your own experience, and I hope you're doing as ok as possible now.",False,False

Clearly you haven't met a good therapist, unfortunately it's very common... I hope you find better.  I can only talk, as you said, about my own Ed and I say thar in my experience of BED and Bulimia i gradually gained weight instead of losing it. Many times I tried going anorexical and it just triggered worse binging. So I'm just saying is a dangerous road not only as a mental illness but also it can be fattening for someone depending on many factors. About the finances issue, in many countries ed therapy is in free healthcare and there are health insurances that cover it... idk yours.  I just know that the problem is in the soul, you have to start from there. I know it sounds so much new age shit but it's true. Wish you luck ðŸ’œ",False,False
