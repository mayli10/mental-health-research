A banana, yogurt (I like skyr), protein bar, maybe chicken with eggs? You're burning calories while working out so this won't be much. I work out six days a week and don't even restrict on these days cause it will end in me crying on the floor like a baby and binging.  I won't give any other advice because I'm not here to encourage Eds. I'm sorry.  Don't let your ed get in the way of hanging out with them. You deserve friends.",False,False
