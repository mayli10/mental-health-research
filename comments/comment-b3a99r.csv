You’re really articulate and that’s awesome, I read this about three times :)  I’m not sure I’m in a headspace to recover rn. But I will think about it. ",False,True

When inthralled with an ED your mind can do some real mental gymnastics to justify it's behaviour.   Imagine your disorder as a literal monkey on your back. Instead of eating you're handing off your bananas to it instead. Of course the monkey says how good you are doing, how strong you are to be so perfect when you keep feeding it. And when you have a bite for yourself? It screams at you and makes you feel awful for doing what's normal. As you grow weaker it's harder to carry the fat ape but it only makes the praise more profound right? ""Look at all you can do, look at how hard you are working, all the other people around you don't understand"" it's says.   When feeding into a disordered behaviour the brain releases the same hormones that addicts get from their fixes. You have to realize that with mental illnesses you have to try and separate out the monkey from your thoughts or else they are going to have lies.   I'm sorry if I'm rambling but I've been in a really similar place before I realized how badly I was deluding myself and how much harm I really was doing to my body. ",False,False

I “willingly” did outpatient though, I don’t know whether I would have been forced if I hadn’t been compliant.   At 13.5 I kinda knew I wasn’t fine, but I’ve been down to 15 and still declared myself “fine” and “healthy”. I was absolutely not. It was my ED talking 😉",False,False
