Its such a sensitive topic, and theres a lot of parents who dont get it. They think ""oh, my daughters not eating? Thats stupid, its just stress, its just some dumb teenage phase"" they sometimes really dont take it as seriously as they should. Thats why its so important to at least try to verbalize it in the clearest way possible. ""Mom, I'm having a hard time eating these days because I feel _____."" That way, even if she doesnt seem to care enough, later on she might get it and say to herself ""wow, she told me, how did I not see the signs?""   Of course this is only if youre ready to talk about it, I know its extremely hard  I dealt with the same thing though, ive had bouts of ED since I was 13 and my parents never noticed because it started out as a diet, i got to a healthy weight, but I never had a healthy relationship with food . my parents, esp my mom, arent the most observant people. It wasnt until last thanksgiving that I had a complete meltdown and finally talked to them about having an ED.   Dont let it get to that point though, its not worth the stress and the hiding, and the toll it takes on your body. Even if you feel like she wont listen, talk to your mom and try to get help as soon as you can",False,False

So I want you to know even if you feel you don‚Äôt look the part or engage in behaviors enough, the fact it apart of your routine and impacting your way of life makes it a disorder. Even though this disorder makes us want someone to notice to say we look like we are suffering, so many people are ignorant. Sometimes those closest to us don‚Äôt understand so they can‚Äôt give us the support we need. It sucks but that‚Äôs why we have professionals and you can seek out others who are in your situation to give you that validation and support you need to get through this. üíú",False,False

So many people with an ED have a healthy BMI and look ""average"", when in reality, the go through restrictive/bp cycles all the time and obsess over food, like anyone else with an ED. The sad part is, its hard for parents and family to really see what youre going through unless you ""look anorexic"". ED is so tricky, it makes you hide things, lie, which makes you feel even more guilty and even high when you get away with it.  Do you live with your mom? If so, if youve been doing this for a couple months, she has probably started to notice some behavior changes, but wont notice everything that your ED probably makes you do, unless she is SUPER attentive. If shes a caring person, don't be afraid to try to talk to her about it, the sooner you do, the better and it'll be easier for you to find healthier habits if you kick this ED now.  Never feel like just because you dont look super skinny, that you don't have disordered eating anf thoughts about food. It is still valid. If you're just starting, do your best to get help now.

Unfortunately, most people seem to think that eating disorders = anorexia = underweight. Which is so far from the truth. You can be underweight, normal weight or overweight.
