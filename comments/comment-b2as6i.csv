For me, dehydration = headaches. So I try to drink lots of water but if you do that without eating much you can flush all your electrolytes out which can also cause headaches. So I’ll take an electrolyte tablet (nuun, 10 cals) mixed into a liter of water and maybe eat a pinch of salt too. It helps a LOT. Maybe take a multi vit while you’re at it? I’ve also had good luck with having some caffeine to help with migraines specifically. Good luck, hope your head improves! Stay safe out there!",False,False
