Like, I'm underweight and always have been small, yet still bigger than her. And when I was at a healthy weight my waist measure was as high as 68cm. Being underweight with similar chest and hip measures I'm at 58cm now. That's my measurements after losing weight from my ED though. I have to imagine that very few people could be thinner without having some kind of struggle with food.",False,False
