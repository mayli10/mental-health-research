I lift heavy weights (PPL) along with serious, endurance road bike in the summer, swim in the winter. What gets me through is high restricting...but some days I just overeat because I've been restricting for so long and my body needs fuel to grow. Some of the big reasons I workout is to combat my ED. I want to fuel my body properly in order to do the things I enjoy, which is fitness. If I didn't have fitness I would have no reason to eat.",False,False

I also walk as much as possible and practice yoga. Honestly doing strength training while restricting is hard as fuck, and itâ€™s hard as fuck on your body. Low restricting combined with weight training and excessive cardio made me lose my period.
