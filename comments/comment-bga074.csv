elk2dg2,t3_bga074,t3_bga074,whatsupbitchezzz,1,2019-04-23 02:16:54,/r/EDAnonymous/comments/bga074/associations_with_being_fat_and_thin/elk2dg2/,"YES.   I associate thin with smart, delicate, wealthy, and feminine most of all. Waking up thin feels like coming home to a perfectly clean, tidy house  I associate fat with (big trigger warning) sloppiness, irresponsibility, whoring. When I think of myself at my highest weight it feels like a very difficult mess to clean, like a physically cluttered environment that you can't just get up and walk out of.   What you've said about the unshakeable ""fat"" label is so so interesting and relatable. I also feel ""fat"" (even if skinny) if I'm out in a loungewear outfit or haven't done my grooming. On the other hand if I'm actually ""fat"", I don't feel it's appropriate for me to wear my nicer outfits even though the difference between ""fat"" and ""skinny"" can be as small as two pounds and, of course, they still fit me. The only time I ever feel like I'm living my life is when I'm maximum thin and maximum dolled up, and at those times I never appreciate it because I'm worried about losing more or having regain anxiety.",False,False

I hate when people can tell that I'm red in the face, even if it's just because my whole family is naturally ruddy, because it makes me think red face = out of breath = unfit = fat. I hate when people can tell that I'm sweating, even if we're in the middle of a heatstroke and there's no AC indoors, for the same reason. I hate when people say I look tired because I associate it with over eating as well as being unfit... etc etc. Getting red in the face isn't because I'm fat and everyone sweats when it's hot and I look tired because I am, lol. But those are all ""fatty traits"" in my head.  Behaviourally I link being whiny/spoilt with being fat even though that's not even remotely true. I think it's because if I see a fat person acting spoilt/sheltered/whatever it reminds me of when I was younger at my worst mentally and emotionally where I was really depressed and it manifested as prioritising my own needs over everyone else's. And obviously because I was fat then (still am lol) I associate the behaviour with being fat even tho spoilt brats come in all shapes and sizes.",False,False
