I restrict but not out of a desire for thinness. My issues stem from a feeling that food is foreign and doesnt belong in my body. I experience dismorpha to a degree but honestly I think that's an effect of my restriction rather than a cause.  Its infuriating that every doctor or therapist I have tried to talk to about this concludes I have no eating disorder because my issues are about weight/body image. I also am not food phobic by which I meaning it's not any type or quality of food, it's the consumption of substances from outside my body. Past doctors have seriously have tried to tell me that it's just stress and should take a hot bath.   I have struggled with my ed since I was 10 and am now about to turn 36. That's far too long.   But we must not dispair! We are fighting a toxic culture and we must never stop trying to heal and trying to be at peace with ourselves. You are in your brain and in your body and can find a way to reconsile the two.   You seem awesome and I hope you find some peace soon. I believe in you!",False,False
