Including SF Jello. Like, why.   I suppose it's a matter of just repeating it until it sticks though. Best of luck to you ‚ù§Ô∏è",False,True

I binge and purge by fasting, and I‚Äôve been fasting for almost 3 days now.  It‚Äôs not a matter of if but when I binge, so the only way I know how is to not eat.  Like if I knew I could eat below or even at maintenance I would break my fast, but I don‚Äôt trust myself so I‚Äôm exhausted and cold.  I remember posting something like this a few years ago about being afraid to eat on ProED, and someone told me to eat just the tiniest bit of something nutritious (I think they said a bite of a banana) and I did and I felt accomplished for eating and didn‚Äôt feel like I failed since it was so small.  And that warmed me up to having food and I was able to slowly eat more.  I hope you feel better :( I‚Äôll try to follow that advice as well.",False,False
