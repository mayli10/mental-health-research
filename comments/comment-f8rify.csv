Frankly, that's low even for your basic cooked wheat pasta which has more like double that amount of calories when cooked. So the 75kcal/100g is definitely for a cooked product, which means the weight of uncooked noodles isn't really relevant here, OP would need to weigh the final product.",False,False

I usually calculate it like this: 75*0.6. Cooking them doesn't affect it (tho it can be nice to know how much water they absorb if you ever have to base your calorie count on their cooked weight),False,False

If its about 350-400 cals per 100 grams that's the typical amount for dry pasta I've seen. When you cook any amount of the noodles they will weigh more afterwards bc they absorb some of the water you cook them in. So you go from 100 grams of noodles at ~375 cals to eg 250 grams of noodles at also ~375 cals. If your label is lower cal than like 250 per 100 then I would check the brand's site to see if it says anything else there or if it specifies dry or uncooked (it varies between brands, usually only instant noodles have cals for the ready made thing as it's a mix of different components of a ready meal)",False,False
