Our family was pretty poor, I had five siblings, and if you didn't eat your food, someone else would. I wasn't allowed to save food for later because the family rule was ""if it's in the fridge, it's free."" There were never any seconds or leftovers of anything. It fucks me up to this day. I'm like a resource-guarding dog.",False,False

Like at all.  They won't eat any of their dinner, saying they're not hungry, then they ask for dessert. Because they are hungry, they just don't want to eat anything remotely healthy.  The ""clean your plate"" rule often comes about because otherwise your kid won't eat anything except candy and pizza.",False,False

If I didn't (and I often didn't) I was forbidden to eat anything else and was grounded. When I did I often threw up because I hated it. To this day I still finish my plate no matter what as if I consider it ""rude"" not to finish. Just yesterday my boss took me to the restaurant. They served me such a big plate, I was full after eating 1/3. And yet... I forced myself to finish everything. I felt so sick after.",False,False

I remember trying to explain to my mom as a child that it was the texture/temperature of the food, but I was too young to be able to articulate what I was trying to explain, so my mom just took it as “I was being picky,” which ofcourse didn’t fly in my house. One of the most damaging moments in my memories was that my mom started yelling at me when I was trying to explain my aversion to if &amp; it made me so nervous, I started laughing hysterically (to this day my brain copes with stress by laughing even when I don’t find things funny.)   I remember trying to drink sprite to stop laughing, and it came out my nose. Landed on the food, and my mom was more angry than she was before. I can still hear her screaming at me to not waste it &amp; forcing me to eat it after that.   I literally can’t agree with you enough. I constantly think about how different I want to raise my future kids - I don’t want them to have to go through any of what I had to,",False,False

I had strong aversions to the tastes and textures of many foods and my (now-ex-)stepfather would stand over me and scream directly into my face until I ate it all.  I regularly vomited my food right back onto my plate, and on more than one occasion he also made me eat my vomit or pushed the vomit-plate into my shirt.  There were a lot of other food-related messed up things he did, and I blame him almost entirely for triggering the development of my ED.  He's a piece of shit and I hope there's a hell so he can rot in it.
