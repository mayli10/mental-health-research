I used to be be extremely obese and after years of being bulimic now Iâ€™m like top healthy weight/ Low overweight BMI but I have a good bit of muscle so idk how accurate that is ya know.  The most important thing that has helped me with my eating disorder whether I was in recovery or not is working out.  If theyâ€™re not gonna let you lose weight then burn that fat and gain some muscle.  Consistently working out every week is one of the very few things that are struggling to keep myself out together. Without it I would be a lot worse off",False,False

Then I had to increase my daily intake. Then I was able to stop bingeing. It's really scary at first but 100% worth it. Hopefully your treatment team will be good and help you through all those steps.,False,False

It makes me so mad because I feel like Iâ€™m failing at therapy? And also invalidates all of my struggle and suffering? But my therapist talks about how accepting set point theory often means that for bulimics learning be intuitive ways will lead to weight stabilising at a lower point. Sometimes for people like us who have struggled with weight and food our whole lives part of recovery is recognising we donâ€™t have that notion of â€˜normal healthy eatingâ€™ to fall back on because we may never have learnt how to eat properly. Because of this nutritionist appointments were just as important as psychologist in order to trust and relearn. Hope this helps, change is so scary but so necessary when the things we have been trying arenâ€™t working or are doing us harm xx",False,False

I've heard about this before. Something about not letting the number hold so much power.

This is totally not important or priority, but there is a decent chance that learning how to eat normally will have a positive impact on your weight. There's no doubt in my mind that the bulimia itself has led to your weight gain. SSRIs won't do it alone.  Also, I'd guess that about half of the users on this subreddit are overweight or obese. Of course, even myself, the people who mark their flairs are more likely to do it if they're UW or normal. The support group I attend is *so* varied in body types and I imagine your treatment group would be the same.",False,False

One of the programs I did for bulimia fucking sucked at this. They would freaking praise me for binging because I was 'not restricting', even though restriction wasn't even my problem. Needless to say, it was not helpful, and I only started to get better when I found a therapist that was willing to help me with both purging AND binging. If this program helps with strategies to reduce both, then it will be much more helpful.  The reason I say this is because if you are reducing binges and focusing on establishing a healthy relationship with food, then as long as you don't have a medical issue, you should lose weight even if you aren't focusing on weightloss.  However, I don't even know anything about the program you're starting, but I'm already suspicious of them. They weighed you and let you see the number? Not letting a patient see their weight is like ED Treatment 101.",False,False

Getting to a healthy weight can absolutely be a goal, and treatment for your eating disorder is a part of that path, even if the scale isn't immediately reflective of that.
