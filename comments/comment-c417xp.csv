I always inspect in the mirror, I feel for my hip bones and ribs, I hold onto my collarbones when I‚Äôm stressed, and I make sure I can wrap my hands around my thighs and see how far up I can grab and still have my fingertips touching.",False,False

People just think its hands on hips. Grabbing my hip bones,  holding my arm fat. I always grope at bed time just to feel different bones sticking out and seeing what handfuls I can grab where.",False,False

Pressing my forearms into my hip bones when I‚Äôm sat down, feeling my sticky out spine at the back of my neck, trying to double cross my legs (makes me feel smaller), counting my ribs when I‚Äôm laying down on my side, feeling my chest bones when I‚Äôm laying on my back ....  And that‚Äôs not mentioning the shop windows. I walk a similar route every day and I can predict the ones that‚Äôll give me a good reflection.   The whole thing is incredibly exhausting and can very easily ruin my day if I see the wrong thing   I also feel my salivary glands obsessively cos they‚Äôre almost always swollen and I fucking hate it",False,False

When I listen to music I drum on my belly, changing between tensed and not tensed abs, to feel the difference in jiggly-ness and hear the sound difference  I also do the lift up the shirt in the bathroom- I've been caught a few times lol it was awkward  And I like to grab the fat on my thighs and pull it back to see what a thigh gap would look like",False,False
