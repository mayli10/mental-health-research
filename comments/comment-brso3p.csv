I just want to be sure she’s not one of those people who think being fat genetic, because that’s not the type of professional I want to pay to help with my fitness",False,True

The thing is though, I don’t actually THAT she’s fat. I care WHY. This is a person who I’m trusting to help with my fitness goals and body. If she’s fat because she’s decided she’d rather eat a ton and be chunky than count calories, I’d be fine with that tbh.   Like, if I had a trainer who was emaciated and had no muscle tone whatsoever, I’d kind of also want to know what’s up, since muscle building is my goal.   I guess I do actually feel semi-entitled to the information, but only because I’m paying her as a fitness professional and I’d like to know that my money is going towards the services of someone that is going to have the ability to help me reach my goals (even if her goals aren’t the same). My talk therapist is actually a larger woman and I don’t care, I pay her to help with my brain and she’s got her mental shit all the way together so I never question her there.",False,True

I'm kind of similar. Decent muscle, know my shit about nutrition, love the gym. But For a long time, I smoked out and munchied my way to ""barely obese"" (that is honestly how I rationalized it ekgbsf I could shoot myself). The food was pretty healthy but my portions were insane.   Maybe she just eats whatever she wants and rationalizes she doesn't look ""that bad.""",False,False

It doesn’t impact her ability to do personal training with you, and yet it bothers you that her body is fat.   Maybe she’s got eating problems, maybe she has medical problems, maybe she used to be even heavier and it is leveling out, who knows. Do you believe you have the right to information about her health? If she were thin, would you assume she has a restrictive eating disorder?   I would try to think of your own experience and struggles and try to have empathy/compassion. Doctors get sick, therapists have depression, etc., it is definitely possible to not practice what you preach for a variety of reasons.",False,False

I get your curiousity - how can you train people to lose weight, but you are fat yourself? I am not gonna lie I would be weirded out too.. like I have a personal trainer too and I've seen most of the trainers around the gym and they are all fit and muscular. It is really shitty because the only way to find out is to ask her which would be just awkward to do.",False,False
