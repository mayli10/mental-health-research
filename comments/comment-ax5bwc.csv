I think I may have some Amazon credit but not enough to get anything I really need. Iâ€™ve been struggling a lot too but live in the US and have the max in SNAP benefits (which general covers food for me and my kids pretty well)... I find that stressing about the financial aspect of things actually ends up triggering binge behaviors for me, and itâ€™s awful. Itâ€™s awful no matter what! And scary at your BMI. Iâ€™m sorry youâ€™re going through this.  Send me an address and some staples if you wantâ€”or maybe you should make an Amazon wishlist of food items where people can get things from it without you having to share your address? Then maybe in addition to the awesome subs already mentioned, you could try spreading it around on Tumblr. Sending you lots of love. Youâ€™ll get through this. ðŸ’›",False,False

Money problems are some of the most stressful problems.  Your campus may have resources to help. My former campus had a food pantry on campus for students only. I'd look around your campus website and see if something like that exists.,False,False
