Then summer holidays started and I've had binge cycles straight from hell and gained so much weight and it makes me feel so invalid...

I need to pull myself together ðŸ˜¶   EDs are so twisted because you won't feel sick if you don't look even tho it's a mental issue with possible physical side effects... I wish you the best with your recovery and hope you find the strength to change your life for the better even if it may seem hard right now, remember, you are valid, you are worthy of recovery ðŸ’—",False,False
