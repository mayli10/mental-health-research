Something I really like is putting a scoop of protien powder into oats and making oatmeal that way. It can be super tasty and it's really filling. There's been days where I'm below my cal intake limit and spent the leftover on a protien shake or the oatmeal concoction   My hair still isn't 100% but... I'm anorexic so it's not going to be. But it stops it from falling out in literal handfuls, it's a lot better now.",False,False
