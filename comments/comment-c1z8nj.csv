If I see someone who's not totally skinny but doesn't seem to hate themselves for it I get so sad and envious.  I went to Pride this weekend and I wore hot pants and a crop top cause I've always wanted to but I live in Wyoming and already got harrassed for the one time I tried to run in the hot pants and a t-shirt. And it was supposed to be fun and freeing and whatever but instead I was just so self conscious of my stomach and my thighs the whole time. But there were so many other people there who were my size or bigger who were wearing the same as me, or less, or more but tighter, etc. and even though my first thoughtclooking at them was ""they're fat"" it was in envy because they seemed so confident and happy and like, why can't I do that? Why can't I be like that? How are they not bothered by the thing that seems to come tell my life the most?",False,False

I feel incredibly guilty, and then I try to make up for the negative thought  by thinking about my flaws. So then I just end up being a sad and guilty mess. Honestly I think that might partly be our own unhappiness talking when it has happened, when I'm not happy I find myself more critical  in general. What matters in life is how we treat others.",False,False

If I have a mean thought, I immediately feel bad, then remember the post and try to think of something positive or at least empathetic. For example, in this case I would think something like: Well, I don't know this person. They could be going through something really terrible to have put on that weight, and for all I know they are getting help/working hard to get healthy. Truly for all I know they could have lost 50 lbs. recently and feel great about themselves. Either way, I wish them the best because I know what it's like to struggle with body image and eating and it sucks a lot",False,False

As I’ve gotten older though (I’m 30 now and have battled AN for over two decades), I’ve come to be JEALOUS of those people. They may have imperfections, but so do I. Unlike me, though, they are able to overlook their flaws and actually enjoy their lives. I used to be horrified by the idea of looking like some of the out-of-shape people I’d encounter, but now I think maybe I’d trade them if it meant I got their self-confidence and self-acceptance, too.",False,False
