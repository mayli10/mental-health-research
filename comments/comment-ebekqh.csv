What I meant is that I *felt* like I binged. I'm sorry for using the wrong definition, particularly since I've never binged and don't know what it feels like. What I intended to convey was that I felt like I ate too much and my anxiety got the best of me with this post. But frankly, your comment is really rude and invalidating to some degree. Maybe you didn't mean to come off like an ED gatekeeper, but shutting down my feelings when I'm struggling just like every single person on this sub isn't helpful. And no need to preface your comment with ""no offense"" when your next sentence tells me to fuck off. I said I'm sorry and I admit I made a mistake. There's a way to explain what I did wrong without being condescending.",False,True

You can come in here and talk about how you *feel* like you binged if you need support, but don’t list out everything in your “binge.” That’s a fairly healthy breakfast. It’s triggering for people trying to recover. And it’s also triggering for actual bingers who would be *proud* if that was all they had for breakfast.",False,False
