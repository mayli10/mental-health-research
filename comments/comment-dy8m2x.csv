I'm pretty much weighing myself every time I pee. I love seeing the number go down even just the tiniest bit, even if it's only water. I get high from it. But if it stays the same, or goes up I'm wrecked. I'm sure I'd have a much healthier mindset if I weighed only 1x a week and could actually see some progress instead of overthinking every ounce of water I drink.",False,False

It's under my sink so it's out of sight out of mind. On a eh day I'll weigh myself in the morning bc I tell myself I'm not as bloated so I'll weigh less (and that sometimes forms a habit of every morning when I wake up for like a week). Bad days see me weighing myself just before bed after consuming food that day, still fully clothed and whatnot",False,False
