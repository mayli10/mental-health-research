Also cold brew or Kyoto slow drip black coffee from a fancy coffee shop are incredible, like night and day from generic iced coffee. RIP wallet though. It is relatively easy to make cold brew at home and I keep telling myself I‚Äôll do that more when it gets warmer again",False,False

It's the only way I can drink black coffee. I drink it out of a mason jar because I do 20 ice cubes, shake until mostly melted, then add another 10 and stir with my metal straw. Don't know why my brain decided on those numbers and that exact method.. but ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è it's a damn good iced coffee. I drink 2-4 in a day.",False,False
