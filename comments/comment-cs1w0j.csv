I have been to the E.R. more than once about it and they could never find anything but it still hasn't eased my panic over it. It absolutely sucks and is terrifying and the only way for it to go away for me is if I continue eating at maintenance for a few weeks. It feels like I'm about to have a heart attack and I can't even sleep when it happens. If anything ever gives me the motivation to fully recover that will be it because it's just so horrific to experience.  &amp;#x200B;  For me it's just a hyperawareness of my heart/heartbeat that overpowers everything, and the beats feel very irregular",False,False

I'll also try bringing it up with my doctor and see if he can refer me, though I'm terrible at mentioning new issues I have.",False,True

It may be that since days into a fast your stomach acid is pretty concentrated, and right after you eat there's probably a lot of digestive activity going on.",False,False

I have these daily due to genetics.  Mine were diagnosed with an ekg during a routine doctorâ€™s visit, but it may be wise for you to see a cardiologist.  Also magnesium supplements help to lesson my symptoms greatly.  It may be worth a try for you.  I know the symptoms can be very unsettling but there are a lot of treatments for pvcs. :)",False,False
