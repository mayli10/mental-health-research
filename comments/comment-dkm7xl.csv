In my early high school years I started restricting, compulsively exercising &amp; self harming which got me to my lowest weight.   2015 was a year full of traumatic events &amp; I did so much therapy to get my self worth up. Eventually I would allow myself way too many treats because ""I'm a bad bitch I deserve to eat good"" ... Until it went too far &amp; I would go WEEKS without ever feeling hungry. Always bloated.   I started restricting again about 6 months ago, but having been thru recovery before I just can't commit to starving myself so it is very unpredictable how any given day will go.  Someone put me on a damn feeding tube.",False,False
