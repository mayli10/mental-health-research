Good work on deleting lose it and quitting weighing yourself!! I'm sorry it comes with such shitty circumstances attatched to it.  (Next sections gonna be advice that you didnt ask for so feel free to zone out now if you want!) Re: trans stuff: the I don't apply this logic to other trans people but I do to myself used to be such a mood - however it's important to recognise that it's still internalized transphobia bc living and growing up in a cis society sucks balls but try and challenge that when it comes up or imagine saying the mean thing your saying to yourself to a trans person you know and yr brain will probably be like ! Actually This is bad thought. It doesn't happen over night but I've put a few solid years into rerouting my thinking after realising I would always be miserable if I let these thoughts continue and I can now honestly say that 90% of the time I love being trans. Also would recommend reading Nobody Passes by Mattilda Sycamore!,False,False
