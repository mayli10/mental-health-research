It's just a bad habit. I've quit drinking before without a problem and gone back to just having like, a beer while out with friends or A glass of wine with dinner no problem. It just becomes like this awful habit that I stop moderating. It stops being a treat and is like ""ok what beer do you wanna grab from the store tonight?""   Idk how to explain it. Haha. It's definitely not good and something I need to moderate if I  decide to imbibe again, but I'm not like hiding flasks of vodka and getting drunk before work to function and whatnot.   I look at it like people who get into the habit of eating too much fast food. Sometimes it isnt an eating disorder, they just get too far into the habit and it becomes their go to reflex, and eventually they're like ""wow I've been eating too much McDonalds for dinner, I should really chill out.""",False,True

Being drunk or recovering from being drunk are the only things that can force me to eat normally. I wish I had advice to offer, but I don't, I just want you to know you aren't the only one I guess. Sobriety is fantastic, kudos to you-- I hope that killing one demon means you can face the others more steadily. Good luck &lt;3",False,False
