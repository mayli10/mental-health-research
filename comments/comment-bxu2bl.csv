Consider which method of eating actually made you feel better overall, and how you might feel in 6 months if you are still doing it. I know it screwed up my studies lol.  The 1,200 is more sustainable and healthy in the long run imo and weight will come of steadily and in a safe way.   You might gain first as a result of restricting and bingeing, but as balance restores I think weight will start to drop again, it just takes time.   I hope you feel better soon, please don't feel guilty about picking up a healthier lifestyle.   I wish you all the best x",False,False
