I’m pretty sure my eating is disordered to some extent. I just wasn’t sure if it could be a cause of this or if I’m just projecting because I don’t know what else it could be?,False,True

Before this late streak my periods came early which was almost equally annoying. I thought I wasn’t super disordered so it wouldn’t effect my periods? But I guess I was wrong fuck me.   Now I’m trying not to play the “Am I bigger because of my period or food?” Game because I know it’s probably both. Fml. Again thanks for the help though, hopefully it crops up soon so I can get it over with.",False,True

I’m trying not to worry about it, especially since I know I’m not pregnant. I’m just a little concerned and a little frustrated. I don’t wanna be caught off guard you know?

I've missed a whole month when low restricting.  I wouldn't be worried over a few days!  But maybe I'm just used to it (I've never ever had a perfectly regular period like some, idk why, it wasn't bc of diet so not sure)",False,False
