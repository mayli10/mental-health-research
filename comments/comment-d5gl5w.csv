But I've never been able to eat intuitively. It seems very impossible to me because I keep on getting paranoid about ""eating in a fat way"" which triggers me to eat less and lose. Even though I wasn't as paranoid when I was a kid I still thought it would be ""better"" to diet and lose weight ""just because"" and I relied on my parents actually just telling me to eat.  Also I don't think most people that care about their health truly, 100%, intuitively eat. They still try to sort of eat healthy foods even though they're not orthorexia-level concerned about it. For example, my brother doesn't seem to have anxieties around food, but he was overweight as a little kid (like when I was 3-4 maybe? so I don't remember) so my mom made him exercise and lose weight.
