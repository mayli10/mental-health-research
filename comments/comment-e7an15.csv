I ended up trying out group therapy for anxiety (not ED specific).  Yo - it helped me develop coping skills that changed my life.  I recommend group therapy esp.  if you’re on the fence about it.  Also helped w my social skills.,False,False

I would go to him if I had any issues getting to my regular therapist and really needed to speak with someone. And if I hadn’t built such a report with him I would have switched to my college counselor. It wasn’t for ED (didn’t have that issue then) but he was truly very helpful. It’s worth it to at least try it.,False,False
