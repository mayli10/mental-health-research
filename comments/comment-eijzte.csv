It’s so hard not to freak out when the scale is up 5 lbs, but that is so, so normal when maintaining. I constantly have to remind myself that people without ED’s don’t weigh themselves 3x a day and notice these fluctuations so much. I’ve been +/- 2 to 6 lbs from my “current weight” consistently and it’s an ongoing struggle to accept that this is maintenance; not seeing just one consistent number. But with all that said, it’s so worth it to try to eat “normally”, for at least the extra energy boost it gives me. It’s a struggle, but I’m trying so hard to pull through for my son!!",False,False

It’s so, so hard, not knowing what to do next. Gaining is out of the question, losing is preferable but unlikely to happen much more, and maintenance is a joke for me at this point...I’m so used to eating &gt;1000 cal and seeing the number jump down I can’t imagine seeing it stagnate",False,False
