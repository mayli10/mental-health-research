We don't have any of that kind of mistrust in our relationship...   I guess it depends on how much you trust your SO to not snoop on you. Its perfectly fine to just say you prefer to keep it to yourself for now. Every relationship needs boundaries and some privacy.,False,False

You should be able to have privacy in the relationship, and I don't know much about how much he knows or how much/what you post, but if it were me, I don't have a single ex I would let see this account...even one when we were engaged and I felt like I told him everything. Some of it is just tone and stuff out of context.   Like I have people I would tell anything I post, but I'm going to post it differently to a forum of ED sufferers reading than the way I would explain it to them.   Hell I even made two versions of a meme once, one for edanonmemes, one to send to a friend. Just slightly different wording.",False,False

They don't appear in your profile that way. Then you could make an alt and post here under it (or make your current an alt whatever works). Tbh tho id say its fair to not want to show ur SO ur whatever account bc it's just nice to have some things be separate from each other, like how ppl have different hobbies or pastimes! Or maybe just show ur SO ur fave subreddits without sharing accounts?",False,False
