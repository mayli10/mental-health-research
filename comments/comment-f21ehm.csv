It's really difficult to do well in nursing school if you're trapped in the restrict/binge cycle. There's SO much to learn and you need to free up your brain to do it. Exercising is good (I recorded my notes and listened to them while walking). But give yourself a break and allow yourself to eat a healthy amount during school.",False,False
