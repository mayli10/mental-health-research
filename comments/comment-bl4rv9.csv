It‚Äôs so fucking triggering. I know a lot of it is fake (they have hair extensions, lip fillers, expensive makeup, breast implants, and enough money that they have the time to work out) but it‚Äôs so triggering. Seeing them surrounded by these perfect girls make me think like why are they taking to me? It must just be because the other girls are busy. I‚Äôm such a joke. So fat. Honestly I was only recently triggered and i feel like it was because I started talking to these guys,",False,False
