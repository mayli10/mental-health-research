I am 26 and I‚Äôve had BED for 6ish years... some years worse than others... I‚Äôll have 2 day binges or Ill have like week-long binges, they‚Äôre controlled but I‚Äôm overeating a lot and eating as much as I can. I guess over time I just try to get better at binging, making it less extreme, trying not to swing the restrict/binge pendulum too much.  But I reeeallly hate it dude. Your post hits home. I wish I had better answers.",False,False

U mentioned that when u binge, the next day u fast. This sets u up to binge again because u will be starving and super super hungry on the day following the fast. So try eating a moderate and healthy amount of food the day following, and then continuing with that.   That way u won‚Äôt experience the extreme mental and physical hunger that gives u the uncontrollable urge to binge   (Note: obvs this isn‚Äôt applicable to people with BED, but OP sounds like they are using these compensatory behaviours so Ye)",False,False

Our brains love fats and sugars.   I've been better about curbing my binges by eating small amounts of healthy food through the day. Breakfast is usually like an egg and toast, lunch is dinner leftovers or a sandwich, dinner is a vegetarian meal. Tbh getting in a small breakfast has changed the game. Then I'm not hungry at lunch -&gt; can eat a baby lunch -&gt; full enough to prepare and portion a healthy dinner.   Also I started only keeping healthy food in the house. Okay I'm bringing, but it's on rice cakes and peanuts, not chips.   Also idk if you smoke pot but prolly half my binges are fueled by the munchies.   For me the trick is not giving in to my urge to fast. I can lose so much weight from fasting üò≠ but afterwards it's really hard to get back on track.",False,False

I think I'm just gonna liquid fast until I have to starting to now at 5pm. I just feel like I cant anymore you know?  i think we can change the storyline at anytime! what i've come to realize is that the mind is a prison. if we can overcome it, we become free to do anything. if you want to do undo the stuff, you can through your own self determination. like you, i also run. i find it really helps foster confidence to make that change. i'm going to do 9 miles tonight on treadmill in an effort to fix what i wrought.  and ty for the reply! this is the first time i've talked about it with others who exist with this too. and i guess it's nice being able to talk to people who relate.",False,True

Eating 1200 calories and running every other day helped. One time doing omad helped (I'd eat at either 11am or 5pm depending on my work)  Other times I've just liquid fasted for 2 weeks (it's hard the first 3 days and after that it's pretty easy)   I'm really sorry this is happening. Believe me I've been there and I'm currently there. I'm at my wits end. Im having the longest binge/normal eating phase of my life I've gained 50lbs and honestly its just making me binge more since I feel so helpless.

It's a long fucking slog if a journey but my binges are ""healthier""  Basically I still go binge shopping and buy and eat 4000+ cals in one half hour sitting BUT a while ago I started to give myself some small rules around binge eating.  If I am going to but and eat an entire pint of ice-cream I have to eat a banana first. I am allowed the huge bag of chips but first I have to drink a pint of water. If I buy shit loads of babybell cheese I also have to buy low-fat yogurt and eat that first. Slowly but surely I am binging on banana, low fat yoghurt and water rather than ice-cream, chips and cheese.   Small rules at ""fuck it"" moments have helped me. If you're going to binge anyway you may as well add in a fucking banana üçå",False,False
