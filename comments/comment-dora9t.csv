The best thing I think you could do is to make clear that you love her for her at any size. That might be hard to do now since she’s experienced your frustration with her eating and exercising habits. Maybe something like, “4lbs in a week is a lot. I’m glad you’re looking to take care of your body, but remember there’s more to it than just your weight. You know I struggle with food stuff, and I guess I just want to know that you’re ok and let you know that I’m here to talk if you need.”  Idk that’s kind of after school special sounding.   Maybe it would be more realistic to say “wow, I’ve only ever lost that much in a week when I was really struggling with my eating disorder. I’m really proud of you but are you sure you’re ok?”  Idk  This seems like a bigger issue than this one interaction so smaller, less direct changes in your relationship might be better in the long run in case a direct approach makes her angry or defensive or hide shit from you and therefore not able to get support.   Ah, idk, this is all above my pay grade.   Good luck!",False,False
