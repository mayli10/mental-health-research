What wasn't the habit formed by? But I've gone down the route of 'why' and I've found it to be unhelpful. I think the only thing in my case is to ask how to break it/deal with it.,False,True

I totally understand that feeling of thought almost like a big poster in your mind that doesn't go away forcing you to address it because it's so uncomfortable having your mind almost pulled towards it like a magnet. You've Identified what triggers that for you which is awesome. Now to learn more about that trigger and it's origin.   How was the habit of needing to eat frequently formed?,False,False

When I challenge this by trying to eat less frequently, I go into this mode where I can't think about anything else, and I get very irritated, until I eat. And it doesn't matter what it is-- apple, pizza, whatever. I haven't been restricting in any way in a long time. I think my mind is just too addicted to eating all the time.   If I challenge it, by trying to eat only when genuinely hungry, or eating things I genuinely enjoy, it doesn't matter. I get very ravenous, not because of hunger, but because I'm trying to break the habit. I'm rarely actually hungry. I don't know how to get out of this 'mode'.",False,True

What is the feeling exactly?   And doing Intuitive eating wrong can't exactly be glossed over. If it's wrong it's wrong. Doesn't matter if you've been trying for 50 years. The fundamentals need to be understood otherwise nothing works.,False,False

I've been trying to do the whole 'intuitive eating' thing for years, but it doesn't work (I'm probably doing it wrong, but still). The problem isn't that I restrict.. the problem is that I often get into a thought loop where 'I can't stand the feeling of not eating' and it doesn't make a difference whether I restrict or not.",False,True

Solution?   Remove restriction. Not just physical restriction but mental restriction eg. Meal timing, meal size, meal types, sugar. Also not being restrictive doesn't mean be mindless and forget feeling or reasoning. You combine how you feel physically with how you feel mentally.   Stop filling your mind with the things you've listed. You've literal made it a habit to fill your mind with those thing's. Stop doing that. Replace it with something else or limit it to one day in the week preferably a Sunday with the hope of not longer finding it necessary to search the internet about all things dieting &amp; food. If you don't put that stuff in your mind it doesn't grow and become your entire world, your mind will be forced to take on something else. What you focus on grows. It's as simple as that.",False,False
