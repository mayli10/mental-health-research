There was a post a couple weeks ago with someone saying they can't see how anyone can let themselves be a BMI above 19. And then people talking about feeling superior to others because they eat nothing for several days, etc. While those of us with binging/bulimia are here like oh okay thanks lol ",False,False

In the midwest where I live people don't seem to code you as overweight until you have an obese BMI, and obese or ""fat"" would be well beyond that. From what I have heard people are much more ""health conscious"" and fatphobic on the coasts than in the south and midwest. ",False,False

I've had people still call me curvry and chubby at a bmi of 21 because I have very little muscle tone and a high bf percentage ,False,False

So, varies greatly from person to person.   And the cutoff as far as people's perceptions go varies by culture. In North America, ""fat"" generally means ""obese"", whereas most other terms such as ""chubby"" describe being overweight, but not obese. ",False,False

Perception has to be measured with one's body fat percentage.  Although I wouldn't be able to give you hard numbers.,False,False
