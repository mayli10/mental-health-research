For example on Thanksgiving and Christmas my fam always eats a big meal together so I let myself have 1 plate and take a little of whatever I want, but only that 1 plate, maaaaaaybe like 1/2 piece of pie if I can get someone to split with me. I try to make that my only meal of the day but if I'm really hungry later I eat something lowcal and safe. Even though I'm definitely eating more than usual it keeps me under control so it's not enough to gain and I've already planned it and given myself permission to eat it so I don't have to feel guilty or try not to eat and end up bingeing instead.   For other holiday parties I usually make myself a small plate with a couple of snacks, whatever I would be willing to potentially consume, and carry it around with food on it for as long as possible. I might sloooooowly snack on it if I feel like I can but the point is to keep something on the plate until I'm ready to leave or until most people are done eating.",False,False
