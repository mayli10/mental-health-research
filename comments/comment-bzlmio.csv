I lost a lot of weight at once and then continued to restrict for months after. Then I gained it all back within a month during final exam season! This is because I was was good at restricting but when I finally got close to my goal weight (almost underweight tbh, even then I STILL wasn't happy with my body) I broke. I was tired of always restricting and not actually eating the food I wanted.  So I of course did the logical then and ate everything in sight...  I'm still struggling with restricting ( I'll be honest, doing a 15 day water fast) but right now I think its best you learn how to do maintenance. Seriously, that is the hardest part of weight loss and I wish I learned it the first time when I was close to my gw. The problem with our way of losing weight is that it doesn't teach us how to eat 'normally' so we gain the weight back. Try to have the goal of maintaining you weight for a week or losing weight slowly (  0.5 per week).   &amp;#x200B;  Sorry if this is cliche and nagging advice, but what also kinda helps me is to have non-weight goals also. Whats something you kinda of always wanted to do? Feel free to make a small goal in that and it helps take away your mind of the weight a bit. Feel free to reach out if you wanna talk or need any support. While I gained the weight back and losing it again, your story does not need to end up like mine! : ) I'm 10/10 confident you can keep the weight off if you work on maintaining and healthily losing.",False,False
