My BMI is ~14 and my SO recently told me I don’t “look sick”. It’s a weird feeling because I don’t necessarily want to look *sick*, but I do want my body to reflect the work I put in.",False,False

As another commenter said, the VS angels are usually skinny enough to be diagnosed with AN by BMI alone. However, as we know, BMI is not 100% accurate for very tall or very short people. You are not very very short, but IIRC, the ""new BMI"" that takes height into account has 5'6 as the height where BMI doesn't change from the old one, so anything taller has a slightly lower BMI for the same height as before, and anything lower has a higher BMI for the same height as before. YOUR BMI IS STILL EXTREMELY UNDERWEIGHT. I do not mean to dismiss you in ANY way, or imply you are not sick, or not skinny. You most definitely are. Other people, people without eating disorders, base ""healthy"" off looks, and if your bone structure is slim or your bones do not naturally poke out or even if you look like a celebrity who also has bones out but is praised for being ""healthy"", people- men especially- will generally think that a person who looks similar is not ""that skinny""  Perhaps you should explain you are still upset- let him know that you appreciate his apology and understanding, but just tell him ""hey I'm still upset about this. People with eating disorders tend to really latch onto comments and they stick with us, even after an apology. If I think of more to tell you to help you understand better, I will. For now I am just upset,"" There is nothing wrong with being upset.  I hope nothing I said triggered you further- it was only meant to help you.   Good luck",False,False

He probably thought ""you need to be on a drip and on your deathbed and then people think of anorexia.""   Just remember, Victoria's Secret Angels have BMIs of like 17...that's normalised (to an extent, you know what I mean).   I also think, however, that your boyfriend needs to research a bit on what to say and what not to say to people with EDs.",False,False
