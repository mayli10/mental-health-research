When I lived in France, I lived in a top floor apartment that used to be the maids quarters. On the floor, there are about 15 apartments that run along the perimeter of the building. The building was over 100 years old and so were the narrow pipes that connected all the apartments. When someone flushed a toilet, you could hear it run through your walls.   After a particularly bad b/p session, I hear a pounding on my front door. The plumbing was leaking in the guy's apartment below mine and everyone's plumbing had backed up. No one knew I caused the blockage, just that the blockage didn't go any further from my apartment. Then the water overflowed into my place and I had to mop it up with all my sheets and blankets.   I was mortified and stopping b/p-ing for a couple weeks before learning to pick food that actually broke down. ",False,False

Not just a bit here and there, chunks. In my shower drain, in my brush, even if I just touched my hair. I had to increase my calories because it wouldn't stop, and it took about 3 months after I increased for the dramatic hairloss to even begin to stop.  I had long hair, past my boobs, it was gorgeous. I cut it to above my shoulders just so when it fell out, it didn't look like it was as much. I cried every time I showered.  It's still all broken and thin now. Breakage and flyaways everywhere. It's at the point where I'm contemplating shaving it all off, because it's just so bad.

I noticed that when I would purge, there would be some blood. I thought it was because my nails were cutting my throat or mouth. Nope. My gums started receding and would bleed every time that I would purge. I'm so afraid of not having any teeth that I quit purging altogether and started using laxatives more. I haven't purged since last February. It's a great achievement, but I have gained a disgusting amount of weight because of it.  I'm glad that I don't purge anymore but damn.

This is so gross, but last year I went to the Philippines for about a month.  I only purged a few times there, mostly in ditches and gutters since the plumbing can't handle vomit.

It wasn't even much, but as expected, the large pieces didn't go down no matter how much water I poured in.  I had to dig the pieces out, climb on a bucket by the window, and throw the pieces out.
