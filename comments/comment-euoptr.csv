With more information you can assess whether she abused that trust. My experience with providers has featured great deal of foolishness and even incompetence but not maliciousness or trickery. It‚Äôs possible she just didn‚Äôt think it through. If she truly proscribed a med with an intent to produce an effect she didn‚Äôt disclose, than that‚Äôs wildly uncool, probably unethical, and maybe time to consider finding new doctor because someone who would do that probably doesn‚Äôt understand providing effective ED help.   It‚Äôs also worth a phone call to doctor or pharmacy to check if going cold-turkey is safe. Sometimes tapering off saves a lot of misery. I hope things stabilize soon &lt;3",False,False
