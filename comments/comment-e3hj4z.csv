I am almost underweight but my thighs are huuuuge and I cannot wear leggings. I don’t understand how people can wear them and look good or feel comfortable. I don’t understand how people can actually want this body type either. I hate it. And yesssss on looking fat under clothes!! I am wearing shorts way too long into the winter because of my leg muscles are not visible I just look chubby. :(",False,False
