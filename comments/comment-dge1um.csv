My mom had my food VERY regimented as a child (yogurt for lunch Monday, Wednesday, Friday. Sandwiches on Tuesday and Thursday. I could have a bagel for breakfast on Fridays. 4 small carrots with every meal. 1 apple allowed as my only snack between lunch at noon and dinner at 8pm, etc.)  And do I eat like that now? Hell no. I hoard so much junk food and inhale it the second I get my hands on it. I feel so stupid for this behavior but I canâ€™t stop myself",False,False
