Since you are at a normal BMI and not overweight, you could try to recomp by eating at maintenance and lifting weights. Basically this will lower your body fat while increasing your muscle mass, making you look slimmer",False,False

It varies from person to person. My legs are much thinner and I'm pretty small according to the standards of the country, that I currently live in. I lost most of my muscle, because of the ED and some other diseases and can't lift weights as efficiently as I used to before.  Basically, you've got bones, muscles and organs too that constitute the weight. Plus, body fat percentage can also vary. At my weight and height, some people might look heavier, if their body fat percentage is higher and they don't have a lot of muscle, because the latter takes up less space.  There's really no point fretting about the BMI.",False,False

Iâ€™m also at a normal BMI, but my body fat distribution is awful. Iâ€™m extremely apple shaped but flat chested, so my blob of a stomach always sticks out farther than my chest.   I want to get back under 19 too. My stomach still sticks out at 19, but at least it doesnâ€™t stick out as much. ðŸ™ƒ",False,False
