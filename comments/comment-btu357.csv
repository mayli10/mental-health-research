I'd rather not get too into it, but the topic was our skills and me questioning why he wasn't getting a decent-paying job with his skills. I was questioning why I had to do everything with my one job that just barely pays the bills. He's been unemployed for a couple months before someone calls me bossy lol. He's got 9 years on me and so much experience. He could EASILY get a 70k job but refuses to because he feels he deserves this long ass break. I'm frustrated by that I can understand like a 2 or 3 week vacation, but 2 months... idk. In short, he took a low-blow at me and my insecurities because his ego was hurt.",False,True
