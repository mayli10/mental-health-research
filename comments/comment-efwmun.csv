I do that too man.  ""I used to be anorexic,"" ""yeah, I used to starve myself."" etc.  I justify it because I'm like, technically I'm not lying, I just skipped over the bit where I \*still\* starve myself.  It's safer, yknow? There are very few people (maybe two?) who know that I'm still struggling, and even they don't know the extent of it.    I do find that ""I used to be anorexic/bulimic/etc"" and ""I used to starve/purge/binge/etc"" can be kind of a code though, if you suspect someone ELSE has an ED.  Like, I told my one friend ""I \*used to\* starve myself as a teenager"", and he was like ""yeah, I \*was\* anorexic and bulimic in high school.""  And we just exchanged this look like ""takes one to know one, I get what you're saying.""  So even though neither of us has mentioned that we \*still\* have an ED, it's like, we both know the other person's secret and we both know that the other person knows, and we don't talk about it (at least in present tense), but we like, have each others' backs now lol.",False,False
