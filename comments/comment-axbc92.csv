Where as her knowingly tricking you in to eating meat can make you ill. What she did was not only immature it was extremely inappropriate and to be honest I think you should look in to your options of moving out or evicting her. She needs to go.  She's allowed to think your dietary choices are stupid but she isn't allowed to force you to eat meat. You trusted her, as you should be allowed to do, and she lied to you and is being insensitive.  I'm a vegetarian for the love of the animals but I'm also allergic to pork and she had better believe she's lucky I wasn't on the other side of that burrito, I'd sue her ass. ",False,False

Being vegetarian isn’t always just because you care about animals or just don’t like eating meat. Some people avoid meat because it actually makes them sick, which would mean that its basically like giving milk to someone with lactose intolerance, or even giving food to someone when you know that they’re allergic to it.      Im so sorry your roommate is such a cunt. Thats never an ok thing to do. If you think being a vegetarian is dumb, than don’t be one, but respect other peoples fucking choices.      Id love to drive the importance of respecting other peoples food habits into her some way. Like slipping **really** hot peppers into her food (not even to kill her, just enough to make her suffer the heat a bit) and when she complains just shrug and say that it wont kill her and its stupid to not eat them.      Then if she tried to say that thats rude/cruel/mean/whatever to do to her, just bring up how shes being hypocritical cause she did the exact same thing. Thats probably just what I would do though if my roommate was that much of a disrespectful cunt.",False,False

That's really fucked up, for all they knew you could have been allergic to the meat that was in it. But regardless, being a vegan/vegetarian is 100% valid and someone trying to slip you meat because they think it's ""stupid"" is an absolute piece of shit. I'm really sorry that happened to you, this is  something that would seriously fuck me up, too. :(",False,False
