Downside is I have like 4 pairs of fat pants that currently fit out of the 20+ pairs of “real” pants that I own... and the trip is, they’re all a 26 waist. ",False,False

I'm not in the lower-healthy BMI category, so that is my next goal. I really hope I feel fine when I hit around a 19 BMI without wanting to lose more after less than a month there.  I feel almost the same now as I did when I had a 29 BMI and was bingeing everyday. Not quite as bad, but still",False,False

Gained a lot of weight because I just wasn't really able to do anything, but now I still can't do anything because my self-hatred is LOUD and now I'm still a lazy loser who sits around all day... but now I feel fat on top of it. Relapse feels inevitably. I don't even know if I want to fight it. It's extra frustrating because the number say IM NOT FAT. My BMI still isn't even into the normal category. It's wack sista. I'm certain you're not fat though, and neither am I. I think it's just because it's different that it's so uncomfortable. ",False,False

I'm currently wearing a UK 22 (US 26, Europe 50) and I usually wear a UK 10. It's massive. But, I can't see ANYTHING. It helps me ignore the lumps and bumps and wobbly bits. It helps me be more at peace with my appearance when I'm sat down at my desk and all the belly rolls come out to play.
