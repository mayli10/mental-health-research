I relapsed, and I relapsed hard.  Now, I'm doing it for other reasons. While some of it is still driven by a desire to make others stop worrying, it's mostly so I can get myself to college where I'll be free to live however I want.",False,False

Sometimes I am so motivated to “get better” for my daughter and my husband. But when I am confronted with what recovery would actually require? Nope never mind. ,False,False

I know I should have a reason for myself, but I just don't. I just hate hurting the people around me.  Living for other people is an empty sort of feeling, at least right now. I'm also struggling with sabotaging my own recovery which ruins the whole point and agh.   Don't want to go on a rant, just know you're not alone. Hopefully you can find a reason to do this for yourself, or are at least eventually happier with recovered life than you were with living in an eating disorder.",False,False
