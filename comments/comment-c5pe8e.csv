It's very easy for crossed wires when it comes to delicate topics, particularly ones where you're already subconsciously on the defence because of your disorder (in my experience!)",False,False

I know my husband loves me but sometimes he can come across as a little insensitive when talking about bodies or ideals. I know he doesn't mean to but it still hurts, I also take into consideration he's quite direct and bad with words sometimes so perhaps he meant for it to come across as neutral or even complimentary?",False,False

I know when my husband says I’m perfect, I argue. If not then my feelings are hurt. There’s really no right answer with me so these days he’s all “you’re good don’t worry about it! We could both stand to go to the gym but we aren’t models” type of response. Which.. I’m happy with bc it’s true! I’m good but I could always be better. That’s true for literally anyone! :) hope that helps",False,False

My previous boyfriend was literally repulsed by my body and said, “we both have bad bodies, I thought that’s what we were doing here.” As in, we both look like shit so we’re even. I told my current boyfriend and he was pissed. He said my body is “fine” and (I know this is TMI but it’s just to get my point across) “I make love to you and have an erection for hours. If there was an issue, I wouldn’t be into you.” Of all the nice he just said, my brain focused on the word “fine”. It made me cry. In my brain, “fine” was the word that was between “not ok” and “I don’t want to tell you how I really feel.”   ED makes us crazy. Literally. Our brains suffer. I would talk to him. Tell him how this has made you feel. Ask for clarification. Anything. Just don’t focus on what he said as being negative. I think it’s just your ED lying to you. I felt the same way about “fine”. I know the struggle.",False,False
