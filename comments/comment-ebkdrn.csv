This is just the start. We are expecting to receive, based on years past, several dozen more cookies, a full catered meal, cashews, chocolate covered almonds, lots of stuff I’m forgetting???

Something about free food is so fucking stressful when u have an ed. And the sweets which are so bingeable. Im lucky that when we do get a bunch of extra snacks, theyre just there and no one cares if u dont eat them. Maybe u could gift the stuff u dont want to another department. And keep the best looking cookie ☺️",False,False
