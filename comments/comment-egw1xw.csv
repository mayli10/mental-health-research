Sometimes I think she just wears a lot of pushup padded bras, but sometimes when she shows some cleavage, the top of her breasts look perfectly round, like the contours/edge of a breast implant, so I'm not sure. But I really wanna know, coz I'm hanging on the hopes that I'd grow my breasts too when I gain weight like what happened to her. ðŸ˜”",False,False
