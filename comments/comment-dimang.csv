I’ve gained about 6 or 7 lbs and even though I’m still significantly underweight my face is round and I have a double chin. Like if I look down even slightly I have a double chin. I can barely look at myself in the mirror bc of it,False,False

It just so happens my best friend sent me a video of myself from last summer. My face was so round, I could not believe I walked around looking like that,,,,  I have a very defined face now, bc I’ve lost 30 lbs since then. I’d hate to go back to that, seeing that video really made me cringe.",False,False
