I think I cried when I took my measurements and did the math and found out that I was probably officially underweight. (Eventually did get that confirmed when I got weighed by my doctor during a check-up.) Everything else you said is pretty relatable too. Despite being underweight I still feel fat and gross when I look in the mirror sometimes. Sometimes I measure myself and see that even though I seem to have lost weight my measurements have changed by only a fraction of an inch. Although, somebody did recently point out to me that at my size the change I was seeing was about 4% of my waist circumference, so I guess if you think of it that way you might also notice more of a change than you thought there was. And of course, I can also relate to feeling like everybody else is bigger. I went from wearing men's slim-fit jeans like skinny jeans to having size 0 skinny jeans be loose on me and yet I still feel like whenever I see other thin girls that they're still way smaller than me. If that were true they must be spending a lot on custom fitted jeans because a lot of stores don't even go all the way down to size 0, much less smaller sizes. I think it's just body dysmorphia brought about by our insecurities stemming from our EDs.",False,False

I definitely see myself fatter but when I ask other people, some say I look skinnier than the person I refer to, and some say I look malnourished so... yeah, maybe you just can't look at yourself with the same eyes you look at others.
