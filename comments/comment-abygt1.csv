It's going great for me. This is a skill, so there's a way to break it down and work on it safely. Basically set yourself up to win. Here are some examples:    * Buy one protein bar, open it at the start of a long walk with music and no wallet   * Wait until others have eaten the pizza/cake/whatever, so you only get the very last piece   * Eat a piece of chocolate before swimming, or some other activity you do for an hour or so   * Eat a piece of chocolate juuuuuust before brushing teeth and jumping in shower or bath, then going bed, when you're already tired   * Take a small treat to a social event that isn't food-focussed (e.g a hike, obvs not a picnic or potluck), so you're stuck out of the house and away from shops and your one treat has to stay the one treat only   The above examples work for me because I find the 30-60 minutes after eating to be the worst, and then it becomes easier to make good choices again. You'll have different strengths and challenges, so adjust accordingly.   I mean this advice in a harm reduction way. This isn't about avoiding eating! This advice is about eating more ""normally"": eating a variety of foods, feeling safe and confident to eat, and avoiding binging etc.",False,False

Like I keep a few days worth of food in my apartment at the time so that also means dealing with grocery store anxiety several times per week. Its so shitty.  I've seriously considered buying one of those timelock safes for my kitchen. Ik I have enough self control to not break it open but don't wanna drop $50 on it and I have a roommate so don't wanna invite questions. But maybe if/when I live on my own.,False,False
