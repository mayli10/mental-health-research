Had I, I would not have made the comment I did.

BMI isn't everything and can look wildly different so her BMI could be 24 or it could be 21, I have no idea. It should also be noted that I am not gifted at determining BMIs! She very well could have a BMI close to what you guessed. Like I literally have no idea and that was a stupid comment I made that I should not have. I'm sorry",False,False
