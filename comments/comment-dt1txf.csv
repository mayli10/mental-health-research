Even without ED, AYCE is often a pressuring environment for a lot of people, so if you’re worried about standing out, don’t be. I know a lot of non-ED people who’d pick salad over steak for a variety of reasons, and what really matters is that you’re most comfortable and enjoying yourself with your friends. Btw- is this Fogo de Chao? Their salad bar is well known and has so many options!",False,False

I’ve learned that it’s better for everyone if I eat safe foods and look alittle odd at restaurants than if I force myself to eat stuff that feels unsafe and end up getting really upset or even going home and purging alone :(   On the other hand, all you can eat bbq sounds amazing and pretty healthy assuming it’s all fresh cooked meats!!!! I think you should be kind to yourself and get the AYCE if you want to most definitely :)",False,False
