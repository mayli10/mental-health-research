White down what you want to eat and how you’re feeling, you may have some unresolved emotions you need to deal with and will probably start to see a pattern 1.5) Make a plan on how to deal with the issues that come up, start by prioritizing what you need to do first and then break that down into baby steps, make a check list and check things off as you go, it really helps to feel accomplished, no matter how small it’s better than nothing   2) When you’re mid-binge thinking “I don’t want to do this” slow down, just taste and chew and take bites and return your hand down.",False,False
