My partners self esteem just seems to get lower and lower as time goes on.

Orthorexia, for example, might look like a healthy diet on the surface, but it's driven by crippling anxiety and really isn't the same as someone just doing Whole30. A person without an ED might eat healthy but without the same fear and rigidity, aka wouldn't necessarily let themselves starve to death if they were stuck on a desert island with a burger.

Honestly, I was angry we didn't do more on disordered eating because like OP said, it's becoming so normalised.

They put a super obese student into the ED ward along with two other students that visibly had disordered behaviours.  The obese girl was miserable for two weeks straight and felt like everyone was judging her and the thin girls loved it and made friends with girls in the ward. They left basically idolising severely anorexic people for their weightloss and ""determination"". Having students like that on the ward would have done nothing for their recovery.

Fasting for example IS a great way to target autophagy. You can either fast with the intent of autophagy which does not need to be done that often. Maybe a once a month 2-day fast, or a quarterly fast, semi-annually, etc etc etc, any more isn't much necessary. Autophagy starts around 12-16 hours and peaks at 36-48. However, if you're intent is just to restrict due to a disordered mentality, then that isn't fasting. I mean it is, but were you doing it back in 2005 because you did research of the health benefits of cellular restoration? No. Are there people out there actualllyyy doing it for the autophagy? yes. But are there people starving themselves and just saying their fasting, of course.  But i totally agree with you with the fact people may be just disguising their disordered behaviors by hiding behind a current diet, or regime. People need to just stop dieting in general, just eat real food and move your body.. if their goal IS to truly be healthy. Otherwise, like you had said it's just accepted disordered eating that has been mainstreamed for sure.",False,False
