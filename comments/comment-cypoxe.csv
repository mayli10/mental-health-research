It's good to keep people aware, though awareness only does so much. I think the missing piece is, ""I know/now know that this symptom is hurting me, but... I lack self-compassion / I feel I cannot stop / I don't know what to do instead / etc.""   I hope we support each other enough to fill in the missing pieces after providing awareness",False,True
