You're in a state between awakness and sleep. It can be whimsical, but also terrifying. I only had the one experience with it when I was super stressed out from school, but it was really cool at first because I would close my eyes and it was like I could see through then, but there were fun decorations all over my walls when my eyes were closed. Eventually as I started to lean more towards the sleep side of things I got that feeling that I was sinking into my bed, I couldn't move most of my body anymore (*the paralysis part*). I could still move my head, but I couldn't talk. I started seeing hands appearing around me, but they would disappear when I looked directly at them. Once I entered a deeper level of sleep the hands grabbed me and I felt like they were pulling me into my mattress. I wanted to scream but I couldn't. I'm not even somebody who typically screams when scared. I usually moreso panic in silence. I think that speaks to how terrifying it was.  I'm pretty thin myself, but not exactly flat. My boobs are hard to spot when I wear a regular cotton t-shirt (*not like the super thin cotton most women's t-shirts are made of*), but they are noticeable if I put a bra on. Om the same note I shift my legs to make it so one knee is higher/lower than the other that way they don't touch.",False,False

It still happens sometimes, but not as much. I would very often wake up in the morning with one of my arms completely numb. Like, so numb there isn't even that fuzzy feeling. Arm is just floppy and you gotta wait until the blood fills it back up. (*Which is painful*.) The cause of numbness is most often poor circulation. That's why you notice it mostly in your limbs. When numbness is caused by poor circulation it starts at your extremities. Fingers and toes will go numb first, then hands and feet, then arms and legs.   I think when you're severely underweight it's possible for your nerves to become damaged which may also cause numbness, but that's not likely if you're only a little underweight like BMI 16-18. I'm pretty sure I've only heard of that happening to people in the 12-14 range. I think you have to be on the verge of death to cause nerve damage.
