I was such an idiot... I had no idea what was in store for me.

I fully regret it now, obviously, but a year ago, I was stupid and insecure and just wanted to be skinny like my friends... I honestly really hate myself for causing so many problems for myself. I thought it would be as simple as eating less, skipping a few meals, and exercising more, but it has expanded into the mess that I now am...
