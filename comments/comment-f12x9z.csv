Hormones effect hunger emotions and cysts. Psych meds have multiple effects. Regular medication can have side effects all can interact with each other.  Hard to know what is doing what and not end up just blaming yourself thinking wtf ahhhh I'm so hungry and now suddenly your frustrated.  Plus if any medication isn't working for you advocate for yourself asking questions being informed and finding alternatives to try.,False,False

I did see her last week but I don’t think I really explained this issue well enough. I just told her how I am very hungry all the time and gaining weight. She thinks it’s from this birth control I’ve been on for approx 5 or 6 months. But I can’t stop the bc because it has stopped me from having ovarian cysts rupture so far. And that pain is far worse.   I’m definitely not craving certain foods! Everything tastes meh to me. I could whatever. It’s more that I’m just hungry.   I do need to talk to my psychiatrist soon too. She might be able to help.   So it could possibly just be my neurotransmitters or basic metabolic function (I’m not sure what this second one means)? I’m asking so I can do more research and ask my doctor about this.,False,True

I can't imagine there's no drug interactions going on neurologically speaking with this sort of side effect. Conversely this side effect (even if your craving certain types of foods) could point to what neurotransmitter or basic metabolic functioning could be awry with health aside from your psychological diagnosis. More information you have is always best way to approach any type of physician.  In mean time try ice chips. Good old stand by for the munching behavior and can be flavored as desired keep up hydration since medications can often dehydrate leading to misinterpreted hunger cues.,False,False
