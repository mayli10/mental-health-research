Obviously part of me loves feeling small and sexy and I want him to find me beautiful and I know he has even when I was heavier but the way he traces my hip bones and flatter stomach I'm just like well fuck okay I think you wanted this more than I did. Cool!,False,True

When I was my smallest I got SO MUCH ATTENTION and I could tell how much he loved my little waist and my lightness and it makes me want to die. I remember every single detail of where he put his hands and how he touched me when I was tiny and I hate myself for it.,False,False

Trust me I know. But someone who trulys cares about you and wants what‚Äôs best wouldn‚Äôt support self destructive habits (or the results/ ‚Äúprogress‚Äù you‚Äôve made). ED habits are hard and unhealthy. But keep in mind you deserve love and respect and health and happiness, and to not settle for less than that. It‚Äôs hard but keep working towards recovery, you‚Äôre doing great and regardless of how you think or feel, remember that you are a soul and not a body. And you deserve recovery and happiness ‚ù§Ô∏è",False,False
