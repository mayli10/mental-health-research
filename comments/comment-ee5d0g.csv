I mean im short and some blogs are like “if youre restricting under 1200 youre not moving enough!!” But ok like cardio to make any sort of dent takes nearly an hour, and I live in a city where its freezing for half the year. I walk for public transport but its probably less than 1.5 miles total. The sun sets at 4:30 in winter. Im not going outside to run and im too broke for a gym membership atm.",False,False

I have not lost weight at 1,200 to 700 calories, it just don’t want to. Maybe it’s my depression/anxiety meds but even when doing cico it didn’t move. I swear I can only lose if I don’t eat or eat a maximum of 500 cals a day.",False,False

Fucking binge eating disorder. The only thing that’s ever worked for me is BP. Lost 40 lb 2 years ago when I decided I was going to purge everything I ate. Eventually I started having major health scares and knew I needed to stop. Gained 25 lb back, more than half of what I lost. I’m unhappy, no diet works, I still end up purging around once a day, so I’m still probably going to die, fat and miserable.",False,False

But people don’t get it. Not everyone has a gym in their neighborhood or can afford healthy food.

I got overweight from my meds and tried to lose the weight healthy. Through strength training, some cardio and eating healthy food. It got me Orthorexia, fast weight loss and then a big fucking relapse into Bulimia (after nearly 2 years without it).  I hate feeling so weak during training I nearly pass out. I hate not being able to do my usual cardio routine because I'm too weak. But hey, at least I'm the thinnest I've ever been and it feels great to finally have my shit life under control!  So yeah, I love this sub too!!!",False,False
