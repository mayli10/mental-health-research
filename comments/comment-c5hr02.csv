But I like what you say about preparing your body for the future. It's something I've thought about before. I don't want ten years from now me looking back at present me and being angry and sick for being so short sighted",False,False

You have to beat it into your head that being underweight is not healthy. Unfollow all those IG accounts and twitter pages, and follow positive happy accounts. Dogs and shit. For me I followed lots of fitness girls who taught me how to eat healthy, not only for my body but for my mind. They‚Äôre so positive about bodies and weight. But definitely follow recovery accounts. Post it‚Äôs on your wall with quotes. Every little helps!  Think about what a healthy body will allow you to do. For me it‚Äôs children. (I am not pregnant but I‚Äôm already preparing my body for the future children I‚Äôll hopefully have! They deserve it). Think of one or a few goals (not weight related) and fixate on it!  Best of luck. You can do it.",False,True

I'm 7 years ""clean"" but have been really struggling hard the last couple weeks.   You're right, recovery is strange. And I feel so alone with my ED right now.
