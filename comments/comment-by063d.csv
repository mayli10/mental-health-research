I could even eat a binge trigger in the morning and go all day without a single bite but the second the sun goes down I’d binge, even plan it at that point.  I eat all of my calories at night, usually right before bed honestly. That way I’m too tired to binge and it’s typically too late to order my favorite binge food anyway.",False,False

I think it's because I ""save"" my calories for late ""in case I eat a lot,"" and if I eat earlier, I get hungrier. :P Trying to convince myself that eating lunch is normal, but my lizard brain tells me I shouldn't be hungry so early. Lol",False,False
