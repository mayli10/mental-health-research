Full disclosure, I'm not Korean and haven't been to Korea so it's not 100% my place to make judgements about other cultures... but virtually everything I've seen of it has been fucked up. Underweight models for diet ads, promotion of restrictive diets, those korean diet/""dieteu"" videos on youtube, you take one glance at the kpop industry and it just screams ED all over...  I'm just saying that if she lost the weight so quickly, she CERTAINLY did not do it in a healthy way, and thus she will/ has experience(d) the health drawbacks of that kind of restriction. She might have gotten that weight loss rush, but she was likely miserable because of it too... no one is immune  I just wanted to point this out so you don't feel like you need to compare youself to that girl. Changing BMI categories is already a huge accomplishment and nobody else can take that away from you! Losing weight rapidly is honestly very bad for the body physically and psychologically, so there is nothing to feel bad about in your success :)",False,False
