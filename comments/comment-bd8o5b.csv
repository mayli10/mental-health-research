I examined the leggings after reading this comment. The waistline is about 3” smaller than the others (even though the others are S and XS) and they have less elasticity than than a pair of skinny jeans. It made me feel mildly better though some part of me wants to keep them as “goal” leggings.  Not that I can reach that goal any time soon because my job requires I maintain a BMI no lower than 17.5.,False,True

I am certain that you *do* have amazing legs, and the super fucking tight pair of leggings are the ones not to be trusted.  You said it yourself, all of the other leggings were a perfect fit or loose. The leggings that were tight could be marked wrong, or they could have been manufactured shittily.   I have a pair I bought from Amazon. They were a medium, they wouldn't even go over my knees. I felt *awful*. I then read the reviews on Amazon and tons of people had written that the sizing was whack. Like people had bought two smalls and one fit them and one was too big, or that they just didn't even fit their kids.  We hold clothing up like it never lies, but in reality, so many things are mass produced that sizing can be mismatched.   &amp;#x200B;  I hope you're feeling better, regardless &lt;3",False,False
