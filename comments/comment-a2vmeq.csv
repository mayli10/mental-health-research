It's a traumatizing, terrible experience to be forced into, and even if you're ""choosing"" it, it will still have significant impact on your self/ mental health etc. Don't beat yourself up for being aware.",False,False

You are doing more than just trying to get through life. You actually want to do good. I cannot remember the last time I was as seriously committed to helping the world OTHER than to get the approbation and admiration of others. I've never been as selfless as You seem to be. You are a good person. i wish I were more like you, more concerned about my impact on the world.   We all have flaws and weaknesses and Honestly an eating disorder isn't really your fault anyway. It'll be okay. You are too tough on yourself. You wouldn't talk to a friend this way, no matter how privileged she was. ",False,False
