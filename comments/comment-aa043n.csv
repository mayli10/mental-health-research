As someone else also suggested, you should try to tone up by exercising to feel better with yourself. I started strength training with some cardio, which gave me back my thigh gap even though I'm the highest weight I've been.",False,False

I also see a chiropractor which has so helped my posture and the way my chin looks. You dont need to lose any more fat but you may want to overall tone up so you feel better about the way you look. I suggest yoga. It's hard but it builds muscle and has some calming spiritual components like meditation.   And a reality check-- at your bmi there is no way you look fat. It's just not possible. ,False,False
