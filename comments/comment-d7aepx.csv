I'd say you're 100% right, any treatment around binge eating which congratulates you for weight loss should not be used (for anyone). It kinda sounds like you fall into the 'OSFED' category in terms of your behaviours. It's really common for people to cycle through behaviours.  Do you have a treating team? I'd say that would be a start if you don't. Having people specialised in EDs makes a huge difference to your progress and works through some of the underlying issues that come with it and can help you to normalise eating patterns.",False,False

Thanks tho.",False,True
