There are people who are underweight and healthy who don’t have any eating disorders. There are people who are overweight and are perfectly healthy and don’t have any eating disorders. Being overweight isn’t a positive to your health, but it’s not automatically a negative either. It’s a risk factor, but 1) that’s not any of our business, their health is between them and their doctor and 2) it being a risk factor doesn’t mean any given fat person will have whatever illness they’re at risk for.   There are lots of people who are overweight according to their BMI but eat a pretty healthy diet (maybe they just eat more of that healthy food than is strictly necessary) and are still quite active. I know many women who are more active than the average American, eat a pretty damn healthy diet, but are still considered overweight. They may even have an illness or health condition that causes weight gain or makes it harder to maintain a lower weight.   For example, fibromyalgia has been shown in studies recently to potentially cause you to have a slower metabolism, and that’s on top of making it more difficult for you to exercise. There are many hormonal conditions that cause you to gain weight as well. If someone feels like they’re starving at their 150 pound TDEE of 1800 calories due to a hormonal imbalance, I’m not going to judge them for eating more than that and gaining weight.",False,False
