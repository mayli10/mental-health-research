She restricts more before a date or under family stress, which is something I know a lot of people with EDs do. The show did do a good job doing a character with an eating disordering while keeping it realistic and still letting her be a character beyond her disorder.",False,False

(At least until the end of season 4)  It's been memed a lot in the ED communities because every anorexic on Tumblr in 2010 wanted to be Cassie desperately hahaha - but I do agree that she's a very interesting character and Hannah Murray does a wonderful job playing her.,False,False

I think it does a good job of showing the difficulties Cassie goes through with her ED without making her character “the girl with anorexia” or making her storyline just about that. She’s a full character, she’s fun and interesting and also struggling.",False,False
