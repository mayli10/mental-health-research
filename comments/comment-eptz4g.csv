Morally it’s true but like you said, it only matters if you have the looks. How people really feel is:  Bad personality + attractive = not good Bad personality + unattractive = invisible Good personality + unattractive = invisible Good personality + attractive = wow, so amazing.   Because yeah, compared to the person with a bad personality who is attractive, the good personality and attractive person is preferred so in that way personality matters to people. It matters within the confines of physical attraction.",False,False

When I was at my thinnest, I honestly felt so good and was so happy and confident. I actually felt pretty too.

Like one of those Russian anorexia accounts. A girl like bmi 16. And I'm not thin at all. I just feel like everything he says he likes about me is fake. Clearly he'd like me so much more if I was skinny since that's who he likes to look at.  Idk sorry if this is a stupid addition to your post I don't mean to detract. But it's just like... even when I finally find someone who does like my personality. They still have a preference for thin and beautiful women. It's like a thing I just can't escape. I dunno. Sorry for venting on your post it's just a big mood",False,False

Not claiming I’m the hottest person in the universe, but I have been conventionally attractive most of my life and it can get hard too. I do admit that some things are easier, but it’s not a walk in the park either. I am not complaining, just trying to make you feel better so I will list some examples:  • people being intentionally rude to you because they feel threatened (especially same gender) • keeping real friends is hard, most people use you to benefit from your looks • not having any talents acknowledged because people only pay attention to your looks • being mistaken for a bimbo and people acting shocked when you mention your education (oh wow you don’t look like a scientist etc) • often feeling insecure because people look at you in public and you don’t know why  • people thinking they have a right to comment on your romantic choices (stupid cliches such as: your are too good looking for him) • speaking of relationships it’s way harder to keep a committed one, due to jealousy • basing your value on your looks and obsessing with them to a point when a small pimple can ruin your day • not finding your personality until later in life because no one cares really what you have to say  I truly hope this doesn’t come off as entitled in any way, my intention is to make you feel better and show you it isn’t ideal either. And to finish it off I personally prefer a personality and can’t date anyone who is just good looking. If a man sweeps me off my feet with his humour I will choose him over a model any day.",False,False
