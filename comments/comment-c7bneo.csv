I know nothing about how one starts that sort of court proceeding, don't know if you'd need a lawyer, etc. What's your parents' involvement look like right now?",False,False

I don’t know anything about you or your family situation, so all I can do is speak in a general sense. Maybe your parents are actually good parents who want the best for you and are trying their best to make the right choices for you, and it’s just hard for you to see/accept that because of your illness. If that’s the case, they should absolutely remain as involved as possible, even if that’s not what you/your illness wants to hear.  On the other hand, it’s possible that your mom really is in over her head and your dad really doesn’t care, which sucks and I’m really sorry if that is the reality of your situation. People are quick to tell kids (and even adults) that their parents know best and must be listened to, because that’s what people want to believe. Unfortunately, it’s not always true. Some parents are straight up shitty. Some parents mean well but make all the wrong choices. My own parents fall into both of those categories, so I understand what it’s like. Those kinds of parents will do more harm than good in the long run, sadly.  Your treatment team should (hopefully) have a good understanding of your particular situation. Talk to them about your concerns and see what they have to say. Maybe they can help figure out a solution that will be best for everyone involved.",False,False

Sometimes teenagers may think they can take care of themselves, but this is usually not true.",False,False
