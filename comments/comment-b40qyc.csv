I am so determined not to let it happen when I visit over spring break. I also do not have the money to be spending on restaurants which you would think would deter us from going out but then he offers to pay and I feel bad wasting his money by not eating.   Do you go grocery shopping with him? I'm staying for a week and have already planned out the fruit I will eat for breakfast and some safe lunches. One thing that really helps is taking home leftovers or splitting dinner the night before to eat for brunch the next day.,False,False

Except I'm going to visit my best friends in a week and I'm shitting bricks. They love to eat and were already talking about hitting up 5 guys and other greasy restaurants.  I purge nearly anything I eat and I'm dreading the disgusting feeling I'm going to get from not being able to purge and having a full, bloated belly. *gags* worst part is I'm going to be there for three whole days. I'm thinking of pretending to be sick for two of them just I dont have to eat much. May God be with us. ",False,False
