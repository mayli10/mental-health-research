I just ate peanut butter and bananas too.   I wouldn't do that for long because it drove me to move. So don't do that. Less than a week tops? Wishing you well. I hated being in that situation.,False,False

Take electrolytes.  I'm happy to explain more, but briefly, you want magnesium (pills), sodium (table salt), and potassium (NoSalt/NuSalt/low-sodium salt, etc.)   2. You might have digestive trouble from the fiber, high protein, and artificial sweeteners.   3. Lenny and Larry cookies have a lot of sugar.   4. You'll definitely want other vitamins and minerals.  Bare minimum, take a multivitamin.   5. The soda and the sugar from the cookies will both destroy your teeth.  Use sensitive toothpaste and a soft-bristled brush regularly, but not too often.  I also like to use mouthwash or plain water to rinse after eating tooth-eroding foods.",False,False

Heads up, it will destroy your digestive system for the period of time you‚Äôre doing it. Cramps, nausea, constipation followed by diarrhoea, general feeling of shitness.   Also protein bars are calorically dense and not very satisfying. I get fewer calories from a big bowl of raw veggies and feel full for much longer.",False,False
