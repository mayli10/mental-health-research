It was great, I was so healthy for years. Unfortunately  the trauma that caused me to develop an ED caused me to abuse drugs and develop severe panic disorder, so I ended up gaining a lot of weight. Now I'm borderline obese and I've relapsed from even more trauma.",False,False

There‚Äôs also this part of me that just wants people to worry a tiny bit. I‚Äôve been overweight so long that no one would expect me to ever be too thin. I love food too much/hate exercise/can‚Äôt stop overeating etc etc. My mum always used to joke that at least she didn‚Äôt have to worry about me having anorexia.   Just wait bitches.,False,False
