This is literally me, I'll stay in bed all day burning no calories because I'm depressed and know that leaving my house and entering into the real world will mean encounters with food that I don't want to deal with.

Wake up next morning, feel shit about overeating the night before so I lie in bed all day depressed and repeat the cycle. cool cool awesome.",False,False
