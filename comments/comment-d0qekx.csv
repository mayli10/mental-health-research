Because my legs are super long, and I lose weight off them very easily, which gives me a skinny, model-like figure.  My sister is my height but she looks much larger overall because she is obese. So people see me as this cute, dainty, skinny girl. Being tall gives you both the cute and model proportions IMO",False,False

Bending at the waist and placing my palms flat on the floor bends me perfectly in half. Like I'm exactly half and half which is super fucking awkward because it means long arms, long legs and a long ass torso. Bruises are such a constant lol. Pair casper white skin with excessive clumsiness and I literally look abused. Like, my ob took me aside to ask if I was having ""domestic difficulties"" when I was pregnant with my daughter. Had to tell him nope, just incapable of being coordinated and not injuring myselfü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è.  My mom is 5'1 and wears a 5üòÇ no sharing here! I'll have to check them out. Tbh, I LOVE DCs and Van's (I think the width offsets the length + sooooo fucking comfortable!!), but now that I'm 'older', I always feel like I've 'outgrown' that shoe phase, if that makes sense? Adore chucks too, even though they kinda exaggerate the foot size. I just love the aesthetic of them.  I obviously never outgrew my emo/punk phase from my preteen/teen years üôà. I have zero idea how to dress as an adult lol. Entire wardrobe consists of leggings, Bermuda shorts, boho ish tanks and graphic tees.

Yeah.....I knew from a young age that I wasn't coordinated enough for sports lol.
