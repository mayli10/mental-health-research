Gain a lot, it visually shows you can lose it just as quickly - lose a lot, and you might regain it just as quickly if you stop caring.  While this is absolutely true to real life, it doesn't help my mental state. It's more like... Why bother? Nothing I do has any real impact. I'm not obese, but I can't be skinny either. It requires a mountain of effort and willpower that I currently don't have. So I log my weight for archiving purposes, but I can't use it as motivation.",False,False
