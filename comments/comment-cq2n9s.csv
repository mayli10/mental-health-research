I bet watching some documentaries and hearing/reading some testimonies from sufferers might be good education for him.",False,False

""How is that helping you reach your goals"" like oh hurr de durr I didn't realize you were the arbiter of my goals! Thanks for keeping track of that for me!  Anyhow, I know how hard it is to disentangle from a long-term relationship, and I know that a relationship doesn't end over one day of being a jerk. But friend, you deserve better than your partner acting like a smug asshole. Let me know if you need me to fight him",False,False

Lemme tell you, if my husband spoke like that to me I'd have lost it and it wouldn't have been pretty. (fun side note, we just passed our 8 year dating anniv and 8 years married is coming up in December!) In that time, mine has said some stupid shit that ends with an argument, then a talk, then an understanding. Some of it fairly hurtful, especially when he's being thoughtless (or drunk. But I'm equally guilty of that one, because if I'm struck I strike back harder). I won't be the one to say ""leave him, he's an asshole"". Even though, yep, that was a dick thing to say. There needs to be a discussion about what was said, why it was wrong, and how you'd prefer him to handle the situation in the future. I.E., if he can't say something supportive, not saying anything at all. If after that conversation he still feels the need to berate you, then it's time to look for away out, because it shows he's not willing to change.  Either way, that's shitty, and I'm sorry :(",False,False

Tell him your true feelings, and how he hurts yours, and what you would appreciate he do instead. I hope this can be resolved!",False,False
