I think 00s fashion was a huge status symbol -  not for wealth, but for weight.  To pull off the slinky and silky asymmetrical tops and dresses, pleated mini skirts, layered camis and polos, low as fuck rise jeans... You had to be T H I N.   They were hideous on everyone, but they were insanely unflattering if you were anything but tall and thin. ",False,False
edpnche,t3_aegkra,t3_aegkra,ehloveeash,1,2019-01-10 08:13:42,/r/EDAnonymous/comments/aegkra/mean_girls/edpnche/,YES! I have/had thick thighs so trying to pull of some of those mini skirt and low rise jean looks were actually so unflattering on me. Now I know it wasn't my weight but just my Curvy (sigh) body type and the fashions of the early 2000's,False,False

Think Paris Hilton and literally every outfit she wore up until 2010. So seeing those beautiful girls seamlessly pulling off what was fashionable then is what made them 'perfect'. That and great hair. ,False,False
