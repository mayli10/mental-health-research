The whole starvation mode thing. You can't make fat or muscle out of nothing. They must be overfeeding OP if they're gaining that much weight.,False,False

Regardless of what our disorders want us to think, treatment isn‚Äôt some evil made up of people who maliciously want us to gain weight. They‚Äôre focused on getting proper NUTRITION back into the body. Sometimes this means your body overcompensates for a bit because it‚Äôs so scared of being starved again. It‚Äôll even out over time, op!!! But considering you‚Äôre still in treatment, getting fed properly and regularly is still fairly new to your body. Once it learns that it‚Äôs not going to be starved of food again, it‚Äôll trust you and settle at a ‚Äúnormal‚Äù weight (also, studies show that being slightly ‚Äúoverweight‚Äù is WAY healthier than being underweight. Also BMI is a load of bs invented in like the 60s by one guy who wanted to use it to measure entire populations, not individuals). Don‚Äôt go back to restricting, that‚Äôs the worst thing you could do if you want your body to trust you again!",False,False

I understand how you might feel that way since you didn't receive the psychological care you required. It must have been an overall very negative experience to go through this. It could be a good opportunity to learn about healthy weight control methods though. Personally I recommend figuring out how much you need to maintain your weight at your goal weight (*which I would hope is still in the healthy range*) and getting there through a mix of diet and exercise. It's important to eat healthy of course. Restricting doesn't usually allow for a healthy diet. I mean, I personally *can't* eat as much as I need to maintain my weight, so I understand how difficult it is to maintain proper nutrition while restricting.  I basically would have to eat the same thing every single day and my meal plan would include numerous supplements including a meal replacement shake. Even then I never quite meet my full goals. I'm often short on certain minerals and I never get a good ratio of macronutrients because I always end up getting most of my calories through carbs. If you can find a way to eat a normal amount and lose weight that would be best.",False,False

You weren't underweight to begin with so a proper nutritional rehabilitation would involve maintaining your weight rather than forcing you to gain and focusing on getting all of the nutrients you need.,False,False
