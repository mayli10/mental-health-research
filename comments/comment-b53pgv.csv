I think this is a controversial reply but here is why I feel this way. I don't think you wake up and choose not to accept your body. I don't think you choose daily to give into the disordered thoughts and behaviors that eat away at you. You say its for control, but really it is the compulsory act to manage the obsession that you have created with utilizing your weight as a measure of stability/control.  What I do think is that it is unhealthy to give a person an ultimatum that guarantees that they fail. Even in recovery the thoughts are there and its impossible to just stop. So you don't choose, you compromise, you both do the work and go to therapy and make it work or you move on, because its selfish to be in a situation where a person resents you because you cant physically choose (stop) or meet their idea of recovered. Its a lose/lose system and I am sorry this reply is harsh, I just want to speak to my experience and spare you some of the heartache that comes with being forced to choose.  ",False,False

I had lost 25 pounds in the 10 months I had been dating him, but it was a BMI of like 24, and he needed more weight loss from me. I couldn't do it. I knew I would fail, so I left. I think he also couldn't handle my emotional outbursts during my binge episodes and my insecurity, but yeah, he was sick of my failed weight loss attempts the most (binge-starve cycle).  My current boyfriend, while he is a lot more forgiving because he is a recovered bulimic, does kind of expect me to recover one day. He's in no rush, and he has zero expectations for me in terms of weight because he's found me beautiful at both my LW and a weight closer to my HW, but he has said that he thinks it would be difficult to be with me if I gave up wanting to recover forever because he wants children. He thinks (and I do too), that it's not okay to bring children into this world when I'm still struggling so severely with my ED. That being said, he kind of takes on the attitude of, ""Oh, I'm certain she'll recover one day"", so it's not as though he's ever really made me afraid of himself leaving over my ED, but I do kind of wonder, ""What happens if we're 35, and I'm still like this?"" He knows my dream is to be a mom one day, and he also knows that I won't have children unless I'm recovered, so I think he just has a lot of faith in me pulling it off eventually. I have been in receiving treatment for most of our relationship, and I am in a way better place now than I was when he met me, so he just acknowledges that I've been getting better when I previously thought that getting to the place where I am today in recovery was impossible. I think he thinks he can see something I don't see, specifically in me.",False,False

You won’t feel it all the time and sometimes you’ll have doubts and want to quit, but I promise a moment will come where you’ll be ready to reach out for help.
