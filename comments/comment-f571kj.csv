ADH is typically released when someone is dehydrated, but exercise can also stimulate rhe release of ADH causing you to retain water and weigh a little bit more for the time being.",False,False

Naturally you’re the body will shed mass due to lowered KCAL intake and an increased KCAL expenditure but after a sustained period your metabolic rate will slow down as the body tries to protect muscle mass.   Kind of “law of diminishing returns.”  Could be a little bit of water weight too. Drink a 2 Litre bottle of water and stand on a scales. There is no KCALorific value in the water but there is maybe a pound of weight gain.   Hoped this helped.,False,False
