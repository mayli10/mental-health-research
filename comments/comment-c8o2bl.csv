I saw a post on tumblr about how lack of fiber can be to blame for not losing weight, even when restricting. In my very unscientific take away from it, w/o enough fiber your body holds on to what itâ€™s digesting but isnâ€™t pooping it out, which is why thereâ€™s no signs of weight loss.   This is all from a tumblr post and i drink a lot of Dumb Bitch Juice so this might not be at all accurate or scientific, but it could be something to look into if youâ€™re not watching your fiber intake.",False,False

Well a month later and NOPE. So now I feel like Iâ€™m back at square one in trying to lose. ðŸ™ƒ,False,True

I think I somehow broke my body when I went from restricting to recovery to mini-relapses followed by a big relapse.,False,False
