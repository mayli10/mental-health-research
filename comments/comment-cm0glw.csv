TBH as hard as it is there are too many good reasons to come, it's my second time too so at least I kinda know how it works by now. Also it boosts your confidence quite a bit, just knowing how much you can go through.  But you are very right, even waking up 10-15 min earlier just to have time for yourself helps a lot. Self care is crucial in those situations.  PS: you don't sound condescending at all dw ^^",False,False

That makes your life even more turbulent but also inspiring. (I hope that doesnt sound condescending) I'm glad that it's not a permanent thing for you, even so, whenever you have free time please try to practice a little self care!

I'm a J1 student so it's just for the summer (even tho I'm going back to uni straight after that) but it's still so tiring. The money are good for a foreigner but nonetheless I'm aware I'm being taken advantage of in a lot of ways. But if you manage to pull off one summer here you can live independently for 3-4 years back home so. I just wish there was cheaper healthy food (in the USA)  :/",False,False

Or you can be really obnoxious about it and wrap all your food in layers upon layers of saran wrap or aluminum foil, yes, I'm talking about your jars and everything, especially the things that make no sense at all like a jug of milk or a carrot (it'll make it harder for you to get to the food too...) hopefully it will make your family feel like assholes while they unwrap and unwrap in order to steal food that doesn't belong to them.",False,False

Occasionally while home I go to the trouble of buying my safe food + the regular version of whatever food it is (such as, low sugar pb and regular pb) and they will eat my stuff first. Like. My stuff DOES NOT taste as good as yours. It's more expensive. And now all that's left is food that you can eat but I ""cannot""  But it's even trickier because I need low sugar/sugar free options to not trigger a hypoglycemic episode and they will eat my sugar free chemical bullshit before their regular food and then have the audacity to ""call me out"" for buying sugar free",False,False
