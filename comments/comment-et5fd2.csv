It‚Äôll be nice not having to see or speak to anyone for that amount of time. It‚Äôll also be nice to hopefully be able to get some more sleep, because I‚Äôve barely slept all week. My plans (other than sleep) include ignoring my phone, reading, watching a ridiculous amount of TV, playing video games, taking jetpunk quizzes, refilling my bird feeder, organising my kitchen, making cauliflower curry, and there should probably be some cleaning done at some point. But for now, bed.  Despite several horrible binge days, my weight actually went down. Not by much, but that‚Äôs better than the alternative.  I ordered a fuckton of Quest bars (I finally got around to trying the birthday cake one last night...it was so good I could‚Äôve cried) from Amazon and Target. Some were delivered yesterday (along with two kinds of sugar free pudding and salt &amp; vinegar pop chips), and the rest will be delivered today along with low sugar and 100 cal packets of oatmeal. And my Amazon Prime Now order is on the way, full of fruit and veg, skinny pop, tofu, Gardein, a pint of Enlightened Brownie &amp; Cookie Dough ice cream (never tried this brand before so let‚Äôs see how it goes), annnnd a couple of treat items that hopefully won‚Äôt become problems. But mostly, quintessential restriction food. It‚Äôs been years since my grocery hauls have been so obviously...well, disordered.",False,False

Their concert is in August and all I can think about is the outfit I'm going to wear, and how much weight I need to lose so I don't look like shit in pictures, and I also don't want to look fat for this concert I've waited years to go to...üôÅ",False,False

Biggest trigger is being. Weighed.  Alright day today, bombed Spanish final but that doesn‚Äôt really matter I could keep my B in the class if I failed and still get a 4.66 GPA for the semester. Really proud of that. Wonder if Romney or Collins are gonna flip in the house, hope they do. Losing more and more respect for Republicans, it seems that they are not a people with a competing  view of how to make America better, they are supporting a corrupt leaders and make themselves accomplices by doing so.  Best thing that happened to me today was beating my squat record today while working out. . . By 25 lbs to bring it up to a total of 385lbs (or 175kg) no idea why I was so much stronger today but it felt great. Pretty sure I have the 4th highest squat in the school now.
