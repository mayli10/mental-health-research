I know I don't believe I have an eating disorder, bc I am not thin, and just have disordered eating. Or I am just on a weird diet, and the whole world is thin and this is what I have to do to stay even semi normal looking. I also alternatively am pretty sure I have given myself binge eating disorder bc my ""intermittent fasting"" is out of control.   Try to focus less on the labels. The thing is it is distressing you and that is all that really matters. The body can't live on 300 cals a day. 1300 cals is still not enough either. Maybe you can discuss this with your therapist. I know sometimes in my life I have been more into wanting a definitive dx or something to point to, but then other times it's kind of like who cares.",False,False

The physical symptoms can be very significant, but the disorder centers in the mind. An ED can occur at any weight, and can be dangerous at any weight. (Micronutrient deficiencies accumulate, restriction and weight changes can damage cardiac function, serious electrolyte imbalances can happen - not to mention the potential worsening of co-occurring mental health issues, and overall deleterious impacts on quality of life!)   It sounds like you’re experiencing a lot of distress surrounding food/eating. It also sounds like you’re targeting intake levels that can be dangerous for *anyone*. That’s real. That’s significant. You don’t have to wait until X time from now when you reach a physical crisis for the struggle to suddenly become real. It’s real right now, and you deserve help and guidance and support right now to get out of that place of suffering. &lt;3",False,False
