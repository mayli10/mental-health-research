You're doing this for no reason you dont have to continue but i do. And then i get to that point of no return where I'm eating to purge I dont get :/  This makes me sound even more insane but i just need to see what i look like during a b/p so I can physically see how crazy and ridiculous I look. Ah, its just all so ??? Some periods of time im perfectly okay almost passing as someone who can eat normally...and then...",False,True

Every time I binge, I'm not just filled with food but with desperation. Heart starts pounding in my chest, you walk to the bathroom even though you just want to run there, three fingers, snot or miserableness dropping out... Yeah, why do we do this? I wish I had some advice to give. I'm sorry that you're going through this too. It can feel like a real mess sometimes. Hopefully we find a way out of it",False,False
