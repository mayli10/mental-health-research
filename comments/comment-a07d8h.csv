I feel the same way. Even when I was wasted, it was a chore. And sober? I don’t even want to think about it.   I’m doing the same. I just want a cuddle or a kiss here or there but if I have to have sex to get that, I’d rather not right now, I think. Best of luck to you as you get through this 💕",False,True

That's amazing and you rock!) has probably done funky things to your body chemistry, so I wouldn't be surprised if it played a part as well.
