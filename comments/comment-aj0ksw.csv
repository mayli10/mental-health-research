And all I wanna do is kick and scream and fight because ""I haven't spend enough time below my goal weight!"" or ""If I could've lost just .6 more pounds I would be at a flat 85, and *then* I could've recovered with no problem because I made another goal and I would be at peace with my weight!""  and it never ends!  Our minds lie to us so much.  There is no ""deserving"" of recovery, and no matter how you frame it, recovery, especially physical recovery, is painful and shitty and makes me feel like such a failure.  Because now that I've seen my potential, and my ""skill"", and how low I can make my weight go, seeing myself gain weight and seeing the number go back up feels like a total failure.  The only way to mitigate some of the pain is to remember that low weight and small numbers shouldn't be the goal, it shouldn't be something to strive for and it isn't good, it doesn't mean you're winning.  Recovering means you're winning.  And that type of mindset is so hard to adopt when 90% of your thoughts and energy have been occupied by ""lose as much weight as possible, because that's good!""  That's what irks me about some eating disorder forums and sites, when people cite weight loss as a victory, but weight loss itself for the sake of loosing weight and getting smaller shouldn't be a victory!    This is kind of rambly and all over the place, but I guess my point is: I feel you.  There is no point at which you will ever feel ""okay"" to recover, especially once you're this deep into the disease.  There is no switch that will flip in your head once you reach a certain weight, and there is no feeling of freedom and relief once you get down to that """"""final"""""" goal weight.  You have to force yourself, to the point where it almost feels like torture, to recover.  Take the energy you've spend kicking and screaming and fighting against the idea of recovery and turn it around onto your eating disorder.  Get pissed at it for doing this to you.  Separate it from your identity.  Wrench your disordered habits from you (metaphorically) cold, dead hands if you have to.  God this sucks, but there is no end in sight if we don't start recovery.  It gets worse before it gets better, as disgusting cliche as that sounds.  I believe in you!!!  And I'm so glad you have people to help you.  Soon, control will be returned you you (and hopefully me too!)  And hopefully soon, you will feel better both mentally and physically.  As much as it sucks, I'm so happy to know that you're recovering.  Maybe because it makes me feel less alone in my situation, or maybe because it reminds me that I (and you too) am never fucked up beyond the point of no return.  You got this &lt;3  I am sending so much love and support your way through this computer screen!",False,False
