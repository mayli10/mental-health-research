I didnt mean to come off snappy or anything btw!  talking abt eds with others is always a slippery slope of what to say and what not to say anyway ,False,True

I wrote this post when moody and upset though, and while it is how i feel sometimes I don't fault her for trying to just come up w something (we text when we talk about it just adding that for the zone out part lol!)

I think it might be bc she deal with it as well that she assumes it's good advice but even though I've explained to her my loss of control during a binge, I don't think she gets the severity of it. I'll probably try to explain to her how it makes me feel seriously if she ever says it again. She also explains her binges as just wanting to eat more food than necessary but idk during mine i get past this threshold to where it isnt about eating food and I think that's why she gives me that advice bc it helps her.

One time someone acted as if my problems would go away if I ate more fruits and vegetables because “omg I find I feel soo much better when I’m eating fruits and vegetables”—well, I guess you *do*, but they don’t solve the root of your issues, hmm?!  Maybe you could tell your friend it’s a very personal/private topic and you don’t want her to mention any suggestions, just give you sympathy—and that sometimes they have the unintended effect of making you feel worse.  just because someone gave you a suggestion doesn’t mean it’s a very well thought out one. they might just be trying to say *something*, *anything* to feel like they’re contributing to the conversation?",False,False
