People not wanting to eat when I want to eat makes me feel like the biggest failure on the planet. It doesn't matter how casual I try to be about it, if I offhandedly ask my partner if they want anything and they go ""nah not really"" I feel disgusting and about ready to cry. It's such a stupid reaction but I can't help it, only what I do afterwards.  I low-restricted for the past couple of days and was thinking maybe I finally deserved real food, a proper filling meal, when a friend of mine casually mentions they literally hadn't eaten for the past two days (can account for every bite) and broke their unintentional fast with one small meal of potatoes and then stopped, even though they were still hungry. Like yeah I know that's lowkey disordered too but PHEW it made me feel like a total loser for struggling when I'd been eating more than them.",False,False

Junk food king. His whole family, sisters, dad, mom were all tiny and ate whatever. I had a hard time weighing the same or more than him and that was twelve years ago. I wish I was as fat now as I thought I was then.  Sorry you are struggling with this! I don‚Äôt have any advice except I can commiserate.",False,False

He just never feels hungry and if he gets hungry from working out, he's still only breaking even from the calories burned.   I think I'm just jealous and wish I had his eating habits haha   But you and Bomby57 are right, he probably doesn't actually think I'm disgusting.",False,True

Now he weighs 155 which is way better for his height, but I am just slightly less despite being 7 inches shorter than him. And if I wasn't mostly in charge of the meal prepping that we do, he'd just go back to eating not enough to gain or maintain his weight. I just find it so frustrating that he gets upset with me if I seem like I am going down the restricting path, but he doesn't think there's anything wrong with his behaviour because it is unintentional. It's just like on Supersize vs Superskinny - where the super skinny ones are super self-righteous (he's not self-righteous, but just for comparison) and act superior to the fat people because being skinny is ideal so if you drink 4L of coke a day for sustenance, who cares, at least you're not 300lb.   I need to go back to therapy haha",False,True
