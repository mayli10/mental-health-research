You could look into an Exchange system! It's not only for EDs--i believe diebetics also can use them. I know Renfrew has a standardized one someone put online. It basically gives you portion sizes (like 1 oz of meat is one protein exchange) and then lets you build your plan within those guidelines (like 2-3 protein exchanges, 2 grains, 1 fat, 1 dairy, 1 fruit/veg being a meal)  . As someone triggered by calories, following the Exchange system helped pull me out of some dark times, but I also was directly overseen by a dietician so ymmv.",False,False
