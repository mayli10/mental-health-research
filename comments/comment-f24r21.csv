Though I don't mind maintaining if the alternative is losing weight and being sectioned, but I don't think that's likely unless I became medically unstable or my BMI went below 13. If he makes me maintaining my weight or gaining weight a precondition for staying on antidepressants he can go fuck himself. That's coercive as fuck.

I would strongly consider requesting a new psychiatrist as it doesn't sound like the relationship with this one is going to improve much.

He did say I could request a new consultant psychiatrist if I wanted, but idk if trying to get a new one is even worth it. He'll still probably insist on seeing me weekly until he's replaced by the new psych?

I completely completely understand why you're so pissed, I would be too, but if possible try and avoid cold turkey purely for your own sake.

I mean I was thinking there's no way I'd be sectioned at my BMI, especially when I'm not even medically unstable, given how stretched services are. I just think he doesn't want me losing more weight because he knows it's probably going to take a while before the regional eating disorder service will be able to see me, because of waiting lists. I can't not attend the weekly appointments because my mum will force me to go, but I could refuse to let him weigh me, right? He can't just section me for refusing to be weighed when my BMI is only 15 and I'm medically stable.   And I think he said it's not safe to keep me on Sertraline as my weight drops or ""antidepressants won't be effective if you lose more weight"", or something. I think that's bullshit, and if he tries to taper me off them, I'm going to stop cold turkey to spite him, and refuse to see him again. Stopping cold turkey probably wouldn't be very pleasant for me, but I guess that's the point.

As someone who was also on 50mg of sertraline it's defo worth tapering to 25mg instead of stopping cold turkey.
