My scale at home is dodgy and made worse because I don't have a properly flat surface to put it on. The only accurate scale is in the gym changing rooms. 1) I refuse to weigh myself in front of people 2) it wouldn't even be accurate because of clothes and 3) it's a paid scale and I refuse to pay to be told that I'm fat.,False,False
