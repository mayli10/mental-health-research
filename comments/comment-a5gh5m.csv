The sequence for me was as follows:  &amp;#x200B;  * Force-feeding for \~2 weeks during which I felt like I was stuffing myself even though I wasn't eating very much. Hunger hormones were still largely dormant, didn't feel significantly hungry. During this time I actually became convinced I wasn't going to experience the extreme hunger I had read about. * Wrong. It started happening and I knew it right away because there is no hunger I've ever experienced in my life that comes close. The extreme hunger came in 2-3 day cycles ""on"", with 1-2 ""normal"" days ""off"" for a few weeks. I am an active 6' 1"" male and on normal days I would eat about 2500 calories and on extreme hunger days I would eat 4000-5000, following my hunger cues. This was miserable as you are basically living out your worst nightmare, listening to your body, eating a lot, and intentionally gaining fat. This lasted about a month. * Every time I had a relatively large meal (almost always dinner) during the extreme hunger phase, I would enter a hypermetabolic state. Now when I say ""large"", again it is relative to how I felt at the time. The only trigger for it was when I ate what felt like a ""large"" amount of food, ie, I felt properly full after eating. When you first enter recovery, your digestion is still extremely slow and your capacity for food is almost non-existent. The first time I entered a hypermetabolic state was after a 600 kcal dinner. The last time I entered that state, it took over 1500 to elicit the same response. * My typical evening dealing with the hypermetabolic state consisted of eating a large dinner, going to bed feeling cold, then waking up after about 4-5 hours with my heart racing, drenched in sweat, ridiculously hot no matter the temperature in the room, or whether I had covers on or not. Usually I would get up, go to the bathroom, drink a bunch of water to replenish the fluids, turn my fan on, and fall back asleep. Two hours later I would wake up freezing, now covered in cold sweat of course, and turn my fan off and put my (probably still damp) covers back on and contemplate my life decisions. * The extreme hunger went away after a few weeks, but I kept experiencing the hypermetabolic state for months at random. It happened during a party once which was pretty embarrassing. Luckily it was a pool party, so when the sweat started literally pouring off of me, I just tossed my trunks on and hopped in the pool. * Fat and bloating: You will experience both a disproportionate amount of both bloating AND fat gain specifically in your abdominal area. I personally experienced noticeable body fat overshoot. This is well studied. Here is one such study: [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4179194/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4179194/) My experience was that the trunk adiposity (belly fat) came and went fairly quickly in the grand scheme of things. I gained about 16 pounds in a month, and then my weight suddenly flatlined hard for a few weeks despite feeling like I was continuing to eat quite a lot. My hunger cues also normalized significantly and I felt significantly less hungry than at any other period in my life. My body fat percentage, which peaked around the end of the extreme hunger, decreased overall, and the fat in my abdomen redistributed itself over my body over the course of about another three weeks, during which I suddenly started to look a lot more ""normal"" and many were commenting on my improved appearance along with improvements in skin, hair, color restoration in my face, etc. * The bloating took longer to go away, because my digestive system was very, very slow for a very long time. It still isn't completely normal, and I still have days where I get ridiculously bloated or don't poop for 2-3 days in a row because my digestion is just slow, or because I'm restricting which at this point automatically slows my digestion.  A special note on fat gain: **Fat gain is the most critical element of recovery**. It has been shown over and over that you must avoid the temptation to restrict during recovery, because doing so actually results in more body fat overshoot than if you listen to your body and help it put the body fat it is looking for back on in a reasonable amount of time. Your metabolism will not recover until you have put on the amount of body fat your body is looking for, which for some people involves gaining quite a lot... going up 5+ on the BMI scale is not uncommon. Take in plenty of all three macronutrients, proteins, fats, and carbs, take a multivitamin, and drink plenty of almond/cashew/dairy milk to keep the calcium you need coming in. Keep in mind, the fat you put on during recovery is temporary. It is called ""body fat overshoot"" for a reason. My experience was that I actually look and measure leaner in some areas of my body post-recovery than I did during some parts of my eating disorder, because when you are in an eating disorder and habitually restricting, your metabolism slows down and your body rewires everything to store fat as efficiently as possible. The goal during recovery is to put body fat back on to signal to your body that the starvation is over and it can switch back to being inefficient. When you are carrying a normal amount of body fat and your metabolism is recovered, you will notice that acute overfeeding will no longer cause noticeable bloating and fat gain that sticks around for a long time.",False,False

(you have hypermetabolim, but that's rare, and also generic disorders but again, rare).  We are all descended from survivors of famine. We have the ability to deal with food scarcity and recover. Think of metabolism more as 'metabolic demand'. Just because you starved on the past it doesn't mean your metabolic demand is lower (relative to weight, height and activity level).  The effects of restriction are many but few of them result in lower metabolic demand. You may burn slightly fewer calories due to the following, as a result of restriction : - slower healing -slower cell turn over -more likely to rest for longer -slower hair and nail growth -lack of muscle growth following exercise  But the reduction is not really that significant.  The other effects of restriction are : -hyper vigilant for food sources (you can spot or smell food a mile off lol) -increased cravings for calorie dense food ",False,False
