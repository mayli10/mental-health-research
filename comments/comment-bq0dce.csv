My husband seems to vacillate between telling me he's afraid my heart will stop in my sleep and acting like there's Nothing Weird Going On, even when I was b/ping for like twelve hours a day. It makes me feel incredibly silly and fat and unworthy of help in any way. Im close to getting into the 13s and it just makes me feel like I need to get at least to BMI 11 or something for him to ""care"" in a way that validates my ED, if that makes sense at all? Like to consistently act like I am not okay? Because as it is I feel like a faker who doesnt even have a real ED. But people have a really hard time knowing what to do or what to say when it comes to a loved one with an ED, you know? There's really no right answer because the way we tend to interpret the most innocent of things is like capital F fucked anyway, and the tension of seeing somebody suffering and feeling helpless about it is real as fuck. It bears thinking about when you feel like this, because it doesn't mean that nobody's noticed or that nobody's worried-- they might in fact be very scared for you and not know how to approach the problem.",False,False
