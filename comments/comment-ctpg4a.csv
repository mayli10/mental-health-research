EDs can really fuck with people's thinking and I wouldnt be surprised if some wouldn't simply wish to have this disease after reading about it  So many people here are suffering through high restriction and overexercise and make themselves physically sick to achieve weight loss or UGWs, hearing about how it is uncontrollable for you could be seriously triggering for some.   If I read an AMA like that, despite how fucked it is, at my worst my ED brain would whisper ""see? It's so easy for them. Why can't you do it? I guess you just want to be fat""  Though maybe it would help some that are already underweight to share any hardships of being underweight?   Idk maybe just ignore me sorry",False,False

I've deleted and will not bother you anymore.  I asked just out of a desire to share experiences that may  help others here, as you all generously sharing your stories has helped me in some way, even though we come from very different places.",False,False

Exactly the kind of feedback I wanted; thank you.  Sorry if my inquiry caused any issues for you.,False,False

You're talking to a community who will inevitably be very jealous of you (regardless of the rationality of that jealousy) and that could be ugly. Flexing on anorexics and disordered eaters might not be a good idea",False,False
