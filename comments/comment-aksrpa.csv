Keep your hopeful and positive mindset.  I do have a lot of interests and hobbies but I find it difficult to really enjoy them due to mental illness as well. Some days, everything feels like a chore, but there are the occasional, yet infrequent, days where I feel sparks of inspiration and remember why I started doing them in the first place.   Mine include:  Music- I play flute, violin, oboe, clarinet, and I sing. Yes, I was and still am a huge band geek.  Writing and planning Utopias- trying to think of solutions to complicated world problems if I were the one completely in charge of everything   Dancing- ballet, belly dance, ballroom  Researching- It is part of my job, but I like writing papers that no one will probably ever see on subjects that interest me  Reading- I love all the classics, sci-fi, and also some very embarrassing fanfics   Art- any kind, really, but oil painting and sketching are my favourites  Horseback riding- it’s great, but I cannot do this one often because it is expensive af  Competing in trivia competitions- it is always a hit or miss. The brain fog creeps in a lot of the time, but I am pretty good at trivia because I collect a lot of information on certain topics   Hiking- I love finding places with lots of lush greenery   Cooking- Yep, I’m pretty good at cooking. It has actually been extremely therapeutic for my ED! It is also a great way to fool people into thinking that I am a lot more mentally stable than I really am  Embroidery- I am only just getting into this and have a lot to improve upon, but I would love to add intricate little details to clothes, towels, pillowcases, etc.   As I said before though, mental health problems prevent me from doing a lot of these often or I just don’t feel as satisfied while doing them as much as I feel like I should be. It is incredibly frustrating, but I hold on to the hope that I will feel truly passionate again someday.",False,False
