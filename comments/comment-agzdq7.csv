I'm small now but I feel like if I become even smaller people will like me more.   It's not true. I've been smaller. It creeped people out. I got stares and whispers. I've seen photos of me from then and I look like a dressed up skeleton. I had so much confidence because I was so skinny but I was wrong. I didn't look good. But I want to go back there for myself because I don't care what other people think now.  But it's not the case that just being tiny will make everything better. I wish it was just that easy.,False,False
