I sincerely hope you‚Äôre doing well right now.  You seem like such a great person, and I find it sad that we‚Äôre going through similar struggles with self-hatred. I agree that I wouldn‚Äôt want anyone else to go through that kind of mental pain. Brains can be such piles of shit sometimes, built for survival, yet sometimes being the same thing that brings you to your end.  It‚Äôs very tempting to come out, since I live in a part of the world where it‚Äôs legal to love whoever you want to, and being trans is just as legal. As more time passes I find it increasingly harder to stay closeted, since it feels like I‚Äôm living a fake life at the moment. But it‚Äôs just so scary, opening up and telling the world something so personal, something people might think makes me some sort of freak. I‚Äôm going to assume you might understand that particular struggle too, judging by your username. I‚Äôm seeing a psychiatrist about it and other things, but it‚Äôs been a few months since the last sesh. I have an appointment booked next month, so I think I‚Äôll talk about that then, and a few other things. Even bring it up myself, for once.  I want to say thank you, for taking your time to write a response to my barely legible comment above. I wish the same for you, bro. You deserve a happy life full of unconditional love, where things work out in the end. I sincerely hope you recover from this disorder one day, too. Going from despising yourself to liking yourself can be an impossible task, so therefore I hope you can learn to be neutral to yourself in the future. To look in the mirror, to recognize yourself, and to think ‚ÄòThis is me, and I‚Äôm okay with that.‚Äô  Have a lovely day OP. üíõ",False,False

Was self-conscious about it, but didn't really give a shit about it until some kid in my class called me fat when i was like nine. It was a wake up call, to say the least. Went home and cried about it, then decided i would have to stop eating to fix the problem. Refused food for a while, until mom got worried and took me to a dietician. I didn't tell the dietician about why I didn't want any food, and she said to my mom that i was just ""stubborn"". I gave up after a while, because i was a kid and i was tired of feeling hungry all the time. Tried once again when i was like 11, but nothing much came of it.  Around that time, i started to feel shit. A copious amount of shit. I wanted to kill myself, i started feeling anxious about a lot of stuff, and most of all, i fucking despised myself. Cue me taking to self-harm to cope with the anxiety. It went on like that for a while, getting worse and worse. Couldn't swim at age 12/13, so my teacher took me and a few other kids to a pool to teach us. Broke down one day at the pool, starting by laughing uncontrollably until it turned into a big ol sobbing fit. Told my teacher about what's been going on, and felt better about it, until she forced me to tell my parents about it or she would do it herself. Completely broke my trust in her, and then the trust i had in my parents when they did jack shit about it. Can't go into that pool anymore without remembering all that stuff, which sucks because it's right next to my school and I'm failing gym because i can't swim. But oh well lmao.  Since i was 12 i knew that i liked girls along with guys, after a few months of questioning. Never told anybody, because i was afraid people would find me disgusting for liking girls. Still am. A few years later, i wound up beginning to question my gender too, because puberty did shit to my body that i did not want, and i ended up with some gnarly gender dysphoria to top off the shit cake that was my life. It felt wrong to use my birth name, my body felt all wrong, people calling me girly words of affection was starting to annoy me, and i just felt Wrong‚Ñ¢. This discovery led me to feel way more shitty about my body and myself, and after a long time of denial, i somewhat accepted that i was different. And finally, on the 3rd of November 2018, i started counting calories and threw myself headfirst into an eating disorder. I also began cutting, first with some rusty scissors, then with my dear ol dad's box cutter, instead of scratching at my skin as i had been used to doing the previous years.  All of this leads me to today, where I'm a complete mess. I have a lot of self-hatred, i have some gnarly anxiety, gender dysphoria's kicking me in the ass which won't be resolved until i come out and transition which is pretty hard to do since I'm scared out of my mind of coming out, i have an eating disorder, i picked up some cool phobia of bugs along the way which sometimes keeps me up at night, i have a streak of being a minor hypochondriac, i self-harm, i literally can't talk to new people neither online or irl, i feel like a big ol fake, and most importantly, i feel like a waste of space and I'm seriously debating whether to kill myself or not. But that's just life lmao.  (sorry for the wall of text, i have a habit of overdoing things because i fear people won't Get It‚Ñ¢.)  Have a wonderful day, OP. I hope you find peace with yourself one day.",False,False

I came from a tumultuous, garbage childhood of trauma, abuse, and neglect, taken at 10 and adopted at 13. That's the shortest version I can tell, really. Food was not something I had often but it didn't really seem to impact anything except that I hate waste. I will just as soon eat expired food and shit my brains out for hours than to toss it.  In my mid teens, I was put on a carousel of psych meds that my weight fluctuate like mad. At 16 I already had saggy breasts (was a D cup at 15, now I've got the tits of a grandma at 22) and loose skin, and it didn't help that I was born with mild diastasis recti and large calves. I still ate normally, but I did occasionally feel too disgusted with myself to eat. No one took it seriously. I had a lot of diagnosis.   I got into a relationship with a sociopath at 18 and moved to a state I'd never been to with him. He'd beat me, forcefully drug me, cheat on me, it goes on and those details don't really matter in this. He was awful. He'd insist that 80 lbs was healthy for someone my size (5'4"", was around 135lbs) and actively shove anorexic fetish porn in my face. He was overweight, because of course he was. I began abusing Adderall and not eating or sleeping for days, walking 20-40 miles a week instead of taking the bus and working a really physically challenging job as a hotel housekeeper. Got down to my lowest weight of 120 and reveled in it. It was the happiest I'd ever been with my body. Looking back, it started here. I didn't realize I had a flat belly back then. All I saw was chub.   Decided to leave, he takes advantage of me sexually before I was able to leave and I come up pregnant and homeless at 20. I'm forced to move back in and carry him to term and put him up for adoption. I come out of it 200 lbs, 160 after birth. My body is destroyed, my diastasis recti is so bad that I want to kill myself. I have cavernous, tender stretch marks everywhere, down to my crotch and up to my ribs and my belly is warped beyond recognition. I begin abusing caffeine and Adderall again after I'm finally able to leave and the next thing you know I'm here with my biological mom and stepdad. I'm at the higher part of normal range weight wise (140) and it refuses to budge, but because of that no one suspects a thing. They see disordered eating, but no disorder because I'm not particularly skinny.   I don't see a lot of people who's disorder started in early adulthood like me, but just know that if that's your case then you're still valid and you're not alone. Skinny or not, young or old, long term sufferer or just started the fight, if you're here you're valid. You don't have to fit the mold.",False,False

Near the end of my second year of college I was running low on meal plan funds and I was really stressed out because I was doing awful in all of my classes and was worried about failing them. I had noticed the little signs around the cafeteria on campus saying that an average person needs 2000-2400 calories a day which was what got me thinking about calories for the first time. I was also feeling self-conscious about not being in shape like I was in highschool. I don't think I weighed any more, but I had more fat compared to muscle than I used to. That's mostly because I started taking an anti-androgen though, so less testosterone meant less muscle. Eventually I thought that if I just ate less I could be less fat and also save money **and** I could take control of one thing in my life while everything else was so hectic.

To me that meant she just didn't care and wanted to get rid of me. Better to keep my secrets.  This transitioned into my adult life and hit all aspects of it. I would say things and it would be ignored or I would get treated like a crazy person. No one stopped to ask me why. No one tried to understand. So I kept my secrets to myself.
