Since it’s with my uni I can’t just drop in and out of the team as I feel, kinda an all or nothing thing I guess. I would likely find another active outlet if I were made to not play anyways. I know that logically I need to eat more and get my BMI up for it to be healthy, but my dumb lizard brain won’t agree.  I’ve been given a week’s “grace period” I suppose and we’re reassessing next week but this has already killed my motivation so much, so honestly I’m not all that hopeful which is sad.",False,True

I totally get it, if I had to stop running I'd probably go insane, but by the sounds of it, if your BMI is that low it probably is really dangerous. I know it's not what you'd wanna hear, but have you considered finding another hobby to take up while you TEMPORARILY stop doing sport? Something you enjoy but perhaps not as life threatening lol. You can always go back to basketball once you're more recovered?  I don't want this to sound like I'm trying to tell you what to do, only you know what's best for yourself. Just stay safe!",False,False
