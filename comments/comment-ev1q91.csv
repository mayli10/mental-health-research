Your hindbrain will melt your self control if you are sane, and you will start having an addiction to starvation (anorexia) if you are prone to DEB.  The issue with that is that you're not failing the diet. The diet is failing you. The difference is important to comprehend.  If your aim is to be a cold, starving, infertile anorexoid, then no, feeling persistently hungry with low energy is not your diet failing you.

You're describing a tree (satiety/energetics regulation) only having in view one branch (the amount of water our metabolic processes can heat up from 15 degrees Celsius to 16 degrees Celsius), and it doesn't make any sense at all. NEAT is a symptom of having enough energy to have a normal quality of life. Spontaneously exercising is a symptom of having enough energy to live normally. Burning 2500 Calories instead of 2000 is a symptom of having 2500 Calories available in your body, whether by eating it. There is some metabolic process that gets stuck when people go on calorie restricted diets that makes their metabolic system only able to find less energy than is actually available, resulting in #HungryButGaining #1200ButGaining #NowImGonnaRestrictEvenHarder. I hypothesise that it has something to do with insulin, glucagon, thyroid, leptin, cholecystokinin and incretins.",False,False
