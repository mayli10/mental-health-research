And her all in is just switching from AN/orthorexia to BED. Like her chest day videos she usually eats upwards of 10,000 calories... she obviously needs help and shouldn’t be promoting this stuff to impressionable viewers never mind selling them health and fitness advice.",False,False

I wouldn’t get too invested in this because at the end of the day it’s her personal problem and she hasn’t chosen to share that information with us.,False,False
