I don't eat anything at school and then binge at home all the time and people are starting to get worried that i'm starving myself again (used to do it) but i'm actually not.,False,False

I was once at a ""rich people's"" buffet because someone else paid for me and I was like ""oh I can't eat much because 1. I'll get fat and 2. I have to be polite and show that I'm not a greedy pig who loves food"" so I ate very little even though the food there was the most amazing I've ever tasted and probably ever will, and then I ended up overeating shitty grocery store food just some days later :)))))))))",False,True

I think that eating only when people are watching could potentially be a very good solution for me, because 1. people stop worrying, especially if they know you struggle with food and 2. will eat more or less ""normal"" portions because I can't binge in front of others. But it's always so damn hard to stop myself from eating when I'm alone, ugh ðŸ˜”",False,True

I find I really have to monitor the amount and the pace at which I'm eating food and it just makes me so anxious that I resort to eating small amounts/ things that are really easy to eat so I don't look like a messy goblin when I eat.  &amp;#x200B;  Then I'm by myself and I i n h a l e  e v e r y t h i n g,False,False

They bought a bunch of snack food (aka binge food). So I don't even try to restrict around people I just like can't eat a lot around people even if I want to. They ended up all going to do something without me and I ate an entire family size bag of chips in about 15 minutes while they were gone and hid the bag somewhere in the cabin garage. I'm sure they noticed it was missing but nobody mentioned it to me.,False,False

I don't want to alarm folks so I'll eat massive portions to dissuade their fears I'm relapsing and make up for it in private.

I tend to do my worst eating when no one is around. Like my bf is always saying how I need to eat more but when heâ€™s gone Iâ€™m like inhaling everything in the house.  This week my goal is just eating when others are around since my shame naturally keeps me from eating a ton around others. Then Iâ€™ll skip food when Iâ€™m alone.

I'm the opposite in restrict phases (same time frame). I guess I've been fucked up long enough that I'm jaded on symptoms. They ALL come and go.

Iâ€™m so terrified theyâ€™re going to find out Iâ€™m restricting that whenever I eat out with friends or family I eat a shit ton so theyâ€™ll for sure not think Iâ€™m undereating.
