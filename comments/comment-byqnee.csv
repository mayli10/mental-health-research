When you start to think of them as garbage they don't taste as good anymore. I think that's part of the reason that I genuinely enjoy most vegetables now. I used to only enjoy a few different veggies, particularly carrots, but now I also enjoy things like green peppers, broccoli, spinach, and onions (*although not red onions*). When I used to restrict way down to like 500 calories a day I wasn't really eating anything with much flavour at all. I would eat a lot of instant ramen and Kraft Dinner. I enjoy these foods, but they are rather bland. Eventually when I did start eating more I decided to focus on eating healthy foods. After hardly eating anything for so long pretty much everything tasted amazing to me. I would eat at Subway a lot because I rarely had the energy to actually prepare healthy meals for myself and most of the affordable options for food around where I was living were not healthy options. I was kind of limited. There were also like 5 subways within walking distance of my house. It helped that subs from Subway are so low in calories for the amount of food you get. (*It's not difficult to order a footlong sub under 500 calories.*) So I would go and order whatever the sub of the day was (*usually oven roasted chicken or turkey*) and I would get spinach, cucumber, green peppers,and sometimes tomatoes (*I'm still picky about tomatoes*). I wouldn't even get any dressing on it. Just meat, cheese, and veggies. I really enjoyed how everything tasted on it's own. I used to be the kind of person who wouldn't eat any vegetables if they fell off my sandwich (*I actually hardly ever ate Subway tbh*), but now I eat everything and I love it. I was kind of worried that if I started eating more I would stop enjoying vegetables, but I noticed that the more I ate healthy foods the less I craved junk foods. I used to eat Doritos constantly in high school and in my first two years of college, but I just didn't want them anymore. When I stopped eating sugar I found that most of the sweets I used to enjoy would be too sugary or too rich for me. I found that I started to hate the feeling that sugar leaves in my mouth. It feels like my mouth is coated in a sticky film if I have too much. I did find that as I started working towards recovery and eating more that I was continuing to make healthy choices and that foods I used to love were simply so unappealing to me. I felt gross when I would eat them.   Unfortunately around a year ago as I got to a point where I could bring myself to eat enough to gain weight and return to healthy BMI I also started suffering from a chronic illness. Basically whenever I eat too much food I get sick and I end up in pain. The worse it got the harder it was for me to keep making healthy choices. I found that eating lightweight yet calorie-dense foods helped me get enough calories without getting as sick. Since healthy foods, particularly vegetables, tend to be very filling for very few calories I would have to eat a lot more to even just maintain my weight. I can't eat that volume of food without getting sick though. Over time I ended up replacing all of my healthy choices with things from McDonald's and Taco Bell and I started eating Doritos all the time again. I actually just ate a whole bag of Doritos tonight. I did have a sandwich and a smoothie today, but together they were probably less than 700 calories which of course isn't enough. I wasn't really hungry, but I had to eat more. It's so easy to eat a whole bag though. Back when I eating healthy just the thought of eating like this would make me feel gross, but since I got sick I started associating these foods with feeling better. It's difficult for me to balance getting enough energy and not eating too much food, so these became my safe foods and now I can't really enjoy other foods. Thankfully I haven't started hating the taste of vegetables again, but I just mentally can't convince myself that healthy foods are a worthwhile option anymore. Like, I had Subway not too long ago while I was at my college for an appointment and it was great, but I felt really sick after eating it. I had another appointment last Wednesday and this time I grabbed a slice of pizza instead and I felt so much better than when I had a sub. They were around the same number of calories and the sub was a lot healthier and it tasted better, but the pizza didn't make me sick, so now I'm probably going to keep getting pizza when I'm on campus and get hungry instead. Lately I have been trying to move entirely to smoothies and cut all solid food from my diet, but I'm finding that very difficult because smoothies are pretty dense despite being liquids and I find it so much easier to eat stuff that's barely food than to drink all my calories. I do believe that part of the reason for this is the association in my head that healthy foods makes me sick though, so if I keep trying I'm sure I'll eventually be able to switch.",False,False

Sometimes I'll be planning on eating something and it will be absolutely perfect, just like I imagined. Other times I get it and it's just... nothing like I remembered it being, or it's not as good, or it just loses its appeal after a couple of mouthfuls.  I think it's partially because our memories of how those things taste distorts the longer we go because we think about them more often. Every time you remember something it changes a bit. So like, if I remember something I ate 2 weeks ago, then the next time I eat it, it'll probably be really close to my memory of how it tasted, which will be satisfying. But if the last time I ate it was months or even years ago, then my memory has had time to mutate, even a memory like taste. So when I next taste it, I'm just kind of surprised by the difference in memory and reality, and it's disappointing.  Some foods tho... some foods just always hit right lmao.  Also I've noticed the better side effect of this is that I can start to get cravings for new foods, too. I forced myself not to get takeout from a certain takeout chain here until past \[X\] date because it always led to a binge, but a blanket ""no more of this food EVER"" rule never lasted. At first it was really hard and I would crave it all the time, and I would fixate on the upcoming date, but the longer I went without eating it, the less I wanted it. Even the memory didn't seem as appealing. I was forgetting the taste and texture of eating it and while I'm still looking forward to trying it again, it's not as visceral. Instead, I find myself craving low-cal ice cream or salad or soup because I'm more familiar with those flavours and recalling how they feel/taste to eat comes more readily and so I can anticipate them more.  It's weird, because you're caught between being happy that you no longer find a high-calorie food to be appealing, but it's also sad because you feel like you've lost something. IDK.",False,False
