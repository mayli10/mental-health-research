It must have felt incredibly violating and unsafe. Thank you for sharing with me.   My trauma was from other acts (being shamed, yelled at, not given necessary water, not given meds, and other things too horrible for me to write out). I hope you know you’re not alone.",False,True

There are no real reviews on the building I was in and I will eventually write one with my therapist to warn people. I think a survivors group might be too much for me but I am very comforted knowing that these groups exist. Thank you!,False,True

I can’t relate to the “tubular” parts of this but everything else including the majority of experiences in the comments happened to me. Thank you so much for sharing this with me. It’s good to know I’m not the only one who has been through this.,False,True

You might try searching for negative reviews of treatment centers, or looking into anti-psychiatry/psychiatric survivor's groups if you would like support around this but aren't finding something ED-specific. I know that the psychiatric survivor's organization in my state routinely publishes info on abuse and mistreatment in hospitals, for instance.",False,False

But I've met multiple people who have. You can look online, I'm sure someone will have written about it by now. It seems like such a common experience. Fucked up.",False,False
