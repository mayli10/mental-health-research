I've got one friend who knows and she's super sweet about it, sometimes I think I'm too clingy to her though which probably tires her out. the thing about your world shrinking, it's already quite relatable because I'm already shy and introverted, and quite frankly I don't really have a lot of friends, which is why I'm clingy to people I trust.   I've actually told a teacher about it and have seen the school counseler, honestly it wasn't very comfortable or helpful because I don't really like the idea of spilling my life and mind out to someone I don't know (ironic since I'm on this sub lol). the counseler did try to encourage me to see her but I also felt like the advice she offered wasn't exactly the best - but then again I like to reject any help or care I receive because I don't really feel deserving of it. so yeah, the teacher isn't really doing anything now so I really wonder what the point was in me telling her - I only told her because I'd broken down in school literally twice in two days and my friend wanted me to tell a teacher, I did it because I didn't want my friend to worry and to somehow lesson my burden on her.   but thank you for your kind words, I'll think of them, and maybe one day we can both achieve a healthy mindset.   sending love &lt;3",False,False

I'm only in my mid 20's but that's so far off from early high school. The unfortunate thing about any mental illness is it doesn't just go away as time passes without some form of treatment. It does have its ups and downs of bad years and good years but it's there if a form of help isn't found. And the thing ive noticed with my eating disorder is how much it's shrunk my world. It's made me have a hard time seeing friends, talking to my family, working on my degree now seeking my dream job, finding a relationship. Its all out of the question now because of the space in my life this has overtaken.   I don't want to mom you or talk down to you since that's not why we're here. But I really suggest talking to someone in your life about this who will be accepting and supportive. Your parents, an older sibling or cousin, a good friend, and school counselors can do wonders for being intermediaries with families, especially if you come from a family that might not understand EDs. When you're in school getting help is infinitely better imo. I left high school my senior year for 2 months to go do an inpatient program for depression and I was still able to keep up my grades and didn't lose any friends and went to college the next fall. I'm currently an adult out of school and seeking treatment is hell because I can't leave my job to get help because I can't afford to and can't afford any of the treatment on my crappy work insurance. I'm not saying you should go out and check yourself into a residential facility lmao but therapy and having people in your life you can talk to can make such a difference.   I really hope this didn't read as preachy, but honestly if I had the opportunity to stop this bullshit when I was 14 I'd do anything to have a chance to experience so many things this disorder has taken from me.",False,True
