For once, today I ate two normal sized meals (breakfast and lunch, usually I skip both and only eat dinner) and I had the energy to power through a tough workout. And I was legit surprised that I didn't feel like I was dying the whole time like other days.",False,False

Hell yea, right? #freespirit  Now I'm over here doing this whole breakfast lunch and dinner thing and minding my macros, fussing to make sure my meals are balanced-- for the first time in my life.   It's nice. Following a schedule helps me feel grounded. I'm not sleeping all day anymore and staying inside in my dark room eating a r/shittyfoodporn diet. Normalcy is all I wanted and it took a depressed hippie phase follosed by an eating disorder/need for ""control"" to achieve. If that makes sense. Idk",False,False
