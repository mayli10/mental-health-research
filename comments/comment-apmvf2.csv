But I will say that if you feel that your thoughts or actions related to food/weight/eating are causing you distress, you could probably benefit from talking to a doctor about it.   I'm really sorry you've been struggling and can understand your pain. Whether you have an ED or not, know that you're welcome here and we will be happy to offer support in any way that promotes your health and well-being. ",False,False
