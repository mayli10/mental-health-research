Every small thing we do for the animals &amp; environment helps. :) so we shouldn’t be so hard on ourselves ❤️",False,True

I may do that. :)   It's just hard not to feel guilty, since it is something I feel *so* strongly about. To me? It's the same as going over to my boyfriend, and taking a nibble on his arm. Which.... also just isn't okay, to me. Or shouldn't be okay to most people? lol.   I understand that people can be really hardcore about their veganism, I just hate that it sometimes also causes people to become out of touch with what life may be like for others. :/",False,True

It’s all okay hun. I wouldn’t post to the vegan sub if they’re very black and white and will just make you feel worse—what about the vegetarian sub? There might be a lot of past vegans there and hopefully people will be a little less strict!!,False,False
