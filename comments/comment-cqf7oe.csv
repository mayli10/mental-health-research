My old house had an attic fan and I seriously didn‚Äôt turn the AC on unless it was like 100+ degrees outside. But my BF and I split the bills and he pays the electric, so if he wants to throw money away, that‚Äôs his deal.

I usually won't turn the air on until it's 81/82 in the house, usually around 1230-1ish. But that has more to do with the kids going down for naps and not having fans in their rooms. Even then it's only set to 80 üòÇ. Winter is a bit more difficult and he whines a bit more (cold bothers his knees), but once he's got a couple beers in him he's less cold lol.",False,False

My husband works nights outside all year long so he's used to being in the cold. He doesn't even notice the house is cold till mid November. We have bigger issues in the summer bc he wants the air on and I'm perfectly fine till it hits 95. I just hate the high electric bills.

I absolutely refuse to turn on the heat until it's like 68 in the house. Always tell him if he's that damn cold, put on pants, long sleeves, a jacket, cuddle under blankets, etc. I'll use a little space heater in the common area, mostly for the kids, in the mornings.

I will be miserable all day ( hot or cold depending on the weather) and won't change the thermostat until someone else complains.   I absolutely hate visiting my sister in the summer.

It's ok to acknowledge it that it's objectively easier to exist in the heat when you don't have as much fat to insulate you.
