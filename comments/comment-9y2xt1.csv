Iâ€™ll have a drink or two which dulls my appetite, and play with my cat which makes me feel more like a human and less like a shitty mess. Doing things that can somewhat trigger my pleasure center without involving food are key. Iâ€™ll also make myself have a bunch of tea or broth or jello or fibrous veggies, which kills my urge to binge on more caloric stuff since I feel so full (even if the fullness doesnâ€™t last too long).  I also wake up pretty early (by around 5 am), so iâ€™m very tired in the evenings (and am usually in bed by eleven at the latest lol, except on some weekends). Itâ€™s hard if you donâ€™t have anyone around, but I will say that living with my bf has been a major help in preventing urges to binge, especially in the evenings. If you live alone, calling someone or otherwise reaching out can be a lifesaver.   Wishing you the best ðŸ’•ðŸ’•",False,False
