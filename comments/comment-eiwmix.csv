What he said was definitely a dick thing to say but my original comment was in response to “fuck him he’s a fool” or something along those lines. My point was yes saying that was a poor choice but don’t pity me too much cuz he’s a cool dude too. I’m not defending his behaviour, I’m just saying he has redeeming qualities. And then I have to defend myself against women writing walls of text making sweeping generalizations assumptions telling me how to live my life and calling me immature. No thanks. I think the problem people are having is minding their own business tbh. I hate to say that because I know you’re all coming from a really good place and I appreciate that and I know you’re good people who are struggling just like all of us here, but IMO if you don’t have nothing good to say don’t say nothing at all.",False,True

I mean... You say he's a ""good person"", but then even when you try and minimize his behaviour it still comes off as like... the stereotypical example most people would give for when someone ISN'T a good person? Like, ""He's a good person, he just lashes out to hurt other people based on his own insecurities""? That's really not selfless. Especially since you say it's specifically about women only, which gives off huge incel red flags as well.  I'm not telling you to stop being friends with him or anything, I don't know you or your friendship well enough to know what it's like the majority of the time. Hopefully your friendship IS more helpful than it is hurtful. But... You came here because he hurt you. I don't know what context you showed him this girl under, but given that she's your fitso, it was probably positive, so for him to respond by calling her a ""fatty"" is wildly inappropriate, and if he'd stopped for a second (which selfless people do) he would've imagined that it would hurt you to hear that. There's also a far cry between ""Yeah he's kind of a jerk but I'm still going to be friends with him because he's usually nice *to me*,"" and ""No he's actually extremely good and nice and selfless how dare you criticise him at all in the face of the inappropriate and hurtful thing he said to me"". Like, you can see our confusion, right?  You're right that most people here have irrationally mean thoughts about other people out of jealousy or insecurity... but most of us... also learned not to share that with people it might hurt, usually around childhood/adolesence. Someone who hasn't learned to put their feelings aside for one second to not say that stuff OUT LOUD, never mind working through MRA-adjacent stuff like ""all women should be smaller and weaker than me or they're fatties"", I don't think could really be described as ""selfless"".  Again. Not telling you to cut all contact with him or anything, I think that's a bit extreme. But the way you jump to his defence when your OWN RECOUNT of him/his behaviour makes him look bad is a little weird. Do you have a good support network or is it just him...?  Edit: Also, even if he does have an eating disorder or body dysmorphia, that doesn't make what he did/said okay? It might make it understandable, but not defendable - there are plenty of women here who say similar comments out of their own insecurity and it's still messed up, so your ex doesn't get a pass for maybe potentially having an ED?",False,False

Calling him out on his BS can help him grow as man. Only children say things without thinking about them first. It's perfectly normal to have slip ups where your words come off different than you intended but this is just outright mean and inappropriate to say to anyone.

A good friend of mine said to me once, “everybody is basically a dickhead. You just need to choose the dickheads you’re willing to put up with” life is hard and very few people reach adulthood unscathed.

I'm not excusing people on this forum who do the same thing as your ex from a decade ago.   I feel like you're old enough to know better but really not as mature as you think you are.   Id discard anybody who was rude to a waiter, id discard anybody who made intentionally malicious comments about somebody else's appearance when they're an adult because that shows immaturity and is just negative.

It’s been discussed on this forum many times that we are sometimes guilty of thinking or saying unkind things about other people’s bodies because of our own issues with ourselves. In this situation as far as I have ever witnessed, we react with support and empathy. We discussed the issue further and he said he can see how some people find her attractive/sexy but to him it is a turn off because it triggers those negative emotions about himself.
