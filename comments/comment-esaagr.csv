Most people with bulimia, for example, are normal weight or overweight. True story.   I think you should go to the doctor but be aware that unless they have experience with EDs they may not know much about how to help you (and you should have help). I would recommend seeing a psychiatric provider, ideally one with experience of EDs. If you're in the US, you can find providers on psychologytoday.com.  Or you can tell your regular doctor and ask for a referral to a psychiatric provider.    And remember: you ARE valid. You do have an ED; the only question is which one (which is just a category for psychs to group your symptoms in). Formal diagnosis or not: your problem is real and you shouldn't have to struggle with it alone.",False,False

It IS valid. I really hope you find the strength to get help and I’m rooting for you. And I promise you, nobody in treatment is going to judge you. If they do they are there for the wrong reasons. The best help in trestment was honestly my peers, people who understood me even if our situations weren’t exactly the same. I made lifelong friends in treatment with people of all different sizes. Us Ed sufferers are usually some of the sweetest ❤️",False,False
