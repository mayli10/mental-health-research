I've only talked about ED stuff with people online and never went into depth with professionals.   I'm sorry you lost Cake Day, but the supportiveness between you and your roommates is really special. Hopefully you can make more traditions together ❤",False,False

It's so nice to know you wont be judge but it's also stepping on such delicate matters on how to manage each other illness sometime ? idk",False,False

I told them thinking it’d benefit me trying to recover... all it did was result in intense embarrassment and awkwardness. Not to mention people without ED’s have a hard time empathizing,False,False

Plus the shame/embarrassment of the whole thing. And I don’t want them to try to “teach” me why my behavior doesn’t make sense, I already know!",False,False

I have serious problems opening up, even to my therapist, cause I know how crazy my thoughts are surrounding food to non-ED people, so having some friends to be able to be open with would be awesome. Hence why I love this sub!",False,False

I learned to talk to these girls before I learned to talk to my therapist about it. It is kind of a precarious situation though, because we're all at different stages of recovery. There's still a voice in my head that says ""she's doing better than you/eating cleaner than you"" when in reality that friend may be relapsing, and it's not something I should be envious of at all. But the thing is we're all very openly pro-recovery in regards to each other, regardless of where we are with our own bodies at a given time. Weird how the double standard works with this damn disease.",False,True

I’ve never talked about it, at least the details, with anyone but my therapist (who I’ve just started seeing). I would imagine it could be so relieving, like not having to hide your weird-ass behaviors or attempt to explain why you’re not eating for the x day in a row.   Oops, I got distracted by thinking about how much less stressful this living situation is vs mine. But sorry about Cake Day! ED makes another food tradition bite the dust :)",False,False
