Turns out that sometimes when I'm hungry I start obsessing about food and when I'm going to eat next. When that happens I try to make something healthy to eat. It's been working wonders to prevent binges! So I'm learning to listen to my brain also, not only my stomach. I always thought mind and body were two separate entities but they're more intertwined than we think",False,False

I think that a huge piece in recovery is learning to give your body what it would like, but not in excess amounts (as in a binge). Restoring hunger is a hard piece of recovery but consider a case of “Oh, I haven’t eaten in a couple hours and I’m a little peckish, let me eat a nutritional meal so that my body has all the nutrients it needs”. This mindset will eventually set your body clock back to “normal” (however that looks for you). If you want a little bit of chocolate, have it.   Our bodies are very complex but also beautiful at the same time. I got a reminder on my “I am” app an hour ago and it said “My body is my best friend”. This is a concept I needed to hear- I need to treat my body well, and I challenge you to do the same.",False,False
