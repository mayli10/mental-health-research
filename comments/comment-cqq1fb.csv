But I'm not giving up even though I want to. I'm gonna stay here for two more months and give recovery a go 100%. Toughest decision I've made so far in life.  If it doesn't work out then I'll just relapse. But at least I'm gonna give it my best try.,False,False

But then it got to me a huge binge and I had to urge to purge and my family discovered me and  started to worry after telling me I looked amazing and how I was the skinniest in our family.

I'm trans and that was mostly okay before I transitioned because I was still comparing myself to guys, but when I did eventually transition I started comparing myself to girls and that was it became a problem for me. Lately I have a desire to go down to 100 lbs because I know that even for women under 5 feet tall it's still uncommon to weigh so little. In my mind if I can't be shorter than other women I can at least be smaller in other ways. I can weigh less, have a smaller waist, have smaller thighs, smaller wrists... I'm very lucky as is because of my bone structure and the way I carry fat on my body. At a healthy weight I can already be much smaller than average. Smaller than average isn't good enough though. I want to be the smallest anywhere I go. It's really not healthy that I've clung to this idea for so long. It's been 8 years since I stopped growing. I really should just accept that I'm a little on the tall side. I stopped feeling dysphoric over my height a long time ago, but for some reason this need to be smaller still persists. I'm not really sure why.",False,False

It wasn't until I was back to a healthy weight and felt comfortable talking about my problems with people that anyone started to worry. They don't really seem to care or maybe even notice that I'm losing weight again. My mom made a comment once, but she wasn't even right. She said my clothes were hanging off of me when my shirt actually felt tighter than usual and the pants I was wearing fit the same as always. I wasn't even underweight again at that point. People don't seem to care unless you've already started dying.",False,False
