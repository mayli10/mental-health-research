My main problem is that because all the foods i eat are pretty low cal i eat a lot of them and my portion sizes are much bigger than what would be considered ""normal"" purely because the foods i eat are low cal meaning i can eat more of them. If i were to eat ""normal"" food in ""normal"" portion sizes i can guarantee you i will gain weight (thats honestly not even my ED talking like my logical side thinks that as well)",False,False

I can't go a day without knowing how many calories im eating because i want to be in control of what and how much im eating because if i stop counting and just eat ""normal"" portion sizes i think im just going to pile on the pounds (which is probably true tbh since my idea of a portion size is probably bigger than what it actually is)",False,False

It wasn’t really intentional, I was just completely burned out. I didn’t weigh myself, either. I ended up gaining 3 lbs but after a week of returning to “normal” eating, it started dropping off again.  First, if you start eating more, you will retain a lot more water. If you gain a pound of fat (according to the actual calorie math), it might show up as 2 lbs on the scale, etc. So don’t worry if that happens.  Second, even if you do legitimately gain weight, remember that you can easily lose it again if you want. But more importantly, gaining weight is not a bad thing and it’s okay if it happens. Your body isn’t the enemy, it just wants to survive.",False,False
