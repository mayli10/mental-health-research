You’ve made me feel like this is possible to overcome and I think that’s my biggest barrier at the moment - that everything feels too hard.   I’d love to talk more privately, just tell me if I become too draining because I know you’re on here with your own struggles too. I’d be very happy to be a support for you too if you need it.   Thank you ❤️",False,True

I'm in Australia too and when I was younger I shoplifted - narrowly escaped a criminal record and it was therapy that saved me - it's slowing down, forcing yourself to take a look at yourself. It sounds like you spend so much time feeling out of control and overwhelmed by these urges and that is making things worse - *the less control you have, the less you will get*. This cycle won't end unless you do something, even the tiniest thing that works to break the cycle. Something you wouldn't normally do... literally anything. What you're doing now isn't working so any new thing to try is fair game, like seeing someone about it. It's miserable, it's fucking agony. I get this so hard, I relate to your pain so much. But you've taken a step by writing this post, you've identified the problem - it took me a whole year to get to that point, so you're doing fucking great honestly. No one else can take control except you, and you are stronger than you know - none of this will change overnight but it *WILL* change if you keep making steps, challenging your thoughts and desires consistently. That being said, you're not a degenerate and you're not a bad person. This is mental illness. Not saying you shouldn't take accountability, but this is difficult, painful shit you're going through and self hatred does absolutely no good to anyone in terms of recovery from an ED and addiction. You need to take care of yourself - long term rather than short term gratification. It's impossible to do this alone. Very few people manage to break free of addiction on their own.  Feel free to message if you want to chat more or just need support &lt;3",False,False

You deserve support for what you're struggling with just as much as anyone else here.  Just because other people haven't been brave enough to come out with these issues doesn't mean you're alone in the sub with how much you're struggling. Eating disorders are an addiction, and so is your kleptomania.  It's such a trite thing to say, and I apologize in advance for being so lame, but I'm really proud of you for being able to acknowledge this -- you didn't just get honest with yourself, you got honest with others and reached out for help. That is so, so brave of you, and the first step to trying to change.  They say ""the first step is admitting you have a problem"", but that's not the whole of it. The entirety of the first step, at least to me, is admitting to yourself what the problem is in its entirety. A drug addict may admit they have a problem, but they aren't truly making a step toward change until they admit to themselves that they lie to doctors, blow their savings, steal from family, etc.   There are some very harsh truths in your post, and while I don't know you, I am so beyond proud of your honesty with yourself. Thank you for trusting us with your truth.  People often say this sort of thing as a perfunctory offer, but I mean it: if you want someone to talk to, and don't want to risk doing it out in the open where you're at risk of judgment, please DM me. I promise I will never, ever judge you for this, you have my word.  ❤️",False,False

I’m sorry you’re dealing with all of this, and I wish I had something more helpful to say but please know you’re never alone.

I’m not working because I’m recovering from a suicide attempt in August where I cut my wrists so deep 4 of my fingers don’t really work anymore and my wrists are really weak - previously I worked hospitality where I’m required to perform at least a 3 plate carry and I can’t anymore, among other hospitality tasks like cleaning and pouring drinks.  And I moved out at 17 paying my own bills and working full time but moved back literally just after my attempt and not being able to work.
