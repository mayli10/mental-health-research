I would ask if your medical records will remain confidential in your line of work. An eating disorder is absolutely a mental illness, and it is also the deadliest of all mental illnesses.",False,False

Will they just give me a plan? Like, I understand when and what i'm supposed to eat but I struggle with the appetite to do so and I fall behind or give up. I find I can stimulate appetite with cannabis but that's not really sustainable.  I also need to pass security checks for government related work and i'm incredibly dubious of consenting to be on their lists. I recognise an ED isn't exactly the same as mental illness but it definitely adds to my inhibition towards getting medical help.",False,True
