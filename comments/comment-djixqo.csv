I found getting an adhd diagnosis to be really validating and valuable for that alone. plus, the provider you talk to may be able to help with adhd symptoms without medication if you talk about both and they won’t prescribe.  I absolutely empathize w that feeling of brain and body not working how they should and it’s v rough. I hope you’re able to access some help!",False,False
