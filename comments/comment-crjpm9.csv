The healthiest thing to do for me , is to go on keto mode (I think I have a fairly high fat percentage for my weight and size)  and kick off from the sugar , but to not go on extreme caloric deficits when I don't fast because my body can't handle that. Thank you for the advice!!!",False,True

I don't know your stats. It can be dangerous. If I were you, I would do that. And then fast and later break the fast with something light, like a piece of watermelon or a sip of coconut water.  Stay safe!",False,False

Thank you for the information. I've eaten some high carb foods today because I thought it would make me feel better. Should I actually keep avoiding them so I get the ketoflu once and than get over it and stay in keto mode ?(as a part of a sugar addiction rehab),False,True

I also get sick, don't eat too much after fasting, the longer you don't eat the less you should start with when you eat again. When I do it wrongly, I have stomach aches, headaches and diarrhea (tmi lol).  Hope this helps",False,False

I absolutely want to have a healthier (less expensive) relationship with food , but going completely to the other side of the spectrum and live on nothing but 'good' food, hasn't been really good for me either.

I've been drinking a cup of tea with some Himalayan salt in it (which isn't as horrifically bad tasting as salt and plain water) as that is one of the ingredients of electrolyte refilling juices. But where I live, I haven't found a place where these electrolyte products exist. Perhaps I should buy some online.  Yeah the nausea is really putting me off but I don't want to go back to a Binge  purge cycle. I've taken a rest day , no weighing and counting foods .
