This makes me question everything of my job as a mother. I have to admit to myself that I failed.   I simply cannot accept this is happening to my amazing girl.",False,False

I just think it's important to be aware of how you are responding to them, though. Ask them what you can do to help and what they need.   I'd also like to emphasize we all have different relationships with our parents. My parents were not ever emotionally available, so we never formed a relationship where I felt comfortable going to them for emotional issues.   In the end, I love my mom, I don't like being angry with her,  and felt she deserved some answers to help put her at peace. I wrote her a letter explaining what I need/ don't need from her and what I've been doing to help myself.   I'm sorry you're going through this, I hope you can find a way to help your child. Anorexia is a bitch, but with the right resources things can get better.",False,True

I know nothing of  your situations of course, but please believe me: seeing my  sick child makes me believe I am guilty for this, it’s my fault and I am useless in helping her.  I would jump happily into fire if this would help her recover but I can only cry myself  sick for desperation.   So, yes, hate your mothers if you want.   But they suffer for you, even if they do so on the wrong way.",False,False

I think it might start off as her trying to empathize, but she can't and ends up just feeling sorry for herself. I don't know your mom, but that's how mine is. Good luck.",False,False

She pretends like she’s the only one in my life who cares about me. I just have to draw the boundary and tell her my eating disorder is off limits of discussion because she has proven she’s unhelpful in resolving the issue. She can buy me food or pay for my treatment if she wants to feel like she’s helping, otherwise, I shut down any of her comments.",False,False

You're going through some tough shit now, but I hope your pain eases sometime and dont forget to mind yourself and dont take on others feelings/pressure/worry ect.",False,False
