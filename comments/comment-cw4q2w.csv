Also, you seem like an amazing, caring husband, she is super lucky to have you. Having a supporting partner is a huge resource in recovery. She must have tried so hard for so long to keep ut ""the perfect healthy wife image"" and must feel so ashamed, she might even be scared of you leaving her now that you found out (I know many ED sufferers would). Sending you a lot of strength!",False,False

It can seem really illogical and maybe frustrating for you sometimes but the thing is that eating disorders can drive you to do weird, seemingly irrational things. Oftentimes, being obsessively healthy about food goes hand in hand with secretly binge eating junk food. She's not putting on a fake persona of being healthy, she's just being driven to extremes by her eating disorder. I can almost guarantee she feels awful after binge episodes like you described, and it's important that you support her through it and try to understand how she's feeling instead of judging her or questioning her.",False,False

They’ve always danced around the subject to avoid upsetting me. But in reality, that just allowed me to continue in my disorder without consequences. I justified to myself that I must not be “that bad” if no one was saying anything to me.",False,False

There’s a saying ‘you’re only as sick as your secrets’ that might be helpful to use.  Don’t tell her ‘you look great’ or even express concern about her physical health. It is deeply uncomfortable to have someone comment on your appearance and body.   I would suggest first approaching by not talking about the food. Leave it be the elephant in the room. Ask about her happiness, anxiety levels, self esteem etc.   Say that you love her, you’re not going to judge her at all, you are here to listen and you don’t pretend to have all the answers, that you’re worried about her. Say you don’t have to be ashamed and keep secrets and that you understand this might be really hard to put into words. That you want to help her. That you can help her to get help. If she opens up maybe offer to do some research on options for getting help.  If she keeps refusing to even have the conversation, maybe try writing it in a note or message that she can read and take time to process.",False,False

She knows you know now (even if there's denial, consciously or subconsciously), and it's just going to become a bigger, scarier elephant in the room over time.   I will say, though, when it comes down to it... she has to want the help too. It may take some time for that to happen, but talking about it should start ASAP.",False,False

She could be in a serious crisis with her eating disorder. It's important that she gets help/treatment as soon as possible, the earlier the better for success. Be prepared that she may react negatively or defensively. Often though, we're secretly glad someone has noticed we are struggling even if we won't admit it. [NEDA](https://www.nationaleatingdisorders.org/learn/help/caregivers) has some excellent resources on how to confront/support someone you suspect may have an eating disorder.  Make a list of observations you've observed. Tell her how you noticed it seems to be affecting her. Tell her how it is affecting you. Tell her you love her so much and are scared, you want to spend the rest of your life with her, which may not be a long time if she continues the path she is on. Use ""I"" statements, don't be combative/accusatory.     I disagree with the other commenters, I don't think you should tread lightly. I think you should involve her parents if confronting her 1:1 doesn't encourage her to seek professional help. The longer she avoids treatment the more likely she can end up in real medical danger. Suicide rates are also very high in eating disorder patients. Perhaps do some research yourself to find what local treatment options are available for you to present when you do sit down to talk with her. Offer to call and make the first appointment. Offer to go to the appointment with her.",False,False

We wont believe were beautiful or healthy or any of the adjectives you think will make us feel better. Words wont save us.  This disorder is like a parasite it will do anything possible to maintain itself, it will foster fears and doubts in the individual and make us assume these false truths. I speak for myself in this, but as a disordered individual there is so much shame and fear wrapped up in these behaviors. She hides the food and overcompensates with healthy behaviors to try to protect you, but most importantly to protect the disorder. Its a hard explanation to swallow. I am sure not everyone would agree with me, but I would ask you to consider it. If you involve her parents or force her into a recovery process, she will feel attacked and all the anxiety harbored for fears she has created will run rampant.   The best course of action is risk management. Be receptive to her plans for dinner and solidify her positive choices. Encourage positive choices and instill healthy behaviors. Tread lightly with discussing this disorder.   There is no magic cure, or ""good"" advice, everyone is different and reacts different. Just continue to be loving and supportive and practice positive behaviors.",False,False

This can be for a number of reasons.   If it is the case that shes been dealing with this for years it may very well be the case that her eating disorder has lead to her losing a lot of people in the past. This is very common among ED sufferers. This can make people extremely averse to reaching out to/accepting help from others.  From my experience, and from the experiences of many I have spoken to, it can be too frustrating to  have a loved one help because an eating disorder can be very difficult for people who aren't disordered to fully understand.  You may have better luck encouraging her to see a professional and promise her that you'll support her. She may open up in her own time.  It might not be the best idea to speak with her parents without running it by her. A lot of people don't take well to having their disordered behaviours exposed.",False,False
