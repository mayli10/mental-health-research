I’ve been sober from drugs and alcohol since March... just recently relapsed into ed behaviors though and for some reason it’s making me want to relapse into other addictions as well :/,False,False

If you do a google scholar search for eating disorders and substance abuse you’ll see studies that have found a high link between EDs and substance abuse, and lots of psychologists and other mental health professionals have always told how common addiction is among people with EDs. Partly because eating disorders have similarities with addiction I think.   Personally I started smoking cigs and later using drugs as a way to control my appetite, starting with coke and mdma every day and then whatever pills and powders I could get my hands on, eventually leading to crystal meth, heroin and crack. My addiction has always revolved around suppressing my appetite, if it wasn’t for the ED I don’t think I would have had anywhere the motivation I did have to try drugs (or to self-destruct really at all).   Was definitely a mistake however and I think it interfered with my impulse control around hunger more than it ever helped me lose any weight really.   Working on getting clean now tho! You are certainly not alone my dear :)",False,False
