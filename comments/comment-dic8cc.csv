I give myself between 1pm and 6pm to eat 700 calories. My coworkers had a pizza party today and were throwing tantrums because I told them I couldn‚Äôt have any... it would mess up my ‚ÄúIF‚Äù. üòÇ,False,False

It works well for me because some days I can't get all my calories in by 8, so I just don't eat them. Helped me lose 40lbs in a fairly short amount of time. Of course that barreled me into a period of severe restriction and eventually 3 months of binging and gaining, but for a normal person I'm sure it works well lmao",False,False

Obviously it was just Wednesday for me, but by our second class of the day all of my friends were groaning about how hungry they were and that they couldn‚Äôt believe they weren‚Äôt going to get to eat anything during Snack like they usually did. I get that normies have normal hunger cues etc but at the time I was astonished lol.",False,False

The IF seems so strange to me too especially because it's so rarely accompanied by any other necessary part of a diet, like, ya know, CICO.   I think the thing literally most likely to out me as disordered in my real life is actually my desire to spout off at people about the 'facts of life' when it comes to food and weight loss/gain.",False,True

Like maybe in the long term the healthier choices thing will work like intuitive eating?? But there's gotta be a nasty swing up when eating three days calories of fruit (aka sugar) because it's 'free'.,False,True

I know they way I eat probably isnt normal but I dont think normal eating requires eating every two hours.",False,False

I have a friend who just started weight watchers or WW? or whatever it‚Äôs called now and she really likes to talk about it (which is a whole can of worms) but she was explaining the whole points thing and how you have a certain amount of points per day and I was like ‚Äúso it‚Äôs calories‚Äù and she was like ‚Äúno not at all‚Äù because apparently a bunch of just normal ass foods like eggs, chicken, vegetables and fruits ‚Äúdon‚Äôt count‚Äù and are ‚Äúzero points.‚Äù   WHICH IS WILD.   Like how could that possibly work?!?  (To be fair I really don‚Äôt understand the program because I‚Äôve literally never met anyone else in it/ and maybe she explained it wrong but the way she said it blew my mind.

Personally if I try a little nibble of something when I‚Äôm not even hungry then there‚Äôs a high chance I‚Äôll feel like I‚Äôm seriously hungry than if I just went on about my day.  If you‚Äôre used to eating 3 square meals a day your brain probably expects it and makes your body signal accordingly but if you ignore feelings of hunger then I think in my case it will give up and try to come back later,False,False
