I usually eat slow and try to save food / always save a small portion. I never noticed until I had someone point it out. I always feel “safer” knowing I’ll have the food there for me if I “need” it. So eating with fast eaters gives me extreme anxiety and I stuff myself and don’t even enjoy it.  I relate to your experiences, I have a myriad of deep abandonment issues that are rooted in me.   It’s very hard to rationalize with that part of yourself.",False,False

Damn I don’t remember having a secret alt account commenting on my own posts. Wtf?  &gt; there will always be other food and it’s okay. Take it slow, mindful and try not to throw daggers at the person inhaling the precious food. e_e  Lmao ok now I know u must be reading my mind. I think you may be onto something about it being a weird survival thing for me just because historically, I’ve found a lot of the things I enjoy(ed) in life went/go away and my revelation that certain happy times/experiences in my life are very limited so I have to make the best of what I get.",False,True

I piss myself off with how I want to get my “portion” of it before the other person takes it all? I think it’s a weird survival / fear of when the next meal is kind of thing. I’ve been trying to mentally coach myself in these scenarios (lol) that there will always be other food and it’s okay.
