Otherwise I may have to wait until tomorrow or next week, no joke. It can be hard but sometimes getting a “schedule” helps! I always wake up - use the bathroom, hit the gym, eat breakfast, then go again if I didn’t poop the first time. My body is accustomed to it, and if I’m struggling, exercise usually helps along with the food. :)   If you don’t have enough volume though there may not be much you can do :/ for me some yoga positions and a shot of olive oil or kombucha helped at my worst. Jarrow’s EPS is great too! Happy Consistent Pooping? ",False,False
