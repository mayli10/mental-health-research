I don’t know what it was and it doesn’t sound nearly as bad as yours—mine were only at the hips and no swelling and not huge. I’d agree with others that doctor is likely best but if you can’t see a doctor right now I’d say maybe rest and give your body some time to heal?   Good job working on recovery! An internet stranger is proud of you. ",False,False

You don't even absolutely have to tell them about your ED - they should get some idea of what could be the immediate problem and run some tests for that anyway. Maybe you could've fractured a load of bones that were too weak to handle the strain of dancing? Who knows what could be wrong, take care!",False,False

I hope you're able to find a path to better health. And if that includes a doctor, than I hope you're able to find one that makes you feel comfortable and respected. And ",False,False

Honestly what I find more concerning than the bruising (which is obviously still a concern) is the swelling. There are lots of things that could cause either of those things, but a doctor is best qualified to diagnose and treat. I think your best bet is to go see a doctor, be honest about your ED history and recovery efforts, and let them give you the care you need and deserve. Hope you feel better soon~",False,False
