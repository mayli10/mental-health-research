I was wearing:   A blouse  A poncho  A cloak  A wool shawl  And a heating pad was on my lap at my desk.   I was still freezing and told my boss I had to go warm up in front of the space heater. I heard a colleague say as I left “I didn’t think it was cold here today...”  Fml. I’m getting an electric blanket for work so I have one there and one at home. My nails were fucking blue.,False,False
