By definition ketosis happens when you're burning fat, be it dietary or body's fat. For the body to use fat for fuel it has to be converted into ketones. But being in ketosis is a term often used as in, burning only/primarily fat. If you're eating carbs, then you're burning through dietary nutrients, glucose first, and protein, and then also glycogen which is stored in the muscles, and this glycogen was created out of glucose you ingested earlier on. If those things are enough to sustain your energy needs then there's no fat being burned but if you're restricting, then by definition you have an energy deficit. So after burning through glycogen (which, in a non keto diet, is also immediately restored if there's enough glucose to go around) you start having to burn fat. So yeah you're Stil producing ketones. But you're not runnunf exclusively on ketones, and studies show that when you stay on a very low carb diet for long enough, your cells adapt into burning primarily fat for fuel instead of glucose. That means, a person who Isn't used to not eating carbs, will feel a crash after glucose and glycogen stores are depleted, before the body sorta reluctantly goes into fat burning. Imagine the cells in this person like slow rusty machines. In a person who is used to keto, or, ""fat adapted"", the process goes smoother and quicker . Hence no crash.  Now, to be keto, contrary to what those guys will tell you, you dont need to EAT  a ton of fat. The reason most ketoers do is because they don't restrict calories and they don't want insulin spikes from too much carbs or protein. So, they indulge in fat. It doesn't mean it's a necessity.

You could eat 3000 calories a day and still be in ketosis if there is less than 30 grams of carbs in those calories.  Technically you would have to eat very ***very*** little to be in ketosis without trying to limit carbs. Even if you were restricting to just 400 calories a day and half of those calories were made up from carbs (usually it's more than half), you'd still be eating 50 grams of carbs a day and not being in ketosis as a result.",False,False
