They are giving us SO much food everyday, it's relentless.   Do I eat it? Yes. Do I say no? No. Am I restricting? No.  So I guess some would say I don't have an eating disorder.  But do I feel shit about eating? Yes. Do I count all the calories afterwards? Yes. Do I body check? Yes. Do I question myself why I'm eating as I'm shoveling food into my mouth? Yes. Do I cry about how much I've eaten? Yes. Do I get anxiety? Yes. Do I hate myself for eating? Yes. Are all my waking thoughts about food? Yes.   EDs are a mental illness. Yes, a lot of the criteria are related to eating habits and how much or little you eat. But they're also more about how you FEEL.  Just because I'm eating more than other people in this sub, doesn't mean my disorderedness is less valid than theirs.   Just the same as you eating more or less than the people in the videos mean your disorderedness is less valid.   Your struggles are REAL. Everyone is struggling differently, but that doesn't mean that you're struggling any less. You're not alone. üíï",False,False
