My ex would visibly be disgusted with me when I gained, and as soon as I was at an underweight BMI wouldn’t keep his hands off of me. Of course I can’t precisely sum up how positively her reinforced my disordered habits in a few sentences, but I’m sure everyone reading this will have an idea.   My now-husband met me at my lowest weight. I was upfront and honest with him, partially because we were only friends at the time and partially because I wanted so badly to recover. He was amazing. A day hasn’t gone by since we met that he hasn’t told me how beautiful I am to him. Not only in body, but in mind and spirit. He truly taught me my worth by picking me up at my lowest and celebrating at my best. Since we’ve met, he has seen me severely underweight and at 20 pounds overweight. I’m now at what I believe is my perfect size and recovered, and he has never for one minute made me believe that he wished I looked any different. He loved me all the same no matter how healthy, or otherwise, I had been.   Someone who loves you for you will always look beyond your physical vessel, and see straight into the depths of who you are. Just because you look at yourself and are disgusted by what you see, doesn’t mean it’s okay for your significant other to treat you the way you treat yourself.

You deserve to be told you’re pretty and beautiful. Beauty is entirely subjective, and even if you feel you are not conventionally attractive, you deserve a man who lets you know you are beautiful and sees your individual beauty that you know is there.
