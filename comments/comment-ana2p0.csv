I think most people on their journey to recovery relapse at some point. I remember feeling suicidal. Feeling like I wasn't being taken seriously because I still had the fucked up mind but my body was no longer stick thin so no one thought there was an issue. Recovery was the \*hardest\* part of having an eating disorder.  Please try to remember: what you're going through now is the hardest part. Don't give up. The fact that you have admitted with yourself that this obsession has become a problem that is impeding your ability to be happy is the first and most important step. You've already come that far. It isn't going to be easy, but I promise you it is so so so worth it to push forward.   I don't know what your situation is. Are you on your own? Do you have familial support? Are you seeing a therapist or are you part of an outpatient program? Whatever the case, you're here right now and you're alive. That means it's possible to get better. As long as you're alive, it is possible. You deserve to be happy again. It isn't just about food or weight. You deserve to feel free, to be spontaneous, to not let your life be chained down by obsessive thoughts and behavior.  You're on this planet. You wrote this message. You're disappointed about relapse. That says so much. You will get through this - maybe the disorder won't go away entirely, but I can promise if you try you will get to the point where it doesn't affect every moment of every day, and you can live your life and be happy. What is in front of you is the hardest shit to get through. I know it is scary. But when you get through it - and you will - you will look back and realize how strong you are for it. And you'll be on another fucking level. Trust me.   Hang in there. I'm here to DM if you ever wanna chat about it. Or just rant to me. W/e you want. ",False,False

I force myself to go to school with social anxiety, with no meds or anything and I feel like that. Like genuinely just not being able to stand up and do much, wanting to collapse as your walking, it’s hard. Like just the thought of doing something is draining. I’m so sorry you’re struggling with this.you can always talk to me. Just remember, you aren’t alone, there are people you’ve influenced in ways you don’t even know. ",False,False
