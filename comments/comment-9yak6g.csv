When she moved to the US and now Canada, the pounds packed on FAST and ever since then, she's been obese for as long as I can remember and she's constantly going on crash diets, even putting me on a lot of them. I've been crash dieting since I was 7, and always grew up being the chubby kid. With the exception of a health kick I went on when I was in the 4th grade, this is the only other time in my life where I've been at a normal BMI, so trust me, extreme hunger is 100000 times more scary to me than it is to her, but I have an obligation to heal myself.  Anyways, as a result, I don't think she ever got proper education or knowledge on nutrition. She's tried keto, vegan, vegetarian, gluten free, whole30 blah blah blah and the same thing always happens. She loses 10-15 pounds, and then they suddenly come back on, but the whole time she tries to educate me on health.  &amp;#x200B;  EDIT: I'd like to add that she knows that 200 a day is starvation, so she's glad I'm not doing it anymore, but I think she thinks that recovery is just as easy as eating a ""normal"" amount of calories all of a sudden and magically being cured. She never had a full-blown ED so I understand her ignorance, I'm just too mad to explain the complexities to her. I hope she goes the intuitive eating route, but if she goes the calorie counting route, she's going to find that 800 a day is not nearly as fucking easy as she thinks. She's already thinking of skipping meals as we speak.",False,True

Second of all, your mom's mental health is NOT your responsibility. Your time, energy, and focus needs to be on yourself and your recovery right now. And that might mean avoiding your mom for awhile till you're in a more stable place. It seems she doesn't care about how her actions affect you and your recovery right now, or just doesn't appreciate the severity and impact. You might find some good tips for dealing with your mom in r/raisedbynarcissists.",False,False

Being triggered by family is the fucking worst, my sister has an ED and is extremely vocal about it. I don’t think I have anything to say that can help, but I really hope that your mother’s behavior doesn’t trigger you too much. ",False,False
