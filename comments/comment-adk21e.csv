Jokes on her cause I found it and just use it secretly.    It's a tough one, cause we are obsessed &amp; for them it's probably like walking on egg shells half the time.",False,False

Family members are not therapists.  Especially when it is your scale, which you bought, not a family scale, it's stealing.   I'd buy a new one, show it to her and add ""I'll be keeping it somewhere secure..."" and lock it up.  Yes, I'm petty.",False,False

So anger comes in first. But this only means they do care (unless they're the abusive and controlling type), so don't take it bad. I know it sucks at the moment, but it's really painful watching your beloved ones slowly destroying themselves and you can't do nothing about it. ",False,False

If anyone is on this sub, including myself, it's because we likely have a disoriented view of ourselves and/or unhealthy eating/weighing habits.  It's frustrating to lose the scale. Use this as a lesson. Take this week to focus on your goals.  People who try to lose weight effectively will shed off pounds whether the scale confirms it or not.  People who try to gain weight will still gain it even if they don't step on the scale.  Your mom is trying to help you. Maybe her efforts won't change a thing but right now you just have to focus on you and not on the scale.",False,False

I honestly would eat less if I couldn‚Äôt weigh myself bc I wouldn‚Äôt know so I‚Äôd make sure there wasn‚Äôt a chance for weight gain   My SO said he wants to smash my scale the other day.

He thinks I‚Äôm obsessive but wouldn‚Äôt check the batteries? Nah man, I take out &amp; reput in the batteries if the scale is even doing something suspicious. I‚Äôd check   And I‚Äôm also 24.
