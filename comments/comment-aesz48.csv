All I know is that at a certain point, in my mind, the only direction I could possibly go was down. As long as my weight didn't go up, everything was fine. Ultimately this drove me lower and lower over time. You will always want to be a lower weight, and you'll always be convinced it will make you look better or make you happier, but these are lies the eating disorder is telling you, no more. Don't listen to them. Take charge and do what you need to do to get better and take power away from the eating disorder, no matter what it costs.",False,False

I remember when my diet first started getting questionable and I lost 20 lbs in 3 weeks. I had 5 lbs to go and I thought to myself ""what then?"" I was clearly on track to reach that. Restricting is easy. My maintenance is x, eat less than x - way less. But then what when I want to maintain? Eat exactly x? That's hard. And what about the initial water weight influx? I'd gain 3 lbs of water weight the first day eating maintenance. I went on to gain 25 lbs in two months and have been volatile-ly *(word?)* coming down since.  But yeah, to this day I still wonder what I would've done (and will do) when I reach my goal weight. Binge my way back up? Set a newer, lower, *better* goal weight? Actually find the secret to intuitively eating maintenance? Who knows?",False,False
