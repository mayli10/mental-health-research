I’ve honestly found that catering staff are happy to help if they’re not too busy and I ask nicely.

Just remember that next time you can ask for only a little bit if cheese and for it to be cooked a little longer. Think of this as a learning opportunity. If you are nervous about speaking to others, maybe practice your order before you go to the dining hall.  P.s. I hope you enjoy your broccoli. Personally, it's my favorite vegetable.",False,False
