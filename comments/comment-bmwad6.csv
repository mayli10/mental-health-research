I was at that weight before(even lighter) and I felt good, I maintained it for a while, I liked myself a lot more. Going hiking sounds so cool, I love hiking. I'm really thinking about it. Also, I'm short and a neet so my maintenance is 1200kcal at best, I really can't lose 4kgs in 2 weeks sadly...",False,True

Would you really enjoy your birthday if you were constantly on the verge of fainting during it? You wouldn’t be able to eat cake or enjoy dinner with your friends because your starved brain would be screaming at you the entire time. You’ll be irritable and tired and when you drink, you’ll immediately get wasted and embarrass yourself.    You don’t have to be thin to enjoy your life. Your body is not something to be hidden away in shame from the people you care about. I bet they miss you.   Your ED is lying to you when it says “you can do whatever you want when you hit x lbs.” it will always move the goalpost and even when you do hit a weight that makes you “happy,” you’ll be too messed up physically and mentally to even enjoy it.   Did you already make plans for your birthday? If not, please call a friend right now and try to do something that doesn’t revolve around food or getting wasted. Personally, taking easy hikes is a great way to distract my mind from stupid food thoughts, I feel good about getting a little exercise, and I feel more grounded and connected to my body. The woods and the coast are healing places for me. I hope you can find something similar that helps you escape and that you are able to enjoy yourself on your birthday. Be kind to yourself, lovely one. You may feel out of control and scared and angry with your body, but I hope you find peace soon.",False,False
