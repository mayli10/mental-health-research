Since obviously people here don't want standard, they want Skinny, here's what my Skinny 5'10"" 120-something friend eats like (I was around her for full days):  * oatmeal (200?) * 1-2 slices of pizza and some veg, or 2-3 chicken strips with 1/2 cup roasted potatoes and broccoli (400-600),  * a juice/odwalla (200-300) * noodles in broth, 1-2 eggs, veg, some nuts, or pasta with red sauce, ect (600-700) * a night snack/dessert (100-400) * 1500-2200 total  If she's hungry, there's more. If she's stressed or busy, less. She's asian, so there's some but not a lot of attention to amount of food (little intentional regulation).   &amp;#x200B;  As for on vacations, yes most people I think eat more. My mom is fairly slim (5'8"", \~130 before she had medical problems), and eats like so:  * coffee, a banana or sometimes 1-2 slices bread with butter, sometimes just coffee (0-300) * big lunch - vegetables, meat, 1-2 slices bread or other carbs, cooked in oil. (700-1000) * a generous portion of nuts (150-300) * some popcorn, bread, fruit, or some other snacks (100-600) * Probably 1700-2200 daily  On vacation, she'll have ample breakfast, lunch, snacks, and little to no dinner (she has sleeping problems and they get better when she eats less at night). She also drinks a fair bit.   Generally vacations are a time to indulge for many. My mom does so and has a very healthy body.  Sorry if this is a ramble.",False,False
