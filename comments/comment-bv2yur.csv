Congrats on finding someone who you can work with. I really like the ""dont pry at my past"" rule. It sounds like one that a lot of people should abide by, but i know some people need to know others past. Can i ask how you deal with the banging up against eachothers walls?",False,True

I get very suspicious and also resentful.   I’m dating a veteran, I met him through a coworker. Our relationship is founded on Don’t Ask Don’t Tell. We exist completely in the present, we go on fun dates and we fuck and we don’t talk about the past, our emotions, or the future. I don’t know anything about his scars, nor he mine. And I don’t know how much longer this situation will be sustainable. I’ve walled off my true self from him, he’s put up walls, too, and our relationship has started banging up against them.",False,False

I felt like I was lying to someone I loved. Once I told him he was super supportive and surprised me with my fav low cal smoothie the next day after work.,False,False

We're into kink so it was on /r/bdsmpersonals.  This is the first relationship I've started from meeting someone online and it's gone surprisingly well - we just moved in together actually! I will admit I had to wade through a ton of people to even find one person I was willing to meet in person but so far it's working great :)  Sometimes I wish I wasn't attempting recovery but I know he just wants me to try, I don't have to be perfect. It's nice to have one person who just wants the best and isn't pushy.",False,False

They ask me to hit a certain calorie minimum (since I restrict/fast) and as long as they see me trying to recover they are proud of me. They get I have bad days or breakdowns though.  The only thing is they expect me to work on recovery, which can be hard, but they don't want me to not work on myself if that makes sense?  That said I have a ""pusher"" friend who's always trying to get me to eat and they've asked me out in the past and dating that person would be fucking BAD for my ED and that relationship.",False,False
