After having this exact scenario happen to me like three times during my first go at recovery I was too traumatized to ever really ""binge"" on my own because I realized that I'd be miserable if I put anything in my body I wasn't willing to leave there....but the real trouble comes imo when you're doing stuff like dinners with friends/family/boys/whatever or parties. It's rally hard for me at least to eat a non-calorie counted/home cooked meal at all, if I just pick at it I'm more ravenous than I would've been if I hadn't eaten at all, and if I eat to the point of actual satisfaction I'm utterly miserable after.  &amp;#x200B;  Still haven't realllly figured out a perfect balance here. If you figure out anything that helps let me know I'd love to trade healthy non-purging tips.",False,False
