They’re tasty cold, they’re delicious with arugula dressed with balsamic, and they also hold well in the fridge for days and reheat well. If that sounds good to you let me know and I can share some recipe tips or links :)  I also like eggs baked in tomato sauce (shakshuka is good, marinara is bomb with it without a little mozzarella), toasted bread on side is bomb  Egg drop soup  Egg fried rice (despite the name you barely need any oil if you use a nonstick pan)  Breakfast crepes (I make light crepes with my nonstick pan, warm up some deli ham, a couple peeler shaves of Swiss cheese, and an egg or egg white inside)—ends up being pretty high protein and light overall. This is my own recipe so again if you or anyone is interested let me know and I’ll share. Also very cheap because you can get milk powder (tastes bad to drink but is awesome for baking/cooking) and use that for the batter and not have to worry about having milk on hand or milk spoiling.",False,False

I like to boil my eggs for 20 minutes so the yolk is completely cooked, mix them up with steamed veggies (I use frozen veggies) and put whatever spices and seasonings I want.    OR  I'll poach my eggs?  Idk, I'll just scramble 2 together really well, add salt, black pepper, some herbs like rosemary and thyme and put it in a pan and cover it.  I cook it like a pancake.  I also add a few veggies to that, mostly roasted cherry tomatoes and steamed brocolli.",False,False

It’s one of the few foods that I enjoy and feel okay about eating (satiating, low-carb, and sufficient protein). I like them over medium or scrambled with a bit of avocado. You can also sauté some red onion and green pepper for simple fajitas and eggs. If you eat bread, you can also make eggs in a basket.",False,False

I love the birds tho, and sell the eggs.  But if I do eat them they have to be scrambled, with cheese and green peppers, onions, salt and ketchup.  Maybe that’s why I don’t eat more eggs; in order for me to like them they have to be loaded with other stuff.",False,False
