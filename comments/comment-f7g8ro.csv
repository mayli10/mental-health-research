It keeps me full and Even large bananas aren’t too high in calories. I also like veggie straws! I have different but they’re not standard safe foods but these ones are good I feel.,False,False

There’s also r/ShittyRestrictionFood but the food there isn’t very food-y. There might be more but I’m only on those three.,False,False
