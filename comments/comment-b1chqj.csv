I haven't had cake in general since my grandmother's 90th birthday in 2014.  I actually don't even have plans for my birthday. I wanted to think of something nice to do for myself, but in the end, I'm paralyzed.   It's weird how I don't even really care for cake all that much, but sometimes I'll get a nostalgic yearning for it. Even something like the boxed confetti cake with pink frosting that I remember eating off of paper plates at birthday parties when I was a kid.  I hope you enjoy your birthday, and an excellent slice of cake.",False,False

I'm not a fan of most store-bought cakes, so it was really nice for me, especially when I was paleo for my 16th and vegan for my 17th. That being said, I did have had lots of ice cream cakes from baskin robins. You should get what you want, even if it's just once.",False,False
