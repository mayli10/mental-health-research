RIP my throat. My body's been in a whiplash for the past month because of this exact thing. Plus ending up gaining over 20 pounds back. Yup just kill me. The binge cycle is vicious OP and I struggle so much just to get myself through the day without it constantly being on my mind.   Im so sorry you have to go through this too. I wouldnt wish it on anyone. Pm if you need some encouragement or need to vent :) ,False,False

It started as a weird BED with failed fasting phases and non intentional purging...  Then it just turned into full blown bulimia.   I still go through restrictive phases but I go through b/p phases more.  Lately it feels like I'm either fasting for days or binging for days.  I genuinely don't think I've eaten normally in two months now and it fucking really really fucking sucks  But you know, EDs always suck nothing new there ",False,False

I tried for so long to get back to restricting but it just lead to more binging and purging until i was so miserable i actually cared about something more than i cared about my weight for once. the brain will not tolerate starvation forever so eventually instinct kicks in and makes you eat and eat and eat and eat and eat. you have to feed it to shut it up. it's a total ""rock and a hard place"" situation",False,False

It's quite, though quite confusing/upsetting. I went from refusing to even *look* at high calorie foods to binging and purging 8+ times a day. it's taken a few years but i've finally got hose number down to 2 or 3 times a day with much, much smaller binges.
