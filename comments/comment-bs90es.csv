I feel weird when I see an ED meme with Jimin in it because it‚Äôs just really ironic.

This is what I mean actually. most idols are pretty open about unhealthy dieting- which is why I feel like using them in ED posts isn't as weird and disrespectful as it probably feels to a lot of people. when you take into account the cultural differences in perspectives on dieting and weight loss, the line between ""weight loss inspiration"" and ""eating disorder glorification"" becomes very blurred lol",False,False

Jimin and IU and several others have been very open about it. the whole reason the ""Jimin diet"" exists is because he shared it himself. he's kind of... perpetuated it. IU has too. so I kind of have mixed feelings.  my main issue is just that the risk that kpop ED memes hold in exposing young fans to pretty toxic ideas. I like ED communities and don't think they're bad, but they need to be isolated.",False,False

I've been in kpop communities for 10 years and ED communities for 6 and I see a lot of similarities between (very broadly speaking) kpop fan personalities and ED community member personalities.  also, idols are pretty much just walking thinspo. underweight is the norm in the idol world.",False,False
