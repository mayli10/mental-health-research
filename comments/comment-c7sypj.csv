My “friend group” (lol) consists of:  -my 60 year old (former/sort of current) boss/mother figure/“friend” (honestly I love her and she is wonderful and has been there for me like no one else in my life, but I have a hard time labelling anyone as an actual friend)  -my nearing 70 year old other former boss who lives on the other side of the country now  -my 70+ year old former therapist who I talk to every few months about books/tv shows/etc  -my former coworker who comes over once or twice a month for a Hulu/alcohol binge  -my fuck buddy who blows me off more often than not and literally only ever talks to me when he wants a bj  -a handful of other former coworkers who I haven’t seen in about a year and have texted maybe three times in the past year  Annnd...ummm...yeah. That’s about it.   Evidently I do not play well with others. And especially not people my own age.",False,False

Im better friends with my parents friends than my own. My wedding drove that one home.   Out of 6 bridesmaids, only two showed; my maid of honor (my only sibling) and my sister in law. My closest childhood friend that knew a year in advance straight up ghosts to be a trimmigrant in Cali (we live in Oregon). Her dad was our officiant and is an excellent friend. I was 22 then. Two years later and nothing's changed... we drive halfway across the state to see him, his wife, and youngest kid. She to this day has known every time and not shown up once. She lives in the same city as him.",False,False

In college the key is finding groups of people who like to do the same sort of stuff. I promise whatever you are interested in, from video games to outdoor stuff to math, there will be a club for it. You could also get involved in Greek life, depending on what school. And you will make friends in class. Please know your fears about making friends are really normal for college students.
