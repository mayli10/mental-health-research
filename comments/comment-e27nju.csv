It's by far the most uncomfortable feeling for me and it used to be one of my biggest SH triggers. It just feels so uncontrollable. I think I read that ""letting it out"" such as by punching pillows etc like we teach kids (and I assume by doing self destructive things) is actually worse than sitting with it? In terms of actually making it go away or something. But sitting with it is so uncomfortable and can feel more dangerous.  Sorry I don't have any actual advice. I hope you're able to find a healthier way to tolerate anger eventually.",False,False
