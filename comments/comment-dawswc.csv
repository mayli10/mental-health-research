I don’t think it’s safe for you to lose weight. Your body hasn’t changed in the moments before you saw your weight, so it seems you’re still stuck in an ED mindset where you’re no good unless you’re under x lbs. It’s a very slippery slope and I wouldn’t attempt it unless you had a doctor and a dietician on board that say that you need to lose the weight. I personally don’t weigh myself, I use my clothes to keep myself in check. If they’re too tight, I cut back on sweets. If they start getting loose, I know I’m not eating enough calories. Since my weight has stabilized, I don’t have to think about it much and it’s a huge relief to let go of numbers. If your clothes fit you well and are comfortable, if you’re healthy and doing well physically, there’s no need for you to lose. I know it’s really hard but you have to work on accepting yourself where you’re at right now and work on feeling more comfortable in your skin. Good luck and take care of yourself.",False,False

Unless your doctor commented on your weight gain, or told you that you should lose the weight for health reasons, you might slip back into heavy restricting. It's too easy, you know that since you've recovered already. I haven't recovered successfully, but I tried to a bit ago and failed miserably because I didn't keep my ED thoughts in check. If you really do want to lose the weight, like maybe your weight is close to being overweight but you aren't there yet, then BE SAFE. My ED started because I was 145 lbs and wanted to lose the weight since I was just a pound away from being overweight. Just be careful, please.",False,False

Don’t starve yourself, focus more on eating healthy foods below your maintenance weight. 1,200kcal should be enough of a deficit. Maybe include light cardio or strength training with light weights (like 10lb or less) to improve your muscle tone, which can improve your appearance to where you don’t feel the need to drop weight.",False,False
