My skin was technically fine, but restricting and getting rid of white carbs, dairy, sugar to make sure it stayed that way made me feel like I was in control. Because no foods felt safe to me anymore, I was eating below my TDEE and started to notice I was losing weight and it felt so good that I began to get scared of gaining weight, started restricting more, afraid of eating more and more foods, etc. I'm close to being underweight as well (18.6 BMI) The paranoia can be so scary, I'm so sorry you are dealing with this :(  Please don't be embarrassed, it's impossible to compare one person's suffering to another's. Your struggles matter just as much as everyone else's &lt;3   I don't want to be a hypocrite because I have been too anxious to do this, but I think that going to a dietitian or a therapist would really help you (orthorexia is commonly associated with OCD), and if you are still concerned about your skin, I actually saw the most results with the advice given to me on r/SkincareAddiction   As for what I *actually* do to cope, there is a YouTube channel I watch called Pick Up Limes. She posts recipes that exclude a lot of common fear foods, but she also focuses on mental health. She made a video on a similar topic to EDs:  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2y9St1EarLA&amp;t=36s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2y9St1EarLA&amp;t=36s) Hearing her advice gave me a lot of comfort, even if my food anxiety is too bad to follow it completely   P.S. Green tea is an amazing antioxidant, one of the most potent ones in the world! I love it too, and I personally think that the antioxidants outweigh the caffeine, but if you are anxious about it there are non-caffeinated green teas available!",False,False

Those are two things I definitely can relate to as someone who does have an ED, and I don’t think that’s quite connected to the rest of your post (adjusting you’re diet in an attempt to improve a physical condition).  I can also relate to having “legit” reasons for certain dietary restrictions— I try (though don’t always succeed) to limit gluten, dairy, and sugar due to migraines. This definitely complicated and exacerbates the ED issues.  I’d definitely recommend booking an appointment with a dietitian. If you truly want to adjust your diet to improve your skin (rather than to hurt or punish yourself) they should be able to help you figure out what to eat so you can remain healthy, and will help you feel less overwhelmed by trying to figure out what’s safe.",False,False
