Usually people I meet outside this state or in other countries assume all of us are in Miami and there‚Äôs a pressure to have a perfect bikini bod.

I live in Florida and a lot of the girls I work with / the current trend leans more towards like ‚Äòthicc‚Äô and more ass and boobs I suppose so it‚Äôs genuinely a compliment to them but it‚Äôs extremely insensitive that people don‚Äôt stop to think someone may have gained weight because they‚Äôre struggling; whether it be an ED or just bad situation. That‚Äôs the shittiest part. They just assume everyone is fine and gaining weight cause they wanna look thicc etc,False,True

Yeah, actually that‚Äôs the ironic part is that most of the girls I work with are my current size or larger and I‚Äôm like BMI 21 right now. But what‚Äôs making me freak the most are the damn comments.   Like, my weight gain became real and suddenly I wasn‚Äôt ‚Äúomg too skinny / u look so skinny / ur so fit are u working out‚Äù it went back to ‚Äúwow you put the weight back on u look good / u look healthier / you gained some back‚Äù",False,True
