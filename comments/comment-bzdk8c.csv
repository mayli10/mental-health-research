You can get the same amount of protein for a lot less calories. It is a bit more expensive, but I think it's worth it because we all deserve to have something nice. Even if it's just a drink.",False,False

I used to sweeten mine with stevia and some coco powder but it's not the same at all. At least if you use unsweetened almond milk that's at least -100 calories,False,False

He is now back to a normal (albeit very low) weight and isn't necessarily trying to gain, but he's terrified of getting back to being as skinny as he was, so he's fighting tooth and nail to maintain properly. Which makes me feel like a hypocrite tallying his calories mentally (he doesn't count calories, just trying to eat more) and if he doesn't make it to his tdee or a little above I'll tell him he should eat a snack or that we should go get a drink from sonic &amp; I'll watch him drink a large slushy while I chill with my diet limeade and roll my eyes everytime he says I haven't eaten enough.   I always consider putting unsweetened almond milk in my shakes a ""treat"" and even in the moment I want to hit myself with a brick!! A cup of my almond milk is 30cal!!! What difference does it make!! (makes the shake taste better, that's the difference).",False,True

He goes through these phases of working out, and when he does he likes to make these insane drink concoctions to ""pack in the calories... it has to have at least 500 calories, but I prefer if it's closer to 1000.""
