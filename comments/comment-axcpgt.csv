Word of warning -- Wellbutrin is contraindicated for restrictive EDs because it can cause seizures if you don't eat for too long. At the very least, eat a bit of salt every 6 hours or something.",False,False

Yes it is incredibly apparent that looks matter with how everyone treats each other. When you are thin and good looking people just say you're quirky and cute. Pffft.  I'm learning to take the mask off because I can't function with it. ASD will be forever. One thing I can do is be skinny. ,False,True

I actually gained so much weight on my adhd meds - which is the opposite of what the dr thought would happen - because I didn’t anxiously avoid food knowing I’d just impulsively binge. ",False,False

I agree that people seem to treat you better when you're thin, mostly coming from the polar opposite perspective though. I haven't been really thin since maybe kindergarten or so. I feel like growing up chubby AND societally weird made it ""acceptable"" for kids to harass you, y'know? ",False,False
