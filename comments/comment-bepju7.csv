Usually if I have crisps with lunch, I won’t eat more after supper as a snack (even if I want them) because I think it’s “bad” and not “healthy” to do so.",False,True

I personally don’t think that’s too disordered but I might be wrong since I have disordered eating habits. I personally think variation in diet is important and you don’t want to waste all of your calories on chips if you’ve already had a ‘treat’ that day.  Because chips are amazing and I would love to devour a family sized bag at any given moment. I’m treating myself like a toddler that needs a balanced diet. When I recovered I couldn’t figure out how people ate normally so I ate whatever I wanted and gained weight.   I think the main difference is how much anxiety it causes you. Like are you suffering because you had toast for breakfast so you won’t let yourself have a sandwich for lunch? I think that’s disordered. If you are being mindful of your wheat intake and don’t want to overdo carbs (or whatever) and you’re happy eating something else then it’s fine?,False,False

Chips or pizza, anything conventionally determined to not be as 'healthy,' would probably not raise any alarms as far as this behavior is concerned. The slices of bread border on disordered though. Nothing inherently wrong with having toast for breakfast and a sandwich for lunch, especially if portions are reasonable.",False,False

It might be a healthy thing for a person to decide not to have more chips today and have something a little healthier because they've already eaten some chips, but I don't think it's normal to do it with every food.",False,False
