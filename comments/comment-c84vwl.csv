The last one worries me as it’s always been the way I’ve felt while at “goal weights”. I’m sorry you felt that way too.   Oh well. I’ll keep counting and hopefully keep losing",False,True

You could have lost mostly water weight, you could have exercised less this time and not toned up as much, OR it could be that you look the same as you did last time but ED gremlin and body dysmorphia possibly makes it seem like you haven't made progress.   Back when I reached my GW and got underweight, I looked awesome. But I still thought I was gross. I was toned and fit a size 1/3,  lots of smalls and extra smalls. But I was so convinced I still looked awful. Then I gained 20 lbs over the next two years and look back on pictures of myself then and realize I was exactly where I had aimed to be.... I just couldn't see it because my ED brain couldn't let myself see a difference.",False,False
