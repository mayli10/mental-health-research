BMR means nothing if you’ve suppressed your metabolism for a long stretch of time on 500 calories a day.   You will gain weight, but it will mostly be water at first.  You may gain fat, but that won’t be until 1-2 weeks of eating 1200. Plus side - it would be much more slow and manageable than jumping from 500 to 2000, and your metabolism will naturally fire itself back up once it sees adequate food intake.  This could take a month or so, and then you should be able to eat maintenance or BMR without weight gain.   I’d say that you will be alright, as 1200 is still in the high-restriction category.   I eat around 1000-1300 and maintain.",False,False
