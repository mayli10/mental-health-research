Would you say losing 3lb a week was fairly typical for you? I don’t look at the scale because I know right now it will make me feel worse.   You’ve probably just plateaued from eating around the same amount and consistently losing. I suggest having a day with a higher limit, like even 800kcal (I’ve done this before and it helped me reset somehow) and drink a lot of water. Also pass a BM if you haven’t in awhile, I suggest strong black coffee first thing in the AM.",False,False
