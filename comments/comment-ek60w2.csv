All my experience is in the US, so this may not even be pertinent (fortnight and kg suggest not)   Personally, it’s **essential for me to have insurance**. $150/mo can sound high but it’s nothing compared to the tens of thousands a single hospital visit can easily cost. I didn’t anticipate that I was gonna go off the deep end a few years back and suddenly be accessing hundreds of thousands of dollars in care. Thank goodness I had insurance and ‘only’ paid my out-of-pocket max of $2000. (Plus, random accidents just happen in life. My sister fell down the stairs last month and the ER bill was over $10k)   Choosing a good plan for your needs can be a tiring/frustrating process. If you have an idea of the type of services you might access you can check which doctors and hospitals would be in-network and what the deductibles are. If you think you’ll be accessing significant services, definitely try to consider total costs. Eg. out-of-pocket max probably matters way more than the monthly premium. Some plans might require you to meet a significant deductible before they cover anything and I’ve seen plans where the cap isn’t until $7500.   Anyhow...writing all that out because the system here in the US is deeply flawed and even when I tried to pick a good plan I ended up on one that didn’t cover the hospital I needed to go to and came within a whisper of having to declare bankruptcy. I’d love to help anyone else avoid that nightmare.   **tl;dr - I’d take the parents offer if it seems like a good insurance plan for your potential future needs**",False,False

Even though it seems too soon right now, it'll ALWAYS seem too soon. You'll never be ready without the help they're offering you. Plus, you'll be paying full-price for health insurance you don't intend on using.",False,False
