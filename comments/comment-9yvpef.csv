Well, that's the best label I've found so far, anyway.   My eating disorder started about 3 and a half years before I figured out I was trans, and 5 and a half years before I started t. Before I started t, it was ""lose weight = more masc."" Things improved a lot my first 6 months on t. Aaaand then they got worse again, because the big changes that were immediately noticable (as opposed to the bigger stuff) were less and less, and it was back to ""lose weight = more masc."" Both times, and even before figuring out I was trans, there was also the undercurrent of ""lose weight = less gross."" The ability to control my body in one way when I couldn't in another was probably also important, in retrospect.   Obviously there are like 500 other contributing factors, but my transness probably hasn't helped. I'm almost a year and a half on t now and while my dysphoria has greatly improved, the eating disorder.... has not. Fuckin RIP me.",False,False

Tbh most of the other trans people I know deal with ED in some way or another. The way gender dysphoria (for those that experience it wrt the shape of their bodies) can intersect with body dysmorphia is agonizing. In my case, my weight always goes to my butt, hips, and boobs, and I always lose weight in my waist first. So even with hrt, my figure is still more traditionally feminine which is endlessly frustrating. But then the body dysmorphia happens and when I look in the mirror all I can see is a massively wide thing with Betty Boop-esque proportions and shape lmfao",False,False
