But considerable metabolic damage ""just"" from having an ED? Barring very extreme cases? I have seen no evidence for that, and consider this talking point a scare tactic. (It's a super ineffective one, though, since it discouraged me from seeking help back when I really could have benefited from treatment. I was just like, ""Oh, so I'm already screwed? And if I eat normally ever again, I'll get instantly fat? Looks like I'm sticking with anorexia."")",False,False

Its just not a good idea. Youâ€™re probably going to end up losing your hair from malnourishment and losing a lot of muscle mass tho. You can still lose weight at a safe caloric intake.,False,False

If you go back to eating the same amount as before losing weight you will likely be in excess of your now lower tdee and regain - but if you adjust your maintenance calories to ur new weight and body composition you'll, well, maintain (with some day to day fluctuation bc of salt/period water retention etc). I guess u know this if u lift but afaik this is the source of the myth for most ppl and you don't damage your metabolism",False,False

People tend to go back to eating their original maintenance(or higher) and gain it back. Atleast in most cases.,False,False
