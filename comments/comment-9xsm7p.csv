We made this sub specifically to get out of the hair of recovery subs so we can minimise harm. There is a middle ground between actively encouraging ED behaviour to worsen, and actively encouraging recovery. And that’s minimising harm, talking about our struggles.  We aren’t recruiting anyone. This sub isn’t exclusive in that regards, we just want a safe space for anyone at any stage, any mindset, any walk of life who are dealing with EDs.  We don’t condone threatening or encouraging people to hurt themselves or kill themselves. As such I will need you to kindly get the fuck out of this sub. Thanks.",False,False
