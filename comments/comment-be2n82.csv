So if I’m still struggling after all that, I decide how many calories i’m ok with, normally at or slightly above my TDEE, and I make sure to drink loads of water in between foods. Once I hit my limit I have another mug of tea/hot chocolate and go to my room to get away from any other foods, I never eat in my room so that I don’t associate being in there with food.  What works for me is changing the urge to bing away from being a loss of control, and instead towards a form of fucked up self care,   I remind myself that eating around my TDEE for a day will not make me gain real weight, its just like pressing the pause button on losing, and that the reason I want to binge is because my body needs nutrients, and because I can’t eat this much every day, I need to be mindful about my choices.",False,False

Tell myself I can eat whatever I want as long as I log it as I go. Log right before I eat each thing  Keeps me in control and reduces my binges to nothing or just mild overeating. I also don’t try to restrict the day after a binge. That can come later, I just try to baby my body, drink lots of fluids and rest until I feel back to myself and in control again",False,False
