I recovered for a bit and now I feel like I can’t even restrict anymore, it’s just binge, binge, binge all the time. I got into fitness awhile back and now I teach group fitness partially so I have a reason to be really fit and stick to a restrictive diet, but I’m fatter than some of the people in my classes, I’m far from the fittest one there. I feel like a fraud, even though I know eating disorders have such a range, I look way too big for people to even suspect I have an issue with food",False,False

I'm restricting fairly heavily (like, goals of losing 2lbs a week) and even though eating more than like a few hundred calories at a time makes me feel physically ill and I'm skipping meals, all I can think about is food....the leftovers in the fridge....poptarts...PB&amp;Js....  You get the point, haha. Food obsession and eating disorders go hand-in-hand!",False,False

We’re also just terrified of it sometimes! Very often! Fuck’),False,False
