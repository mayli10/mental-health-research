You‚Äôre feelings are valid as much as anyone else‚Äôs. I totally feel you. With my anorexia, I can safely assume that people feel bad for me, and/or admire my strength, but with BED people are probably so quick to just go ‚Äúew‚Äù or think you‚Äôre weak or something. Whereas honestly it‚Äôs the same illness - just different sides of the coin. I hope you feel welcome here even though the restricting-type and purging-type of ED‚Äôs are the most vocal on here.

I regret).  LOL. doesn't that just about sum it all up.  as a complete side note  i honestly hadn't thought about that period of time where i was eating pints of B&amp;J multiple times a week, in... well, i guess a few months now.  i've been feeling like such a hypocrite and a faker ever since all the proed stuff happened and the creation of this sub, because i'm not officially diagnosed with anything (i mean i've never even been to any sort of doctor regarding this) and because ""BED isn't a real eating disorder, you just eat too much"" and because i felt i don't engage in enough harmful behaviours to *really* understand  but now i'm just sitting here remembering that i had a period of time, not very long ago, where i'd literally, multiple times a week, go to the store and buy pints of B&amp;J together with bags of chips and candies and just eat until i was sick while thinking of all the things i wanted to do if only i weren't eating until i was sick, and then spending the rest of my days 24/7 hating myself for it (and i still do)  and i want to say, fuck it, i am sick. i'm not just some person pretending to have problems so i can feel better about myself.  i've been doing well for about 2 months now (i'm at a 61-day streak) and it just feels like a total nightmare to remember that and i can't really process it.  and somehow this all came back to me from this discussion about ben and jerry's  ...man i dunno. sorry. needed to vent i guess.",False,False

Yeah we have total opposite stances on ice cream.
