I fucking hate my eating disorder. I still make dark jokes about it.  Not because having an eating disorder is by any means fun. It just puts things in a different perspective and highlights the absurdity of it. And it sort of works like a shield. But I can see how that might not seem appropriate or make sense.  People do get better. You can get better, even if it feels impossible now.  It doesn't have to feel like this forever. Being sick of being sick is a step in that. Do your friends and family realize how much you're struggling?   Please stay safe  ❤",False,False

It’s not fun being a walking encyclopedia of calories. It’s not fun being weak and hungry every day all the time 24/7. It’s not fun to starve yourself and it’s not fun to binge. It’s not fun to watch each and every day slip by and each week pass by with everydaybfeeling the exact same its not fucking fun,False,True
