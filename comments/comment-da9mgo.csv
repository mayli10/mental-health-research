From the way you describe him this man seems incredibly abusive and even though I know it hurts now, it's a blessing that he's decided to end the relationship.  He clearly wants to keep you on the hook for when he gets bored/runs out of options. I know it isn't easy but the absolute best thing you can do is block him. You can still cry over him, you can still miss him, but you need to make it difficult or impossible for him to contact you so he can't manipulate you anymore. His behavior is disgusting and you don't need any of that in your life. You can heal from this ‚ù§Ô∏è I'm rooting for you.",False,False

Block the bastard because I think you need time to focus on healing.
