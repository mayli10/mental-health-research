But things that help me are:  1. Baby steps, try little bites at first, don‚Äôt push yourself. Half the time it‚Äôs just the getting started that‚Äôs hard and once you get going it‚Äôs not so bad.  2. Projection, think of someone you care about or a beloved pet and imagine you are feeding them. You wouldn‚Äôt neglect them by restricting their food so sometimes it helps to imagine you are feeding them instead.  3. It‚Äôs a lot harder to gain weight than you think! The number of times over the last 10 months of trying that I‚Äôve maintained or lost despite imagining that I‚Äôd gained loads has baffled me. Eating normal meals does not make you ‚Äúfat‚Äù. You will gain a little if you‚Äôre very uw but it will be sloooow and actually take a lot of hard work. The fear of uncontrolled weight gain is irrational and part of the illness you have to be mindful of.  Very best of luck.",False,False
