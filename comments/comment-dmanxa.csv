I legit almost burst into tears in a sandwich line once because the girl making my sandwich put three slices of ham on instead of the usual two and I had to stop her from putting on TWICE the cheese that I expected. I know that she probably wasn't thinking twice about it and that other people aren't as rigid about food as I am, but god *damn* I was so fucking angry because stupid ana brain insists that she was trying to make me fat on purpose because she hates me.
