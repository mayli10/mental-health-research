I’d personally recommend talking with your counselor, that’s what they’re there for, and you only have to tell them what *you* are comfortable telling them. Whenever I wanted to purge I just thought of how it affects there body, not the whole “starvation mode” shtick that you already heard three hundred thousand times today, but what got me was the acid that comes up when you purge will straight up rot your teeth, and I was not about having dentures at 17.   I understand not wanting to confide in family, it takes a bit to get to the point where you want other people to know, and that’s something the counselor can help with. Take it one step at a time and trust in them and their advice, because I am positive that I cannot provide that level of clinical wisdom.",False,False
