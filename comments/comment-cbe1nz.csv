Tbh, I admire you for being able to choose that leap of faith. Hell, I just fucked up and was too drunk to remember to close out of MPA.  It worked out in the end though?!  &gt; Because if someone else can care so much about me, then why can‚Äôt I show myself that same treatment?  This is so underrated. It's one thing for people to tell you to love yourself, but when it feels like nobody else does...liking yourself just feels overconfident and unjustified. At least for me.  I know people hate the phrase ""you need to love yourself before anyone else can love you"", because it sounds victim blame-y, but I think this is actually what it means. We need to love ourselves (no matter how fucking *scary* it is), so we can *accept* love from others as genuine and deserved.  You're absolutely right. We can all do this. For the people who love us *and* ourselves.",False,False

When I opened up to my BF, when I truly let him see my ‚Äúweak‚Äù side. It reassured me that he truly cared and loved me and the support that he showed motivated me to try and get better. Not just for him but for me. Because if someone else can care so much about me, then why can‚Äôt I show myself that same treatment?  It‚Äôs hard lovey. I‚Äôm still working on it, this self love thing is so fucking hard. But you can do it. We can all do it. Don‚Äôt give up hope lovely. He loves you and I‚Äôm sure that won‚Äôt change if you are honest with him about your struggles. You can grow stronger together ‚ù§Ô∏è",False,False

You and his ex aren't the only two women in the world. He could've tried to date anyone. Hell, he could've chosen to keep trying to win her back, like a dumb dodo.  But he chose *you.*  For what it's worth, the first real trust in my relationship was when my wife accidentally found out how ""messed up"" I am - and still stayed, and still loved me.

When we were still together I asked my ex who at our school he found sexiest and it was the skinniest girl out of the cheer team. I was probably 80 lbs heavier than her at the time no joke.
