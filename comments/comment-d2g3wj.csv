Some were female, but actually more were male.   I'm jealous that I can't relate, never had an issue with gaining weight.   Oddly enough, when weight is discussed I actually feel outside of myself and my current best friend, I was hearing more from the skinny people who can't gain weight than from people vocalizing being overweight. Must just be my odd pool of friends / associsates.   For reference of demographic: late teens to early 20s as well as one older woman (50s)",False,False

But then once people gain weight and aren‚Äôt considered attractive, culture responds by telling people the correct way to deal with that is by cutting off food completely, don‚Äôt eat whatsoever, feel ashamed for the person you‚Äôve become.

However I have met people in treatment who have experienced this! I think it‚Äôs a really interesting side of the disorder that isn‚Äôt discussed enough - the way people perceive your disorder can later affect your own perception of the disorder and can negatively impact your recovery if your disordered behaviours were accepted.

They have to be disordered to achieve it. Society normalises ""weight loss is everyone's goal"" and has made it really acceptable. I'm disturbed by what I've encountered in other people and I can't be superficial.  No one ever says they want to put on weight, or they know they're too thin, or they have an eating disorder. I think the distorted perceptions people have of themselves as being ""fat"" when they're far from it, and them finding fault with themselves is triggering.   I don't think any good comes from it and it drags other people down. My self-dialogue is complicated. It's for therapy or whatever.
