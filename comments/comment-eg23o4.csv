When I relapse I start with straight hard restriction, no exercise. Not even at home stuff. Basically just be a blob who doesn‚Äôt eat.   And then someone usually picks up on that I‚Äôm back on my bullshit and calls me out, so I ‚Äústart eating‚Äù again.   Then that‚Äôs when I join the gym. Lol. So I can ‚Äúeat normal‚Äù but then purge out the calories with exercise. I aim for minimum 4 days a week, but ultimately I want at least one hour a day, especially cardio since it burns the most.   Then once people chill the fuck out I start restricting hard again. But still workout. Pretty much just aim to burn off what few calories I do eat. I‚Äôll do that until not eating exhausts me too much and then I stop working out and just restrict.   And then the cycle begins again!",False,False

I feel it actually reduces appetite and increases my motivation to eat well becuase I don‚Äôt want to have spent 30 minutes busting my ass for nothing.   However, realistically, this doesn‚Äôt always happen and I end up sitting on the couch with zero energy ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è I think u gotta find the combo that works for you!
