Like if were *really* anorexic then binging wouldn't be such a huge problem for me. It really sucks that there's a hierarchy of eating disorders and that anything other than purely restricting is seen as 'less than'. EDs are already so competetive without all of us being made to feel like we need to do a better job of starving ourselves in order to be Valid™. No matter whether people want to admit it or not, anorexia is associated with cOnTRoL and willpower while any other form of disordered eating is looked at as sloppy and weak.

Of course, any kind of anorexia eventually leads to binging as your body freaks about trying not to die, but if you binge on a daily basis because you starved yourself all day due to anorexia that's probably what it is. I don't know that much about subtypes though, so maybe I'm wrong.  Sometimes I kinda do wish things were worse for me, but I'm somebody with a lot of self-control and experience recovering from mental illnesses, so I feel that I would have have no excuse even if I did struggle to control my impulses to starve myself. Like, after I lost 30 lbs I literally just told myself that I was getting better and I was going to stop losing weight. Would literally force myself to eat even if it made me cry and it would be so exhausting trying to recover, but it worked I guess. I would occassionally take breaks for a week or so just to get back the energy I spent on recovery, but it's not like one week will undo over a month of progress. I eventually started to eat maintenance calories and later even got back to a healthy weight despite having developed some kind of problem that makes it so my body doesn't process food properly. I still get that urge though. Anorexia is always at the back of my mind telling me that it would be so easy to just starve myself and that I could just give in if I wanted to. I know that I look better at a healthy weight though and that it's actually easier after all this time to eat enough than it is to starve myself. I don't know if this is the same thing you were talking about, but that's my experience. I kind of just wish I could give in and get somebody else to help me so I could have a better excuse when I don't succeed in other areas after spending all of my energy looking after my health. If I didn't want to get better I could focus on other things and have professionals waste their energy looking after my health. In my experience though nobody ever comes to help you. One time a friend was worried I might kill myself and reported me to my college and the most I got in terms of help was a diagnosis for a problem I already knew I had. No follow up to help me manage or to improve my mental health. I just find that if I want anything in life I have to do it myself and if I don't focus on my health I can't focus on other things. Of course, even when I do focus on my health I can't focus on other things because it's very hard to take care of myself with the resources I have and no support, so I'm kind of stuck just focusing on my health because it's at least better to be healthy and not doing anything than to be unhealthy and not doing anything.",False,False

I've struggled with binge eating longer than anything, before I even knew what an ed was. Long story short, had a crisis putting 2 and 2 together between abuse and how it affected me and started hating myself and my obese body bc of what happened. It seems like every extra pound is a testament to my shitty past and what ""plw"" did to me as a kid. My mom and sister are both under 100 pounds. I'm the only fat one. If it hadn't happened... i could have been pretty. I could have been happy. So i started fasting and purging as a last act of defiance and an attempt to reclaim myself and my body. I lost about 80 pounds but still my lw was still only about 21-22 bmi. I never even got to be skinny. I keep telling myself I can't recover yet. I've never even been thin... plus i just had a baby and I'm still working off that weight and I'm like 155-160 now and hate myself. (185 at the highest pregnancy weight and highest overall was around 195 to 200 and I'm 5'2"" i know I'm disgusting).
