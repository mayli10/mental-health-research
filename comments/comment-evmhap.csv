I get asked if I have spare change several times a day. Much as I'd like to give them money, I can't give everyone money and I don't want to play god. I don't ever carry cash on me anymore, and walk as fast as I can.   It makes me feel guilty and selfish as well, and it makes me feel guilty that I feel bad, because they clearly have it much worse than me (although I am, I think justifiably, scared that I will one day soon end up like them), so how dare I feel bad.   I don't have any wisdom to share, and I'm sorry that you feel that way, but it did make me feel a little less alone reading it.",False,False
