This comment means the world; it truly does.  I don't even know that he treated me ""bad"", per se. I just feel like... wow, something in me must be so damn wrong and bad and unworthy to make him act one way during the date and then ignore me afterwards. But I know that's the tendency of people with chronic low self-esteem; there's no way I would NOT blame myself.  Again, thank you, and I wholeheartedly believe in you, too. ",False,True

Things are still hard but I’m in recovery and feeling more ok than I thought possible...keep fighting. You are strong and you will get through this and you DESERVE to eat and be a person who’s life isn’t ruled by numbers. You are valid and worthy and good. ,False,False
