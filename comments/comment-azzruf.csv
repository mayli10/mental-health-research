My boyfriend has started to catch on, through small things for example: if we eat a big dinner I’ll promise out loud to myself that I will do better tomorrow, hearing me complain about my body or telling him not to touch me in certain places because it’s too fat, also when he sleeps over he gets to experience my morning weigh-ins and the excitement i have when I’ve lost weight.   he feels sorry for me, i feel bad that i let him see small slivers of how miserable i am.",False,False

My parents aren't the type to understand, and I don't have the kind of relationship with either of them where we tell each other anything remotely personal.  It does help, for me, to have at least one person who knows, if only so I don't have to lie to EVERYONE. But it's also a risk at least in my eyes, because then you open up all those possibilities of someone invalidating your problems, or saying something insensitive, or even just my own mind trying to convince me I need to get sicker to 'prove' to this person I have a problem.",False,False

I feel like not sharing is lying but at the same time I don't tell him everything. I only bring it up if he asks directly or if something is particularly hard. I have other people I talk to about my ed struggles so I only go to my boyfriend with the really big stuff ",False,False
