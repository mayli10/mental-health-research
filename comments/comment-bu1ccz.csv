Whenever I stop restricting I feel like my imagination turns back on, but then I lose it again when I go back. I hate that we feel the need to give up so much of ourselves to reach something so arbitrary.",False,False

Worse: whenever i see her texts, i think “oh cool, ill respond to her in a minute” and then suddenly its 10 hours later and i still haven’t answered and then i dont answer at all because “whats the point”. I cant really grasp the passage of time these days, apparently.  A girl i dont even know pulled me aside to ask me if im better and to tell me i can always talk to her - because apparently ive been so brain dead that i legit havent talked to literally anyone unless they directly speak to me and everyone is getting worried.",False,True

I haven’t thought about anything except my weight and diet in weeks. It’s making me completely calllous-my friend is in the hospital and I keep forgetting because I’m so focused on what kind of soup to have for dinner.,False,False
