Think about it though even though you feel bigger and that sucks a lot not trying to downplay it. But you said the depression is getting better which means you must be feeling better at least a little bit mentally besides the feeling bigger. Hold onto that there is your hope. Hold on to the good feelings. Maybe urge surfing and realizing feelings are just that and they come and go may help. Though I prefer distractions from unhelpful or unwanted feelings or thoughts. Which is just doing something you like anything in the world. Reading or working or drawing or writing or cleaning whatever floats your boat.,False,False
