Although I have no idea what you mean in the first paragraph.  My intention was not to label you as sexist, and I know you didn't tell me to leave.  It's just that me leaving, will not fix the attitude of some of this sub. It needs to be addressed, that is all.",False,True

Just because the main subreddit of a topic isn’t gender-specific doesn’t mean there’s no benefit to creating a space in that topic that *is* gender specific.",False,False

Not because the main subs are for men only, but because it's good to have a space where the vibe is closer to what you experience when the main subs just naturally have a gender disparity.    I'm not saying leave this sub and only go to a men's space. I'm saying this sub should cater to both, and men should also have a space where they know they are the forefront of the conversation.   I specifically did not say to leave here, you saying I am attempting to exile you is far off base.",False,False

Now this I do take offense with. I know that the eating disorder community is dominated by women, and that in itself is sad.  But this sub is not geared towards just women, specifically stating so in the rules. I won't be exiled here because of a select group of sexist women.   I get that you're trying to provide helpful advice, but that is exactly the problem. This sub is not just for women.",False,True

There isn't a vocal minority of men speaking up here, so it's not something posters have in the forefront of their mind when posting. It also might behoove you to seek out/make an ED men's space?

But it's also a safe space for men too.  I'm all for venting about men, some men are assholes sure!   But what I've seen on this sub lately, is blatant sexism. Not the venting kind, just pure hate against men. Especially if it's reiterated several times.  I love this sub, because it's a safe space.

I'm not saying it's okay, but also just remember a lot of people consider this a safe space to vent. Sometimes when you vent what you say is not worded exactly how you mean it.
