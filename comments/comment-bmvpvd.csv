If they could be completely honest, I feel like many men are attracted to underweight women because they look younger and so much weaker. I grew up with a lot of dude friends and wanting to be the macho caveman with a tiny, frail partner has NOT gone out of style.   But they know that it would make them sound gross to admit that they want a partner who is small, frail, and young, so they hyperfixate on the idea that skinny = healthy because it's ""just natural to be attracted to health"" when, evolutionarily speaking, a good breeding partner would be one with plenty of muscle, a little bit of fat for food scarcity, and enough energy to bear children. Like if you are really going to try and argue the paleo approach, it's not ""natural/biologically wired"" to be more attracted to women who look like they wouldn't survive pregnancy.

Women also aren't the ones who fight about the steroids thing, in my experience? Mostly dudes battle over whether its natty or not lmao. And there's so much more variety in attractive male physiques compared to women. Like, if men don't only think that the underweight big tits lady is hot, he's literally given labels. Chubby chaser. Or he 'likes amazonians' or 'death by snu snu' and shit like that. Idk I'm tired and ranting. Sweet dreams lol",False,True

It really fucks me up that the societal ideal for a women's body is one that is usually unhealthy and only really acheivable by ignoring our natural hunger cues to some degree. I don't think that any of the male celebreties that are touted by the media as the ""sexiest"" or ""fittest"" have a sub-18 BMI, but for women it seems to be the #1 requirement.  I mean, im generalizing a little bit (its 5 am and i need to go back to bedü§°) but i could rant about this shit for hours.",False,False
