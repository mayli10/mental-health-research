I was (am) (kind of) dating a man that is a bit overweight and it has been really triggering for me. I hear him talking about doing keto but he just half-asses it and also, I think keto is just ridiculous. Hello saturated fat. I mean, maybe vegan keto is good, but anyways...And to top it off, he is so mean. He hates homeless people, people who are flamboyantly homosexual, emotional people, you name it. Pretty certain he hates me 80% of the time, too, but I use his criticism as fuel for my disorder. So who's the fucked up one? aha. Yeeaah.",False,False
