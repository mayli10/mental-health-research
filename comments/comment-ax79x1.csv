Plus acid reflux, bad scarring on my hands from purging and eroded tooth enamel. It's just not worth it having to deal with this sort of thing for the rest of your life. ",False,False

I am in my 20's and already suffering from severe GI issues. My esophagus has so much acid erosion that I cant even take ibuprofen anymore. Also have you ever heard of GERD? Because thats caused by so much acid in your esophagus that you basically have bile in your throat anytime you lay down. So please try your best and don't choose this lifestyle. ,False,False

It was a famous legal case but basically she ended up brain dead because of bulimia, I didn't know that until a month or so ago but reading about it scared me a bit.   Regarding medical consequences, I'm sure you know about teeth problems/malnutrition and all but there are a ton of others. We are more likely to get throat cancer. Our stomachs and insides can burst and kill us. Imagine being found dead hanging over the toilet. We can wreck our digestive system, have to be put on dialysis or reliant on medical treatment and hospitalization for basic function. Heart attacks are a big risk too. Every time I hear of a *healthy* woman who had a heart attack in her 30s/40s for seemingly no reason I always wonder.  If you want an accountability buddy I'm trying to quit purging too. I haven't in almost 2 weeks and want to keep this up. We can PM each other daily or weekly or whatever you like, just let me know. Its hard but we can do this.",False,False
