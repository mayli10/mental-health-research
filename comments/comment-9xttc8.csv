For what it's worth, a thread I really wanted to recover was this one: https://goutiest-zorse-5012.dataplicity.io/ProED_Trees/t3_9w03l9.html  I remember saving it just last week as a post to show people if they ever felt r/proed was toxic or harmful. Then the sub got banned for being toxic and harmful and the post was gone.  This is the post I'll show people to help them understand that it wasn't like that. A post with a beautiful message, not telling people what to do, but just sharing an experience. And every single comment supportive. Feel free to share it on your own if you think it might help.",False,False
