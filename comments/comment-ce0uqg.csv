When I'm not extremely restrictive like I am right now, I usually get up to 1800. When that happens I have so much more energy and burn a TON of calories. Like on days like that my Fitbit clocks up to 6 HOURS of active time  So I usually end the day with like. At least a 1000 cal deficit, if not up to 1300",False,False

Id often feel invalidated when hearing about anorexics that exercise for multiple times a day,False,False

In my latest relapse I ate between 1200-1600 calories every day while exercising at least an hour a day + walking 12k steps. Anorexia isn't diagnosed based on how many calories you consume.,False,False

That is why in the new DSM they specify that it can be either deliberate restriction OR persistent behavior that interferes with weight gain.   I eat around 2k a day and often feel like the restriction part of my ED is invalid because of it, but like you am also am big into exercise and do very long runs. We’re basically high-restricting and not responding to the additional energy needs of our bodies from exercise. It is hard because you see other people fasting and subsisting on teeny tiny amounts of food but that’s not everyone. I am not AN but am nearing underweight and eat what most people would think of as “normal” or even excessive for being short and thin.",False,False

I run 5 days a week (splitting my runs into 2 each day, so I run for an hour+ most days) plus I run/walk in place to get 25K steps everyday. I feel like I’m the only one who tries to get so many steps but it’s become an addiction and I feel terrible if I don’t reach a certain number.",False,False
