My main sport is Eventing but I’m just starting to do more now (cycling, running, swimming) so as I’m getting fitter I’m getting more and more obsessed.",False,True

Being an athlete doesn't invalidate your illness.,False,False

It’s good to know I’m not alone in the struggle. I’m an event rider (horse triathlon basically, have to be under certain weight for my smallest horse) and cyclist, looking at starting triathlons (just getting back into running and starting swimming), and I dance for fun actually because I admire dancer’s figures. Plenty going on sports wise. I can hit 15 hours a week when my uni work load is mid to low.   I’m only 5’1 so I’ll only burn 1500kcal a day when almost sedentary. As I love eating naturally I’ll eat 2000 a day so I love my more active days because I can binge for my macros (obviously on the right food). I can relate about eating right when competitions are coming up and making your macros etc. Didn’t mention I eat a vegan diet so that helps me to eat lower calorie foods too.   It makes sense about the substance abuse theory, it’s similar to self harm isn’t it really. I suppose in a way it’s another form of SH.",False,True

Eating disorders can certainly be comorbid with the other mental health conditions you mentioned.  I'm a collegiate dancer (formerly competitive swimmer as well) and train 15-25 hours per week in all, both dance and cross training. My TDEE is a lot higher than I'm willing to believe it is, around 2500-3000.  I have Bulimia, but I also need to watch my figure and food intake for dance. I can keep this separate from my eating disorder for the most part, but at times of high stress I tend to crack and relapse. I tend to view eating disorders with the substance abuse theory — no one is ever truly recovered (has a wholly natural and healthful relationship with food and their body), but the condition can be well managed and almost silent. Control issues and eating disorders go hand in hand in pretty much all of the medical literature.  I learned to compartmentalize pretty early on. In times of necessity, I can ""turn off"" the eating disorder, but it's always very calculated and tends to be more of a temporary transition to orthodox food habits. I don't binge and purge before performances, for example, or during intensives (think training camp) or teaching workshops. The second my situation is lower stakes I fall (often willingly) back into disordered habits.  But I cannot just quit counting calories and tracking my food because I will overeat, undereat, or miss essential micronutrients if I do, and I expect to be this way for the rest of my life regardless of how long my dance career lasts. I have other factors that complicate recovery, too. The common advice for beating binge eating and purging boils down to eat whatever you want when hungry without tracking or viewing nutrition labels, etc, alongside intense mental work. I have Celiac disease and several food allergies that mean this would make me incredibly ill.",False,False

A lot of people on here seem to not be athletes so I sort of use that to separate myself - if you’re an athlete or not I don’t mind.   Think I’m in denial over it though. I’m diagnosed anxiety and depression already so I guess they can come hand in hand with eating disorders? Just worried I’ll lose control of the urges to control during stressful times (if that makes sense?),False,True

I do want to say that this sounds like a very real manifestation of an eating disorder and that the belief and mindset is what makes an act disordered, not the act itself.",False,False
