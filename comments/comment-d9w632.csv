One of the reasons I decided to recover is to look prettier. I just love the external validation . One of my bulimia triggers is my skin. I have naturally perfect skin. It‚Äôs pale and poreless and I always get complements on it. If I get a small blemish once in a blue moon it triggers me because I feel people won‚Äôt love me if am not perfect. I even became orthorexic to keep my skin pretty. It‚Äôs exhausting and I felt so alone but it‚Äôs good to know someone else feels like a raging narcissist.,False,False

It requires treating people like shit, whether overtly or covertly.

And I used to feel bad about feeling so shallow about my appearance and public persona, but honestly, what in our waking lives isn't image-oriented? At heart, I think it's very little.
