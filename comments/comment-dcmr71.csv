Calories are how much energy a food releases when it's set on fire. Well, if you burn charcoal it will not burn up for a long-ass time, but we all know if we eat charcoal we aren't going to gain weight for the supposed 10,000 or whatever calories it relases.",False,False

Calories are energy, and, say, a rock can’t have energy.   A wooden chair would have calories because trees have energy. A metal chair would not.
