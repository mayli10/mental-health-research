A lack of energy, sense of humor and happiness really does change how attractive someone is!!  A few semesters ago, when I was gaining rapidly (into obese territory) and pretty depressed, I was dismayed because I was getting less attention from guys as well as potential friends. I suspected it was all because of the weight... I knew that if I got back to a healthy BMI and people liked me again, I'd be forever paranoid that people only liked me when I'm thinner, so I made a conscious effort to be happier and friendlier, and to take care of myself even though I was fat.   Lo and behold, I started getting more friends and strangers were so much kinder to me, etc! The only thing that was different was I got hit on less, but I expected that so it was cool.   That's just my experience with the problem you're facing now :) make of it what you will!!",False,False
