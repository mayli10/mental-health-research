I definitely need to recognize that my eating disorder factors into this choice if I want to attempt to mitigate its influence.    I just have a nasty habit of over analyzing and then jumping for one option because it ‚Äújust seems right‚Äù... not necessarily the best course of action for non-neurotypicals üòÇ.    Totally did help, thank you ‚ù§Ô∏è",False,True

When you begin to starve and lose body fat, the brain changes to focus on food. It is a survival mechanism of course. But it literally alters your thought process... unfortunately there is no remedy except eating more. :( I'm sorry. this sounds like a really difficult dilemma for you.",False,False
