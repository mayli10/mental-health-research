Last week I was so close to my GW, less than a pound, and the same day I binged, and it ended up being a 3 days binge, and now I'm 2 pounds away.  I binged because I was like fuck it, I'm so close, what now? What will I work for after that? Set a new goal and hope it'll make me happy?It will not, I already know,might as well sabotage myself.  I always think about the children part, I'm still young, I know, but sometimes I really start to reflect on the amount of fuck shit I'm doing to my body and ruining it forever even though I would love to have children in the future.   Being skinny doesn't mean anything, but I desperately want it.  I desperately want to disappear. Like for real, I don't want to be here living my life like this.  The only thing that motivates me is the hope that one day I'll be normal. It has to be, right? I can't be in my damn 60s with an ED, can I? Of course I can,  I just try to not think about it.   Sending love, we'll get better one day.",False,False
