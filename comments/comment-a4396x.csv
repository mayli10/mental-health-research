I'm terrified that I'm going to gain weight when I go home in two weeks. Except I'm also terrified at what my parents' reaction is going to be when they see that I've lost weight, because they're always threatening to help me stop paying for school...",False,False

I can usually get out enough that my mom wouldn’t notice me not eating but this weekend I have ZERO plans.  I’m gonna skip breakfast both days and try to hit the treadmill, hopefully to at least curb any gain.  Could you make plans that happen during meal times? Meet a friend for coffee (even if the friend doesn’t show lol), go to the library, gym, mall, whatever? I did that a bit the last time I stayed with relatives. I think I only ate one or two meals with them for a weekend.",False,False

If you’re really struggling, feign being ill and stay in bed while they’re eating. Can always ask for some pedialyte or water and dry crackers, to help your upset stomach. Yeah it’s bad to lie to your family, but you’re lying to them either way and this way you can try to avoid purging. ",False,False

While I'm still very bad at relapsing when home, I always tell my parents I'll eat whats at home when they get fast food. My mom will sometimes make me buy my own groceries but if im buying cheap shes fine w jt. Also my family knows im trying to ""eat healthy"" so that's always my excuse! being vegetarian helps w tht excuse as before it wouldve been weird to hear me say tht which is also weird bc its not rlly their concern?  But anyway, maybe try doing that just cooking w whats at home or you choosing the food? ",False,False

And use that to justify needing your own healthier options?,False,False
