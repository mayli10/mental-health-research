I have been on a ton of medications since I was diagnosed in 2000. It took a lot of different doctors to finally find one who diagnosed me correctly and put me on the right kind of drug (that was about 3 years ago.) I was absolutely at rock bottom at that point, two involuntary visits to the psych ward in a 3 month period kind of rock bottom. There are tons of drugs out there and it does take a lot of trial and error to find the right one or combination of them. I don't have depression so I can't say much about the types of meds they prescribe for them, I can just relate to your trials.   And I feel you on not being able to lose weight. My BED was out of control all year this year and I gained back a lot of weight that I had lost. I think I finally have it under control at this point but I never know when BED is going to rear it's ugly head.",False,False
