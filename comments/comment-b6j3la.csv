The first time I lied and said I’d try.  2nd time I told her the truth, no, I’d hate myself even more for eating more ",False,False

I view ED as a different means to the same end I was seeking drugs and alcohol. It changes how I feel and helps me ignore emotions I don’t want. ",False,False

That's one way to spot someone who is self-diagnosed with bullshit: when they shame or judge others as a matter of course (we all have nasty weak moments where we aren't our best, I mean in general).

I'm by no means perfect at not judging people( continually working on it, though). But ever since this stuff started, I feel like I'm much more sympathetic than I used to be. And two quotes I read awhile ago are on my mind a lot. they are like  ""Everyone you meet is fighting a battle you know nothing about.""  and  ""If you are willing to look at another person's behavior towards you as a reflection of the state of their relationship with themselves rather than as a statement about your value as a person, you will, over the course of time, cease to react at all.""
