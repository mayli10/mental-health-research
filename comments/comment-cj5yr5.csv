Most the time I'm the one initiating and He turns me down more than I turn him down. He knows that me getting him off during my period is still a thing.",False,True

He probably wasn’t expecting sexy times today, especially if he knew you were on ur period, so he got himself off.   The watching porn during sex is a problem, though. Maybe try asking him why, or if there’s something specific he wants that he’s not getting.   He’s definitely in the wrong here overall, but if you love him, it’s workable.",False,False

It is a problem with HIM. He has real issues if he needs porn as a crutch in bed, and I guarantee he'd be pulling this crap (like with beating off and then not being able to have sex as a result) no matter who you were or what you looked like. He has a problem with porn. That's what's at issue here.",False,False

It sounds like he's got his own issues if he's using porn several times a day to get off while in a relationship...tbh sounds like you guys need to have a conversation about it generally.
