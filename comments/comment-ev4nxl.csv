I do agree with you that a lot of this is me being self critical rather than necessarily reality - I'm sure my team won't actually think any less of me, that fear is probs in my own head. I think anything to do with physical performance triggers a bit of an ED meltdown cause it's like the conflict between ED brain and knowing logically that my ED habits are going to be detrimental to that. Maybe it's the ED fearing it's losing a bit of control?   I think I'm just going to see how I get on at my first session back and if I feel like I'm not coping I'll sit myself out and have a chat with my coach after the session, depending on how badly it actually goes.  I totally take your point about the fainting thing - if that actually happens I'll sit out and I'm not planning on competing until I'm happy I can cope.  Hopefully it all goes fine üôè",False,True

Which is 100% relatable, but when I‚Äôm getting into that mindset, it‚Äôs often not helpful because ultimately I have no control what other people think or how they react. All I can do is to take the actions that are most effective for *me*. The two concerns I hear tumbling around for you are (a) the coach will think you‚Äôre not trying unless you justify your reduced ability level and (b) if you attempt to justify the reduced ability level you‚Äôll be judged for that. So, ‚Äòlazy‚Äô one way and ‚Äòattention seeking‚Äô the other, but maybe try to remember that‚Äôs your own brain throwing out those harsh labels. I‚Äôve had loads of conversations where I got lambasted...and most of them only happened in my head.   There‚Äôs a spectrum of options to choose from I think. If you‚Äôre able to safely perform at the minimum acceptable level for the team, then you don‚Äôt necessarily *have* to explain anything. You go out there, do your best, and to any comments can say, ‚Äúthis is the best I‚Äôve got today. I lost a bit of fitness lately but I‚Äôm working hard to get it back.‚Äù Another option is to tell the coach you had a health issue recently. If it‚Äôs appropriate/true you can say that you‚Äôve received help or that things are improving and that you‚Äôre ok to play but at a slightly reduced intensity for a little while. If you feel it‚Äôs necessary to give specifics, I‚Äôd try to remember that the coach‚Äôs response is on the coach. If it‚Äôs the truth of what you‚Äôre going through, that‚Äôs not attention seeking or laziness. It‚Äôs just the truth.   It‚Äôs maybe a little concerning that you feel you‚Äôre at a place where you might be passing out during practice. Thaaaat‚Äôs probably not going to be a positive experience. So, maybe it‚Äôs something to think about whether you‚Äôre able to safely participate at this juncture? That said, athletic pursuits have been a great motivation for me to improve my nutrition and can also be something that helps me feel more at home in my body. I hope your sport will offer similar benefits for you!",False,False

Its quite a full on sport so if you have certain health issues you have to get certified fit to play, I don't think they'd let me be vague with it. I could certainly try in the first instance though.",False,True

You could say you're dealing with some health issues that might effect your performance. It should be sufficient enough information.,False,False
