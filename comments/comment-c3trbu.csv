Yeah I just wish I could forget about it completely but it's like weight is somehow tied to everything else about my appearance as well, like I can't go to work without makeup bc I feel awful about my own face and it's the same with my body. I feel ashamed that my natural ""set point"" weight isn't a tight 18.5 bmi and I know I shouldn't because I'm still perfectly healthy rn, but then I think about the validation from other people I received when I was that size and it's just...ugh. I truly do want to get ""better"" because I need to stop saying ""I can't do X or Y until I lose 10lbs"" and shutting myself in at home (which has been my summer so far lmfao) but I'm frustrated at the way that society (both in the US and East Asia) genuinely seems to reward/worship the look of borderline underweight bodies but with bigger tits lol",False,True

Your appetite is based on habits. Being less obsessed over food will help you eat less, but you also need to eat an amount that can sustain your body and eat a consistent amount at consistent times in order for your appetite to be consistent without effort. Eventually it just becomes a habit and the hunger hormones in your body will tell you how much to eat an when, but it takes a lot of work to get there.",False,False

Is that the only compliment we know how to give? Like can we uplift people without discussing physical appearances?   But yeah I really don't know how to have a healthy relationship to food when all of society basically tells me that the way my body naturally is isn't as attractive as the way it is when I'm eating less. And the orthorexia thing confuses me too, because on one hand I do agree there are a lot of low key orthorexics in the recovery/health community (or ones who no longer want to look skeletal and instead become obsessed with looking ""fit"" and lifting lol hashtag foodisfuel) but I also have this internal conflict of like, is it really disordered of me to avoid processed foods when it's known to have addictive effects/be engineered to be hyper-palatable, or is it wrong for me to get upset seeing parents give their children full sugar Coca Cola or is it all just my fucked up brain being stupid because unlike normal people, I can't just stop at 1 slice of cake so I'm projecting onto others..........",False,True

It’s so frustrating to try and have a healthy relationship with food and your body when society rewards being thin, even underweight. To me this definitely started and continues to be at least partly rooted in vanity and liking myself better thin (but also, how I cope with things...)  I actually don’t even know the difference anymore between healthy weight control practices/caring about my health and what’s disordered and obsessive. Like obviously when I b/p that is not good but a lot of the other stuff...I don’t know. Sometimes the recovery community and the health nuts that basically have orthorexia feel like two extremes and I don’t know what’s normal or what I even want for myself. I have no idea what is normal or healthy.  I would push back on the idea that a model can’t find an unconventionally attractive person beautiful. I think it’s possible to hate your own body and see beauty in other people...I know I do. I think some larger women are absolutely gorgeous. Kelly Clarkson comes to mind her weight fluctuates but she always looks stunning to me. Also sometimes people just radiate confidence and that might be what they say they want. That being said I do think a lot of the body positive/Instagram feel good party is problematic and toxic. It’s all a popularity contest and also continues to reinforce the idea that being beautiful is what matters in life.   Anyway that was a lot of rambling but just wanted to relate. It’s a shitty world in a lot of ways and it definitely makes it harder. You’re not alone.",False,False
