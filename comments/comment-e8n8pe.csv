Don't know how to go about it since I'm a pretty passive person and despite what I'm gonna type about her she is a really good friend. Guess I just need to throw it out there to release the negative feelings hopefully, and it's ""safer"" in my mind to throw it here than make a separate post. My age will probably show here since it's just young adult drama.  Been feeling pretty invalidated by my friend lately. We go on these food trips on the breaks in between classes and since I feel a lot safer with her I'll usually eat a lot more. I've hinted before at some struggles with food but she said the whole, you know you weren't fat to begin with, and that was kind of the start it all. After saying I was depressed usually after eating, while packing up her leftovers she scoffed and made a joke about throwing them up later and I didn't know how to respond. She's made other kind of questionable comments here and there too. The TW comes in when I was revealing that I was worried about nerve damage in my arms from cutting and I was getting shocks and tingles almost daily. She then mumbled through an explanation that I'd probably would have had to cut pretty deep to get damage and it just fueled some stupid competitive part in me. It feels like what I do is never enough, I'm never ""sick"" enough.  The most recent one that really made me think about all this is the fact that she wanted to go get take-out and asked if I was ""still on my diet"". I passed on it but when she was about to drop me off she said she would just make something at home and praised ""my control"" for inspiring her. Talk about a punch in the gut lol. I know it's not emotionally healthy to depend on someone's opinion of yourself so much, she's just one of the few people in my world that I feel open with and these things are making me distance myself a bit from her. But every time I bring up something serious I'm going through, it's just ""same"" and then a joke :/",False,False

I feel like that's fairly close to ""healthy"" territory, if not in it. It's not like I'm planning to binge.   I don't cut faster than 500 calories a day; I lose strength if I'm more aggressive than that.   Two nights ago, I had an unplanned cheat meal/evening/clusterfuck. Probably about 1500 calories over maitenance XP   I thought, ""well, no biggie- if I spend 3 days cutting this week, or heck, even two, that'll make it not compound too bad with the planned cheats.""   But that day, my lifts all felt so weak, that I decided I could not possibly cut starting that day. I feel quite uncomfortable about it. I'm actually suspicious that I've been underestimating my maintenance, but my IBS has been so insane this past month that I have not bothered to weigh myself. So I have no idea. Also now I'm scared to weigh myself because of how long it has been. So that's how my holidays have been going so far.",False,False
