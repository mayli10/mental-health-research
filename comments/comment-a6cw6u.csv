I know from experience and witnessing that b/p helped me lose weight at 11. I don‚Äôt stuff like that anymore because I love my teeth too much. I‚Äôve also stopped laxative abuse because I just felt bloated all the time. ,False,False

The breakdown does a good job explaining why exactly it's so harmful to spread that information in recovery as fact set in stone. It creates distrust between the recovery professional and ED sufferer to have the professional tell the sufferer information the sufferer knows to be false from personal experience.  The same thing applies to other recovery tips too, I've heard many recovery coaches say that the only sole reason for obesity is crash dieting and that enduring any tiny amount of hunger to be a normal BMI instead of overweight/obese is an eating disorder.",False,False

The study's conclusion was that there's a ceiling of around 400-500 calories that is the maximum possible amount to be absorbed from each binge. 50% comes from the average binge size of the study being around 1200 calories. Some with binges as high as 4000 calories in the study only absorbed 400-500 calories max too.  I don't want to promote this illness in any way, it's a trap I'm going to struggle with for the rest of my life, but there have been weeks where I've been stuffing my face literally every chance I get (+5000cal/day) while still losing significant weight. I know that recovery professionals don't want to cause any harm by saying half of all calories are absorbed, but it's simply not true in my case and misinformation doesn't benefit anyone. Everyone binges differently, everyone purges differently. Those who are the most efficient at getting everything out tend to end up underweight and have an official diagnosis of AN B/P instead of BN, thus not being included in the beforementioned study.
