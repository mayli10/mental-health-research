I feel like it’s hard for me to enjoy anything when my mental health is bad. I used to love drawing so much as a kid, but now I barely think to do it bc I feel like I have no need to express myself yknow? Like I honestly feel like a shell of a person sometimes bc my brain and emotions get so blunted by my mental illnesses + restriction. It sucks dude",False,False

I’m a painter, also into sketching and anything art related, but I love using oil paint as a medium. I used to paint a lot of dragons, elven inspired landscapes and portraits, and I did some commission work as well. Now because of a combination of my ED and alcoholism I’ve started this weird abstract self portrait era where all I can paint is fucked up images of myself. Surreal interpretations of a human figure, usually bald and way too skinny, with a gruesome expression. Either blank or black eyes, a huge gaping mouth or no mouth at all. I can’t do anything else- just get drunk and paint these fucked up interpretations of myself on huge canvases. I have 8 in my studio right now so I can’t even look at anything else.  Sorry that turned into a rant but I understand, this fucking disorder kills happiness and creativity and spawns only darkness.",False,False

Starve.""   Omg I remember feeling that way about my art back when I was at my worst. When I was losing weight steadily and my life revolved around restricting, I definitely felt my motivation to draw waned somewhat in the face of my new obsession.   I have to admit though, part of why I turned to restricting in the first place was because it was a particularly stressful period of my life, during which I had no time to draw. Drawing was always my primary love and coping mechanism in life, and I was desperate for something else that could help (and that wasn't self-injury). Then I discovered dieting and, before I knew it, it had almost taken precedence over drawing. That's when I realized that this restricting thing had kind of spiraled out of hand. Around then drawing became ironically, an escape, my brief reprieve away from my constant angst over my weight.",False,False

I am a professional actor, I work six days a week in the theatre, with a full slate of performances at night. When I’m in full on restriction, I get so worried because I feel myself having lower energy, dropping lines. I get terrified someone will notice, but mostly I feel disappointed in myself for not keeping myself healthy.  In terms of coping, I just try to remember there is no rule for creativity. Having an ED doesn’t dilute your imagination or your drive, it just takes away your drive to complete a vision. I have to believe I can still perform at the level that’s expected",False,False
