Just before I started taking vitamins and stuff though I was starting to get numbness in my extremities and tooth aches. After I started both symptoms went away. They didn't just stop getting worse, they're gone. There are obviously concerns with severe weight loss like increasing the risk of heart failure which aren't solely influenced by nutrition, but without all of the other symptoms it's hard to find problems like that in patients. So reasonably if they make it seem like physical health is the only problem and you can manage your symptoms well enough it's easy to get sucked into thinking eating disorders are a good thing. When you see underweight people who appear healthy you have to assume it's possible. They should focus much more on the mental health aspect of eating disorders than the physical health aspect.

I didn't succeed in purging. I don't seem to have a gag reflex and I think chugging baking soda in water might have actually settled my stomach instead of making me vomit like the Internet said it would.   I have to say that I couldn't really care about my appearance at all. I think I looked better for the brief period I got back up to a healthy weight. I feel like I look too thin now.

If someone opens up to you about their struggles, believe them. * Eating disorders have the highest mortality rate of all psychiatric disorders . * EDNOS is the most common eating disorder and most people don't fit neatly into an AN/BED/BN diagnosis. They still have a valid mental illness and need help. * Causes are complex and vary from person to person. * You don't have to be underweight to need help. In fact, most people would benefit from getting help far earlier.  * Recovery is not linear, looks different for everyone, and takes longer than you think. Way longer. * Just because someone hates themselves at a certain size doesn't mean they hate other people for being that size or above.

Im not going to discuss anymore than I have to for fear of triggering people but he went on to ask, when these kids feel they cant turn to their friends or parents to talk to about these things, where do they turn to?  No one in the class could fucking answer it. If there was anyone else in that class who suffered, I applaud them for hiding it so well. Everyone was baffled. A couple of people said, guidance counselors etc. But there was an awkward silence that lasted too long.

Boom. I swear to god, there was an audible ""ooooooooh"". He went on to talk about tumblr and another website that shall not be named.
