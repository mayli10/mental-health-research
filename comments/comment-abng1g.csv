I've nearly fainted on multiple occasions from the pain caused by taking laxatives (for constipation). Just don't... Just eat things with fiber and drink a lot of water.",False,False

I have never abused them though, I just use one two nights before a day I want to be my skinniest for ie a formal event or even just a good party (and then fast the day after the laxative) and it's fine. I do make sure to stay hydrated though, and to not have plans for the morning after I take one.",False,False

I've abused lax post-binge, but only because I hoped it would make the food baby go away faster so that I could therefore forget about it faster. And I've also overused it when restricting really hard, because I wanted my damn whoosh.   And now I have a high tolerance to laxatives, which sucks, because I eat a high protein diet and have IBS, so I do legitimately need them for non-disordered reasons. I now have to use the anal suppository ones, which are really not fun lol. (But I have not been tempted to abuse them, so there is that, lol)   &amp;#x200B;  But yeah, they hurt. Even a moderate dose of ""gentle"" oral ones can give you awful cramps, and possibly dehydration symptoms. Even if you're drinking as much herbal tea as, well... one of us, lol. ",False,False
