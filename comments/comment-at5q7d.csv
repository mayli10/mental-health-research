We severely restrict and that’s not healthy, we all know that. Biologically they are different and affect the body differently. Hence my presenting the difference. ",False,False

If you're just fasting for weight loss  it doesn't matter all that much whether you're in a ""true"" fasted state or not, because you've still created a large caloric deficit. And if you end your fast after you ""broke"" it with something like C/S that deficit will be smaller than it would if you didn't consider it broken and kept going. ",False,False

Obviously you don’t go get tested every time you fast to see if you are in a true fasting state but you follow rules proven to get you into one and stay in one.
