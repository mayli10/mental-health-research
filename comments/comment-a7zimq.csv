It’s going to take you longer to reach a deficit that results in weight loss. Plus, a lot of home scales aren’t sensitive enough to detect small changes in weight. And changes can be hidden by things such as fluid status.",False,False

Your basal metabolic rate is the absolute rock-bottom energy requirements necessary to stay alive. By ""stay alive,"" we are talking in the long term, obviously, but eventually if you starve your body of energy and nutrients you will die.  TDEE is non-essential daily activity added onto your BMR. Usually, it's a few hundred calories depending on how much you move around during the day. Your BMR is probably at least 900-1000 calories (for most people, the minimum is more like 1200), so you can tack on another few hundred calories to account for movement. Basically, to have a TDEE of 900 calories, your BMR would have to be, like... 600-700, which just isn't really possible.",False,False

This is normal. You can't expect to lose weight at a rapid pace indefinitely.  I don't think it's possible for anyone to have a TDEE of 900 calories a day, barring extremely rare medical circumstances. For reference, I am 5'3"" and at 89 lbs, my TDEE was estimated at something like 1,191. (Based on body composition testing by a professional using Bod Pod and skin calipers, not just an online calculator.)  Trust the numbers, but also recognize that they are always approximate. More importantly, changes in hydration and fluid retention have a much more obvious and immediate impact on the scale than calories in/out. Water and food mass can easily mask or distort your perception of weight loss if you're losing at a slower rate.",False,False

Eating fat means no water weight and if you eat healthy fats your body learns to digest fat for energy meaning you actually burn fat (and any fat on your body when you fast).  Also it helps with brain fog in a major way. Eating salmon, avocados, macadamia nuts is important and so good for your brain even if they are crazy high in calories but nutritionally so much better for you.   This is basically the ketogenic diet but even ballerinas eat avocados and find that it helps them lose stubborn pounds. ",False,False

I understand all of that to a certain point but does that really mean that like, someone who is underweight could have a TDEE of 900 calories a day?

Your body is desperate so your BMR slows way down, and BMR is already lower in people with lower body mass. Your body needs to become more efficient to stay alive due to the fewer calories available  and lack of backup storage. You will be losing more muscle mass at this point, also contributing to lower BMR. You may find yourself feeling more cold and constipated, and have difficulty sleeping as everything slows down.
