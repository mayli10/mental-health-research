But clips and tape are frequently used during photoshoots for optimal fit purposes. Plus measurements are often fudged by both agencies and retailers - or just not current.  Some online retailers do a short runway video that I find more helpful than still photos but the garments may also be tacked (quick short stitches) for better fit. There is also the inconsistent sizing issue across brands (not every size two, xs, etc, is the same)  I'm of model proportions (5'9 32-24-34) and still experience fit issues - sometimes it's cut, sometimes it's my build vs the model's, and sometimes it's flat out bullshit. I try to pay close attention to the specific garment measurement details, I usually order multiple sizes, and only order from online retailers that offer free exchanges and returns. Not a perfect solution but I still prefer it to endless hours in fitting rooms. ",False,False

I ordered a dress from Lulu’s a while back since I have the same measurements and height as the model listed and ended up having to exchange it for an xs (their smallest size) because it was huge! ,False,False

Like a 5’10’’ model in an xxs dress would have her ass hanging out the back. And they want to show you where things realistically hit on your body length wise. So they pin larger sizes instead? ,False,False

A lot goes into styling the garments to give the best impression to the buyer.  Plus with a lot of brands on the higher end you get into sizing up/down to alter the silhouette and the tag size isn't as big a deal. I used to shop at Totokaelo a lot and met one of their catalog models in store one day and I was a little larger than her but usually wore the same size as she was listed wearing on the sute.",False,False

It's still disingenuous cause it wont fit other people with large shoulders and small waists the way they say it will, but that size is what they genuinely have to wear. Hope that makes sense",False,False

I'm 5'9/176cm and my shoulders aren't *huge* – about 39cm biacromial width – but I rarely fit smaller than a 2 and even then it usually turns into a 7/8th length sleeve deal.

I find that even if an xxs or xs fits me, it never fits my shoulders. These models could be dressed based on something like that. In jackets I almost always have to go up 2 sizes because of my shoulders and arms, but my body is drowning in it if that makes sense. ",False,False
