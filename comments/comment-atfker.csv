I did it in college too but I didnâ€™t have so much bad food chatter around overeating. I have to actively tell myself that I can get food elsewhere. Iâ€™m gonna work on changing my thoughts so itâ€™s like I feel cool for not eating it. Idk how else to not binge on something thatâ€™s free. ,False,False

If itâ€™s there at work Iâ€™ll usually take a couple of my fave treats like chocolate &amp; put it in my purse to enjoy later after work. But if I eat it during work or at the start, my day is totally ruined. I always must push all pleasure to the end of the day.",False,False
