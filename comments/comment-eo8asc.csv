Her genetics and previous health can handle 20+ years of vegetarianism. Your previous health, given your anorexia and insulin-agenetic diabetes, is not likely to be able to handle vegetarianism.  Again: high cholesterol isn't actually a proven risk factor for heart disease, whether you're a nondiabetic or a type 1 diabetic. In type 2 diabetes, it points towards a cardiac outcome for the disease, which is actually optimistic because it's not the other ways type 2 can kill you. The way statins reduce heart disease death (and they actually increase the stable form of heart disease, weirdly enough) is by reducing inflammation, which your body as an anorexic doesn't even have the energy to have. So now is not the time to be worrying about cholesterol. Now is the time to be worrying about micronutrient density, given that you have a drastically reduced diet. And you can't do that anywhere near as easily or as completely on plants.",False,False

I also don‚Äôt have any deficiencies. I had a potassium deficiency that almost killed me at 18(Pre vegetarian) but that was because I was eating like 1 yogurt a day and that‚Äôs it.   Thanks for your concern but my step mom has also been vegetarian for 20+ years and is completely healthy.,False,True
ffli6eg,t3_eo8asc,t1_fflccos,j4jackj,1,2020-01-26 05:59:26,/r/EDAnonymous/comments/eo8asc/diabulimia_and_me/ffli6eg/,"**Trigger warning:** I'm going to get strident again, because I get irrationally angry (triggered, to be honest) when I hear that people are being told by their doctors to exclude valuable sources of brain-enabling nutrients that cannot be found in any other food in the name of their cholesterol numbers. I hope you will be able to forgive me. Please only uncover the following spoiler tags if you are willing to listen to unconventional opinions on diet and heart disease, and are willing to consider the possibility that your doctor may be totally wrong.  &gt;!From what I've seen, only one of the cholesterol markers are evidence-based (if you ask for evidence, all you'll get is consensus statements, not studies) for heart disease risk, and that's the HDL/trig ratio which is a signal for hyperinsulinemia and insulin resistance (which you don't have, because, well, you're literally starving yourself and not taking much insulin). Ivor Cummins did a great advanced technical talk (the Cholesterol Conundrum, I'd show it to your doctor if they're willing to listen to alternate opinions on cholesterol) on the matter after he got some whack blood results, but he promotes a mild form of orthorexia in the same talk because that helped him bring down his liver markers. A healthy number for your cholesterol levels is where-ever your metabolism puts it, assuming you do not have a genetic disorder like familial hypercholesterolemia. Given that you are starving right now, and starving people are known to have hypercholesterolemia due to the metabolic adaptations starvation induces, the healthy number is going to be drastically higher than if you are slightly overweight and bountifully muscled with a 5.5 A1c and very few hypos eating a healthy diet inclusive of animal products as necessary to support micronutrient, protein and fat (if you choose not to use carbs for energy) needs.!&lt;  &gt;!Are you willing to throw caution to the wind about the cholesterol numbers, in the name of enabling eating disorder and malnutrition recovery? I value your physical and mental health in the now and the near future far higher than I value some nebulous number that's said to have something to do with your heart attack risk.!&lt;",False,False

I apologise for my stridency at the top of the thread.  My original question would have been a buttered pork chop but I realised, since you're vegetarian, you won't want to eat that anyway... or would you? Should I reask the question with different phrasing and use the pork chop, or should I use a paneer and tofu tikka curry? The reason I asked ""how would you feel emotionally about eating the thing, assuming your blood sugars rode flat"" is because I wanted to try to disentangle the diabetes from the eating disorder for a split second. Obviously with type 1 diabetes, eating disorders will affect management, in your current case helping create a bunch of hypoglycemic events (because currently, if I'm reading this right, you're more anorexic and less diabulimic).",False,False
