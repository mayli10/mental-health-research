Today has been a bad day mentally. Oscillating between deep depression and suicidal ideation with moments of just being so numb I almost dissociate. This has been a pretty common occurrence since the Fall. To preface today‚Äôs events, I must tell you about my all time low.   In November of 2018 I was hospitalized for my suicidal ideation and self harm. In the events that led up to that, I would self harm in the shower. I would turn on music all the way up, get in the shower, wash up, and then sit in the tub with the water on and self harm. The way that I self harm is pretty audible, so my boyfriend would hear me and come in to make me stop. It happened multiple times. The night before I went to the hospital, I self harmed in the tub in a different method. My boyfriend now checks on me at least once whenever I‚Äôm in the bath.   Today I felt really low and took a bath. He came in and washed my back, which he‚Äôs never done before. After he left I sat under the shower and listened to music. He came back. I started to cry and then he climbed in the tub clothed and held me. After the hot water ran out, he got me a towel and wrapped me up where I sat in the tub and then combed my hair for me. I‚Äôm really bad at self grooming and I haven‚Äôt actually fully combed my hair in months. I usually just comb it enough that it looks fine and then leave it be, but it‚Äôs riddled with knots, which he brushed out.  I haven‚Äôt had another person brush my hair for me since I was under the age of ten, and even then my mother hated to do it and her manner of brushing hurt, so I hated it too.   I just felt really loved today, and I wanted to tell someone about it because it felt really special for me. I‚Äôve never had anyone care about me so much, to take the time to take care of me.",False,False

I tried to tell a therapist, who said that since I didn't look anorexic, I was probably fine. Sent me in deeper lmao. All the therapists I saw only wanted to talk about me being trans, and would never touch my abuse or eating disorder.  My freshman year of college I put on about 50lbs that made my knees feel like they were going to fall off, and I didn't manage to drop it all until about my junior year. Then, slowly, some habits returned as I started dealing with other bullshit. My ED took full swing last spring in the worst relapse of my life. Bingeing/purgeing/fasting and I did actually get down like... 6lbs lmfao.   I'm 23 now, and will be 24 this year. In February I finally started talking about my ED with my therapist, who helped me through a body image workbook that honestly helped a little, but I've been bingeing so much I'm back up 10lbs from my lowest weight and I hate it so much. I'm starting therapy for the summer but I just honestly want to break this binge cycle by fasting as much as possible. I am tired. Recovery is tiring. I just want to lose weight. I've been married for a month now and I stay in bed late to try and put off eating with my husband before he goes to work, and then I binge anyway. I have no idea what I'm doing. It doesn't even matter if I count calories or not. I estimate and obsess and feel morbidly obese and horrible for it.",False,False

Everything started last summer, one year ago. Summer it's usually when I get bored and decide to eat healthy, exercise, lose some weight, and that's what I did. I had a GW, I wanted to lose 6 pounds. I'm extremely impatient as a person, even if I was slowly but surely losing, after a couple of weeks I got into IF. 18/6 was too easy for me. So I got into OMAD. That's when I started counting calories and binge eating. After a binge I'd fast, 24,48,72. But it wasn't that bad back then, it wasn't emotional eating just yet. By september I lost that weight and I just wanted to keep it off, I was so happy. Idk when I started using food as a coping mechanism. If I felt sad, I'd eat. Depressed, nervous? Eat your whole kitchen and you'll feel better, I thought. At the same time, when I wasn't binging I'd count calories everyday, trying to keep it under my bmr, but not drastically. Then I wanted to lose sone more weight. The cycle begins, again. Count calories, weight in every day, fasting, I was restricting but at the time I didn't know it had a name, I would eat lunch and a snack, all under 1000 cals and that was it for the day. 2019 comes. Worst year of my life so far. Depression and anxiety hit me like a train, so of course, binge eating and restricting are back in town. I became better at restricting. Really bad at fasting because it will trigger a massive binge before and after. I know the calories of the things I eat by heart. I use the calculator on my phone everyday. I have a restrict meal plan. My period is fucked up. I get caught in binge/fast cycles. This week I gained 2 pounds binging my life away hoping it would fill the void in me. I'm 20 pounds lighter than when I started but I swear I feel like nothing changed. I'm seeking help, now, next therapy session is on Wednesday. I'm almost two weeks purge free. There's so much more I want to say but this ain't a book about me. I'm only 18. I don't want to live like this. I've set myself up for failure. I want a normal relationship with food. I really do. That's my story.",False,False

I feel like I‚Äôve had an issue with food for as long as I can remember. I was an extremely picky eater. As a child in preschool, I was always forced to eat foods I never liked, even being force fed a couple times &amp; sometimes I would even vomit. I also developed a lot of anxiety when I was 10-13 years old around having to eat with my dad. For some reason I‚Äôd always feel sick to my stomach when I had to eat something. Doesn‚Äôt matter if it was pizza or ice cream, I‚Äôd be running to a bathroom to vomit (not intentionally though). This happened Every. Single. Time. My dad started getting concerned if I had an eating disorder &amp; started threatening to take me to a hospital. This made me more nervous to eat around him. I was fine with food for a while until my 1st year of college when I started weighing myself every day, but never restricted my intake. 2nd year I started eating less just to see the scale drop lower but it wasn‚Äôt until my period stopped that I realized I‚Äôve taken it too far. Final year I developed bulimia completely on accident. On my day off, I‚Äôd always bake myself desserts &amp; eat the whole thing as my OMAD &amp; then exercise it off only to accidentally make myself vomit from over exertion. I said ‚ÄúI won‚Äôt do that again‚Äù but then I kept doing it every week, and then every time I was home alone. I‚Äôd be so happy I could eat what I wanted and be able to get rid of it. I‚Äôve been purging regularly since this past November &amp; there‚Äôs no sign of stopping. Scares the shit out of me because my heart, teeth &amp; stomach are all sorts of messed up. I finished college &amp; now all I‚Äôve been doing since grad is b/p, think of food &amp; exercise compulsively. I‚Äôll go hours of exercising until my body aches (which is kind of satisfying in a twisted way) but I can‚Äôt help but think of how much time I‚Äôve wasted due to this shit. The thing is that no one knows about this so I‚Äôm suffering in silence. I‚Äôve only found comfort in this subreddit for making me not feel so alone.  Hopefully those who read this are doing well!  tl;dr issues with food in early childhood mixed with anxiety makes for a screwed up future of food &amp; weight torture &amp; an irrational fear of numbers. Never thought numbers could be the thing that ruins my day üôÑ",False,False

Now I look back and god I‚Äôm so glad I wasn‚Äôt at my LW. I look beautiful and healthy on my wedding pics and though I didn‚Äôt appreciate it at the time I do now.
