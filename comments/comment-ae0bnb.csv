He fully didn’t understand what I was going through when we started dating but asked questions every time he didn’t understand something I said/did, read books on EDs and went on support forums to learn how to support me, and encourages me to go to my therapist when he sees I’m struggling and doesn’t know how to help. He tried different approaches to talking me through hard times over the years and we have a dynamic that really helps me right now- he calls me on my shit when he sees I’m struggling and offers different POVs and coping skills to whatever toxic shit im doing. I’m really lucky to have him. ",False,False

After my husband first found out about my ED he thought that ""encouraging"" (more like pushing food on me and making me feel guilty) me to eat was being helpful.  It is not and made it so much worse!!!!!  We had a long chat and he no longer does that and is super supportive now.  ",False,False

He only asks I eat enough to live, and got me multivitamins so I wouldn't be deficient.   His only request is I don't die from my under eating. :) Honestly I couldn't ask for a better response, I'm super thankful! ",False,False

I'm not dismissing his issues but my ED was worse and I don't think he understands the degree of how bad it was. To him, it is equal to his issues - negative body image, obsessing over food etc. Obviously these are serious issues as well and I deal with these too. But for me that's not where it stops (ex b/p) and that's the part that's hard for him to understand. He tells me I can always feel comfortable talking about it but whenever I bring it up I can see him squirm and he doesn't know what to say, so I just don't talk about it to avoid the awkwardness.

But he always says that things will be alright, and can tell when I’m about to have a panic attack and he’ll just touch my arm and give me a certain look, or give me a hug, and just that little bit of support can help me pull myself back together.  He doesn’t force me to eat, and if I ask him to stop me from binging, he won’t force me to stop, but he’ll give me a gentle reminder that I asked him to help.   I know I’m really lucky, and wouldn’t trade him for the world.  He always says that WE will get through this together, and everything will be okay.   I thing your SO needs to understand that he doesn’t understand. Once that happens, the unintentional condescending and hurtful language will stop.  It does sound like he really cares though ❤️ ",False,False

Honestly, the best thing he does for me is supports me. If I binge with him and take a super long shower shortly after he’ll leave me be but will ask if I purged. I’m always honest with him about it. If I did, he hugs me and tell me it’s okay and I’m going to do better tomorrow. If I don’t, he tells me he’s happy or proud. He’s FAR from supportive of my eating habits, but whether I fuck up or I do good he’s there for me.   I think stressing to him that you don’t need a coach or someone telling you what to do is important. Sometimes people think you actually want their 2 cents when you vent about what’s going on. Maybe he misinterprets it, maybe he’s just trying to help in the only way he knows how to. Opening up that communication is really, REALLY important to maintaining a healthy relationship with an ED. Best of luck!",False,False
