How do you fathom that a half eaten burger was left for you? Mother, why would I leave you half eaten food?! No matter how many times I told her I planned to eat leftovers the next day, she'd still eat my food (after eating her own leftovers) and use this excuse. When my ED got really bad I'd hoard food that I was planning to eat just to avoid the ""my safe food is gone, what now?"" breakdown. I still worry about her purposely sabotaging my safe foods, like if she cooked rice, and then I cooked my own portioned rice and put it in the fridge, she would eat the rice I made, instead of hers! It's very difficult for me to store anything in the fridge now. Thank goodness non perishables exist.",False,False

I save food for weeks and I daydream about it so I definitely don't want it to be eaten, but my mom also has an eating disorder and if I ask her not to eat an specific something only ONCE then she will NEVER eat it again! She will always say she's saving it for me no matter how many times I tell her to eat it. It makes me really sad.      But OP, don't be so harsh on yourself about reacting in an emotional way. I think that's a very natural part of EDs.",False,False

I have these frozen meals that I carefully match so I can have 2 a day, so I feel like I'm eating an actual dinner. Then I come home and she's eaten one! That throws off the whole rotation!

Previously I lived with a family which was a nightmare in itself (they had a *lot* of issues) but they would also steal my stuff all the time.
