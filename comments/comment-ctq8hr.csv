It's just hurtful to read some of these posts, even though I really do get where others are coming from. Like, I don't hate my parents. There was a time when I was really upset and I did blame them a lot.    I'm sure a lot of us here have actually been through some abusive shit with our families and food, and I don't want to down play that. But It's sometimes important to take a step outside of it all though to see the bigger picture. Like families forcing you to clean your plate. Is it abusive or a product of the parents own history with food insecurity?  It's kind of like when an abused child grows up and becomes an abuser themselves.   I feel like I could talk about this subject for hours. I haven't even touched on the whole ""food is showing love"" which is SUPER prominent in my family. My dad died of cancer, and while in the hospital he constantly made me take his cookies, and he even tried to get me to put a bowl of mashed potatoes in my bag ü§£ he just really wanted to show me how much he appreciated and loved me. I gained 20ish lbs in 3 months. That wasn't from the food he gave me, that was from eating my feeling in the privacy of my own car.  Anyway! I'm seriously just rambling now.",False,False

I agree with you, there are times where you can excuse a parent for that; like you said they didn‚Äôt know any better, but feeding their kids junk food 24/7 and knowing it‚Äôs bad for them is not one.   I‚Äôm wholeheartedly agree with ‚Äúreflect, learn, move on‚Äù instead of dwelling or blaming, especially when you have matured and grown.",False,False

That's all well and good, but here it the catch:  The parents that do this very likely do not *know* any better. Our education system (especially back when my parents went to school) teaches fuck all about actual nutrition. Parents who grew up in the 50s-70s had a food pyramid pushing a pretty skewed version of healthy foods. We still have that, they seem to ""update"" it every few decades, and now it's not a pyramid but ""my plate"" and they still push food groups because of lobbyists.  When I went to school we did nutrition in 7th or 8th grade. We did some calorie counting, but it was ""everyone needs 2000/day""   You have advertising pushing sugar cereal and sugar drinks and fast food. These ads target kids and busy parents (parents working 2 jobs don't always have time or energy to meal prep healthier dinners) Even school lunches are atrocious nutritionally(and in every way really)  So it's easy to blame the individual, but from my perspective, the whole system is broken. I grew up overweight.  I asked my mom once if any doctor ever told her, ""hey, I think your kiddo needs to go on a healthy diet. She is in the 90th percentile by weight. She is obese. Here is some nutrition information to help your family make better choices."" She said no, they didn't. I was bullied pretty incessantly about my weight. There is no way my mom didn't know I was bigger then other kiddos, but like someone else pointed out- the thought a lot of society has is ""oh they'll grow out of it""  The other part I want to point out is, some parents have their own issues that they have with mental health and food. My mom was a chronic dieter. She yoyo'd from thin to obese and back. My dad would binge eat (little debbie cakes were one of his go tos.) Kids pick up on these things even when the adults don't bring a lot of attention to it themselves. So my mom made dinner for the family, but *she* had a slim fast. My dad would eat a whole box of snack cakes in the middle of the night. What does a kid make of that in their own mind?  So its really a whole socio-economic issue. Its systemic. I can't really **blame** my parents. They got a shit roll and they passed it on to me. All I can do is reflect, learn and move on trying to make better choices then they were able to make.",False,False

I think part of it is was both my parents grew up in poor households and going hungry was a legitimate fear for them both. They meant well and wanted me to have more than they had. I was always a chubby little child and was always told that I would grow out it. (spolier: I did not.)  The turns tabled in high school though. Dad was out of the picture and money was tight.
