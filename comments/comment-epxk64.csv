Maybe because the word is usually used to describe one entity putting food into another entity. You feed animals. You feed babies. You feed aging/sick people who are unable to care for themselves. We don’t talk so often about “I fed myself” because we have another verb for that - “to eat”.   This just made me realize I actually never talk about “feeding the dog”. I’ll say “I gave Charlie his dinner”. Huh. Food for thought  ;),False,False
