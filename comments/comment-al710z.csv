I'll keep sharing these out as I am able. This is the first time in my life I've been in a situation that supports long-term therapy, so I'm definitely not taking it for granted. It's so fucked up how prohibitively expensive mental health services can be, and it's hard to find a therapist or counselor who specializes in this (as I found out, when doing research to find a therapist this past winter).

I personally am pretty poor atm and can barely afford food to feed myself on the days that I even want to so therapy is certainly no option for my until my wallet is in a better state of affairs. But this is very helpful and I think I'm going to try it out tomorrow or sometime this week. Thank you very much for sharing this! ,False,False
