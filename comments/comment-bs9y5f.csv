She is likely just in denial because coping with a child having an eating disorder can be very, very difficult for a parent because of how deadly they are and so she is probably just desperately hoping it is not true and is grasping for straws and doesn't realize she is making it so much worse unfortunately by not supporting you when you need her support the most. Stay strong and please keep standing up for yourself, by the way it is wonderful you booked an appointment, that is a HUGE step in the right direction and is very brave of you, I really do strongly recommend that you go. I promise your psychiatrist will be much more supportive of you and helpful and that's what you really need right now.",False,False

Family members often react in unhelpful ways...for a variety of reasons. It does not mean her judgement of the situation is accurate.  Keeping the appointment with the psychiatrist sounds like a good idea. For starters, they are much better able to assess mental health issues than a family member is. Secondly, if emotions/experiences surrounding food or eating or body image are negatively impacting your life, then seeking help is a smart move! Best wishes.",False,False
