I’m vegan myself and have been accused of being deficient in just about everything, but this was a new one lol. I just knew about K2 being in animal products and fermented foods so I figured that’s what the commenter meant",False,False

I've actually heard it being a problem the other way around, with some vegans getting *too much* vitamin K. Too much can lead to clotting issues.  But yeah, if you're not eating a balanced diet it can lead to issues either way, regardless of if you're getting your vit K from plants or animals.",False,False

K1 is in a bunch of different vegetables but is supposedly less available to the body than K2, which is maybe why some vegans who don’t eat a balanced diet including fermented foods might become deficient",False,False

When related to diet it’s usually only seen in strict vegans, although restricting + “plant-based diet” could probably do it too. Maybe try a Vit K supplement or a multivitamin with vit k (not all multivitamins have it because it can interfere with a specific type of blood thinner).",False,False

Anyway I got little baby bruises all over when I was deep in my overexercising phase. Apparently if you don’t do proper recovery after working out the little tears in your muscles can start to bleed and lead to bruising. I had **no idea** this was a thing until I talked to some rando at my gym. If this sounds like you, try lowering your exercise and upping your recovery time and see if that helps!",False,False
