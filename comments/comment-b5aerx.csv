Last week I was asking my therapist the same exact question- can I try to lose weight and still be in recovery? In short, her answer was no. She told me that recovery is accepting your body at any weight and not seeing it as ""lesser"" because you think you could lose a few pounds.... I personally totally disagree but I know my ED has really fucked with my thinking.    I'm still not happy with my weight and I dream about dieting all the time. But i've given up on dieting because 10/10 times it always leads to binging and purging. Instead, I abuse exercise.   &amp;#x200B;  &amp;#x200B;  &amp;#x200B;  &amp;#x200B;  &amp;#x200B;  &amp;#x200B;",False,False
