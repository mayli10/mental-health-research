But not all comparisons are healthy. When you hold him do you think about his weight or how warm he is and how nice it is to be holding him? You're happy with him, and you obviously haven't let yourself go too much if he likes you. He likes you, for the you that you are right in front of him. I know it feels rough during sex and when you're undressing and vulnerable, but when he's holding you he's thinking how close he is to you, how warm you are, how he can show you what you mean to him. He's cherishing you in the moment, the way you are in that moment.  3 days might not seem like a lot compared to 365 days, but it's still 72 hours, 4320 minutes and 259,200 seconds.

He deserves someone beautiful, stunning. And you know, he calls me beautiful, he would tell me right now I am stunning. I believe he feels what he feels but I simply cannot agree that I am not the grotesque and squishy unworthy girl that I see in the mirror. When he puts his arm around me, I freeze thinking “does he feel that I am pudgier than yesterday?” Im so sick of it all. Sick of wanting to eat a piece of damn bread but instead verbally assault myself in my mind to the point of tears. I want to know a duration longer than 3 days of not scrutinizing myself. I want to not have a breakdown before or after having sex because I feel so ugly and ashamed. God. I have so much good in my life so I have guilt over this demon.
