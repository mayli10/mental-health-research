Putting it into the bin isn‚Äôt any different than putting it into my body. The food is being wasted the moment I buy it from the shops.   Idk if this will help you but worth a shot! ,False,False

It was a really odd feeling, and eating from intuition is something I haven't done since I was a child. It was alien, but somehow I *knew* what I wanted. I still eat about a serving of fruit a day, but something in me felt like I needed something else. For two days I tried to sate my appetite with fruit, but I need a starch instead of fructose.   So I did it. I used two 40 Cal pieces of wheat bread to make myself a sandwich for lunch. Now, before recovery, bread is something I'd eat ONLY during a binge. Or if I did eat bread, it'd trigger a binge, so I was petrified of eating it.  But because I'm in recovery, it didn't trigger a binge. And actually, it made me feel better. And for once, instead of it stimulating the urge for me to eat more bread, it satisfied it.",False,False

When I eat, I usually eat the part I don't like to save the part I really like to eat at the end.
