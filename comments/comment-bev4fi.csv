Maybe you can call your doctor today to get a referral appt. Since you probably won't be able to get seen this weekend on such short notice, a solution for the meantime might be to call a hotline from the stickied post (or Google ED helplines for your area). Talking to someone will 100% help.  Another important step in starting recovery imo is accepting right off the bat that you're going to make mistakes, and that's okay. If you slip up and do an old habit, your attempt is not ruined, and you don't need to give up or start over, recovery is a mindset, forgive yourself and just keep going!  Hope you feel better this weekend!",False,False

I was a daily purger for the majority of my \~20 year ED history and eating regularly and adequately really helped cut the urges to binge (and therefore purge) way down. I'm in my first year of full recovery, and I started out recovering on my own.  I would also investigate the blog, podcast, and YT channel of Tabitha Farrar. She uses the term anorexia a lot because that is what she suffered with, but everything she advises applies to any restrictive eating disorder. You might want to read posts on r/fuckeatingdisorders, which is great place to look for recovery advice.  Of course it is important to seek out professional help when you can, but it is also important to realize you can start taking steps on your own. I wish you the best of luck;  please feel free to DM if you have questions or need support &lt;3",False,False
