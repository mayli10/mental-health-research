Small amounts tend to be from scraping your throat, large amounts can be a sign that you've torn your esophagus. Less common, but still possible, is blood from elsewhere in your GI system (stomach, lower intestines). Although purging small amounts of blood could very well be from a small scrape in your throat and nothing serious, there's usually no way to be sure, which makes it dangerous.   [Here's](https://www.cedars-sinai.org/health-library/diseases-and-conditions/m/mallory-weiss-tear.html) some info about Mallory-Weiss tears and [here's](https://www.mayoclinic.org/symptoms/vomiting-blood/basics/when-to-see-doctor/sym-20050732) a list of things to watch for in the future.

Dark red/brown= go to the hospital immediately. Purging dark blood is a Very Bad Sign.",False,False
