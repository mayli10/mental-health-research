Like my bust is 92cm and my waist is 78cm so the difference is so so apparent and you need both in an image to get the full picture of my body  I was at an event this weekend where I was behind a stall, and all you can see on the event’s photos are me from the waist up with my enormous tits and fat arms and terrible chinless side profile and I’ve had to keep off Facebook and Instagram until everyone’s stopped posting shit about the event so I can go back to hating myself the normal amount",False,False
