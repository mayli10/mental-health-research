I very recently went to a Chinese buffet &amp; ate 2 large plates of fried foods &amp; 3 large plates of desserts &amp; then went home and involuntarily threw up most of what I just ate. My mom thought it was food poisoning as well as I tried sushi for the first time &amp; thought it just didn’t agree with my sensitive stomach. I’m just over here thinking I’m incapable of digesting large quantities of food.,False,False
