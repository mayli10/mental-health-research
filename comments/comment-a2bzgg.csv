Damn I love this sub üò≠üíõ for not making me feel further ashamed. I forget how good it feels to connect to humans on the same wavelength. Ooh it‚Äôs the Warburtons wholemeal small loaf! So the bread is on the smaller side but it feels me up. ,False,False

Colleagues at work are calling me out and judging me for eating less - ‚Äúis that all you‚Äôre going to eat? Rabbit food? You used to be so hungry‚Äù. Like wtf. I have 3 slices of bread (165), 3 quorn vegan ham slices (44), Tesco free from mayo (30), with celery sticks (13), cucumber (15), cherry tomatoes (25). With veggie broth (12). All the while she‚Äôs eating a portion of chips and falafel wrap and she‚Äôs much skinnier. I feel like she was shaming me ..because she can eat all that and remain slimmer. And I‚Äôm of course a fat fuck who shouldn‚Äôt even try eating healthier?! üåö. I want to hide.   Haven‚Äôt met up with friends ..who would most likely see a weight loss in me. And will judge me for eating less. When they‚Äôre all so skinny and triggering me. :(((",False,False
