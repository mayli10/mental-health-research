She said she felt so alone dealing with such a huge secret &amp; it was a bit of relief for the both of us that we weren’t alone. We don’t encourage each other at all tho. Which I feel like can be toxic between two friends who struggle with an ED together. We mainly vent about the terrible thoughts that go through our head when we purge or eat. ,False,False

I have a feeling she knows and that's why she felt comfortable telling you without fearing you judging her about it. Just telling her about your struggles and that you're there for her would probably be really helpful,False,False
