I try to go for a long run, or stair master for awhile. Anything to sweat profusely. BUT it is important to drink LOTS of water. Usually I feel better near the end of the day. Try not to eat anything too carby today either. I stick to salmon and eggs. ",False,False

Unfortunately when you restrict that low you can cause binging since your body is probably craving nutrients &amp; shit like that. Don't purge if possible, understand any weight gain is just ""water &amp; food weight"". It'll take a few days to even out but you won't gain any real fat or muscle weight.    You probably already knew that but good luck yo!",False,False

You will definitely not gain weight other than water/food weight, which will go away eventually. I would say drink loads of water to help digestion, you may not be completely unbloated for the party but it'll help in the long run. Try to focus on wearing something nice that you don't feel uncomfortable in and enjoying yourself.",False,False

You have to be 3,500 calories over maintenance to gain 1lb. As for the bloating doing some cardio might help but nothing will fix it in time for tonight. Just choose something that hides whatever is making you feel uncomfortable about your body and start fresh tomorrow. You can’t undo the past, all you can do is make better choices the next day. Drinking lots of water will help too. It’ll make you feel bloated but it will help in the long term. It will probably take a couple of days for the water weight to go.",False,False
