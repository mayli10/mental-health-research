He knows when I’m not meeting my meal plan, he doesn’t get over the top, but he will tell me “You’ve worked so hard to get this far, let’s keep going.” or “I know you’re letting ED win right now, but your strong enough to fight back, and this lapse is just a bump in the road.” Honestly, it gets kind of annoying most of the time, but I know it’s only because he cares. He knows all my safe foods (which I regret telling him because sometimes ya girl just wants to “fast.”) so when I’m struggling, he’ll buy them. I always make this joke that my ED hates him.   I think that’s the only time it’s okay for a SO to care about eating habits.",False,False

But also someone who's gonna help you through your struggles because they want to see you healthy and happy.,False,False
