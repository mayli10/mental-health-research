I’m trying to lose some weight and I weighed myself today and was up 1lb... 1LB!!! And  I started panicking and freaking out and felt like I gained 100lbs :( I spent a long time sad, and almost cried, and wanting to binge because I felt like crap about it. I feel like I’ll never be happy because even if I reach my goal weight every time it wavers (even due to water weight) I’ll want to cry.    I’m sending hugs :( I wish I was there to help cheer you up and support you ",False,False
