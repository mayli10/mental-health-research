I'm obviously not 100% recovered since I still find myself drawn to this sub and relatively preoccupied with food. But yes, it's absolutely worth it to recover, in my opinion. I had about a two-year relapse with bulimia before recovering this time around (I'm at 5 months ""clean"" right now).  I have so much more energy, so much more space in my head. I ultimately decided to recover, because, as you mentioned, I was just so *exhausted*. I didn't see a way I could carry on as I was.   I now eat all my meals and snacks. I don't count calories. I don't choose the lowest calorie option. I'm much more relaxed when it comes to food -- this will come with time.  My performance with exercise is much higher. I actually have the strength and endurance to workout, run, etc. Whereas before, my body was always running on empty, I was constantly feeling weak and sick.  I found a great therapist and worked with her (she didn't know much about EDs and just used a DBT/CBT/mindfulness approach). I knew I didn't want to go through an ED clinic, because I had done that before, there isn't a really great one where I live, and I didn't want the focus of my therapy to be on food. So I never had a meal plan.   I set goals for myself around building positive self-worth, coping in times of distress/anxiety/depression, etc. rather than ""eat three meals and two snacks every day; eat these foods"" which IMO wouldn't get to the root of the problem.",False,False

It varies dramatically from person to person. Some people's guts are back in the swing of thing within a few weeks, other people's take a few months.  &gt; How do I get a more relaxed attitude over food?  That depends entirely on where exactly you're food anxiety comes from. There's as many reasons as there are people. You have to attack the source.   &gt; Was it worthwhile to recover.   There's a lot of major wins. More energy, improved cognitive function (bye bye, brain fog), *not* being constantly constipated, not freezing my ass off in 70 degree weather, and being able to do things like go and get food with people.   It's a lot of hard work though. It doesn't always feel worth it, but I think it is.   &gt; We're you bloated from eating more and how long did it take to normalize?  Most people will experience this, but it usually only lasts a few weeks- a few months.  ",False,False
