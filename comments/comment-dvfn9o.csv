So I quit and felt like I’d ruined everything and I might as well die, but it’s honestly not the end of the world. If you can’t graduate, you can still get your GED once you’re in a better place mentally, and if you want to go on in school at that point you can.  Just keep at it, focus on taking care of your mental and physical health right now, the rest will come in time.",False,False
