I'm too lazy/anxious to intentionally go out of my way to avoid food, but on my days off I get nervous because I realise that I'll just be home all day and that makes it so much harder to avoid snacking or eating all the time. I definitely look forward to days when I'm busy because I distract myself from food.",False,False

I can eat a small meal and be not hungry in the slightest, but somehow if I have nothing to do, I‚Äôll find myself standing in front of the fridge looking for something to eat. When I was bigger and not concerned or conscious about my weight or what I ate, I was a ‚Äúbored eater‚Äù and I think it just stayed with me despite my new restrictive eating habits.",False,True

Weekends are always harder because no school/work, so I always try to go out as much as I can. It just makes not eating so much easier, because I tend to snack when I‚Äôm bored.",False,False

I make sure to take tons of stops on the way, and I usually buy myself a drink like an icee or coffee/something to help me restrict.",False,False

My pride has finally accepted that Engineering will be the death of me. But when I was studying, it was so easy getting away with restriction or OMAD.  Say you ate breakfast at home then when you get home, say you had dinner or lunch as school. Also, it helps you save your allowance for other things ‚ù§Ô∏è  I hope I pass the exam for the college I'm applying for so I could earn money and restrict a lot again ü§ë‚ù§Ô∏è",False,False
