Like by the time Ive gotten through M&amp;Ms and a bag of Cheetos I’m like well fuck, I could have just had like chicken and rice and veg or something?????  My dietitian says the body wants calorie dense and fast-acting foods when you’re in starvation tho, so it makes sense that this is how it works out.",False,False

In a bad binge cycle a while ago, I would go to the store on my way home from work, buy a can of frosting, and eat it all. Storebought frosting is a sleeper hit binge food... Delicious, cheap, usually vegan. I always felt like nauseous garbage after.   Other good ones include the countless halves of family-size bags of stale Tostito's at my parents' house (like the only snack food they have wtf??); mostly crushed cookies from a Ziploc bag of crushed cookies my roommate brought home from an AA meeting (I'm vegan and AA meeting cookies are like never vegan); and about half a jar of bread and butter pickles, with the liquid poured out and a shitload of vegan cream cheese stirred in (this sounds so disgusting but was pretty good).  tl;dr Thank God for self checkout",False,False
