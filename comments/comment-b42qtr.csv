Now I cope with all of life’s stress by disordered eating, but it’s not an eating disorder. When I’m not stressed I even eat intuitively and give no fucks about it sometimes! 20+ years on this merry-go-round. I doubt I will never be 100% “normal” about food, ever. ",False,False

However, as I’m now 18, and I’ve dropped a loooot of weight, they’re deeply concerned so I get appointments every four weeks for a weight check up, sometimes blood tests and ECGs too.
