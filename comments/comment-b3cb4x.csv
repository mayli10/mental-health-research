What's weird is that even though I'm restricting, I'm eating nutritious meals so I'm actually getting more protein and micronutrients than when I consume higher calories. When I consume more calories, all I eat are cakes and chocolate.",False,True

Even when I first started restricting at 20 it wasn't as bad as it feels now at 25. I have the same dizziness that makes walking hard, or being unable to have conversations or even the ability/motivation to complete school assignments. I even have to plan when to eat around when I need to do any mental processing.  It's ridiculous, and not an efficient way to live for sure. ",False,False

Day 2 of a ""relapse"" (don't know that I ever felt recovered?). My brother is getting married in a few months, and I so badly want to look thin for it. Couple that with meeting the other (super skinny modelesque) bridesmaids, and being newly single and reconnected with an old flame. I'm just desperate to do the only thing that's ever worked for me. No negative effects for me yet. I'm just remembering how proud I felt at my LW and remembering the pain through rose-colored glasses. ",False,False

I used to fast for days without much issue, but now even a singular 500 calorie day will trigger a migraine. Good luck, OP, take it easy if you can. ",False,False

As a teenager I could pretty much get though any task with a lot is discomfort. I’m back to restricting like you, I shoot for 800/day, and holy shit I feel so dull. I can’t drive home from yoga class because I’m too weak after. Standing up makes me lose my vision. I wanna eat more but it’s so stressful to think about eating more ",False,False

Also everything is harder in general the older you get. I'm in recovery and a few weeks ago I had a mini relapse. I restricted to ~800-1000 a day as well as exercising more for a week or so, didn't lose any weight (maybe 1kg but yeah), and legit felt worse for it than I had maintaining at my lowest weight for years as a teen. Even maintaining said low weight in my twenties after my first try at recovery was sooo much harder on my body; it's been 18 months and I'm fully weight restored but my body is still trying to repair a lot of that damage.
