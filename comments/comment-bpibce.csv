If theyâ€™re a true ED specialist they wonâ€™t think youâ€™re faking. I had a panic attack in my therapists office the first time I saw her cause I was so anxious. Itâ€™ll be ok.

When you do find someone you feel comfortable opening up to, be careful, because it's possible that you'll get that reaction.    I opened up to a friend when my most recent bad downward spiral was starting and he responded by saying, ""You're not going to like this, but I think you're just a normal girl with normal thoughts."" That just fueled me to lose more weight. ðŸ™ƒ",False,False
