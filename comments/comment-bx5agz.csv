Honestly, no part of recovery is going to be easy but taking little steps like this really do make a HUGE difference. It sounds cliché but one of those most important things is having support, especially from the people who are closest to you!! Make sure to keep us updated on your recovery.",False,False

I guess I only viewed recovery as gaining some weight and eating slightly more.   On another note though thank you for the advice and I’m sorry you had to go through similar situations as well. It must’ve been awful, but that’s amazing that you recovered!!! I didn’t think to tell them about how I’m feeling since they already know about the disorder. I’ll try to tell them next meal time.",False,True

First of all though, I want to clarify something: losing weight and recovering from a restrictive eating disorder are diametrically opposed. You can NOT recover if you are actively continuing to lose weight because getting over the fear of gaining weight is perhaps the most important part of recovery.  Second of all, I know how triggering it can be to see other people restricting when you are trying to recover. During the height of my eating disorder, my uncle (who lives with my parents) was on a quack diet that restricted intake to 1200 calories a day; I can remember clobbering myself when my intake went above that. The guilt of eating more or even just wanting to eat more than somebody else can be awful.  Even now, having recovered, it's extremely triggering when I see my mom eating a sad garden salad or going on and on about how full she is or talking about how she ""has to walk now"" after eating a relatively big meal. Where I went wrong is that I never told my family what I was going, through (although they certainly suspected it). The best thing you can do is to make your family aware; it may be difficult but you should probably tell your brother what you're going through and how his restriction is affecting you. Likewise, your mom might not make the connection that his new diet might be triggering for you; make sure that she knows what upsets you and what's the best way that she can help you. Of course, this is all easier said than done but I'd still say that that the best you thing you can do is communicate with your friends and family.",False,False
