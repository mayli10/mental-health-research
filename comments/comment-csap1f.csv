Sorry I just get so angry at people like that. Makes my blood boil to know there are psychopaths freely roaming the streets and no one bats an eye.  Maybe that’s kinda a personal thing cause my bf experienced physical abuse as well during his childhood (not nearly the extend you did tho) and he’s.. totally fine with it. He thinks it didn’t do him any harm and he wouldn’t mind doing it to his own children. How fucked up is that?  Apart from the obvious psychological harm it did to him which he always denies (“I don’t need therapy bla bla bla”) it’s just so fucked up to normalize this. I bluntly told him if I ever have kids with him he won’t get the chance to parent them.  Well anyways, good luck with your life, I truly hope you’ll find peace ❤️",False,False

She would never back me up and goes as far as to blame my bipolar and says I don't know what's real and what isn't. Her story constantly changes about the day I thought I was really going to die: She was too sick to get up and stop him, she wasn't home ( she was, I remember screaming at her for help ), she had headphones on... The list of stories just goes on. The closest to the truth her stories have gotten was that it was ""just a screaming match"". She saw it when he choked me and she's seen him being violent towards me several times. She just doesn't let her brain take it in.  My dad is incredibly manipulative. At this point it'd be my word against his, with absolutely no one to back me up and my entire family backing him up. I haven't seen any of my family  since i left, apart from my mother, who I love too much to not want her attention, but even then i barely see her. I don't know what sort of stories they've planted in everyone's head. The day he tried to kill my bird was the same day he uploaded a picture of him to Facebook talking about how cute he was - literally just hours after he tried to make him die.  I don't know what it is about him. He's painted this amazing image of himself and it's like only I can see what's under it. He'll do anything it takes to get what he wants and to make people believe him.  Trust me, if I thought there was any way to build a case against him, I'd have done it. But it's one crazy bitch's word against an entire family. Justice won't be served.  I live 40 miles away in an appartment of my own now. I just want to live in peace, I don't have the fight in me anymore. I'm so tired of what he's done to my life that I'd rather just live in spite of him than try to fight a case I know I can't win.",False,True

No person deserves to be abused like this, but especially not a child.   Childhood trauma is definitely a known risk factor for EDs. And in your case the causal link must be especially strong, given that your abuse/abuser was so tied to issues of food and weight.",False,False
