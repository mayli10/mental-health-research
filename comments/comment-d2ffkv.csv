Those intrusive thoughts can be really overwhelming and horrible at times.  While this sub is not about encouraging or giving tips on eating issues, I just wanted to say that you’re a whole and worthy person and you are more than your eating disorder. When you feel ready, my hope for you is to have a full and wonderful life.  In the mean time if you ever need someone to talk to or just want to vent like a diary my inbox is always open.  You are necessary, you are valued and you are loved",False,False
