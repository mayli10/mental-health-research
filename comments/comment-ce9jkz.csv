I’m going to work on increasing my calories, I’ve slipped this pass 2weeks, I had been managing to stick with 1,950cal per day but I back slid. That’s going to be my goal to work toward, I’m planning on easing back off the exercise so that I can replenish myself with energy and start taking some days off of it to rest. Well, I plan on eating a good breakfast thanks to you, I’ve been restricting my breakfast by like 200cals less Than usually and skipping my morning Tea. (Meals that im alone) That’s been my problem recently. Once I fix that I should do better. Hey, thanks though. Today im going to have breakfast &amp; my snack (along with my other meals) 😁👏💯  Ps.

What personally helped me, knowing what a ""healthy"" calorie intake is, I would count and prepare my meals, but I'd make sure it goes over or was equal to that calorie intake.  The stepping...unfortunately I can't help with that but maybe try sleeping tablets? You can't excercise if you're asleep after all.",False,False
