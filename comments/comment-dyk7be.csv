I think each pregnancy/child healed me in a different way and made me a better person. I know the weight gain is horrible. For me, I felt like I had no control over my own body whatsoever. I swear it‚Äôs like exposure therapy for people with EDs. But if you can make it through the pregnancy (and you will!!) life will be easier on the other side.",False,False

It contains relatively large amounts of omega-3 fatty acids, and is an important well of nutrition for creating breast milk that optimally supports baby's brain growth in his first year.    In other words, that weight *also* belongs to your baby.  It's going to be the building blocks of his brain.",False,False

The end of each pregnancy was the worst because at that point I'm so ready to lose the weight but had to wait until I had the baby. I went from 190ish to 126 at my lowest after my last pregnancy.

My first pregnancy I gained a whopping 80 pounds. My body was preparing for triplets....I have a weird genetic thing in my family where our body is only pregnant with 1 child but we create multiple sacs. My aunt had the same thing happen to her. That pregnancy ended up with me having heart failure after birth from the sudden weight gain.   Out of fear, due to the heart issues and my ED, during my second pregnancy I was super careful and obsessive with my diet. I still ate as I was supposed to, but I was restrictive in the sense that I weighed and counted every calorie I ate. I still gained about 60 pounds, though. It really did a number on my mentality around food and I struggled a lot during that first year postpartum.",False,False

I couldn‚Äôt stop until midway through the pregnancy. But I haven‚Äôt been actively bulimic since and it‚Äôs been 9 years. In a way I think that being pregnant/having my first child is what healed me of that! Yet, the core ED itself never has fully disappeared. I‚Äôve struggled with starving/binging in the years since and I can tell you those feelings/urges never fully go away, but there is finding a healthy balance and not letting the ED completely control/run your life. Idk, it might be different for other people but my ED became active when I was 13 and I had the ED thoughts/feelings WAY before that, probably starting from when I was 5. So I guess it‚Äôs deeply rooted in me no matter what, unfortunately. But I can and do choose to not engage in certain ED behaviors and that‚Äôs all I can really do",False,True
