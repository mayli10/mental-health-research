I've helped a few friends lose weight because I know how to count calories, eat balanced meals, and exercise safely and told them that. I know what is and isn't sick behaviors.  that being said you should probably not become an Ed specialist dietician if you have an Ed yourself and aren't recovered, I think that crosses a line",False,False

Someone active in their eating disorder giving diet advice (likely to others struggling with eating disorders themselves) is akin to a drug counselor who is addicted to drugs. They are not in a place mentally to be guiding anyone to healthy behaviors because they would be walking contradictions. I don’t think one can authentically give advice to avoid fad diets if they are slowly killing themselves with fad diets. Honestly, going to school to become a dietician might even aid in recovery because it will teach how misguided our maladaptive coping mechanisms are.",False,False

No shame to you for wanting to be a dietician; at my clinic, every person on the staff was in recovery themselves, including the dieticians. I think coming from that struggle could lend to you being an effective and empathetic dietician, I just think in order to get to that point, you need to be in recovery and not active in the ED behaviors.",False,False
