What weirdly helps me is fasting. My stomach kinda resets and stops making any acid at all after a few days. Or you can go in the opposite direction and eat something like bread. Bread usually helps soak up all the acid for me. Milk helps too. It neutralizes it",False,False

You can take antacids occasionally, but popping them all the time will make your body overcompensate in the long run. If you don't want to eat, water will at least help dilute things and keep your stomach at least a tiny bit busy. Broth would probably be even better if you can muster it, because then your stomach actually has food to digest.",False,False
