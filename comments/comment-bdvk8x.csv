I'll expose this lie: some people cover their ED by ONLY eating in situations where they are seen to eat. So they might eat a ton of indulgent foods in front of other people, and then not eat again until they need to ""Show off"" that they're eating.  A lot of those people also purge. There is a TON of misdirection going on in the thin community because people take pleasure in being THAT girl, the girl who can eat whatever and stay skinny.  There's no more truth to a person eating loads and never gaining weight than there is to an obese person insisting they only eat 1200 calories a day and just can't lose weight. they're both lies. it's just one lie is fetishized by society and the other lie is demonized.",False,False
