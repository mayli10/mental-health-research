When I had ortho my goal wasn't even to be underweight (ended up there anyway due to being restrictive), I just felt ""tainted"" if I ate anything but low carb yogurt, bananas, romaine lettuce, vinegar, and brown rice.

It is called the Flexible Dieting Lifestyle and it is hosted by Zach Rocheleau and Miguel Blacutt.

It actually soothed my ED considerably to listen to them break down the science behind what our body needs.    Also Zach has struggle heavily with disordered eating and body dysmorphia so he gets it and speaks openly about his issues.
