I walked out of the kitchen and quick looked up how much calories bacon fat is, and FUCKING CHRIST ITS 700 CAL. I was freaking out, I refused to eat the food my dad had made for me. And now, I’m really paranoid of the fact that my parents are trying to sabatoge my food too. My mom also gives me bigger bowls/plates, so I’m also paranoid she does that on purpose, to trick me into serving myself more food.",False,False

I worry my husband is going to secretly add extra butter or oil to food I am cooking. To the point I stalk him if he goes in the kitchen. Which is nuts because I don’t think he even really would. But if I don’t I have doubt and can’t eat the food.",False,False
