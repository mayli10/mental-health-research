I would say those are some pretty large indicators that there's a problem.    But! You can start fixing this. If you can go to the doctor for a check up, I highly recommend that as a starting place. It sounds like you may be malnourished (no matter what weight you're at, your body needs a whole slew of nutrients that it can't produce itself or store long term). Maybe try to factor in nutrient-heavy foods on days you do eat - an exam/blood test may help you figure out where you're deficient, or you can try to find a balance on your own but that is definitely more difficult/riskier. Your doctor may also be able to help you get in contact with someone for the mental health aspect, because obsessing over food and weight loss to a detrimental degree is not healthy for anyone.    I'm not a medical professional though, just a concerned stranger. However you choose to handle this I hope you end up in a happy and healthy place. ðŸ–¤",False,False
