Just remember the bare minimum you're supposed to be eating is 1200 cals a day, anything lower is considered low restriction. Your BMI is pretty low, too.   With the weekly purging and low restriction and low BMI I'm gonna say it's an eating disorder but I'm not a clinician.",False,False

When I flirted with it just being disordered eating I could go out and eat and enjoy it and have a normal day. With a disorder everything is food. Everything is about food. I never stop thinking about it,False,False

""disordered eating"" is something most women have and is like, calorie counting, yo-yo dieting, trying to heavily diet then being starving and eating a lot by impulse once in a while etc. once you cross the line into inflicting dangerous harm to your body that comes at tremendous risk on a regular basis this is a serious problem that you deserve help for. I think deep down you know that you have a problem, I hope you can receive the right help because any eating disorder is a prison for your mind and your life that I wouldn't wish on my worst enemy. don't be afraid to try therapy. you don't necessarily need to gain weight, this is a mental disorder and the best treatment is someone who understands the thoughts going on in your head that is making you do this and have the beliefs you do about food and your body. I wish you the best &lt;3. by the way, 800-1400 calories for a 17 year old is severe restriction- that you don't think it is is one of the faulty beliefs a qualified therapist can help you confront.",False,False
