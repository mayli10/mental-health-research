And I’m just being irrational and giving up on my goals and that’s why I’m binging. And I kind of believe that all the time just because I *can* resist the urges, it just takes all my willpower and attention.   But then I think about how it’s not normal to panic, or to fantasize about letting go and eating myself into oblivion, and I shouldn’t spend every waking hour obsessed with being skinny, looking at people who are skinny, hating the body I’m in, etc. I think about how life isn’t supposed to be this hard.   Some days eating is just a coping mechanism and I shouldn’t be doing it, other days it’s a curse on my existence and it’s eat it all or eat nothing. Very rarely does it feel like fueling my body. Almost always do I feel like shit.",False,False

It’s really important that we promote that it doesn’t have to be ‘severe’ (underweight, overweight, binging, purging, hurting yourself everyday) to be a problem. If you’ve found things to relate to on this sub at all, then you are definitely not faking it.",False,False

I lost my fitbit for an hour and had a panic attack looking for it. It turned out to be in an obvious place and I sobbed as I put it back on my wrist. Then continued with my day as if nothing had happened, and it wasn't until an hour later that I realized that was probably kinda fucked up.   Of course, a few months later it broke and I haven't been able to fix it since. That was a whole other disaster that we don't need to speak of lol",False,False
