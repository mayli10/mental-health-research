And it’s not what you eat in the short term but in the long term that matters. Even if you eat like 5000 calories in one day, you wouldn’t gain more than like a pound at most (bc you naturally burn 1500-2000+ on a normal day, plus your body can only process so much at once). You may have some temporary fluctuations due to food volume and water weight but it won’t last More than a couple days and it’s not “real” fat gain!!! I’d recommend hiding your scale for a few days around if you weigh yourself often. Distract yourself when you can so you don’t sit around and overthink things. It’s hard but try to be present in the moment, enjoy having fun with friends or whoever you celebrate with. Your birthday is cause for celebration and it’s normal to celebrate with food! It’s ok to struggle with it, but it’s ok to be nice to yourself and you deserve to have nice or special things you enjoy :) happy (upcoming) birthday!",False,False
