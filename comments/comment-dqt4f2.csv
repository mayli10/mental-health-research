If he's making you feel like you are because of that, thats fucked up of HIM.            Id lose my fucking shit if my fiance got me drunk to have sex with me because I said no...that's so so so gross. Wtf. You don't deserve that. Hes in the wrong for all of this.            Like, I understand it sucks when your SO doesn't want to have sex with you. Any time my fiance rejects me, I do get a little butthurt about it. But then I get over it. Because I don't want to have sex with someone who doesn't want to have sex with me! Not once have I even THOUGHT of getting him drunk to get him to say yes???? Idk if you realize how fucked that is. It's really fucked. It's disgusting.            When I was really depressed I didn't have sex with my fiance for 6 months straight. And he never tried to coerce me. He knew I wasn't feeling up to it, and accepted that. That's what decent people do. Or if not having sex is a huge deal breaker, then he should break up with you. Not ""take no very badly"" or get you drunk to try to have sex with you.",False,False
