You should tell them that forcing you when you're not ready could lead to you developing bulimia or some other ED instead. Youre still 14 tho so even if you did gain weight, you'll still get taller but i understand if you dont want to just give in.  They sound like my parents . I fought with them a lot around my early teens and those problems accumulated and is part of why my mental health sucks rn. You can tell them that you could end up worse when youre older but its not worth getting angry. It doesnt help and when youre burnt out it just becomes sadness.",False,False

""Now I'm fully recovered "" vs "" I know I'm not going to recover ever"". It seems like you're not recovered but your parents are forcing recovery on you. You say you know not to take it to far but where is too far? The only way I can see you able to keep fasting is that you have periods in between where you deliberately gain weight.   What you can do is to try to reach a compromise with your parents. You'll have to eat regularly and at least maintain your current weight. That way, at least you can choose your food and when you eat and you wouldn't have to gain weight. You can tell them too that a lot of the time EDs stem from the need for control so the more they force you, the more they're making your ED worse. They might be force-feeding you because they feel helpless so you should direct them in how they can help you- ask them to cook a breakfast which you're fine with eating etc.    then please try to recover when you're ready. You've invested a lot into your ED so it might seem like part of your identity but trust me you'll find things that'll make you happier than fasting.",False,False
