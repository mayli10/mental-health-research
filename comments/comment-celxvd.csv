I started EC stacking a couple years ago, and I was very careful and made sure to educate myself on it. I started slow, taking only half a pill of E with no C. Then after I got used to it I added in half of a caffeine pill. After talking half stacks for several months, I decided to try taking a full stack, 25mg E and 200mg C.  That night at work I started to feel really sick and really sluggish. I hadn’t been fasting, I even tried to eat some chips from the vending machine to see if it would help me feel better. NOPE. Eventually it got so bad I had a slight pain in my chest every time I took A STEP.  I ended up crying to my manager that I was having chest pains and needed to go home. And almost immediately when I got home I had probably the most violent and painful vomiting session of my life. God it was terrifying. I have never tried to take a full stack since.  For reference I’m 5’2” and was probably around 120lbs at the time, a perfectly healthy weight. That shit will sneak up on you!",False,False
