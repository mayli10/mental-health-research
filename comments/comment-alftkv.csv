Basically I was thighs with my counselor and he hooked it up to keep me out of trouble since the administration HATED me and would go after me for some of the dumbest shit. •im not exaggerating years later my old principle gave me a call and formally apologized for the way he treated me and even offered a reference if I needed one• ,False,False

The process of getting one involves identifying where your diagnosis affects school performance and adherence to school policies, and finding ways to accommodate that.  Flexibility with deadlines is a very common thing in 504s. One specific way you might see it is that teachers must accept late work and aren't allowed to deduct points, as long as it's turned in within the grading period.  You may be allowed a private place to eat lunch. You may be allowed to eat and drink in class regardless of school or teacher rules about it. You may be allowed to go to the nurse or counselor to calm down when your anxiety spikes. You may be exempted from cell phone use if you need it to access health resources, like if you need to track your food or access a CBT app. You may be allowed to take tests privately or have extra time. One thing you might consider asking for is the ability to take tests after school during tutoring hours. You might find it easier to ask for help when you're one-on-one.  You might ask for weekly or monthly meetings with a counselor or whoever is in charge of inclusion, to give you a scheduled opportunity to work with someone to identify where you need help and how to ask for it.  In short, here's what you do:  1. Figure out how your diagnosis affects your life, generally speaking.   2. Get specific, and identify where you expect to struggle going back to school, and why it will be a struggle.  3. Brainstorm ways to solve these problems. ",False,False
