I write up a comment and then just discard it because I worry it'll trig someone.  The one I spat this time was about how I'd provide a product suggestion and keep the judginess that motivated it quiet, were I the cashier.  In reality, had I been the cashier and done that, I would realise upon seeing this post that I should have asked if you were feeling alright and not been a snarky bitch.",False,False

And I’m not kidding wen they’ve seen me exclusively on my worst days. I go in there nearly daily even still and closely examine every tempting thing that once had been a binge food knowing I’d feel disgusted and put it back. Even having memorised the calorie content of each of them. But for some time I only ate fruits and similar things there and one guy who’s worked there for years asked me what happened to my healthy food rule when I went in dressed like a mess to buy my unhealthy binge foods (oh boy I was truly a mess that day) and I felt mortified and said something like “temptation wins today”. Admittedly I still go there nearly daily for my caffeine fix (those zero calorie monster energy drinks) no such comments since really.,False,False
