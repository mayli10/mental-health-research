Only safe foods and things I don't really crave. It's such a pain and I can't even allow myself to bake homemade goods üò™ No multiple serving snacks, no desserts. Only frozen vegetables and some canned goods. Almond milk, oatmeal, tofu, beans. I miss eating like a normal person.",False,False

I actually used to drink zero cal iced tea all the time but then I stopped. Maybe I should start again, especially because here in my country they sell like a... Concentrate (?) that you blend with water - so you can buy 1L of the concentrate and potentially get like 90L of the drink. Thanks for reminding me that zero can/low cal liquids exist haha.",False,True

I wish I could do the same thing but I live with my bf who loooves food so we have to have something yummy around all the time. Thankfully we only really share dinners and he buys his own food for breakfast and lunch and I have this rule that I don't eat his food, so it's not too bad but ugh. I'm trying not to count calories, but freezing leftovers immediately is a great advice! I never binge on stuff that takes 4-5+ minutes of prep so freezing seems like a great way to counter that :)",False,True

The only thing in my pantry is oatmeal, instant miso, falafel mix, and rice. So I 100% feel you on the bland stuff. Whenever I try to buy more I have the mindset of IF ALL MUST GO RIGHT NOW SO I CAN'T BINGE. Have you tried getting a food scale and weighing stuff out? That makes me feel better. I also use a calorie counting app and input all my food for every day of the week beforehand to lessen anxiety about picking stuff and worrying if I'm going over my calorie limit. Also if I have leftovers I freeze them right away so I can't just take them out and finish them. Writing this all out makes me feel pretty pathetic tbh....but I hope it helps maybe?",False,False
