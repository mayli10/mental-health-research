I love baking + cooking too, and see so little people who enjoy it in the ED community.

It’s a great creative outlet and people generally enjoy sharing the results. Everyone stays on my good side so the goods keep rolling in lol  I’ve also found charities and stuff to donate baked goods to. Baking just gives me the warm fuzzies too. Feels like my way of putting good out into the world.  Unfortunately, how much I get to enjoy my own baking depends on the current flavor of my ED. Sometimes I enjoy my fair share, other times I c/s to make sure it’s edible. Always feels a bit insane when I can’t bring myself to eat things I make for others.",False,False
