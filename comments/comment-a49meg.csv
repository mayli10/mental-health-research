I want to loose more weight before my graduation ceremony in April for that very reason. On the other hand, I’m skeletal in my prom pics (I’m 5”9 and I was way wayyyy below 100 pounds) and I wish these pics didn’t exist cause I’ll never willingly show them anyway (cause it’s super obvious I’m not healthy) and they are not a nice memory.   So what I’m trying to say is you might not regret not having these pictures if it’s a visual reminder of how uncomfortable you felt. I’d also vote for something like a journal entry, a later to yourself or something like that you can look back later on and that’s more focused on your achievements rather than the visual aspect of the celebration.",False,False
