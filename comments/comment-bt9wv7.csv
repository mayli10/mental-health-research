When I was at my HW I didn't pay any attention to my appearance and now my flaws are all I notice. Would definitely say a 1/10.,False,False

I'm male, so you get treated poorly if you're thin. People only treat you well at a BMI 14, but that's more because they're scared for you. They look at you like they've seen a ghost. It feels nice.",False,False

But body dysmorphia is a wicked bitch. I was more confident at 150+ lbs heavier than I am today.   I had that shocking realization just the other day. I went on a scavenger hunt where had to take pictures and the entire time I was concerned with how fat I look. Then looking at the pictures I saw I was the smallest one there. I was no where near this insecure when I was actually fat...,False,False

I used to feel alienated bc I was really fat and weird but now I feel alienated bc I’m still weird and moderately fat. I have days where I wish I was just “normal.”   I have autism and in middle school I hit puberty before everyone else. So carrying about 40+ pounds more than 90% of my peers, a tutor in every single classroom, and different tastes/interests than most people, I never felt compatible or truly accepted by those around me and probably never will.   Except on the internet. Bless the internet.   4/10",False,False
