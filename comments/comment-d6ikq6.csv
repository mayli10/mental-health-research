I drink electrolyte drinks, take nightly magnesium, and try to eat and keep down some high potassium foods (my go to are banana, sweet potato and spinach/Swiss chard). Soaking in Epsom salts held too. Not sure if you have an option to hop in the bath after your run with Epsom salts and a Gatorade but I bet you would feel better quicker.",False,False

A pill version wouldn't be a horrible idea, but the nice thing with the sports drink thing is it's also ""forcing"" you to drink water simultaneously.   However if you've been electrolytin' it all up and are still getting cramps, it might be wise to take a rest day where you focus on stretching and soaking your legs/sore muscles? I know it's hard to skip workouts with ED brain, but maybe justify with ""if I find a way to rest, I can workout more consistently""?  Take care of yourself, love &lt;3",False,False

It could be a variety of other things but electrolyte issues could be helped with a sports drink (low/no cal options out there).   It won't hurt you to try and it may help.,False,False

Most ED sufferers are at risk for it, I assume purging also compounds the dehyration/electrolyte depletion. Please get yourself a sports drink soon, there are zero cal options if you need.",False,False
