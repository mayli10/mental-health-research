It takes a LONG time and a TON of work to even understand what our baggage is. Learning that is the first step and it sounds like you know that you have a deep-seated need for affirmation. And it ALSO sounds like you realize that that is maladaptive and isn‚Äôt getting you where you want to be long term.   None of this means you suck, it just means you have to do the hard work of learning how to be careful with others while still getting what you need. (I speak from experience, I had a ‚Äúhappy‚Äù childhood but my parents fought a lot and I CRAVE affirmation and love from mentor figures and have maladaptive behaviors so I really feel you here).   I just wanted to chime in and let you know you aren‚Äôt alone in these things üíï",False,False
