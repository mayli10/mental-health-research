Like there's just a very very tiny, conscious part of us while the rest of us is just this impulsive bacteria-infested meat blob that will always overpower the tiny sliver.",False,False

I'm reminded of a quote from a show that's currently popular:   ""Either you know what you want, and you don't get it, or you get what you want, and then you don't know what you want.""  It sounds like hitting that BMI is your capital G Goal, and after that, maybe you don't know what you want. That could be the real reason it's so hard to obtain.",False,False

Other people including my family might make snide comments about my body or weight or people judge what I eat  I can dislike myself and everything about my body and associate all this negative stuff to it  But my body itself, my organs and raw cells, they just wanna thrive and do their best  All they care about is thriving. They don't care if I'm tiny or pretty or if I compare to whatever Tumblr thinspo, they just wanna do their best  Our bodies themselves love us, it's just our stupid brains that fuck us up :'~)  Hope you feel better ❤️❤️",False,False
