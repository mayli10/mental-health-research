Maybe you could ask your sister to turn it down/try not to weigh food and count carbs around you? I‚Äôve spent holidays at my parents‚Äô house and there were a lot of situations and forgotten feelings that kinda triggered my negative thoughts and all. Not to mention all the Christmas food ugh. But it‚Äôs good that you realized something wrong is going on and want to reach out for help. Maybe there‚Äôs a support group where you live? Hang in there, you are now stronger than you‚Äôve been before and I believe in you, don‚Äôt let the stupid disorder take another toll on you! xx",False,False
