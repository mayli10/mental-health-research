I also know that I am objectively not fat, but I definitely don't think I am skinny/thin. People do call me that sometimes, but I just disagree. I think my personal idea of thin has been skewed to my lowest weight - which I am not at currently. Stay here and keep your positivity - we all need a perspective check sometimes. I know I do! Keep safe ❤️",False,False

Eating disorders are mental illnesses and not just about weight. Don't worry about initial downvotes, your heart was in the right place for sure. People might not like being called thin, or we may have some trolls on here. Either way, sending you some love. You are welcome and wanted here. ",False,False

So far bulimia really hasn't been effective for me to lose weight, the only weight i've lost and kept off was the 25ish pounds i lost BEFORE I started purging. obviously everyone is different and idk what this info will do for you if anything but just thought i should say something because I relate so hard. I also have been in treatment for it and I was taken very seriously by anyone I talked to (they even recommended me to do residential to start), so do not worry about being ""skinny enough"" I thought the same thing but you are just as valid at any weight. You deserve happiness!!!!",False,False
