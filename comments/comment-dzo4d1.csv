That you took my words to heart instead of rejecting them is very encouraging. I sincerely hope you can find a way to eat without guilt — even for one meal. When you find that moment, hold onto it. When you realize you are capable of experiencing such freedom, you might realize that living life without ED is truly possible. I believe in you!!",False,False

I promise it will get better and easier. Right now your ED is feeling threatened and ramping up the abuse it doles out to keep you in line and the disorder safe. Fuck that!! You deserve to feel strong, enjoy food, and live your life free from self-abuse. It is hard because you normally use starvation to cope with your anxieties and push them away, and now that you don’t have that, you actually have to deal with and work through your feelings. It feels unbearable but it’s worth it — all pain and uncomfortable feelings are temporary. Practice makes perfect. You’ll be okay. If it’s really hard, you can negotiate with your ED like “I can always starve tomorrow” and when tomorrow comes, put it off another day. Remember that you have agency and you are in control. Feeding yourself means you are taking back the reins of your life, not that you’re failing at your ED. Starving yourself means you have failed to control your impulses and you are giving your life to your ED. Don’t throw away all the hard work you’ve already put into healing your body.",False,False
