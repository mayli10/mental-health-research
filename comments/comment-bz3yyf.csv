So, if you haven't recently hurt or threatened to hurt anyone (including yourself), that leaves the vaguer ""gravely disabled"" category, which could include not nourishing oneself. Though I'd have thought they'd need to be able to assert that the lack of self-care was putting you in fairly immediate danger.  &amp;#x200B;  I've had psych holds in nice facilities and psych holds in kinda scary places. It can be a big gamble since you often have little to no say over what facility you go to, what doctor you see, what treatment they prescribe, and when you get to leave. Can you talk things through with whomever is making the threat and hopefully reach an understanding that doesn't involve them requesting a 302?",False,False
