It's like I binge and purge, and then I feel emotionally cleaned. The binge has a clear start and finish.  Whereas when I just binge I feel like shit for the rest of the day. And I might as well keep on binging because I've already ""ruined"" the day. I'm finding Saturdays really hard because I plan a higher calorie day, but I wake up and eat the breakfast part of my plan, and then the lunch part, and then the snack part, all before 11 am.   Then I go to the library to revise. Then I only have dinner left when I get back. Which I eat. And then I want a snack. But I'm already over my limit. So I end up caving and then it turns into a binge.  This all happened because I tried to recover, and break the b/p cycle by not purging after binging. Now I just binge. I've gained almost 15lbs and I'm so fat. I was so much happier when I allowed myself one b/p on Saturday per week. Ironically, I found myself often not even having my weekly b/p.  I'm gonna go back to having one planned b/p per week. I feel like this is me giving up on recovery, but honestly it will reduce harm.",False,False

While I definitely don't *like* being Bulimic, I *definitely* prefer it to the BED, dear fucking christ. I feel like a lot of that is due to the fact that I don't purge with lax or puking, but rather with starving myself; if I dealt with the ramifications of the ""classic"" bingeing I think I'd definitely hate this more. As it stands, though, BED is genuinely the hardest shit I've had to deal with, even worse than drug and self harm addictions. It's fucked.",False,False
