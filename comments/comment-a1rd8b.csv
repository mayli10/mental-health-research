Don‚Äôt be afraid to move your computer monitor to be most comfortable in your new and improved position. I‚Äôm nearsighted as shit, so I even upped the text size on my laptop so I can sit better and still read (embarrassing since I‚Äôm only 22). I don‚Äôt have diagrams but googling ‚Äúphysical therapy for forward-head posture‚Äù or ‚Äústretches for a dowagers hump‚Äù or various combinations of similar buzzwords will get you good instruction. It‚Äôs an ongoing process, but take some selfies of you sitting ‚Äúnaturally‚Äù (aka shitty) and ‚Äúcorrectly‚Äù. I promise you‚Äôll look 15 pounds lighter and much more toned, and the hump will be less pronounced. It seemed to shrink when I got into the healthy BMI range, and I assume will be even smaller as I push towards the lower end of healthy. ",False,False

This give me so much hope. How did you fix your posture when sitting at a desk and studying? Because that‚Äôs where I struggle. Also is there a website with diagrams of the stretches?? How long did it take you? Once again thank u!! ,False,True

Partially it went away with weight loss. Partially fixing my posture. Lots of it is stretching. I stretch the following muscles and it helps: pectoral muscles (the doorway stretch, diagrams are online). Neck, particularly the front. Abdominals. This exercise also helps: pull your head back (like a cobra fixing to strike) and hold it there for 30 seconds. Other than that, imagine a string attached to the top of your spine that pulls you up.

Lol I know that sounds weird but yoga has helped my posture a lot. I didn't know you're supposed to kind of tuck your tailbone (also helps with stomach pooch and back flaps).   Sitting with proper posture made me realize how weak my abs are. ,False,False

Never went away from weight loss for me. :(.   I ended up seeing a surgeon and they let me know it was a mix of fibrous tissue and fat deposits. If you do a lot of workouts with Olympic bars it can also be a natural response from your body to protect your spine. Or at least that is what they told me.    I ended up spending two grand to get the fat sucked out, but there is still the fibrous tissue/muscle there. It is a baby hump now and I am still insecure as shit about it. I tried doing exercises on youtube for it and it didn't do much. I also ended up over-correcting my posture over the past few years so please be careful with that! Maybe go speak with a chiropractor and they can try to line everything up and show you were your posture should be naturally.    Sorry to be the downer here. :/ I just have first hand experience with it. ",False,False

Thick dark skin at the back of the neck can be a sign of insulin resistance. But the color would be super obvious, so you're in the clear there. A hump can also be a symptom of Cushing's disease, but Cushing's would also be very obvious. If you're not taking oral steroid medication (a side effect of which can be a fat deposit at the base of the neck), then I think it's probably just a postural issue.  You mention that you have bad postural habits.  Frequent forward head posture can lead to the development of a fat pad over the back of the neck as a way for your body to protect your spine. The good news is that you can very likely get rid of or at the very least drastically improve the appearance of the hump. If you're above a 'normal' weight  (sorry, hate that term) then weight loss will help. Otherwise, practicing good posture and doing some simple exercises and regular stretches should do the trick. You can find lots of good info by googling ""Dowager's hump"". Hope that helps!  Source: not a doctor, just know some stuff.",False,False

The hump kinda dissapears but my the base of my neck is kinda thick and masculine (sorry I don‚Äôt know a better term to describe it) I grew up with binging tendencies and have definitely been stuck in binge cycles but  not extreme calories in one go.. maybe 3000.
