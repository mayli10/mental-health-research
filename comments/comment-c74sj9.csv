I honestly don't know what to make of it. But it's likely that she was being thoughtless... The thing that upset me the most was the situation we were in. I was eating ice-cream (extra small cup ofc) and for the first time in a long time I didn't feel guilty...but I threw away the rest after that,False,True

I know for a lot of people who arenâ€™t as fixated on weight as we are, those type of comments usually arenâ€™t made to be mean, or necessarily even true. Maybe her daughter has been complaining about the medication and weight gain or something, and mil just had a â€˜stupidâ€™ moment. She probably meant nothing by it.",False,False
