The medication Iâ€™m taking is called topiramate, and itâ€™s actually an anti convulsant (used to treat epilepsy) but also proved to be highly effective in treating nightmares for people with ptsd. Since I started taking it Iâ€™ve lost aprox 3lbs a week. I am now borderline underweight and feel like I am developing an ED again. I have a history with AN.",False,True

I have been taking sleeping pills for 1,5 years because of my ptsd, and my doctor just stopped prescribing them a couple of months ago. Not because I was losing weight again, but because I was still using them for restricting (sleep &gt; eating) and was/am pretty addicted.   I definitely think you should tell her the truth, so you don't spiral back. While I do know the feeling of not wanting people to stop you restriction, dealing with the sleep-problems caused by ptsd is (as you know) absolute hell. I don't think your UW will ever be worth that pain.   I hope you feel better soon, and the appointment goes well!!",False,False
