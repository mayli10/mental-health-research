I'm not a doctor so I cant tell you if for your situation you are practicing a dangerous behavior. But I will say, if you are underweight, you should stop, and if you feel dizzy, your throat feels tight, or if your heart rate gets much higher than usual or feels jumpy or ""skippy"", you should stop immediately and get a source of electrolytes (if it's too difficult to get calories, look for powerade zero or Gatorade zero) and if you can handle calories, a fast acting carbohydrate, even half a banana, and then something more dense in protein.  All I am looking for here is a little harm reduction, please stay as safe as you can make yourself do.",False,False
