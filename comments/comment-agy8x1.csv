I replenish all of my electrolytes with Powerade Zero all day. My daily routine is go to class until 11:30 than volleyball or some other team sport for 2 hours, then 2 hours of weight training, then most days a 2-3 hour golf practice, come home sleep for a couple of hours, get up go to the gym for a couple of hours to grind cardio. Than study for a bit and then pas out and get 4 hours of sleep at best and then the whole thing starts over. Basically I‚Äôm physically active all day and keep running into the problem of supporting my physical activity with stimulants instead of food for energy and my body just feels exhausted 24/7 also pic of my morning workout üòÇ   https://imgur.com/a/C3az6um  Yes I avoided touching the heart rate censor for the entire workout just for the meme of heart rate 0",False,True

And it isn‚Äôt like a ‚Äúooouuuu I want that now‚Äù craving it‚Äôs more like. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt feel that hungry and don‚Äôt feel like eating but it‚Äôs almost as if my body is forcing me to get it‚Äù like no desire to eat it but my stomachs is finally like ‚ÄúI‚Äôve had enough of this shit put some goddamn food in your mouth‚Äù the thing is I don‚Äôt binge hard when I fuck up. I will eat maybe 500 cal and fucking hate myself and be in physical pain for hours and mental pain for days so when I see people that say they have 8000 cal binges I‚Äôm like ‚ÄúI‚Äôd rather shoot myself than have to live with myself after that‚Äù ,False,True

I hope that you eat something small, just so your body has some energy after that workout. If you feel like you cant, at least drink something with electolytes!! Best of luck to you!!",False,False

Had been doing a great job of fasting and restricting for a month and gotten down to an extremely underweight BMI... answer? To binge on 4000-8000 calories for a week and just see how much comes back on. It's never as much as I think I'll gain and that gives me the confidence to binge harder until I reach a point where I feel to fat and go back to severe restriction to lose all the fat again. I don't even enjoy the binges. I eat and it hurts but I can't stop. Then I just feel disgusted by myself and do it again to try and feel better. No one ever really seems to notice my weight fluctuations though and people always just label me skinny.  Also late night McDonalds? Always. I'm a big raver and my biggest weakness is a 4AM McDonalds binge.,False,False

Got up and skipped class to do my workout this morning because I knew I‚Äôd be depressed all day if I waited till 5pm to workout like normal. So I went and did a quick 800 cal run on the treadmill and I feel better ,False,True

Got to my lowest weight and yesterday turned into a giant binge. I've decided I'm giving myself one set cheat day a week. It made me feel better knowing that yesterday was my cheat day and I was allowed to eat all that. If I tell myself that I cant eat something, I feel guilty and anxious leading to purging. But if I give myself permission to eat everything I want in 2 days, I know I can wait.  You're not alone &lt;3",False,False
