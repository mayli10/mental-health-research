Was feeling on top of the world and almost sociable - started getting in touch with friends I‚Äôve isolated myself from. Now it‚Äôs Xmas day and i haven‚Äôt been able to stop snacking and overeating the past three days - I‚Äôm miserable, bloated, and don‚Äôt want to see anyone until I‚Äôve got rid of this horrible body",False,False

It‚Äôs my favorite holiday and I hate that this bullshit disorder is taking so much of the joy from it. My sister got me chocolates that aren‚Äôt even that crazy high calorie and the first thing I thought was, ‚Äúokay, I can redistribute this to my friends when I see them next.‚Äù It makes me feel like a horrific person. The worst thing is knowing that it barely fucking matters if I eat like shit during the holidays because it‚Äôs not like I‚Äôll stop restricting in the new year, lol.",False,False

Him being enraged and literally yelling in my face (in front of my aunt who has not visited in 6 years). Full on restriction mode until I suddenly snap at night, inhaling 8000 calories. Compelled to fast for ""x"" amount of days out of self hatred, despite already feeling hungry at 12 hours into the fast. Feeling sad, scared, unlikeable, unworthy. Wanting to completely isolate myself even though I'm lonely.",False,False

My family arrived and looked me up and down which made me feel sick. My mother has brought up my size multiple times which made me want to leave, especially when it was in front of everyone. Everyone was watching what food I served myself. I am currently in the bathroom contemplating purging, for the first time in 4 years. One of my family members touched my waist. I am so anxious.

Planned a four day fast. Made it 21 hours, checked my weight on a scale (don‚Äôt have one at home), hit a new LW and was in an amazing mood. Used said amazing mood to try to eat, enjoy it, and just restart my fast tomorrow. It wasn‚Äôt a true‚Ñ¢Ô∏è binge and was definitely under maintenance but I felt so sick and afraid of gaining weight and I ended up purging. Now I‚Äôm restarting my fast (literally restarted it on the zero app the second I got done throwing up lmao) and debating whether I should break it w alcohol or real food as soon as it‚Äôs over :‚Äô) cheers",False,False

They love him so much and think he‚Äôs gods gift to humankind and I‚Äôm the only one that knows he‚Äôs a piece of shit. Yet I have to sit here and pretend he didn‚Äôt pull me out of my dream job and leave me penniless, friendless, and lonely while they literally cry about him being so amazing (he‚Äôs in the military so of course that mitigates and wrong-doing, right?üòí) and I‚Äôm sitting here fucking stabbing a baked potato wishing my own parents would text me back and wish me a merry Christmas.

Also someone gave me chocolates for Christmas and I both want to stab them and crawl into bed and eat them all. CHRISTMAS,False,True
