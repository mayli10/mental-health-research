There is no way your body is gonna do that just because you lost under that point. Your organs will be damaged by long periods of starvation but that's not about weight it's about the nutrition needs. If you look skinnier than your weight then there is a chance that you can't get to underweight or close to it. My mom was anorexic and looked skeletal at a just barely healthy weight.,False,False

Yes you can lose 10 lbs a month safely but you still need to eat and exercise and take multivitamins so you're not just wasting away. Your body will try to yank out nutrients from other parts of your body it shouldn't be pulling from. Think of drying to wring out water from a dry sponge.,False,False

Sudden weight loss (Even if it's like ten pounds) can be alarming for doctors if you arent, like, obese or something. They kind of just know that if it isnt slow weight loss, it's probably disordered. Find some rocks or something (Magnets or another metal work best) and hide it in your clothes, then weigh yourself.

It can cause health problems even if you're not underweight. Also your doctor might be worried that the distance from 20 to underweight isn't a lot, and because you've lost weight quickly before, you might lose more and become underweight. When I got to the low end of a healthy BMI, and people started getting worried, I thought they were just crabs in a bucket, but then I lost more, and it turned out they were worried for a good reason.
