Technically, a ‚Äútrue‚Äù fast wouldn‚Äôt allow any liquids except water and absolutely no solids. Meaning no caffeine, no electrolytes, no vitamin gummies. Some sects of religion even nix water- meaning it‚Äôs *absolutely* nothing being consumed.   But obviously, you‚Äôre doing it for an extended period of time and have to do actual life things. You‚Äôre not a monk meditating for days on end. You actually have to move around and interact. So things can be allowed. Exceptions can be made.   It‚Äôs you and your fast. No-one else should have input on it and you shouldn‚Äôt feel shame for anything that might be a bump in your fasting road.",False,False
