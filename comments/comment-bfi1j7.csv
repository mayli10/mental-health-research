I've had my ED for about 13 years swinging around purging behaviours, restricting behaviours, binge eating and chronic overeating and back again. I've had a personality change and where I was once friendly and funny and good at connecting to people I know struggle to socialise, can't make new friends and frequently just...drift away from the ones I do manage to have.   And for what. I'm not even thin. I still hate my body, I've been overweight for years. My teeth and skin and hair are a mess. And I'm still over here like 'If I control my binge eating and restrict I can't at least get reasonably thin again' while I spottily purge while my family is out and abuse laxatives.  &amp;#x200B;  The only thing my ED really achieved was making what should have been the best years of my life (uni) a nightmare, killed any creativity I had and left me completely clueless about how to be healthy lol",False,False

I'm nowhere near as bad as I was in the past and I'm grateful for that. I am functioning and have my career so I'm ok. Still striving to be recovered but ok.,False,True

Can barely chew anymore but it just makes me even more anal about food because it's so difficult and such a chore i feel like I'm losing control over the ONE THING I had!!!,False,False

I know how shitty this lifestyle is (year 5 of ano), but like they say above, please, if you are ""new"" to ed, turn bacl now. There is nothing lovley about this way of life. The mental breakdowns, lack of sleep, lack of trust, constant anxiety. There is no glamor in eating a hash brown out of the garbage at 3 am. Trust me. Please be safe!",False,False

I’m almost the same age as you so I can’t take it as a “warning from my future self” but I really hope it reaches someone the way you want it to.",False,False
