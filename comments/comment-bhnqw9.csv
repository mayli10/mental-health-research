It kills me inside to do it and to not restrict but I try. And I binge anyways lol.  I have been having a few somewhat restrictive days in between the binges but all they do is end up taking me back to maintenance for the week. And they arent purposeful- I guess my mental hunger is satisfied and it coincides with days of less stress as well",False,True

If I am knitting I can't binge (no spare hands) and my focus is on the pattern.  But sometimes still it's not enough.,False,False

So don’t worry  too much about it :)  I wish I had any tips on how to stop bingeing but it’s something I haven’t seemed to have cracked yet either :(  Hope you feel better soon babe",False,False

I've tried pre-logging in the past but it seems to be something I forget to do. And it did help for a bit but then I'd fall out of the habit and start binging again. But I can always try again. Thank you,False,True

It's helped me be way more thoughtful when I'm trying to binge and after a few days of doing it the desire for out of control binging is pretty much gone  Also those Gerber cheese puffs are awesome for mindless eating. It's 200-something calories for the whole container so you could that (or eat multiple of those) and it'd be better than binging on a big bag of Cheetos. Pretty much all the baby snacks are great   More unhealthy tips: when I was trying to break my binge/fast cycle a few weeks ago I'd eat like 3 halo tops and a can of soup. I felt satisfied, like I'd emotionally eaten, but I was still at a reasonable calorie count for the day",False,False
