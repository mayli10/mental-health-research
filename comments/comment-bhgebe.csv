I bet you've made a lot of people feel way less alone about their secretive behaviours. It's disgusting, but this is how eating disorders can be. They're mental illnesses and we are not the glorified version the internet loves to perpetuated. It's disgusting, it's embarrassing but that's how things are for some of us. I can't explain the things I do, it just seems like the best option/idea to my disordered/messed up brain at the time.",False,False
