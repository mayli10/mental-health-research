If you‚Äôre underweight or at a relatively low weight your body not just loses weight slower but has a tendency to plateau. You have to be losing fat on these stats so im sure it‚Äôs just water! ‚ù§Ô∏è is could be sodium bloating so just drink lots of water and you‚Äôll see it go down don‚Äôt worry about it. It‚Äôs very possible that the scale is broken so mayb try new batteries? There‚Äôs so so many possibilities so don‚Äôt freak out or just eat even less which could do some damage to your body. ‚ù§Ô∏è maybe drink lots of water and replace your scale batteries and try again in a couple days? In addition- measurements! They are far more constant and less variable,False,False
