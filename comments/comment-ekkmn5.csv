In the instruction manual there was an asterisk with a small print *must be combined with one of our eating plans for optimal results. So I open the eating section of the booklet and there are four plans titled: slow results (1200 kcal), medium results (800 kcal), fast results (600 kcal) and ultimate results (400 kcal), each with an example of what you can eat. I didnt know any better, neither did my mom. It was on TV, we thought, they must know what they are talking about.   Now that I look back at it - what the actual fuck?",False,False

Tracking calories and macros obsessively? (CICO is true and actually how you lose weight, but mainstream diet culture takes it waaaaay too far and into the realm of unhealthy obsession).   Cutting entire food groups out of your diet primarily for weight-loss reasons? (e.g. keto, paleo, plant-based, etc.)   Fasting for days? Intermittent fasting?   Practically tailoring your lifestyle to fit your diet? (bringing ""safe"" food to social events, turning down social gatherings due to diet stuff, etc.)   Logging everything you eat?   Juice cleanses?   The overwhelming majority of mainstream diet advice just reeks of ED behaviors cloaked in ""health"" language.",False,False

They encourage even doing 36 hour fasts. What happened to the whole eat healthy foods at a certain calories intake and exercise regular healthy lifestyle get shoved aside and replaced with things that we used to get shamed for.  Now it’s ok to restrict and fast for days and getting a pat on the back by society. It doesn’t help when these diets are being paraded around by doctors.,False,False
