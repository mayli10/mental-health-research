I haven’t been this weight in over 5 years so I was in high school back then. I’ve also been through a pregnancy, so my hips are wider and I have fat in places I didn’t before. My body just doesn’t look the same as it did when I was 15 which I know isn’t something that is even possible since I’m almost 23 lol. I felt like this was a good weight for me back then, I looked awesome!! Now it’s like I don’t even recognize my body in the mirror :( doesn’t help that I’ve lost 78 pounds so I’ve got cellulite/stretch marks and my girls are saggy. It just sucks.",False,True
