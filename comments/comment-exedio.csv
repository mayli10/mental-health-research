I wish i could help.  You absolutely shouldn't feel guilty for eating or not eating.  It's okay.  You are free to choose which one you'd like without shame.  Just remember that your body needs energy, so if you can't eat, rest and drink water.   Your mother loves you.  If you need her, she'll be there in a heartbeat. That's what she's for, so don't be afraid to reach out.",False,False

The “failure for eating and failure for not eating like normies”!feeling is common in eating disorder sufferers, especially those who toy with the idea of pseudo recovery. But i can assure you that neither criterion makes you a failure. You have an eating disorder that haunts you every minute of the day, so of course eating will be hard. The fact that you try demonstrates that you’re far from being a failure. On the other hand, you are most certainly *not* a failure for eating. The ED wants you to think that way because the ed wants to hurt you. The ED has convinced you that your worth is perhaps solely contingent upon your ability to starve and get rid of the food. So you feel worthless and guilty when you don’t live up to this toxic standard. But that’s false. You deserve to eat like the rest of people, regardless of your weight or body or grades or whatever.   Please, for now, just try to rest if you can. You’re crying and you’re in no position to force yourself to eat. Let yourself cry. It’s ok. If you’d like to talk to your mother sometime soon, I recommend it, as long as she would be understanding and wouldn’t worsen your condition.   You aren’t bothering your mother. You’re not a burden. The truth is all kids have problems. If you bring a kid into this world and expect them to never have an issue where they need help, then you’ve got a surprise coming. I can assure you that your mother doesn’t see the issue as “wow my child is burdening me”. It’s probably more like “I want to help my child whom I love but I don’t know exactly how”. Would you feel burdened by a friend who confides in you? No. And that applies to loving parents as well.   **CONCERN FOR A CHILD /=/ FEELING THAT THE CHILD IS BURDENING HER**   I’m here for you if you’d like to talk in detail. Just shoot me a PM. Things *will* get better. Look at my recent post - I was gonna freaking kill myself. I’m glad I changed my mind because the day after my dumb half-attempt was good. Sending you my loving",False,False

You are very strong, and I’m so glad that you care enough about your mum to feel this way but I’m sorry it hurts. You can get through this - please try to eat something, I know how hard it is but you and your mother will thank u down the line.  If it helps, always remember that you don’t need an enormous deficit to lose weight, and in fact it can sometimes make things worse as it leads to binges.  U have got this I’m so sorry it’s so hard",False,False
