I’m a recovered bulimic and sometimes I eat more than usual because this is what my body needs are at the moment. However, I know that these are not binges because in the past it was very different with binging and purging. Before I describe how binges were for me, I want to say that eating more than you normally would is totally normal if you are listening to your body and this is what your body currently needs.   I remember binges were like a blackout. As if your mind shuts down and then you start eating. After you “wake up” you realize how much you ate. This is followed by feelings of guilt and shame. So the difference is that during binges you do not listen to your body at all, you ignore any signs it is giving you whatsoever. The opposite is when you are mindful, you listen to your body, you realize what and how much it needs, and eat more than usual because you are just more hungry than usual at the moment. To prevent binges, I recommend eating slowly, enjoying your food, noticing flavours, making pauses, and reflecting on your hunger level and satisfaction. Hope this helps!",False,False
