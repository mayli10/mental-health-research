I‚Äôm a 6‚Äô2‚Äù girl, and I‚Äôve struggled with BED for 18 years, since I was 8 years old. So I‚Äôm big, but not a rolling sack of lard big. But I am like 260lbs (120kg, 190cm).  And I have never ever felt good about myself. When I was 16, I was under weight, even with my BED since I was pretty active and ate like a normal person for every other meals. And my biggest trigger has always been shopping for clothes. Nothing ever fits.   Its seems to me, that the ONLY people who are allowed to be either skinny or fat, are short people.   NOTHING is ever long enough no matter how large the size is! Sometimes the legs are actually shorter on the larger sized jeans. LIKE WTF???   I have so many body issues because of my height. The absolute worst are my feet. I wear a EU 43/us 12/uk 10, and 95% of brands only make womens shoes up to a 41/10/8. And the rest are tranny or granny looks.  My only other options are unisex and mens footwear.  I‚Äôm basicly just never going to be pretty, and feminine, and dainty or graceful like a flower.   And even though my BF is 1inch taller than me, he still has a lot of insecurity issues with himself, because of my height. So that sucks too..   And I often scold myself, because ‚Äúwhy couldnt I atleast have one of the *useful* ED‚Äôs like anorexia so I could at least be skinny, and not just be a big fucking whale on all accounts. I‚Äôm such a failure because I have a stupid ED that noone tales seriously. I‚Äôm just a lazy fatass‚Äù.   HaHaHahAHahA...",False,False

Why would I want to be short? 120 is underweight on me‚Äî of course it is. I'm grateful that I don't have to chase double-digits, greatfull that 1200 is a significant calorie defecit for me, grateful for the high BMR. Grateful that I can eat a bit more and still be slim, or that I'm runway height and 6'0"" in heels.  I think short people just project their own weights onto us. Literally, people are soooo shocked at 120 because they imagine 120 on their own short frames. But I'm like of course I'm 120‚Äî Duh! What am I, 5'2""? Like, if the BMI is the same why not?  I will admit, I'm more of a tape-measure-girl than a number-on-scale girl. Definitely more concerned with how clothes fit me than the force of earth's gravitational pull on me. Scales are just a bad idea overall. But like why would I ever want to look like ariana grande when i could look like bella hadid i don't understand",False,False

People are just prone to wanting what they can‚Äôt have, probably.
