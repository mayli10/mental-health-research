When I cheat, I go on (take a few) Wheat Thins \~ (10) crackers. I also cheat on coffee creamers but its not really cheating if I write it down or admit it. If my deficit + exercise is &gt; 500kcal from wherever I was at my weight gain plateau (June 21) I lose weight. 12lbs so far. At this rate I have 10 weeks more to go. I know I need to keep moving. Our dog gets me out walking a mile a day. Fitbit says 1 mile (dedicated exercise) is about \~2,000 steps or \~ 200kcal which goes into MFP bank. I try not to ""eat the bank"".",False,False
