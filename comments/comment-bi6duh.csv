But after like 2 weeks of trying to think like that and 2 weeks of looking huge and bloated &amp; seeing the scale go up it’s getting harder to stay positive.  I’m a stay at home mom to 2 toddlers so I’m always stressed. Plus I think it’s that time of the month bc the very end/ beginning of every month is always a huge struggle for me.",False,True

I know it can seem like the end of the world, but it is never too late to try and make positive changes to ones lifestyle. Just try to take small steps in a direction you want and it will become easier with time. Hiccups in self progress are okay too! It happens to us all.   Has there been anything in your life recently that might be adding additional stress? Maybe finals or something happening at work?",False,False
