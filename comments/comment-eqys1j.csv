But I will say if youâ€™ve been restricting for a long time,  binging once you start eating normally is bound to happen.  From what Iâ€™ve read itâ€™s pretty universal in eating disorders, itâ€™s a bodily instinct.  It happens to me every time.  You have to accept you will binge, but it should calm down after a week or two.  Donâ€™t get down on yourself about it. Good luckðŸ’•",False,False
