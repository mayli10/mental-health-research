Ya I was a little chubby but not by a whole lot. I hated my body. In 8th grade I went on my first diet and went from about 120 at 5 ft to 101 in in the span of maybe 3 months. I got so much praise. Most of the praise was from my mom who spoiled me with a new wardrobe from Abercrombie and Fitch. I wore a size 0.   People at school were nicer to me. When I talked about being in a diet in home economics during the cooking portion the popular girls invited me to sit with them and were genuinely nice to me. I got a date to homecoming freshman year and popular kids from other middle schools wanted to be my friend instead of telling me to kill myself.   Now I'm fat. Like really fat. Less fat than I was before but on my way up I had many breakdowns in fitting rooms bc I was un the double digits in size like I am now. The smallest I've been at my adult height was a really fit 122 and generally size 4. Men dont want to date a fat girl. Fine to fuck but not good enough to be Facebook friends let alone Facebook official. ,False,False
