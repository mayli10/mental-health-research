I’m going to try really hard not to let my mental health suffer because of this.",False,True

There’s underlying issues to what he’s masking with alcohol, and until he reaches a point in his life where he KNOWS he needs a change or that something clicks in his brain that he wants to fight against his addiction and take back his life, it’ll be very, very hard. Life is Beautiful by them is also a good song, and you might like Words as Weapons by Seether if you’re ever in an angry mood about how your mother treats things. thank you.. 😊 I’m on and off reddit fairly often, if you ever need to vent my inbox is always open! ❤️",False,False

I love that song, and I’d completely forgotten about it until now! I know that what’s healthiest for me is to not fall back into that enmeshed relationship pattern I had with them in the past, because I know that is the WORST thing for my mental health and recovery. It’s just so incredibly sad because I feel so helpless, and I need to remember that I can’t be their only support system, or the only one who cares about his recovery. Thank you for your kind words ❤️",False,True

Have you heard the song Accidents Can Happen by Sixx AM? It’s geared towards recovering from a heroin addiction, but can be used with other sorts of addictions.. the main bit that i focus on when things are hard is the chorus: “And you know that accidents can happen And it's okay, We all fall off the wagon sometimes It's not your whole life It's only one day You haven't thrown everything away.” When battling an addiction or a disorder, accidents and slip-ups often do happen.. even if it’s the last thing we rationally want to do. I used this song with others when I left from home to move over a thousand miles away to live with my (now) wife. my dad was an alcoholic that after a lot of trauma when i was a baby/toddler, quit and turned to religion and food to cope without dealing with the underlying issues. He quit trying to help his health after I left and his weight shot up, his health problems got a lot worse and all in all he quit trying while my mom was swinging back and forth between similar things.. it’s hard when you’re mentally thrown back into the same mindset that you were then because you know the coping skills that worked then, even if they were self destructive and it’s what your mind is drawn to.. it makes complete sense that it’s what you would reach out to for relief. But.. a major thing to remember is that you’ve made a lot of progress since then towards recovering your life and living, instead of just surviving or existing. One mistake doesn’t mean you’ve thrown everything you’ve worked for away, it just means that you didn’t know how to cope with the past coming up in that fierce and traumatic of a manner and reached for the thing that you know helped.. It doesn’t have to be the start of a relapse, though it really feels that way a lot of the time. In that situation it’s understandable to feel out of control, and lost. I try to remember that my parents are grown adults.. and that I’m not their therapist, addiction counselor or marriage counselor. Even if I was certified, i’d cost more than they’d be willing to pay.. and I can be there, to a point. After years of being their go-between and my mental health suffering as a result, I have to take a step back and remember that my health and being able to care for myself is important, too. my life and what i’m building is important. I can help as far as I can but if someone isn’t willing to be helped, it’ll do both me and that person no good. even if they’re someone i care dearly about. I have to process the emotions of them refusing to get help and the pain that goes with it, and eventually acceptance that I can’t make them do what I know would help and what I know that could very well add years to their life. My bottom line is, that you’re not a failure and this event doesn’t negate all the work you’ve already done bettering yourself. you can only do so much for someone.. You can guide them in the right direction, and be an ear for them to speak to, but you can’t force them move forward in their own recoveries.. it’s a choice they have to make from within. It hurts deeply, especially when you’ve been through a parallel process. When things get tough please make sure to try and take care of yourself some.. doing something (or a few things) nice for yourself, even if it seems small or difficult, can help. As someone told me recently, ‘you can’t pour from an empty glass’. it’s hard to have to take a step back when it’s family or people close to you, but sometimes it is necessary to take care of yourself. Destructive coping mechanisms can make it easier to run on empty, to do everything and take on the situations of others without time to recharge.. but eventually they’ll take their toll on your life in a multitude of ways.   please stay safe, sending good vibes your way. ❤️ i hope that you can find a spot of brightness in today, or that something good, however small, crosses your path soon. 🍀",False,False
