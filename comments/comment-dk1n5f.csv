However there is a part of eat like a child that isn’t added into it too often but I do like is to explore and experiment with food, children eat like crap if allowed to eat as they wish with no limits but when we were kids so much of our experiences with food were just exploring with different types of food. I think in some ways that kind of helped me, bc it kind of removed the judgement and was more about kind of having fun I guess.",False,False

I mean I wasn’t actually disordered until I was 12-15 but still... those thoughts and feelings have always been there for me.",False,False

I know it’s well meaning but it’s also really dumb. Kids have BIZARRO eating habits. Like I remember liking to eat chalk, and there was always a few kids who tried to eat glue/paste. Also childhood eating patterns often come from one’s parents and that’s a whole mess. I think what they’re really saying is to get back to basics or trust our bodies but like you said that’s really freaking hard to do if you’ve never seen your body prescribe to a modicum of normative eating.",False,False

When I was a child, I either didn't eat anything if I didn't like the food (and I was very picky), or I ate massive amounts if I liked it. I snacked on huge amounts of unhealthy foods all the time.  My parents were bad role models too. When I look at my two youngest siblings who are still living at home, I see that one cooks his own (vegan) food and the other subsists on cookies and school lunches. My parents have no idea how to feed children.",False,False

My therapist asked me how I’d eat as a kid so that I could “listen” to that and I was like uhhh I was constantly shamed for whatever I picked and told I was greedy, etc.   But her response was “how do you think that played into your relationship with food?” And I-  So I try and listen to the voice of a “child” me as if it ISNT suppressed or disordered and that helps a ton tbh, it’s the most progress I’ve made in treatment so far! Wishing the best for you and sending you love.",False,False
