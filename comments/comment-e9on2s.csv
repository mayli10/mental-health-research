Gaining weight especially with ed is the worst feeling, we can all understand that. Sorry you are not feeling good.. I am feeling terrible with weight gain too. You are not alone in this.",False,False

I appreciate that you can't (and probably don't want to) give the numbers, but I'm asking you to consider this: if you were at a low weight to begin with, maybe your doctor specifically chose a medication that would help you reach a healthier weight... Of course, your eating disorder hates any weight gain. But in a lot of cases with ED - it's a necessary part of recovery. In any case talk to your doctor. Talk with him/her about your concerns. Wishing you all the best.",False,False

There’s so many out there and not all will react the same! I take zoloft and it’s worked well for me but lexapro didn’t for example, and these are considered pretty similar medications. Be kind to yourself ❤️",False,False

I know it feels impossible right now but try to convince yourself that mental stability is the most important thing right now, and you can still be healthy and exercise  and practice normal portion control. There’s plenty of normal sized/thin people on psych drugs it might just be a bit harder. You have challenges but you’re not destined for obesity. Take care xo",False,False
