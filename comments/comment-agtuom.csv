These things can definitely be comorbid though, if you're having disordered thought patterns about food. Make sure that you're getting enough of what you need (I know I can sometimes get shaky/dizzy/physically weak if I haven't had the right balance of electrolytes and/or vitamins.) Maybe try taking a multivitamin if you're not already or drinking some Powerade or the like to get your electrolytes up. It might be worth checking out what people on the fasting subreddit drink to stay alert and strong during their extended fasts and implement that in your daily life.   Obesity can wreak havoc on your body's hunger signals/response, so as others have said you may have to retrain those signals by eating at certain times. Small snacks a few times a day while trying to make sure you're getting enough micro/macro nutrients should help.   Try not to push yourself too hard and listen to your body. ❤️ Best of luck.

I just deal with it the best I can as things start to get worse. I certainly wouldn't notice a change if something happened because my sleep habits are always all over the place anyway.,False,False

If you're eating only tiny amounts you may not be eating enough to maintain your weight. Of course if you're obese you probably don't want to maintain your weight, but in order to lose weight you have to eat less than you burn and as long as you're burning more than you eat you'll always feel hungry. I think a solution for you may be to only eat at set times throughout the day. If you build a routine your body's hunger hormone, ghrelin, will become regulated to the times you typically eat. The trick is that you have to stick with it. If you're constantly snacking throughout the day your body will adjust to your habits and you'll start feeling hunger pangs at the times you typically eat. If you can't go a few hours without eating you're training your body to feel hungry more frequently.   Personally I'm anorexic and also have sleep problems that cause me to be up at inconsistent hours of the day quite frequently. Together between these two problems I've sort of trained my body to never feel hungry. It's really the opposite problem that you have. My ghrelin never spikes and so I never feel the need to eat. I have to remind myself to eat all the time or else I end up with migraines and I feel very lethargic. Of course the solution for me is the same as you, but it's very hard to actually do that. If you find that you have too much trouble you may want to seek out help from somebody like a counselor or maybe even just a self-improvement service. There are certainly apps out there designed to help people get on control of their eating habits and a lot of them have options for gaining, losing, and maintaining weight so they could certainly be used to help regulate your eating. Worst case scenario if you think that this problem poses a significant risk to your health you could always check into a hospital for emergency mental health services. I'm not sure how that would work if you're obese, but I'm sure they have some kind of service to help you.",False,False

Is it mental exhaustion when you don't or physical exhaustion? Eating frequently could be normal depending on your body and your lifestyle. And if you find it to be a problem there certainly are ways to fix it if you're willing to suffer through a bit of tiredness for a little while.,False,False
