When I’m downtown in my city and I decide not to eat the snack that I’m supposed to have for my meal plan every day, I usually just give it to someone who is in need. My ED therapist wasn’t happy about me doing that during intensive treatment, but better it go to someone who needs it than in the trash, right? 🤷🏾‍♀️  But still I end up wasting other food and I feel so bad but I’m disordered AF 😞.",False,True
