I used to have thick, soft hair, and it turned PAPER thin and always felt so dry and ratty. It was really bad.  For the past 2 months I’ve been in “recovery” (pretty much just binging but I guess it’s better than restricting, and I’m getting nutrients and shit). It’s definitely not at all where it used to be, but imo it’s better than it was 2 months ago. A lot thicker and somewhat softer. I think if I keep it up I can get it back to where it used to be.  Generally though, I’ve heard that it can take anywhere from 3-6 months, maybe more? Your hair kinda lags behind everything else. It’s the last to go and the last to come back.",False,False
