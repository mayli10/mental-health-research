(anyone else here dating someone way out of their league? what are your experiences?)",False,False

I noticed the popular girls were all the thinnest girls in their grades, save some very rare exceptions, and they did turn against eachother if one put on weight.",False,False

No wonder i was bullied to fuck. Yes, most of the popular girls were thin and conventionally attractive and safely mainstream...but not all the fat girls were bullied. I do remember popular girls getting into dieting and healthy eating as a social thing, they were a bunch of stepford wives in training really. Size was definitely an issue though. We used to measure ourselves in strange ways, if you could fit between a certain cupboard you were ok. Or if you could walk across the gym without making loud footsteps.",False,False

But my high school wasnt too bad you were popular if you knew the right people and did the right extracurriculars. The popular people had trendy outfits and nice hair but they were also of all sizes, if i had to guess visually (sorry) most were healthy weight skinny with some being borderline overweight noticeably OW. I never really felt much pressure to be losing weight from the social environment honestly.",False,False

I pretty much did sports and did drugs and was in drama and that’s what I was known for. I also mostly hung out with the ~Emo kids~ so that too, I guess. I think maybe 2% of my school actually knew my name. I kind of ghosted through it, tbh.",False,False

Basically a squad consiting of queers who did drugs and made art. I wasnt a looser in high school but I wasn't a popular guy either. I never noticed what the popular kids eat or anything like that. Not all of them were skinny, their was certainly  some weight variety. But none of them were fat or overweight that's for sure. I miss the relationship I had with food in high school. I truly did not give a fuck. I ate what I wanted when I wanted cause I wanted. Counted no calories. My eating disorder developed in college. Sure I was heavier , I'm 5""6 and in hs I was around 120 maybe 125 I cant rember exactly. Now I'm around 110 but I sweat at the sight of a pb and j so I think high school me was the real winner here lmao. On the idea that popular kids were more likely to have eating disorders, I disagree. Almost all my friends have dealth with some form of disordered eating. But then again I do think that the correlation between The Gays tm and eating disorders is strong.",False,False
