The weight classes here aren’t huge (10-20lbs) so usually there isn’t a huge difference",False,False

My next class down puts me at bmi 19. Hard to hit while keeping some muscle, but man, I’m making it happen. At least it covers up my obsession with weight and clean eating.",False,False

There a way you could go back into weightlifting but not have it be so official? Or is it the community that you're really drawn to, because in that case maybe you could just be a spectator/supporter while having weightlifting be something you do in your free time?",False,False
