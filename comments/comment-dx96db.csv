It certainly is important to be selfish, but in ways that don't hurt yourself or other people. Starving ourselves is a selfish behavior that hurts us and people we care about. It's okay to see ourselves in a bad light, that's how we can change. If we see ourselves as the heroes of our own stories, what's motivating us to become better people? I don't think anyone should hate themselves, that doesn't solve anything and is just a manifestation of our depression. Self-hatred is another mindset that hurts us and other people. But knowing you've made some big mistakes that really effected your life, that's a good thing. That's the first step to becoming a better version of yourself. I know this isn't the accepted narrative on most of the internet, but I've been ""recovered"" for over a month now and this way of thinking has helped me take much better care of myself, for the sake of my friends and family.",False,False

All the feel good ""you can never do any wrong"" just made me justify my issues. It can obviously go too far into self-hatred, but having a good balance of self-awareness AND self-care is a real way to bust out of this mindset. Just remember it's okay to be a little selfish in the right ways, at the right time. But starving yourself to make people worry is never the right way. It's a big step for you to realize this, it's honestly huge. The point you're at right now can lead you in so many different directions, you've made an important discovery about yourself, and now you have the choice to change or to rationalize your behavior. It's easier to rationalize, I do it all the time, but it's healthier and an all around better decision to change. That's the hard path, though, so good luck.",False,False

We all tend to excuse a lot of actions caused by EDs because we don't want us or anyone to feel bad about their mental illness but in the end it's still us doing all this stuff even if we're manipulated by an disordered mind. I feel like being honest is the only way to bring some clarity tho. So thank you sm!,False,True

If not, you now know thatâ€™s not my intention. The bad things with this disorder isnâ€™t wanting attention from loved ones, or even being selfish, we all need that and some people are seriously lacking in that aspect in this day and age &amp; thatâ€™s part of what draws them in to these behaviours, well I can only speak for myself. As I said to the person, itâ€™s good to find another coping mechanism like reaching out and actually talk to your friends and family when youâ€™re low and about your thoughts, to give them a chance to listen and acknowledge them. I guess we just have quite different approaches in trying to help.",False,False

Right now you're in the regret phase things, that's good. I don't know if this is true but it is for me, when I feel bad about things I've done that's the only way I can change. It's okay to see yourself that way, it's constructive, as long as you don't use the regret as a source to keep harming yourself as you have been. I was scaring the shit out of my friend who knew I was starving myself. I felt like an asshole that I wasnt even trying to recover, even though I love her and she knew there was nothing she could do to help me. Open up to someone you trust not to spread gossip, tell them not to tell anyone else, and I promise you that their disappointment in your behavior will shame you into recovering. This sounds bad, but that's just because it sucks to go through. Nobody likes seeing themselves in a bad way, but we can all agree there are bad people in the world, and sometimes it turns out those people were us all along. You're not a bad person, though, and I know this because you want to change. You recognized how selfish this disorder is, so change. For their sake, for your sake, literally everyone wins when you recover. Good luck, and I'm sorry for being an asshole here.",False,False

That's what helped me recover, because it definitely IS selfish. There's nothing wrong with realizing something bad about your personality, it's what you do with it.",False,False
