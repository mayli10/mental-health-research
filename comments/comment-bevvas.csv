The ED will convince you that everything is your fault and you are worthless so you might as well starve yourself to death (at least, that is what mine said to me for years).  However, it does sound like you are edging closer toward considering recovery. I think many of us how to have the realization that the ED has taken over our lives and is ruining everything. You might want to consider visiting the r/fuckeatingdisorders subbreddit, and maybe explore the famine response theory of EDs that Tabitha Farrar talks a lot about in her work.",False,False

I like to remind myself that if I'd truly done it to myself, I could remove it just as easily.  You might have failed to *prevent* or recognise disordered symptoms developing, but hey, no one who's not disordered is really on the lookout for that shit. Maybe if someone with depression had ensured they didn't isolate themselves, had forced themselves to continue their hobbies, had contacted a therapist the day they felt numb or sad, their depression wouldn't have properly formed or been much less severe. But nobody expects depression. Plus, symptoms that we can recognise generally happen when it already has a grip on us.  I mean, I can look back and see that while there was a point where I could eat a cheese sandwich, I was weighing every ingredient out to get the final calorie estimate and feeling anxious at the idea of being unable to. I wasn't on a diet. I wasn't overweight, nor had I ever been. Regardless of being able to consume the calories and the cheese (and bread, butter &amp; chutney lol), I was exhibiting disordered behaviour. Maybe it didn't have enough of a hold on me and I'd have been able to stop right there, if I knew. But how could I have known?  Pair that with the research that EDs have lots of genetic factors along with environmental and I don't think anyone can blame themselves. I don't expect this to change your thoughts, I still blame myself. I walked into some of this fully and entirely aware of what I was doing, but there's a reason normal people don't do that. You would not have 'chosen' any of these things if there wasn't something wrong with you in the first place.",False,False
