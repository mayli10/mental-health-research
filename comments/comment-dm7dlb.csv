But yeah that's kind of why I'm frustrated with the keto craze. Like when i come on here i expect some level of people having fear foods, most of us even acknowledge that they are irrational fears, but now it's the general population falling into basically an ed habit. Like ads online trying to make me fear carbs, coworkers talking about how they are going to lose so much weight now that they cut carbs, products everywhere broadcasting that they are low carb. The thing about all of those ads, people, and products is that they are trying to sell you this idea for their own benefit. They don't care about your health or comfort around food. It's fucked because it reminds me of the cringy ""pro-ana coaches"" from tumblr but everywhere. I'm really scared to eat out or tell ""normal"" people what I eat anymore. However, it is weirdly reassuring to see people on here even recognizing how disordered the keto craze actually is. I really am rooting for you and even though it is hard to get out of that mindset you are so strong for realizing you need to change how you see carbs. The brown rice was a great achievement and shows you can do it",False,True

I think in the short term, keto works for a lot of obese/significantly overweight people because many people find fats and proteins to be extremely sating. So that can kinda inherently help with portion control, often making it a little bit easier to take in less overall.   It also cuts out added sugar by default, and some people find that to be helpful with reducing cravings. At the end of the day though, weight still boils down to CICO!!!

Like you don't have a magic fat digesting gene. But you have a different view on what makes you feel fuller. Half of any diet is placebo until something really bad happens that your body just can't ignore.,False,True

It still is disappointing that people don't realize how overeating is the actual issue and prefer to demonize an essential macronutrient.,False,True
