For me personally I get to a goal weight and then realize that your weight can fluctuate by 5 pounds in a day so I lose 5 more. Then I think about how recovery causes an initial weight gain and I decide to lose 10 more before working up to maintenance.  The truth is no number will ever be low enough. Thatâ€™s just the nature of this illness. Sending you strength and love.,False,False
