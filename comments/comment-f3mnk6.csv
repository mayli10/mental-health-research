I feel the same way it’s so ingrained I don’t know any other way. I grew up with this so to speak. It’s the only constant in my life I just can’t let it go. Such a terrible way to live.,False,True

I thought it would just go away on its own but it didn’t. I can’t afford treatment and I’m so ingrained in the habits that I can’t stop. I’ve forgotten how to eat normally and I basically go to work, exercise, sleep and eat. That’s all my life consists of. It’s sad but I don’t think I can get better at this point.",False,False
