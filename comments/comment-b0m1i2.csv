I've never specifically told my husband of 6 years. I don't hide my behavior either. He's just very ignorant on the topic of nutrition and eating disorders especially. I think the exposure to my BS has messed up his perspective on what's normal. I have dropped dozens of hints over the years but he's still oblivious. I feel like if no one asks if I'm okay than I must be okay. Like it's not real without someone else acknowledging it. So as much as I want His support sometimes I can't bring myself to have that conversation. I feel really guilty when I'm underweight because I feel like I'm lying about my healthy lifestyle and it motivates me to reach for some balance and make better choices.,False,False

The issue is a lot of the times, at least for me, telling yourself “you just need to lose a few more pounds” doesn’t really end, it just keeps going. It sounds like he cares about your well-being, and while it may be scary, I think it should be good to tell him and have someone else hold you accountable. It can be frustrating at times, but in the end it’s good to have someone aware and helping you. Telling your significant other can be REALLY scary, like when I told my boyfriend he really didn’t understand eating disorders, and even at one point said “weren’t you just being really healthy?”, but after explaining to him the severity of eating disorders, he’s now my #1 supporter. It’s good to remember that he’s with you for a reason and you are 100% deserving of his love. Be patient and I hope it works out! Good luck ❤️",False,False
