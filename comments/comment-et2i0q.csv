It's literally medical history.  Share it or don't, though sharing hard copies of your medical records would probably be viewed as strange to almost anyone.  There isn't a calorie per day or a ""woe as me"" requirement.  If it's affecting your life negatively it's most likely real, and if it's not than you probably wouldn't be posting here...unless you are attention seeking I guess, which STILL would make it real in some sense.  So yeah, you're fine to be here.",False,False

The fact that you’re worried or not that you’re faking it, like you can’t tell, is a sign of a problem. Eating disorders are based on hyper fixation and obsession over weight and routine. You aren’t faking. And I think any parent stopping you from learning more about your mental health is absolutely old-fashioned and not understanding whatsoever. They were raised in a time where it “didn’t exist”. Don’t feel like you have to meet a standard to be “ana” or to be “mentally ill”.",False,False
