I'm sorry your mother caused you so much grief.  &amp;#x200B;  My mother was an emotional manipulator. She was a wonderful woman though and she didn't suffer from any ED or other mental illness. My observations of other parents born in the 50s, 60's and 70's (warning, generalization up ahead)  is that a majority were born into large families of young parents who had no parenting skills. Many of our parents did not know what love looked like from a parent. A parent used punishment quite liberally back then. 'Children were to be seen and not heard'. Manipulating emotions is what got them attention when they needed it. They also probably grew up in an environment where women were second class citizens in the home and in the community, and saw their mothers lay on the drama or manipulate a situation to get what they needed just to run a home. I think ED or not, your mother probably would have been manipulative with whatever she had at her disposal. Not because she was an asshole, but because many were raised that way: in the absence of any rights, children and women resorted to  manipulating situations to get their needs met. Guilt, shame, the silent treatment, never being given any praise...you name it. My mother's methods baffled me when I was younger because I felt more emotionally mature than her.  &amp;#x200B;  The ED thing is not really the root of what I want to keep from my daughter as much as it is the feelings of shame and guilt i bestow upon myself. My mom ignored me when I was hurting so I could toughen up. In the absence of a support system I used food to sooth myself, then I used restriction to punish my indulgences.  &amp;#x200B;  More than anything I just want to be there for her and teach her what emotional maturity looks like because the root of all our problems is the lack of emotional maturity displayed in our childhoods and in our adult relationships (that could take all kinds of formats - even sexual abuse is a lack of emotional maturity from the abuser).  &amp;#x200B;  This is also testament of how invasive our food relationships can be in our heads - I consider myself a pretty emotionally mature person with a sense of responsibility and authority in my life, and these things only get stronger and better with time - but I only 'manage' my ED.
