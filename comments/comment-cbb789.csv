My brother used to make the worst noises constantly and it made my entire family mad... Until my mom realized the 2% milk was making him congested permanently and the opening his mouth randomly while eating was an unconscious reaction to not getting enough oxygen nasally! He switched to skim milk and I stopped wanting to murder him (as much),False,False

I have a co-worker who does this and it's so disgusting. Even thinking about it now makes me shudder. But I only have to see her once a week - I'm sorry you have to deal with it every day! I agree with another post saying to puke on him or dry heave haha,False,False

Thankfully my husband hates it as much as I do. Talk to him. And if that doesn't work, get a **very tiny bit** childish and start dry heaving when he does it. Explain that literally hearing him chew eoth less skill than a toddler is going to make you puke. ....... Maybe word it better than that, haha.",False,False

Even my 3 year old understands 'chew with your mouth closed'. Shouldn't be hard for a grown person to understand. I personally vote you puke on him. Just beacaue, ew.

It‚Äôs a major shift for them and I‚Äôm apparently severely disrupting their disconnected eat style. üôÑ   I have talked to my boyfriend and my brother about this, I gave up when I got to my mom and step dad. Being around people who are eating is a maddening experience for me. Sometimes, I fake a phone call or take the dog out for a walk to avoid them, or just leave the room for a while. Whatever is possible at the time.  It‚Äôs not easy.  In my experience, noisy eaters enjoy further distraction while eating, so they like company and I can‚Äôt always get away at restaurants.",False,False
