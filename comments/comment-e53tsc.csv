When I reached a bmi of 18, people would mention about how much weight I lost, how big my jeans were for me etc. Nothing too extreme though, they wouldn‚Äôt hound me to gain weight or anything.  Now at a bmi of low 16, my family are always saying ‚Äúyou‚Äôre so skinny!‚Äù, ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no fat on you, you‚Äôre a stick‚Äù, ‚Äúyou‚Äôre very underweight, I can‚Äôt believe how light you are‚Äù, ‚Äúyou‚Äôre too skinny, even if you gained 10lbs it wouldn‚Äôt even make a difference.‚Äù And in general their comments feel like they carry an aura of worry to them and (maybe this is just my ed fucked brain) lowkey jealousy? Either way people tend to be more careful with me now, the things they say and the way they look at me, like I‚Äôm fragile or something. Always with concern. When I was a higher bmi, they didn‚Äôt care.",False,False

When I was BMI 18.5 I was basically treated like a ‚Äúhot person‚Äù. Which might sound crazy. But before that, I was basically ignored, and suddenly people were crazy about me. NO, I wasn‚Äôt just more confident- I was just as shy and had low self esteem just like before. I had men asking me out/for my number multiple times a week, which had never happened. Girls noticed me too, which I had always struggled with. Strangers stopped me to tell me I was beautiful. It was like living in a movie, and I was the hot girl, not the awkward best friend of the protagonist.   But since I‚Äôve gained weight all the compliments stopped and guys don‚Äôt ask me out anymore. I look virtually the same except for the +2 BMI point weight gain. It KILLS me. My self esteem is at an all time low after realizing what I had, and how all i need to do to have attention again is lose the weight. It‚Äôs depressing.",False,False
