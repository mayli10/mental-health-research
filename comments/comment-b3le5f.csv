If I’m being honest, there’s no way in hell I’m eating completely intuitively, especially with my f’d up hunger cues, but I’m trying to make it work.  And I totally feel you on the maintenance thing. I’ve tried every “daily caloric needs” calculator there is, and  they range anywhere from 1,300-1,900 calories. Literally no idea what to trust lmao.   It’s confusing as hell as to how people just... eat normally.",False,False

I don't know how to eat at maintenance or eat at a healthy caloric deficit. I starve or I overeat. It's been four years since I've done otherwise...It's overwhelming figuring out how to intuitively eat.,False,True

Binged for about 3-4 weeks, *everyday*, probably over 4,000-5,000 per day.  Here was my thought process: I could restrict again. I could hopefully make up for this shitty-ass binge month. However, every time I restrict, it inevitably ends in another binge. It doesn’t matter how “dedicated” I think I am. For 4 months I’ve been stuck in this ridiculous cycle, and I knew it was only going to get worse.  I stopped restricting a few days ago (directly after that binge). I’ve been eating when I’m hungry &amp; allowing myself “treats”. It’s only been a few days, but I haven’t binged since. That’s a record for me — normally I’d binge about every 2 days. So far, this is working for me.   It’s difficult as fuck, especially with the amount of weight I gained during the binging. It’s so fucking hard. But in the grand scheme of things, 8 pounds isn’t so bad. It should be off in no time. Restricting will lead to another binge; it doesn’t matter how hard you try to resist it.   My best advice is to end it. Don’t restrict, no matter how tempting it is. Whatever happens, I wish you the best of luck. This shit sucks. :(",False,False

Thankfully I mostly maintained, but 2 months ago I went abroad and gained 10lbs which put me at 18lbs above my lowest weight.  I'm now the biggest I've been since 2016.  Only this week have been able to seriously restrict calories. The journey hasn't been the easiest. The internal conflict has been the worst. But I hope in the end it'll be worth it.  The only advice I can give is find something that's seriously worth it. Once you find your motivation, you're set. And don't push yourself too hard. Pushing yourself too hard can be counter productive.",False,False
