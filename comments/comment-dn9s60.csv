C/S is really satisfying - I even do it with mints and gum - but it damn does it take up a lot of time and thought.   It's good to notice these things happening, means you're one step ahead. I've been trying to just have a small bit and to really enjoy the taste before swallowing. It takes AGES to eat a small bit of something but it's better than the weird growing disgust in myself at spitting up in to tissue and then the inevitable hiding the evidence.   Hang on on there! Recovery is worth it.",False,False
