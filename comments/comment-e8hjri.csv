I don't know you but honestly the suffering of an ED and never feeling sick enough yo recover is some of the worst mental turmoil, not something I wish on anyone or anyone deserves.   go ahead, recover! don't let your life be controlled by food and fear, because it sucks that way.

Measures such as that are general guidelines and dont take into account variables and your personal circumstances. I'd lost 15 lbs before I realized what was going on and might not have been considered ""thin enough"" to be labelled as anorexic (for example), but other signs and symptoms were pointing to an eating disorder. In consolation, ED doesnt care about what size or weight you are. Treat yourself towards recovery. Try reading ""Life without ED"" if you need a place to start. Hope that helps :)",False,False
