I used to eat at every whim just because I thought I was hungry in like winter break, but now I'm more on track with not eating 2,000 calories in fruits as I played the Sims on the couch all day as a 4 ft 9 person who doesn't ever burn that much in a day.  Sorry if that doesn't help.",False,False

Also I’ve mentioned this elsewhere but I find it REALLY satisfying in a host of different ways to tip some flaky sea salt out into my hand and nibble on that. Great for flavour, texture, crunch, and that “mouth stimulation” feeling you mentioned. Plus it makes you feel like you actually ate, it combats hunger to a certain degree. ",False,False
