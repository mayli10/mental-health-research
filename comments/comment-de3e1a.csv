But i also think that is a slippery slope and for my experience is not a sustainble habit even if done rearly. I never intended do become bulimic, i thought i could do it only sometimes but it didnt go like that.  so i think that you shouldn't underestimate it and go talk with an expert, maybe you are totally okay, but it's better to be safe i think",False,False
