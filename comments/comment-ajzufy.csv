Like, I get state funded psychotherapy for my depression (when I got my ED 10 years ago it made me depressed, and it took 10 years to get proper therapy for that. Still No therapy for my ED). And some month back when I finally dared to bring up ED stuff with my therapist (I've been relapsing this autumn), her response was sort of ""oh I recommend this book""... And the GP I talked to literally said that I really shouldn't lose more weight, because I am currently at the Very end of normal. Like.... I fucking know that. Why does those numbers make me seem less sick to you, medical expert? :( So now I am restricting bad so she might notice the weightloss when I see her again. . . TW: suicide attempt . . When it came to My depression, I had to go through a suicide attempt to be taken seriously. I am afraid the same thing will happen with my ED. Except I doubt I have the willpower to get that Skinny..

I made an appointment with My GP for next week for this reason AND at an ED clinic same week another Day, and it has motivated me to lose like never before... Like, I NEED them to see that I have a problem, and it feels like I NEED to be skinnier for them to see that. IF I am not, they Will brush it off.   I'd Love to Keep thia discussion Up, btw, cause I NEED validation too. Fucking terrified, event though the GP is Good and the One doctor who so far has shown concern regarding this.",False,False
