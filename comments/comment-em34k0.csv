I'm on 3k calories a day trying to get back to a healthy BMI but stuck at 17 because I workout a lot, walk everywhere and just generally move around constantly.

I was dipping below a BMI of 15 and passing out at home before I realized I would have to change something if I actually didn't want to die.

It made me look at food differently. Instead of thinking what foods I *shouldnâ€™t* eat, I started thinking of what foods I *should*. It can easily become a cover story and allow people to restrict more, but I feel itâ€™s helped me tremendously with food fears and made me actually enjoy food. Itâ€™s still a tough journey, but I feel itâ€™s been good on me :)",False,False

It has high abuse potential, in that itâ€™s a great excuse to not eat in public, but Iâ€™m impressed at how non-triggering itâ€™s been. When I started, I was afraid I was having to choose my ethics over not being triggered, but itâ€™s actually worked out well. Itâ€™s made me feel more positive about food in general, partly because some of my external guilt about food has been removed (in terms of carbon, exploitation, etc).   (For anyone reading, I still recommend caution before going vegan if you have an ED. Please examine your motivations carefully. Veganism can easily become a cover story or tool of enablement. But it also does piss me off when itâ€™s said that people with EDs just shouldnâ€™t/canâ€™t be vegan.)",False,False

I find that now think in terms of macros and will rarely pick up something that has no/bad nutritional value. I donâ€™t get the feeling of not being full if I know itâ€™s not nutrient dense, but if I ate a carby meal the day before, Iâ€™ll consciously eat a more protein heavy one the next day!
