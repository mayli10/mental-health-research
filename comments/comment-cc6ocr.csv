There may be ways to make yourself comfortable though. Have you tried wearing your crop top with something high-waisted? You could show just a little bit of your midsection without showing off your whole belly. It might make you more comfortable. Another thing you could do is layer something light over top that you can zip or button up if you feel too uncomfortable.,False,False

Like I still feel fucking ugly but it's freeing to at least put on a facade of being confident in the way I look. I would say try wearing it at home for a bit, see how you feel, and if you end up liking the way it makes you feel wear it to the fair!! If you don't that's okay too, find something comfortable that makes you feel good and wear that instead.  And ik this isn't that helpful when you have an ED but I honestly think that all body types can pull of a crop top + high waisted pants. Like I see a skinny girl in that outfit? Here for it. Heavier girl in that outfit? What a hottie I'm in love. Wishing you all the best, have fun at the fair!! ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è",False,False

Wear something comfortable that makes you feel safe :),False,False
