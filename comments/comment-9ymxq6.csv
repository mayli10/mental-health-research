I estimate that no matter what I do if I even lick the refuse off the spoon it's at least 100 Calories. But it's the most beautiful thing I've ever made and I just fucking wish I had the calorie allotment for it but I don't...... And I can't unless a slice is the ONLY thing I eat. SIGH maybe Sunday after work. ,False,False

Everytime I bake it's a constant struggle of ""just lick the spoon! there's a glob on the edge of the bowl, eat it! you can't count how many calories are in one lick so you don't have to log it!"" I'm gonna tape my mouth shut today while I'm baking stg",False,False

Sometimes I’ll avoid cooking anything that requires assembly because by the time I break down and cook something I’m always so starving! If I could just stop shoving food into my mouth while I cook the game would be changed. ,False,True

I only bake when I’ve barely eaten that day bc I know I’m going to consume a psychotic amount of batter/ dough. I’m not even that worried about how many cookies/ brownies/ Slices of pie or cake I’ll eat after it’s cooked. I can control myself then. But the raw batter/ dough is a whole different story for me,False,False
