Someone took a photo of me and I looked so awfully fat in it because of my pants, way bigger than what I actually am.   I just got size 8s in the same brand and I really, really hated myself since my ultimate goal is size 4 (daunting as a pear shape, lol). But I was happy that at least the size 8s were kind of comfortably loose on me. Honestly you look way better in more form-fitting clothes, even if the size personally disappoints you. It’s a mindfuck for sure, though. ",False,False

It helps to have a general concept of what your aesthetic style is, what colors you wear, and what shapes you feel comfortable in. Goodwill is solid because they’re generally very organized, easy to peruse, and the organization itself does a ton of good. Their downside is that the flat rate pricing by item type makes it marginally more difficult to find crazy good deals. Pay attention to their sale calendars and you’ll make out like a bandit. It’s the kind of place I’d go to on a day I don’t have a ton of time to waste. Salvation Army as an organization, I really don’t care for. They pour a ton of money into anti-LGBTQ efforts and treat their employees rather poorly. They’re also far less organized. But, their pricing is often more arbitrary which can be really good as a buyer. They will up charge for mid level brands that are popular while simultaneously pricing super high end items low because they don’t know what they are. The sales can be pretty solid too. But if you can’t narrow down what you’re looking for before you head, it’s easy to get super overwhelmed and frustrated. Value World is probably my least favorite. They’re always huge, dirty, and insanely disorganized. Your bang for your buck is almost never worth the time you’ll spend there trying to find it. I only go to watch for shoes or when I know I’m looking for one specific thing (like black slacks for example). Their pricing however tends to be amazing, which can offset the nightmare it is to shop there *if* you find something good. Smaller, local charity thrift stores are always worth checking out. Many of them tend to spend their proceeds on good causes, like supporting victims of domestic violence. They’re almost always on the smaller end and price their items very fairly. And, because they are small, they make for a quick trip. You might leave empty handed, but you won’t have wasted a ton of your time. Here in Michigan, Grace Centers of Hope is a fantastic example. Avoid curated, higher end thrift stores. You can generally pick them out because they’ll call themselves “consignment” stores rather than thrift stores. The upcharge just isn’t worth it. You can  worth find far better deals on higher end items at less fancy places. Plato’s Closet is super helpful when you have a super precise idea of what you want *and* that item is “trendier”, because they only sell things that are a few seasons old. The prices are higher than other resale stores, but the convenience is so worth it. They sort by type and size, are clean and efficient. And as an extra bonus, you can generally *sell* them your unwanted items rather than donating.   A few other tips:  1- Try everything on if possible!!! I can’t tell you how many times I’ve bought something that I thought was amazing only to never wear it because it fit funny. It’s an annoying chore that feels burdensome, but you’ll save yourself disappointment in the long run. 2- Pertaining to number one, wear something either easy to slip in and out of like a simple dress or even better, something super form fitting like leggings and a tank that you can try things on over in case there aren’t dressing rooms. 3- If you’re on the fence about an item, just know it’s *super* unlikely it will be there if you go back. Personally, if the piece is priced on the high end and I’m not totally in love with it I generally leave it behind, *unless* it’s, like, a designer item in which case I’ll just buy because when else will you get it at that price and if I don’t like it I can give it to someone who will. If the item is super cheap, I just buy it. It’s worth the risk if I’m on the fence but it’s only $2 and I know it won’t be there when I get back. 4– You don’t have to look at every single item. Skip colors or pieces you don’t like or don’t need. When browsing the stuff that’s relevant to you, flip through quickly and casually. You will absolutely be able to *feel* when something has enough “weight” to it to know it’s quality. Then check the size. It’ll either work for you or it won’t. Most times it won’t. Don’t be discouraged. The day you find some perfect designer item and snag it for $4, all the lost ones will be so worth it. 5- Similar to #4, when looking through patterns, only focus on the ones that appeal to you. Don’t waste your time evaluating every single item. You don’t need to. 80% of what’s in there isn’t going to appeal to you anyway.   I *love* thrifting. Honestly if you have any other questions or anything please don’t hesitate to reach out. I could go on for hours so I’ll stop here. But seriously, I can’t encourage people enough to try it. It’s better for your wallet. It’s better for humanity. It’s better for the planet. *And* you can write your own off donations as tax deductible. Once you sort out a system that works for you, it’ll get so easy and the payoff is so great. :)",False,False

But I realized that how clothes looked on my body as a result of fit was actually a huge determining factor in my self isolation. There were just far too many times to count that I would get excited to go somewhere, start trying to get ready, end up crying in a pile of clothes on my floor, and then rushing at the last minute to throw something, *anything*, together that was marginally presentable before leaving the house absolutely loathing the way I looked. I’d ultimately end up binge drinking to compensate for the insecurity and then hating myself even more the next day.  So now I thrift. I can’t mentally justify the prices for new clothes when I know I don’t want to stay at a current weight. But thrifting allows me to find things that fit and that I don’t hate myself in without feeling guilty about the expenditure. When something no longer hangs the way I want it to or I find myself avoiding an item because I don’t “look right” in it, I re-donate it. It feels sustainable, both economically and socially (for those bothered by the impact of fast fashion) and it helps me not hole up in my house to avoid the self-loathing and pain that had come to define venturing out into the world. I still might be dissatisfied with the way my body looks, but at least I feel like I can present myself in way that doesn’t cause utterly crippled with anxiety.",False,False
