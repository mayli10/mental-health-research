Most bulimics and myself don’t really see it as a waste of food.  We get to enjoy eating just like anyone else would the only difference is that we don’t get the calories from it. We eat for taste so it’s not really a waste. We don’t want the calories anyway if that makes sense,False,False

Generally speaking, you have to have been in the shit yourself to understand.   Also, the whole anti self-diagnosis thing is irritating as hell, especially given the current state of healthcare in the U.S. in particular. Lots of people are either uninsured, or can't afford their copays. Also, there are real reasons to not want certain conditions on your medical records...and what does it even matter if you're not actually seeking treatment? Like, great, now your patient profile is, ""anorexic, but too crazy to care,"" which has zero upsides in a medical setting.",False,False

My boyfriend was talking with my friend about my bulimia and they were annoyed with me because it was a waste of good food/money. They just do not and can not get it. Like I told my boyfriend about wanting to be super skinny and he’s like no it’s ok to be thick that’s hot. Ummm not what you say to someone with an ED  And yesss. You don’t need to be formally diagnosed with an ED to have it. Like I’ve been throwing up daily for 6 years but have never seen a doctor. Does that mean I’m not bulimic Bc It’s not on my medical records?,False,False
