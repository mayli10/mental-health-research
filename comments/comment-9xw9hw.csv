It can absolutely be done, but in order to make sure that you do it for the right reasons and not to make restricting easier/more socially acceptable within the guise of veganism. You need permission to eat everything you normally would when you were healthy whilst recovering, imo, to make sure you don't swap one disordered behaviour for another. If you do decide to try and recover, feel free to pm me! Otherwise as well. ED's can be so lonely and recovery, forced or voluntary, so very scary. ",False,False

And then I had my moment of clarity and I was like yeaaahhhh this is not good. But I don‚Äôt want to stop? That‚Äôs the thing. The thought of eating more than I burn off terrifies me. The thought of being fat again terrifies me. Ugh Ed‚Äôs are really the worst.   Thank you so much for your comment and I honestly hope your doing well xxx üíñ,False,True

Idk I will definitely think about it though! ,False,True

I'm somehow always telling myself I'm a fake but then I'll have moments of clarity where I fully accept how sick I am and cry. But then I somehow manage to trick myself into thinking I'm a fake again, and I know that's just my inner ED voice trying to hide itself from danger but it's very persuasive.  I'm sorry you're going through this and I hope the first steps to recovery go well. ",False,False
