She's on a diet, ice cream is tempting, but then she stopped herself from eating it at the last moment. I think it's bad to waste food like that, but whatever. Or maybe she tried it and hated the taste.",False,False

There‚Äôs been times that I‚Äôve made pretty healthy food, took a picture, ate a few bites and then tossed it. Yeah it‚Äôs wasteful but I mean that‚Äôs not uncommon. ",False,False

Maybe she had a bite. but why would any person HAVE to eat the whole thing??? that seems more disordered to me.  like the old ""either the trash can is the trash, or my body is the trash."" why is it anyone's business is someone decides to not eat something after got it? it's just junk food too. (at this point) it's better healthwise to not eat it at that point.  &amp;#x200B;",False,False

She essentially threw away a free, biodegradable prop from a photoshoot, it's not really that weird?  Also I read the comment that was like ""she's not even skinny, why didn't she just eat it?"" and just wanted to throw my whole phone away JFC",False,False

But it's also something a generally thin person who wants a picture with ice cream but doesn't necessarily want to eat it right now would do.   I think it's possible she has an ED but it's also possible she was staging just like she would do with clothing she doesn't want to buy or a table spread of things she doesn't necessarily use. People will go to much further lengths than she did for the 'gram.,False,False

Although, disordered eating is a spectrum and the data (from my secret longtitudinal study lol) has also shown that a large proportion of people actually fall on it.
