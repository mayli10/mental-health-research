BPD is often found in people with EDs as well which is a really interesting (and crazy) correlation, i'd encourage anyone here to check it out",False,False

For example I cook a dish and I know that I could eat it tomorrow as well but then something in my brain clicks so I have to eat everything which leads to my stomach being painfully full and then I purge.  Also it often leads me into doing nothing :/,False,False

My therapist calls it black and white but it’s definitely all or nothing. If I don’t think I can do something perfectly I won’t do it at all. Leads to a lot of paralysis too.,False,False

Borderline people tend to see life in black or white. all good or all bad. so similar to all ir nothing.,False,False

I have elements of all or nothing but most my ed is driven by paralyzing indecisiveness and restricting. I was like 10% bulimic and  90% ana in high school,False,False

I can't keep fucking sandwich ingredients in the house because I will continue to eat sandwiches, two at a time, until I run out of one of the ingredients. When I started restricting I wouldn't buy more than two days worth of groceries at a time, and if it wasn't something that had to be in the fridge/freezer I kept in the car so I would have to walk outside and go get them if I wanted to binge. I think it's been getting better though, I've been able to buy multi-packs of frozen things I used to binge on and eat them one/two at a time so they last *weeks*. Still too terrified to test it with sandwich stuff though.",False,False

I struggle with all or nothing thinking all. the. time. It's in every aspect of my life, not just with food. But food was where I first became aware of it. I struggle with bulimia with restricting on top of it. So because I was restricting, afraid of, just to give one example, anything sugary, those types of foods would be my binge foods. My mind would say ""just eat it all so you can get rid of it from your house because it's ""bad"" or ""unhealthy"" food , then I'd purge, feel bad because I wasn't someone who ate normally, then restrict, repeat.  So I know exactly what you mean. I am still working through having fear foods at home because I'm afraid I will just eat it all. Unfortunately, the way to work through this is to have those foods in your home. Look up [food habituation](https://www.verywellmind.com/food-variety-in-eating-disorder-recovery-4159544) if you're curious. It sucks, it's incredibly scary, but it works.",False,False

Before that I was like that with food, school, my emotions etc. It's what made recovery (or my almost recovery) so difficult. I could do no food or all the food and nothing in between. It was hard dealing with people, because if I got angry I'd either say nothing or I'd be a total bitch about it. It was shitty with school because I'd either put all my time into it and get straight As or I'd be skipping every day and fail or nearly fail.
