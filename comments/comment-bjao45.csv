I’m struggling with disordered thoughts and getting treatment but most days I’m still eating pretty dang close to maintenance and I’m in the mid range for BMI. I could lose more and I have restrictive thoughts 24/7 but I just can’t get myself to eat that little anymore (used to eat 1200). Now I eat 1800-2200 and lose or maintain. I’ve been trying not to binge because that’s my new found ailment. But I feel like such a fraud because not only do I eat, I eat so much more than everyone else. I just have to keep reminding myself I’m super active and my body needs more than people who sit all day.",False,False

I can go 1, maybe two days beneath 1000 before I eat between 1400 and 4000. It varies. If I'm not b/ping, I'm working out for hours to get muscular but not eating enough to actually gain muscle.   These are still disordered behaviors. I think we tend to think that we are ""fake"" because we dont exhibit typical AN symptoms at all times. You are still valid",False,False

Some part of me absolutely refuses to believe my maintenance is 1700 calories. It doesn’t make sense to me. I ate &lt;1000 all week this week because of my denial. I’m on track to do the same today (200 cal breakfast, 190 cal lunch).  I maintained from February to now. It has its peaks and valleys.",False,False

My gw was 128, so not underweight for me or anything, just a BMI of 19. And I was maintaining at 1800-2000/day.  Then some life situations happen and I was eating shit/eating my feels and I gained to 144, but now I'm 136 and maintaining here because apparently I can't under eat anymore without triggering a binge. Like, even restricting to bmr is soooooo hard.",False,False

I find that after I hit a new low, if I eat to maintain right away my body will hold the weight. So I typically restrict hard and then eat at a slight deficit for a few days to a week so my body doesn’t freak out. One day I might eat 1000 cals, the next couple 1200, then 1500; to get my body used to eating a certain amount. That way it doesn’t feel like binging as much and my body knows it’s getting a steady supply of food.",False,False

I recovered from an ED non-anorexic tendencies related but started developing anorexic tendencies lately. I’m not extremely thin, but mentally I’m fighting this shit everyday and it’s hard. But I think you don’t have to be completely engulfed in what is expected of anorexic or other well-known EDs to have an ED and more specifically voice how much you struggle with it. That doesn’t take away from others who you could say are at more of an extreme with their ED.",False,False

But regardless I’ve been trying to just maintain now for almost a year and have mostly been successful ( have actually lost a little more but extremely slowly). I should preface that this is hardly a success story I’m still disordered as fuck in terms of being rigid about food and b/p about once a week. Doesn’t seem to impact my weight though.   Anyway, most days I eat 2000-2200 calories and workout pretty intensely 3-4 days a week. I feel like an idiot or an imposter or something on this sub because everyone else is fasting, eating under 1200, etc. I honestly don’t think I would have that in me anymore even if I wanted to.",False,False
