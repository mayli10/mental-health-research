This just happened to me this week when I've already been having a hard time and feeling SUPER triggered this month. I have been losing weight really slowly and trying not to go overboard or get into an unhealthy place about it... I have 7 lbs to lose to reach a normal bmi so I know I'm not ""looking good"" buddy. For the love of God please stop putting a spotlight on my body... It makes it hard to pretend nobody notices.",False,False

I get super uncomfortable and irritated when people make comments on my body. ""You're so skinny omg."" (I'm literally fucking not skinny at all. Wtf? I'm overweight by 50lbs ðŸ™„) Like I get trying to be nice, but don't flat out fucking lie to me and call me something I'm not. I've lost a lot of weight the last 6 months, but I'm NOT skinny.
