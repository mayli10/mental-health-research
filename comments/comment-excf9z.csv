I think I might be underestimating the power of an ED, though. Last time, I feel down the rabbit hole. But this time my ugw is a healthy weight (it's my discharge weight from IP). But then again, started with a reasonable goal the first time, too....",False,False

I reached my UGW and still thought I looked fat. So I kept going and I couldn’t eat normally anymore. I honestly thought I could stop when I wanted to but I couldn’t.

I don’t think I can recover without reaching it. I feel like it’s holding me back. Until I know I I can achieve that, I’ll never be able to let myself get better. I plan to get there this year and then call a treatment centre.   But it has gone like this: when I was 14, I had an ugw and I reached it and lowered it and then I reached that and lowered it. I’ve never reached the next one because it is an insanely low ugw but this year I am determined to get there but what will happen? Will I be satisfied or will I lower it again?",False,False

I lost control over my ed when I reached my ugw. I learned that happens to a lot of people.  You lose weight, reach your ugw, then you're like ""but I can't eat normally like other people... I will get fat again"" and baaam. You're even more fucked.",False,False

Then I reached my less healthy one and lost more. Then I reached my UNHEALTHIEST one. I’m 2lbs under that now.  It’s a cycle for a lot of us. I want to recover, but I need help I don’t have access to. At the very least I figure I’m putting some “room” between my ugw and whatever weight I might gain by eating again.",False,False

Wanting to feel valid, wanting to feel worthy of help, wanting our story to follow a certain arc, wanting to be in control. I find all of that very relatable.  For me trying to flip my momentum was the moment I discovered it had been awhile since I had actually been in the driver's seat, and the ED thoughts had been lying about 'you can stop when you want to'. It was a scary experience, feeling that powerless against my own mind. The longer we stay engaged with the disorder, the the longer the road out becomes...possibly by a nonlinear multiplier.
