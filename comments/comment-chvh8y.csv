I get so tempted to do a McDonald’s binge and eat like 5000 calories at once, but I tell myself that if I have a soda and a snack and STILL feel like getting more food, I’ll go, but by then I’m temporarily full and have wasted an hour and so the craving often passes. It does help that I get my binge cravings at night, though, cause then I know I can just sleep in a few hours and forget all about it",False,False

Also, I started saying no to food by cutting off my methods of buying food... I don’t take my credit/debit card with me to work if I get hungry and I purposefully do it when I’m invited to eat out with friends. I don’t wanna miss out on making memories with friends just because I have an ED so that’s how I get around it lol. Of course they’ll insist on buying you something, “lending” you money, or offering you a bit of their meal but I’d feel too guilty doing that. I just like being around my friends, and the atmosphere in restaurants is actually fun when you know you literally can’t eat.",False,False
