It‚Äôs just so hard not to feel wounded by it even though I know all these things to be true. But reading this really made me feel better especially the last part I think is really true; I hadn‚Äôt really thought of that before,False,True

I remember I was almost feeling good abt myself that day but in the comments she talked about how she had ""balooned up to that weight"" completely ""let herself go, had never been that huge before"" and I was like oh yeah, yep, i am balooned and huge, time to starve ‚è∞",False,False

Idk about you but I am so ruthless with myself in every aspect but I'm very sympathetic to others. Sometimes I make shallow judgements of others but they are incredibly shallow compared to the utter disgust I feel for myself. I think a lot of people are like this.   &amp;#x200B;  Also people say these degrading things about their previous weight normally cuz they are posting pictures or sharing details and tbh I think it's partially a way to deflect embarrassment because they are a little self-conscious/nervous about sharing.",False,False
