I'm also about 3 pounds from underweight, and when my mom heard I lose weight she instantly told me to gain.  If it makes you feel better, there is Nothing Wrong with gaining a few pounds. You could do that without anyone noticing. The most likely cause of losing your period would be malnutrition. Since you arent underweight, if you were to figure out your maintenance calories, you could eat at maintenance and shove a ton of nutrition in there. If your period doesnt come back after a few months of eating nutritiously, consult an OB GYN.  If you are happy with how you look and feel at your current weight, I would highly recommend that",False,False
