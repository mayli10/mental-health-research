Keeps me from being able to just get up and go mindlessly binge.",False,False

I actually used to play a lot of video games but that's been put on the back burner because I can't binge eat and play at the same time.... Will try get back into it!",False,True

Also video games help to keep my brain focused elsewhere and keep me artificially “happy” like I’m accomplishing something.    I also take like two evenings a week to just hang out at my local game shop and play/demo games with people. I just have to be careful with that because I have to drive home past a few triggering places I could get really bad food.,False,False

I'm at the point now where I can sit and improvise over a backing track for an hour and barely notice the time go by.  The pleasure of hearing new music come from my own hands, something so lovely and abstract that floats up into the air and disappears, is almost like a drug.",False,False

It’s self care and luxury and relaxation all rolled into one and it makes you feel somewhat more human and just... clean,False,False
