After I entered a day treatment program last month (one of the Renfrew branches) and started eating more, it was amazing how I instantly and almost entirely lost my urge to drink.  A related surprise was going into some kind of hypermetabolic state while my body hurried to reupholster my organs, etc. While also amazing, I lost more weight and the program said it was unethical to keep me on below 77% ideal body weight (a standard? insurance calculation).   I'm still terrified of the idea of gaining weight--but still eating more, and barely drinking, and feeling better, and appreciating the human body so much more!",False,False

It had literally nothing to do with the horrible life choices I was making or how much alcohol was destroying my life. Literally all about how many calories I was taking in from the booze. This is the only reason I stay sober a year later. Good for you for limiting your intake regardless of the reasons though, it's so hard to do!",False,False

It’s interesting though how one coping mechanism quickly shifts to another.  As for me I love drinking, especially wine - but it makes me ravenous and the hangover always makes me overeat.
