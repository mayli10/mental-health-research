I also just fell back into old habits. My biggest trigger is when I'm off work so usually during summer break. But now I'm off because I'm about to have surgery and I've fallen back into my old patterns. The same restriction and rules around food that I had when I was really underweight. I can already feel myself getting thinner but it's giving me such a high and its so hard to stop. So I sympathise with you and I hope you will be able to get past it and eat normally again soon. Sending love &lt;3,False,False
