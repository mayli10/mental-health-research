More recently I’m using independent psychedelic therapy. They all help to some extent, but over the years I’ve learned that &gt;95% of the help comes from within. Whichever method you use it’s a lot of hard work. I still have far to go I think but I’m certainly so far from where I was at my worst (thank God). So I’ve made a lot of progress, there’s hope! Very best of luck with your recovery 🙏🏽💚",False,False

Are you receiving any professional help or therapy? If so, does it help? When I get back from travelling I think I will reach out to my GP, because I don't know if I can handle feeling like this indefinitely.",False,True
