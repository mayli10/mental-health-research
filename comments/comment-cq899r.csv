My issue is the guilt of recovering from anorexia and the fear of relapsing in my 30‚Äôs. I will try it at the weekend when I get a moment. Thanks‚Äô.  Just have to keep working at it. I know this a lifelong thing.   Your a kind person.,False,False

And Alan Watts is awesome - I find his voice so soothing haha  You can totally meditate. Everyone can. There‚Äôs absolutely no reason why you can‚Äôt, cultural or otherwise (Irish parents here lol). It‚Äôs hard as shit to begin tho üòÇ the meditation your friend showed you sounds a lot like yoga nidra - ‚Äúfocus on the muscles around your eyes. Relax those muscles. Now move to your cheeks and feel them relax. Now your lips, then your jaw, feel every muscle release... now focus on the muscles in your neck, the tips of your shoulders, etc..‚Äù etc.   My mind still races and does some fucked up shit, I‚Äôm by no means a master, but now I‚Äôm able to pull myself back to the present moment and it helps so much more than I thought possible",False,False

It‚Äôs just a cultural thing within Irish society. I don't think mediation works on us Irish. I think we are just hardwired a certain way. Irish people tend to have a constant inner monologue.   The closest I have come to unburdening my mind with meditation was something a friend showed me.   ‚ÄúBreath and relax. Focus on the tips of your fingers. Now think of the tips of your fingers on your left hand side moving the focus down your hand to your wrist etc.‚Äù I am paraphrasing.   I find when I sit and listen to Alan Watts lectures or other Buddhist teachings it provides a sense of relief and insight. Like a nervous child being reassured by a parent.,False,False
