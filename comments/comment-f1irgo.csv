I think about the girls my boyfriend used to like (and kind of cheated on me with in a way before we dated during a time we had a thing) and it just reminds myself how i'll never be good enough or that maybe he's only with me because I lost weight and now kinda look like them! I hate torturing myself by looking at them but I cant help it. Maybe one day we'll realize we're good enough.,False,False
