You bring up some really good points and thoughtful ideas. At the end of the day I truly want what's best for her and have to try to avoid letting anything (even my own internalized jealousy and toxic thought processes) impede that. Seriously appreciate you!,False,True

I would just casually say that starvation mode isn't real next time she brings any of this up. If she rebuts, you can just say something like ""I'm just letting you know what I know to be true because I wouldn't feel right about not telling you. Definitely do your own research and decide what is best for you."" That way, you've done the right thing by telling her and it's not your fault if she doesn't believe it.  I couldn't find a video specifically on starvation mode, but I would encourage her (and everyone!!!) to check out the YouTube channel [Shredded Sports Science](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXrqErU_TjqiHAHJkzITAvg). It's the most informative, unbiased, and entertaining fitness channel on the internet (imho lol). I had no idea just how much fitness hogwash there is on Instagram until I started watching his videos.    Honestly, it boggles my mind that people think starvation mode is real. Why do millions of people die everyday from literal starvation?! That being said, remember it's not your responsibility to convince her.",False,False

Talking to her about it now will probably be better in the long run. I'm just not exactly sure how to approach the topic sensitively/craft a sound argument since there is a ton of conflicting literature on the subject. And I don't want to make her feel bad either!,False,True

She's strong-willed, argumentative. Dispelling the reality of starvation mode would not come easy since it's something she (and seemingly her body coach) fervently believe in. I have a lotttt of anxiety around being perceived as unintelligent, and I fear the conversation would end with both her (and me) thinking I'm stupid/uninformed. And frankly I don't think I'm in a position to be giving \*anyone\* eating advise. :/",False,True

I think you'll feel better if you do tell her. Maybe send her some sources. In my opinion, jealousy (not to make it sound trivial, but it does break down to jealousy at the end of the day) isn't as bad as guilt/shame.",False,False
