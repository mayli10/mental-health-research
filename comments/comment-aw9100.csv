My mom had an eating disorder, but never talked about it with me. She comes from a very stoic family that acts like nothing is ever wrong. I love her very much, but when she found out about my ED in high school, I wish she would have talked to me about it. She got me into treatment, but never said a word to me directly.   If you do notice meal-skipping and more worrisome behavior, I’d try to get some active dialogue going about health and body image, even if you have to initiate it. ",False,False

I’ve always been very careful with my words with regards to diet and body image. I am painfully aware of how I need to be a role model for them, particularly for my daughter; and this was the main catalyst for my current weight restoration (it was she who had commented on my weight). I’ve been very frank about my weight restoration and acknowledged that it’s not healthy to be so underweight and that I’m actively trying to gain.   It’s a tough one, both of them have been through phases where they declare that they’re fat (they’re both skinny af!) and they’ve done several days/weeks where they would cut out candy or whatever. My son too. I’ve had to bite my tongue a bit not to make a big deal of it as I didn’t want to turn it into something bigger than a phase, as they didn’t skip meals or anything there’s nothing disordered about merely giving up candy. I kept my comments minimum, and only when prompted reassured them that they did not need to lose weight but if they wanted to quit candy to be healthier that’s fine. I left them to it, they were eating all their meals so I waited it out and eventually they went back to candy, and I made a point not to comment on it.  It’s a fine line to walk as if I’m too proactive about trying to prevent ED it could actually backfire and trigger it so I just try to be as normal as possible and put all the emphasis re diet on health and not appearance, and don’t initiate discussion on it but also don’t avoid it if they bring up the issue ",False,False

My only saving grace is that I’ve know girls with children who’ve also had ED’s and said that experiencing pregnancy totally changed and helped their views of their bodies.

There are other factors at play too- Im unstable beyond my eating. I worry my depressive episodes would interfere with being a reliant, attentive parent, and that my wild mood swings would be frightening for a child to have to see (I can scare the hell out of a grown ass person on a bad day) and honestly if I ever got healthy enough to physically carry a child to term  (gaining weight, quitting smoking, putting down the bottle) I wouldn't want to risk baby weight and stress triggering a relapse- but my biggest fear would be passing on my ED.   I just know I don't have it in me to raise a kid who would love and value them self because I don't know how to love and value myself.   I don't really *want* kids but its upsetting to know that I wouldn't be able to handle it if I did want to. It's equal parts *can't* and *won't* for me but I spend a lot of time pretending it's all *won't* for the sake of my pride. ",False,False
