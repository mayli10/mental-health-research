But that time she was having a rough time with her family and we ended up talking about our childhoods and, unfortunately, some bad things that occured at that time. I kept it very light because I hate when people know that about me but I wanted her to know I understood. It was just sad the way she was always trying to ""up"" her trauma. Like that's not why I'm talking about it with you...",False,True

They want to be the best in everything, even bad things, for attention. They can‚Äôt handle someone else having slightly more attention than them so they ALWAYS have a more dramatic story.   You know what? Even if she does have it 10 times worse than you, that does not invalidate your problems. If she‚Äôs always going on about herself I would stop talking to her. When they stop getting attention they quickly change habits.  Good luck dealing with them though",False,False
