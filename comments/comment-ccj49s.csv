I was in a big group of my bf‚Äôs friends once, chilling and enjoying myself as the only woman in the room, until another friend came over. She was petite, feminine, and dressed in a cute top and short skirt. My overweight, men‚Äôs-tshirts-and-jeans-wearing ass just felt huge and ugly and awkward and *awful* for the rest of the night.",False,False

The people you keep around you can be a reflection of you so if she‚Äôs super cute and petite then that rubs off on you lol. It‚Äôs not a competition to hang out with people who have traits you admire, I think it actually lifts you up.",False,False

I have a friend I have been avoiding because she is very short and super skinny and extremely beautiful. I am tall and basically an ogre compared to her. I hate eating when I'm around her because she eats like a bird and soooo slowly. Every time we hang out I am so stressed that I can't have any real fun üòû I feel bad but I have such a hard time that I literally want to die whenever we hang out.",False,False

This is actually a huge thing keeping me from being around people and I‚Äôve pretty much lost all of my friends over time.    Feels bad dude. I‚Äôm sorry you feel this way :,(",False,False
