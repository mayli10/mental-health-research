I considered myself a recovered bulimic for like 6 years, but all of a sudden in the last 3 months I've regressed SIGNIFICANTLY. I shared an EDmeme I made today with my mom, and she was shocked, but tried to be as supportive as possible.   She was mostly only serious until I told her that the memes help me not be as hard on myself, and make me feel way more comfortable opening up, and not being so secretive. She then sent me bitmojis of her uncomfortably laughing in solidarity.  I could tell that she was thinking ""is it healthy for me to support this"" tho",False,True
