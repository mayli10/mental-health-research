This works for me because I know I couldn’t comfortably live any other way; the pros far outweigh the cons. It’s an individual choice though, if this isn’t fun or convenient for you, try not to get stuck in the cycle. It fits really well into the kind of life I want to live and facilitates my lifestyle. If it doesn’t do that for you, it won’t be sustainable.",False,False

It is one of the only times I have ever truly liked my body. Not gonna lie, it was also very comforting to realize that pregnancy doesn’t have to mean massive weight gain. Everyone acts like ballooning up is inevitable, so I was terrified. But I gained the recommended amount, lost all the extra weight by six weeks postpartum, and my baby is perfect.   ED thinking is always messed up, but it doesn’t mean we can’t do anything right.",False,False

Most days I would not eat at all, or eat less than 500 calories. Once every 7-10 days I would eat about 2000 calories of mostly junk. I have never been able to binge more than that, and it’s a “normal” amount of food. I have always teetered between BMI of 18 and 20. The evidence all suggested I was doing just fine. When I first heard about intermittent fasting, I was like, “oh I already do that!”  While pregnant and breastfeeding I have had to actually eat every day. I figured out my TDEE and added the recommended 300-500 calories for growing and feeding a human child. Surprise surprise, eating the right amount every day means I maintain my weight, even while pregnant! (Plus the exact recommended amount of weight gain, I mean.) But instead of being happy about this discovery, I am soo looking forward to restricting again instead. Sigh.",False,False

I love it, honestly. I get to eat *e v e r y t h i n g* I want and maintain my LW at the same time. Obviously it gets really hard at times but those are sacrifices I’m happy to make in order to have the best of both worlds.",False,False
