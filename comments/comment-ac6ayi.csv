Looking back, in my early 20s, I used to tell myself that by my age now (27) I would be ED-free, eat normally and be in a healthier weight range.

Besides that ‚Äúgrown-up‚Äù stuff is bull anyhow (or at least the myth that at a certain age you should automatically and magically have all your sh*t together is bull). 25 or 65 we‚Äôre still just finding our way each day as best we can.,False,False
