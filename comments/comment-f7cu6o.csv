I think the more you stress yourself over it the more you are going to eat from the stress. I don't wanna make this about me but after three weeks of uncontrollable binging (because I didn't want to give myself off a few days which I know works for me but I just didn't do that) after I finally stopped caring at all I have literally forgotten to eat two days in a row (I mean I ate breakfast and then remembered to eat lunch.. wasn't hungry at all and ate whatever I wanted) and both days I stayed in maintenance. I know it's scary but I really hope it will help you as well.",False,False

Had a little reese's cup egg before that. Just one, not like, idk, the whole bag. Yeah. I've had more than enough cheat days this week alone. Yeah, my head needs a break.. I'll try to give myself a few days off. Thank you :)",False,True
