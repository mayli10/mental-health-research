I genuinely want to make this subreddit a positive community for everyone because a) I care so fucking much about people and b) the subreddit could get deleted again without SOME changes. Thanks for completely invalidating me, it really makes me feel great. Maybe you could reach out to me personally and actually, you know, talk. I share information that I think is actually important to say, and its not going to be liked by everyone. I also try to consider how things will make everyone feel. That doesn't make me a bad mod. Seriously, I would love if you reach out to me privately to talk because it makes me extremely sad to think that someone hates me this much. I literally feel sick over it.",False,False

As long as somebody isn't severely underweight I'm sure they can just stave off the negative effects by living a healthy lifestyle.,False,False

In many ways the mental aspect of an ED is the worst part because it can almost completely consume every waking moment. OP is wondering if it’s possible to be thin and not be miserable and self hating at the same time. What is wrong with asking that?  OP is also asking if it’s possible to be underweight and healthy. Many responses have said that no, it’s not, and being underweight long term will lead to health consequences.  The discussion of BMI in this thread helps facilitate a reality check that not everyone who is skinny has a mental illness. It also facilitates a discussion that acknowledges even if someone isn’t struggling mental whilst underweight, medical professionals suggest they will experience long term health consequences. Which reminds us all that it’s important for us to not lose sight of eventually trying to recover and maintain a healthy weight and healthy mindset towards food.  If we can’t discuss BMI in a sub specifically created for people with eating disorders who aren’t necessarily ready to recover then where can we discuss it?? Subs like r/fuckeatingdisorders exist and are there for people who actively want to recover. There are legit subs for people with heroin addiction and alcoholism who have accepted that they will die from their addiction and are not attempting harm reduction. Yet you’re saying discussing BMI in a sub for people with eating disorders should be censored because people with eating disorders who read it might be triggered?  If a person with an ED is worried about being triggered then they shouldn’t be on this sub in the first place. It’s not our responsibility to censor ourselves in a community where we’re supposed to be able to speak freely and without judgement. Honestly I’m disappointed that your a mod here as I’ve seen your post history. Your opinions and approach make me feel very unsafe as a member of this sub.",False,False

Like, as long as it doesn't go into giving tips or mocking the girl for claiming to not have an ED, it should be fine.

If you watch super size v super skinny,  Dr. Christian goes over in detail why being underweight is bad/hard on your body in the long run.    There are a lot of problems that arise from a lower then healthy BMI, even if it is an effortless thing for a person to maintain.  I think saying something like ""I don't have any health problems at an underweight BMI and I've been like this for years"" is about the same as someone who is overweight/obese saying they don't have any health problems so being overweight is fine. Just because you are not symptomatic does not mean there are not already issues arising with someone's health. The potential for negative health effects are raised significantly in both categories",False,False

What dictates that? Metabolic rate? Leptin/ghrelin levels? For people who don't actively monitor their intake, weight is mostly a product of their circumstances and their learned behaviors. Even if your muscle/fat ratio is extremely high, your metabolic rate isn't going to be boosted by an astronomical amount. Not enough to make a big difference unless you track calories pretty strictly.   It's *possible* she just has all the hunger drive of a rock. Or a thyroid condition. I'd be quicker to believe this if she is also active. But I'd be dubious.   &gt;see her eat normal/big portions  That's what you see. People regularly see me eating *huge* portions.
