I normally do cauliflower rice, frozen veg mix, garlic, ginger paste, something spicy, soy sauce and if Iâ€™m really feeling it sweet soy sauce (abc brand) is reaaaally good in stir fry. Sweet soy is about 70cals per tablespoon so I just do a drizzle but it really balances out the saltiness.   But with the cauliflower rice being so low cal I feel okay with a little sweet soy.   It comes out to about 150-170 depending on how much of everything you use and if you add kimchi or a fried egg itâ€™s soooooo fucking good but the egg is obviously a lot more cals added.",False,False
