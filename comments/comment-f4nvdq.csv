Some fat on your body is healthy but an overwhelming amount is unhealthy. And I can say I feel fat because I do and I have free speech. HAES annoys me so much and I'll argue anyone who claims being morbidly obese is okay. Edit: Being positive about yourself and having positive self-talk at every size is AMAZING. You should always be as positive as you can when you think about yourself and your body, but that has no relation to the fact that if you're morbidly obese you're still unhealthy.",False,False

There are those who don't see the difference though. They can be so hurtful. They won't even consider that it's an illness. They don't understand that body dysmorphia literally makes you see yourself differently than you really look.

I love the ~idea~ of HAES, that yes people can be healthy at different sizes (but probably not when you get to super morbid obesity where you canâ€™t move...). That you can be skinny and super unhealthy- so as a basis health doesnâ€™t always depend on body size. I like this idea at the root of haes, but the community online seems to be v toxic. Itâ€™s far more focused on people accepting being fat at any cost to health.   Iâ€™ve followed haes accounts before when recovering from my ED expecting to see videos of chubbier people exercising or tips about the best exercise when you have massive boobs etc. Like a community about being healthy that isnâ€™t focused on weight, but all they are focused on is fat acceptance rather than health in any way.  Take me for example- Iâ€™ve gained weight recently due to ED recovery. Iâ€™m finding this really difficult as exercising is now more difficult than it should be. If I joined a haes group they would recommend that I accept my â€˜fatnessâ€™- but personally it just ~feels~ bad. Itâ€™s not an aesthetic thing, I literally feel worse running when there is chub moving or rubbing.   Iâ€™m not sure what Iâ€™m trying to say tbh, on one hand ppl shouldnâ€™t be discriminated against for being fat but on the other, ppl shouldnâ€™t feel bad engaging in behaviours that are associated with weight loss. There has to be a middle ground or a more nuanced understanding about weight.",False,False

I feel fat a lot of the time. I stand in front of the mirror and stare at myself to try and see if Iâ€™m seeing things wrong. Iâ€™ll take pictures to look at and compare with earlier pictures to try and confirm if my brain is seeing things wrong.  Iâ€™ve felt like all of my clothes are too tight even though they fit just fine. I have literally felt fat and itâ€™s not fair to say thatâ€™s fatphobic.,False,False

They will cry ""fatphobia"" at the most minor of things and at things that have nothing to do with them - including stating that they are personally affected or even victimised by those with restrictive EDs or Body Dysmorphic Disorders saying that they ""feel fat"".   Saying you feel this way when the ED or similar is making you feel that way is not fatphobic. It is a well-documented symptom of the mental issues you're struggling with, and that is nothing to be ashamed of.   I don't get genuinely angry at much, but the HAES and fat acceptance communities piss me off.",False,False

Nobody can read minds so nobody can be hurt by me judging the shit out of them bc of my ED unless I actually act on my judgemental thoughts. So maybe it makes me a shitty person just to think badly of someone in whatever context but that has very little impact on others as long as I don't externalise it.
