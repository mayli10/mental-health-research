I went vegan so I could easily restrict and things have kinda spiralled from there. I meet up with a group of friends regularly and they always bring snacks and ever since I went vegan they make an effort to bring at least one vegan thing as well and it's such a nice gesture but I wish they didn't üò≠üò≠üò≠ I usually just have a little bit of it and then other people end up eating it so it's not too bad but still.

It definitely isn't for everyone, and that's the best thing about diets, you can accommodate what works best for you.
