Chocolate and vanilla are both good, but strawberry is terrible. On Amazon I think they're also only like $1 per shake. Maybe close to $1.50 actually. I just know that they're really cheap and super healthy. Not so cheap in stores though. ",False,False

Gluten-free, ethically sourced, gets all your daily nutrition needs, and is so filling. I thought I wouldn't be able to survive with just 2 or 3 drinks a day at 400 calories each because I've had issues with binging, but this helped so much.  It's also not so sweet that I force myself to have more because SUGAR, either. I got it almost 2 weeks ago. But had to give myself a week to adjust.  Definitely better when it was in the fridge overnight. And I love chocolate but fuck chocolate Huel. Go with vanilla. Haven't tried the berry. Just adjust to it for a week or so or beware of shitting. I take pills to keep me regular but look at the forums and r/Huel.  It's cheap in the long-run and healthier than Soylent. If you don't love or hate the taste, you get used to it and it helps to not binge on it. It's less dishes by far and less money than buying food.",False,False

There's so much protein that it kind of tricks my brain into feeling full. It's sweet and I personally enjoy the flavor. There's probably cheaper alternatives but this is my recommendation!,False,False
