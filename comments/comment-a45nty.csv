Instead, people now go out of their way to make things specially for me, so I'm even more obligated to eat them.    On one hand, it's amazing knowing how much people love and care about me and my food choices, and I love thinking about how many animals i've saved, but on the other hand.... FML. Oil and flour and sugar are still vegan. ",False,False

Most of that stuff is pretty shelf stable.   Anything that really stresses you out isn't worth it. Your mom loves you and this was very sweet and thoughtful, but that doesn't obligate you to keep every item. There are probably food pantries near you or donation bins at your local grocery store for anything that doesn't feel safe or worth the stress? I'd consider that paying her love forward, not being ungrateful. (-:",False,False

Other things to do: pre-portion them out in ziplock bags of x number of calories and possibly keep all but a couple in very inconvenient places (I did this and it helps because I don’t feel like getting to stuff), share with friends/family, or donate them to a shelter/charity.",False,False
