Paedophilia is the attraction to prepubescent children. Also I'm willing to bet he's not actually attracted to teenagers like you assumed. Teen is a popular pornography subtype but the girls who star in it are 18 and over (actually a lot of them look close to 30???) and it's fairly vanilla. I guess it's a taboo thing, like a fantasy. They aren't lusting after teenagers.",False,False

I would rather have no boobs at all than have the boobs that I do have. They're just weird to me. I think I had growth problems because I did stop growing at 13. I think my breasts only grew for a year before they stopped, but I read that breast growth often takes around 5 years. I have a small frame for my height so I think I would look better without them than with them. At the very least if they had gone through all the different stages of growth and still ended up small that would be fine. I think they rushed to Tanner 4 then stopped though. Or maybe they might even be at another stage. Those puberty charts are hard to read. It would be nice to not have to worry about bras and stuff, but my understanding is that of they had just fully developed then I could go braless without any issues because the final stage of growth has the breast tissue settle into the boobs and as a result the nipple/areola become less pronounced and so I wouldn't need to worry about people seeing them constantly. I always read online comments where people say that at least when you have small boobs you don't need a bra, but I feel like that's not true for me. Maybe if I had a normal adult's body it would be...",False,False
