There's not a single valid explanation for how that can be considered selfish. It's a long, difficult, painful process which will permanently impact your body. There's nothing wrong with not wanting that.",False,False

Yes labour is painful and raising a child is a waste of 18-30 (depending how successful you/they become) years of your life. But the worst worst worst thing is the *weight gain*, the ripped abdominal muscles, the widening of your pelvis, stretch marks, milk balloon boobs, pain trying to sleep/bend down/walk...  Why would I want to destroy my body that I work so hard to keep perfect, only to then destroy any concept of having a life for the next two-three decades? Nah. Not for me. Sorry boo.",False,False

With my second he had extra fluid around him and I blew up the last 2 months, resulting in some pretty severe diastasis recti (even 3 years later there's a big gap!). During pregnancy, my brain wasn't that bad. I ALWAYS wanted kids. So when I finally got pregnant my ED brain gave me a reprieve. Literally the DAY I got cleared for exercise it was back though. ""well, I let you have the baby experience, time to starve again, get on that treadmill fatty""!  My stomach is literally the bane of my existence. It'll never look the same. Never BE the same. Not even close. Unless I get surgery (which I absolutely qualify for but will never get). But I absolutely love my kids. They're my fucking world and I absolutely couldn't imagine my life without themüíú.",False,False
