Like someone else said, it also takes a couple of pounds to notice weight fluctuations and especially if the person is taller. I also think that for people without an ED, they'll naturally have a lower appetite the day after eating a lot, and some will subconsciously fidget or move around more.",False,False

For people with normal eating patterns one day they may eat a little more because the dessert was yummy, and the next day they need to rush out of the house in the morning because their alarm didn't go off so they eat a smaller breakfast or maybe they go for a walk outside because the weather is nice. Everything balances out in the long run.  Also when you're eating patterns aren't forced or out of whack eating intuitively works very well so you will in fact end up staying the same weight.  Weight fluctuates with a few kilos, mantaining is not about being exactly a precise weight always under all circumstances.",False,False
