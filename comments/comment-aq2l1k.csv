When I would travel with my ex, the guilt eating would create in me was terrible. I wanted to enjoy the trips so bad but I couldn't get past my own ED. My best advice is to try and eat as clean as possible. High Density low cal foods. Id say I didn't want to upset my stomach during our trip and didn't want to feel heavy or get sick while we were out exploring. Try and enjoy it! ",False,False

I wasn’t particularly looking for advice, because I doubt anyone would be able to suggest anything I haven’t already thought of after dealing with this for over a decade and have traveled a fair amount in that time.  I will probably end up fasting for an extended period after we get back if I feel like I indulged too much, as usual. I just needed to get this out because everyone in my real life thinks that I am stable now and I would like to keep it that way. I was mostly looking for someone that could relate and you provided exactly that, so thank you! I hope that you have a great time and are able to enjoy yourself on your trip!",False,True

I’m excited to go but all I can think about is the calories, how I will look in a bikini, will I be able to use laxatives etc. I love traveling but I can’t remember the last time I was able to fully enjoy the experience, since food can be a big part of vacations, and it sucks.   I am also hiding my ED from him at the moment, so having to eat every meal together is a big fear. I usually pull the sensitive stomach card &amp; can get away with eating less, and will probably bring protein bars to get me through. Wish I had better advice, can just say I relate x",False,False
