I've gotten it so drilled in my head over the years that I've still got extra fat to lose, I'll probably always think that regardless of my size.  The rare moments where I can see how bony certain areas are always catch me completely off guard, it definitely does worry me. Getting smaller is addictive and it's hard to keep perspective, even harder to let go of it all",False,False

None of my old work clothes (that I spent hundreds of dollars on after getting a shiny new job) from literally three months ago fit. I cried when I saw how loose they all were. It's scary because when I look in the mirror I can tell that okay, sure, some people might think I'm a bit slim, but I definitely don't see a huge difference from when the clothes did fit. And yes, those moments when you realise how little control you actually have over this are fucking terrifying.",False,False
