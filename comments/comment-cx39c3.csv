I really love that calorie counting all. It gives you all kinds of information about your calories and macros and other stuff but some of the other stuff is premium,False,False

Like, if yesterday's deficit was 1k, that dictates today's menu, and then today's deficit dictates tomorrow's menu?",False,False

Itâ€™s just not included in the new design so fml. Iâ€™ll come back tomorrow and try to figure out exactly what youâ€™re asking and try to help, again Iâ€™m really sorry! Itâ€™s such a shite and confusing design and Iâ€™m pissed off lol",False,True

Idk. That has confused me too. I thought I just got it but as I started typing I got confused again,False,False

I've honestly been confused about this for a bit.  So today, for example. I've eaten 353 calories so far today, I got that, that's easy. Underneath, it says ""1266 calories left"". When I click on the expanded view, it says I've got 353 calories in, 1449 cals out, and 549 left that I can eat before I'm overbudget.  I'm not quite getting what math it pulls to get the ""1266 calories left"" part, what that means, and what I'm supposed to do with that number?",False,False

The way it used to be is that I could go to log a food (like the bread I usually eat) and at the bottom of the whole ""add food"" screen it would show you other foods you've previously logged it with (peanut butter, jelly, banana, chia seeds, etc) and you could select those, do a quick-edit of how much you had of those, and log it all at once.  NOW, it doesn't do any of that, *plus* the ""frequent"" and ""recent"" tabs more often than not don't have what I'm looking for, so I have to dig it out of the pantry/fridge all over again just to scan the barcode and log it.  Also yes, as a graphic designer, I am appalled by how ugly it looks.",False,False
