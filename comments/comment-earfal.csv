It's okay to feel guilty but don't forget, one day of eating over your limit won't do much harm. I actually would recommend to do this maybe once a week. To show yourself that it's okay. Idk if it would help you but it did help me. At first it was scary but now I don't even feel guilty about my binging days because I know it won't ruin my progress. Our Ed's are telling us such stupid and untrue shit but it will never change reality. I hope you will feel better soon. Don't listen to your ed. You did good today &lt;3 you can be proud of yourself.",False,False

One day of eating over your self made limit won't make you gain weight. You are gonna be fine. Trust me. Enjoy this special day and tomorrow you can go back to your ed bullshit like we all do :'),False,False
