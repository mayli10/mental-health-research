Also it sucks when I'm forced to talk about food because of the orthorexia and how food was the only thing I could talk about for so long and people ask me if I'm still eating organic food and want to talk about food. Also I didn't weigh myself for a month and tried to eat normal but the ED would always kick in and tell me to skip meals so I'm not gaining weight even though I'm not weighing myself. Now I'm back to just kinda weighing myself whenever I feel comfortable enough to. Good luck to you!",False,False

My family praises how good I look.  I've had some mild concern but no one really actually looks at me and goes, 'girl, you're not okay, and you're struggling'.  The only person I've broken down in front of is my flatmate and it wasn't by choice.  Your family not being supportive seems mean, and unfortunately Western culture is to blame for that.  Skinny is best life apparently, regardless of how you get there.  Not true but thank you media.",False,False
