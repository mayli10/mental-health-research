She did say in my first session recently that everything I say if confidential unless I plan to harm myself or others, and she can’t talk me out of it. But she also mentioned that my doctor and her have s professional relationship and can give updates to each other. I think in my next session in a few weeks I will ask for clarification for peace of mind, and so she knows I am worried about it.  She is a good therapist (well I’ve only had 2 session so far lol but she seems competent and I feel pretty comfortable there) and I’m glad to be seeing her, just I’m always on edge and over worrying everything. But yeah asking for clarification next time will help me I think.    Thank-you :)",False,True

Explain how you feel.   You can't have a trusting relationship with your therapist if you don't understand the boundaries. The therapist can and should explain to you what she can and will tell other members of the team.   Sometimes its easier for patients to only have to tell one person something. Repeating things is frustrating when its hard to say even the first time. For other people (myself included) I need to known which people in my life know what. The idea of my doctors talking about me without me present makes me very distrustful.  That said, I have worked with a managed care team. As long as I had the final say in what specific information was shared it worked out.  Good luck to you.",False,False
