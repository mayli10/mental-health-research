The steeping process should only extract an entirely negligible amount of calories, if any (we're talking less than one). Please don't fret over this. You are okay, I promise.  It's similar to calorie counts for black coffee (usually around 5cal), which in reality are effectively zero as there is nothing nutritionally viable in the actual coffee liquid - just perhaps a negligible amount if you were to actually eat the beans.",False,False
