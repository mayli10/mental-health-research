I imagine it's because they contain a lot of what's being talked about in the other comments so might be worth looking into for you.",False,False

I also drink a meal replacement shake. I just started that the other day so can't say if it works yet. But I did pick these vitamins because I eat fast food so much. Usually McDonald's. A McDouble combo is just so cheap yet so satisfying. Their fries are also high in potassium which is good. Potassium is good for your brain and muscles but only 5% of people get enough. I still won't get enough even with the supplement, but that's what I get for eating so little food I suppose. I mean, I probably don't need as much since %DVs are based on someone eating a 2000 calorie diet. Supplementing so much probably isn't as good as eating food, but I feel that I'll be okay. With this plan I'm only a little low on phosphorous and potassium and I don't reach the upper tolerable limit for any nutrients. Seems okay to me.",False,False
