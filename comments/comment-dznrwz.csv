I had to stuff it down today. Usually I just eat habitually... my boyfriend is leaving for a week and since I live with him... I know I wonâ€™t be drinking or smoking weed and I will sleep more.... so... Iâ€™m gonna drop weight and be increasingly depressed. I call this plummeting. It happens once a year.,False,False
