My UGU was around 125, which is still ""healthy"" but on the lower end... but my BF% was very low (lost my period for over a year until I gained weight again lmfao) because I lift a lot of weights. Now that I'm back up to 155 (between trying to ""recover"" as well as a few surgeries over the last year), I absolutely HATE myself again. I can't even with this shit. I want to crawl out of my skin every freaking day, it feels suffocating. I never want to be 155 again. Ever... :-(",False,False

I‚Äôd say I felt neutral about my body (possibly because my body and brain were slowly shutting down so I felt pretty neutral about everything). I recognize sitting at my LW wasn‚Äôt physically sustainable and also that it wasn‚Äôt going to heal the emotional issues that drove me to that LW (and which stemmed from varying sources, not solely body image). Though I‚Äôm back to some of my bs, so, I don‚Äôt even knowww.   The popular narrative about EDs and ED recovery leaves soooo much out.
