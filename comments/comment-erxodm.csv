I don’t know if it’s at all useful info, but there are PHP and residential programs geared for depression or other non-ED mental health issues (anxiety, bipolar, OCD, etc.) if you’re feeling like a higher level of care would be helpful. It’s not only ED treatment that offers those things.   I really relate to feeling like there’s no hope. Sometimes it’s there when we can’t see or feel it...or even imagine what feeling it again would be like. I’m sorry you’ve been struggling so much for so long. That’s really hard and really deeply tiring. I hope you’ll find what you need and be given help that helps &lt;3",False,False
