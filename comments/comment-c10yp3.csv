Like I get that you probably don't mean anything bad but girl hello? It's an eating disorder, it's like saying ""I don't get anorexics how can they just sit there and starve themselves don't they understand they look sickly? They must be pretty dumb if they believe they can live their lives like that!"". Like excuse me but find a kinder way to put it next time. It's a disorder, people aren't choosing to get BED.  Why people binge? Different reasons, some do because food literally makes the brain give out endorphins and you feel happier, when something goes south food is a safe space, a comfort. Another reason can be malnutrition, your body is asking for nutrients and your hormones are out of whack and you literally don't feel the fullness in your stomach.",False,False

People of all weights deprive themselves. Many overweight people feel ashamed to eat in public or are determined to lose weight but go about it the wrong way - starving all day and then losing control at home where nobody can see them. Then there are people who have emotional issues and of poor mental health, who go on to binge.",False,False

It has nothing to do with the personality of the person. It is a survival instinct. The body is desperate for food, energy and replenishment and will do whatever it has to do to get it. It's unfair to congratulate yourself for not bingeing as some kind of quality, when you have lots of people on this forum battling with a sense of shame and failure for bingeing. It wasn't 'them' that binged, it was an illness and or a deprived body that drove that kind of behaviour. For anyone reading this who binges, please be kind to yourself and feel no shame. xo",False,False
