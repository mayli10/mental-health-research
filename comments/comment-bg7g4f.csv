By being fat, all my insecurities, vulnerabilities, and failures are on display. I dont have many status-y things like a husband, home I own (I live in a studio), kids, or a career I can brag about. If I were some high powered business executive I could say my career is a reason why I dont have a family. I love my career but it's not that fancy and i dont make tons of money.   Part of me feels that what's holding me back from a lot is my weight I dont deserve those things anyway while I'm this big. And I worry everyone around me is like ""of course shes unsuccessful, have you seen her?""   I'm an open and supportive friend. I can be fun to be around. I support myself financially. Yet I dont see the progress I've made in my life bc it's not a status thing. No one sees it. I dont have anything to brag about but I also feel like I don't deserve those things anyway. But if I was thin, I could show myself off. People would assume I'm doing well. When they find out I'm single theyd say ""but you're so pretty!"" And not ""I know you want to date but men are very visual. "" I don't deserve to date some amazing guy when I'm so sub par.",False,False
