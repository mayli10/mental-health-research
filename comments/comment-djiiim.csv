People can be so mindless when they talk about weight and appearances. They don‚Äôt know how much that stuff can get into their loved ones‚Äô heads!And maybe it‚Äôs our fault for having low self-esteem/poor body image, or their fault for being inconsiderate, or both, but it sure does make it difficult to process all the feelings and thoughts that go along with those situations.  No problem. And thank you , could be better ...but can‚Äôt it always? Anyway, hope you feel better about this situation soon, one way or another üíï",False,False

My sister is a really awesome, caring person, which is why I get so confused how she‚Äîalong with various other people‚Äîcan say things like that so nonchalantly. It‚Äôs just strange to me. I‚Äôve never felt the need to say things like that. It‚Äôs just really foreign, and I honestly can‚Äôt understand the thought process behind it.   Thank you for your comment. Hope all is well with you ;)",False,True

And definitely no kudos to her friends for saying those things, either. I‚Äôm honestly so sorry. People don‚Äôt know when to shut up.   ‚ô•Ô∏è but hey, you‚Äôre not alone, friend.
