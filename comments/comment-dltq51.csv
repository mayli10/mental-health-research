Are you diluting it enough? I usually have a teaspoon to at least 8oz. Also adding ice and drinking through a straw makes it seem like I'm having a fancy cocktail.  Other drinks I inhale after a binge and find helpful: tea (green, peppermint, chamomile, ""digestion"" blend teas), kombucha (which actually gives the same benefits as ACV), and warm water with lemon. Good luck!",False,False
