It sucks too bc it I go a while without purging even if I overeat or binge I donâ€™t get as strong urges, but the more I do it the more intense/worse they get to where i even want to purge small snacks ðŸ˜•   My therapist and I are working on finding good distractions and ways to work through them. Obviously getting around other people and in situations where itâ€™s impossible to purge is the best, but not always able to happen. Iâ€™ve been working on grounding techniques (google some and find some and try them) and basically Iâ€™m working on building up my tolerance to feeling the urge and sitting with it til it passes, even if itâ€™s an hour or two. Also talking or writing out my feelings, moving my body (even if itâ€™s yoga or stretching like with a 10 minute YouTube video)  Eating smaller/more frequently may help. For me a trigger is def having a high volume of food in my stomach or foods I know are easy to purge so Iâ€™m trying to have a bit more calorie dense/lower volume foods bc I hate eating often. Itâ€™s a lot of trial and error and building up distress tolerance. ",False,False

I told myself ""this isn't who I am, this isn't what I want, this feeling will pass"" or some variation of  it under my breath when I felt the urges. I also distracted myself with other things like journaling, drawing, video games, stuff like that. remind yourself of your goals- why do you want to stop purging? what will you feel like if you give in? remind yourself the rewarding feeling you get post purge is short lived and followed by self loathing and guilt. it's a bad cycle that won't end until you literally stop the action of purging.   good luck to you!",False,False
