I think only like 5% or 10% of people in the US get the recommended amount in their diet. Even with all the bananas I have in this meal plan I still needed to add a potassium supplement. I think bananas are the highest food source of potassium, so idk how anybody is supposed to get enough.",False,False

It's kind of ironic though that I'm so sick now that I'm finally ready to get better, because being sick actively makes it harder to get better. I've never considered bananas a fear food, but peanut butter is for me, so I'm really glad to have a meal plan where peanut butter is a main ingredient for something I'll be eating.",False,False

I find Vitamin A way easier to get though because most of my meal plans have these carrot cake smoothies I make which have a whole cup of carrots in them. I get like 1400% of my DV vitamin A. Fortunately you just pee out any excess vitamin A, so it's not a problem üòÖ Carrots are great for a lot of other vitamins, so they're good to have.  I'm on mobile atm, so I don't have my usual screens/data that I keep on my laptop, but I do know which day I recorded that meal plan I was talking about, [so here's a screenshot of that one.](https://m.imgur.com/a/Hp6UueG) I do have custom macronutrient ratios set, so carbs are higher than usual, but that's because I need more carbs than average. I did used to have this meal plan so that the calories were exactly the amount I would burn in an average day (*if I started exercising*), but it was a little unrealistic because I had vanilla extract which is super expensive for very small bottles and some of the amounts of stuff I used were unusual, so I changed it up a bit and it's like like 100% perfect for me now, but it's still like 99.9% perfect. I don't think it would be good for everybody though. I made the original version of his meal plan for a friend who couldn't eat then modified it for myself because I have health problems that make it so I think I would be better off cutting out solid food from my diet. Like, this meal plan is two smoothies and meal replacement shakes. I separated the two smoothies (peanut butter cup and carrot cake) by the supplements I would add to them if you're curious about that. That's also why bananas are listed twice. With this plan I would be spending like $70/month on bananas which kinda sucks, but they're a good source of potassium which is hard to get, so I don't mind.",False,False

I genuinely don't get how some people who eat enough can have low calcium. I wasn't even able to bring the amount down to twice the recommended amount.
