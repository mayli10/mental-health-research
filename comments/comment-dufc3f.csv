I still need to get some minerals from food though. Sometimes I drink psyllium husk powder in water which is a decent source of iron. Sodium I mostly get from eating fast food. I usually don't get the recommended amount of phosphorus, but that's based on a 2000 calorie diet and I tend to eat 900-1000 calories in a day, so I think it's fine.  Before taking any vitamins you should be certain that you need them. I plan out all of my meals in Cronometer. Lately I have been recording what I eat in it and if anything ever proves to be a bad diet I don't eat that anymore.Like, recently I had Hero Burger and that was a really bad choice. But McDonald's turned out to be a really good one. ðŸ¤”",False,False
