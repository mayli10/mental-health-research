Honestly I don’t believe the keto types when they boast about feeling ‘so full’ after eating an egg and a piece of bacon with some pickle juice. I find I can eat heaps of high fat, protein/ low volume foods like eggs, nut butter, cheese, bacon, salmon etc. without feeling full. The calories add up quickly too. Can’t do the same with starchy/ carby foods like boiled potato, veg, fruits since they fill me up fast and are more voluminous",False,False
