A similar thing with my SO; you're setting yourself up for always consciously focusing on that goal and not on your overall happiness/health.  Also it's okay to 'mess up'; you just gotta keep picking yourself up and doing your best as tiring and difficult it sounds. Do your best to live life. I'm lucky to have that other person in my life and their ED detracts nothing from how much I appreciate them. I do worry a lot and require communication on how they're doing but... point is- you can still be a wonderful person and be yourself without letting ED consume your life. Wish you the best of luck. You're not alone!,False,False

Sorry it took me so long to reply, I've read and cried to your post multiple times and it's very nice to hear someone else's perspective on this. Some days are better than others, and I know it's an uphill battle because I won't be happy unless I've achieved my goal. You're a very kind person to support the other person in your life who's working through this. I wish them the best, and I hope they can find happiness and peace as well :)",False,True

I think it's possible in general- but I can't speak for you. It is a relationship you have with your body, your psychology, and food. I'm not somebody who should even be speaking in regards to how you should handle the situation (not a professional) but I do want to give you and many others hope... I have someone close to me that shares the same exact feelings and I was completely unaware until I learned more about ED in general.  I think with time and the right means of support, you have the potential to feel a sense of normalcy. Will your feelings and overall ED disappear from your life? Honestly, I don't know- but we can hope that you can forget and overcome your struggle.  &gt;I'm absolutely obsessed with food but I can't eat. Or I do eat, and the aftermath is physical and mental torture.  It's a lose-lose situation to yourself. I would hope that you don't hate yourself for eating food- because you need it to live and function. The toxic mentality you've developed towards food and your own body is not a *factual* reality. It's something in your psychology that has been changed your perception of reality. What I'm trying to say is; don't blame yourself. I draw comparisons to depression. There's a number of factors that make you feel how you feel. It's okay to feel those things; but it's not your fault for simply existing and suffering.  I... as an outsider of someone's life and a stranger on reddit- can only hope you slowly begin to gain confidence in yourself. A chance to be content with who you are (even I don't love myself- that's a tall order) and try living life everyday with small steps to find improvement somehow.  &gt;I'm relapsing and stuck in a starve/binge/purge cycle.  I'm so sorry. It really is a cycle that is never ending unless there is a means to change/prevent your body from physically doing what it does. It's not your fault for having ED. It's, as you said, torture. The idea of maintaining a normal eating cycle is nigh impossible because there's always something in your mind that prevents you from meeting your standard/ideal/something. I would hope that you can find some way of eating consistently and not starving yourself.  &gt;I just don't understand how normal people can just do that. To live without an obsession.  You lived a life prior ED too. I'm sure many people would have ED given the right conditions and factors that might have impacted you. You are *not* some weirdo or outsider. Nor are you someone worth dismissing. You are *somebody* and it's worth all the consideration and attention it needs because it impacts *you*. Lots of people have problems and feel the same sense of... irregularity. But it's okay. Some of us have our own things and you can be/are beautiful because of your struggle. Just don't beat yourself up too much (easier said than done, I know). It doesn't do anything for you nor the people who care about you.  &gt;How they can be healthy and consistent and not spent every waking minute think about food or suffering a consequence of eating/not eating it.  It's only when you're aware of something does it (potentially) harm you. It's hard to unthink/unsee something once it's something that you believe- much less live by. The phrase ""ignorance is bliss"" is true. People don't care/notice about things that they've never thought about. What's that? Something something corruption or slaves in third world countries or murdering innocent people? It's hard to look at things the same way once you are informed or view something from a certain angle.  So in relation to ED; I'd say most people don't think about things like ED (or depression, or addiction to ____, or whatever troubles ""not normal"" ^(also that's a terrible way to view things, normalcy or not) people).   Much of the things that unintentionally trigger other people with ED and make other users on here feel bad include ""ignorance"" I guess- in relation to eating, body image, etc. But the opposite may be true, you're too self conscious with ED and you care too much about something that only hurts you. You'll never win with your current mentality- and it's hard to escape that without the right will-power, emotional support, etc.  I'm sure your body is not as bad as you think it is. Your toxic perception of yourself is too harsh. The food you eat is something that can be enjoyable and not something to fear/stigmatize.  I've been rambling too long but... I hope someone finds a little solace in this. Keep your head up. Life is hard; and a life with ED is nothing to scoff at- but I hope you'll be easier on yourself and give yourself a chance. Treat yourself as a third-person; you can treat others with kindness- you can also treat yourself with kindness too. I'm sure someone out there loves you as you are and is willing to fight alongside you.  To that one person in my life, I know it's difficult but I hope you know I think you're beautiful and perfect as you are- with your ""flaws"" n' all. I love you for you. I'll be by your side and I'll do as much as I can to support you and let you know it'll be okay- we'll do this together, you don't have to do it all on your own.",False,False
