When I told her about my diet she mentioned that she needed to start eating like me more because she needed to loose a few lbs before a vacation. She kept saying that I eat very healthy since I mainly eat fruits and vegetables (literally no carbs or sugar other than fruit). Her suggestions for recovery included: eating a spoonful of Pb a week (too fear food) and baking more (something I love but don’t do since I can’t eat the stuff I want to make).   I obviously stopped seeing her since I think she was mistakenly listed as an ed specialist.,False,False
