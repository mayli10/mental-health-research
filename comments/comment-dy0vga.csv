Maybe it will take more of this shit before you feel it's worth putting her behind you but please remember that you don't deserve this unprofessional treatment by virtue of who you are or for the fact that you put up with it in the past.,False,False

My GP is a bit like this psychologist - he told me to ""pull myself together"" when I mentioned I have problems with eating. He's manageable BECAUSE he's only my GP and I don't trust these doctors with anything but when it comes to someone who really has to treat you like a psychologist, you should look for someone who takes your problems seriously.  Also, I'm a tad petty but someone like this doesn't deserve to have any clients whatsoever. She gets paid for trying to fuck you up.",False,False

I’m so sorry they responded this way. I’ve had several negative experiences with psychiatrists and I feel so sad/angry when I hear stories from fellow humans experiencing similar crappy care.
