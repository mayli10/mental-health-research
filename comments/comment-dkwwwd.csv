It can take a long time but the only way out of this is through it. So yes, the voice will eventually disappear but you might need to be very patient. Or... it will disappear really quickly! Who knows? Gotta try! Good luck OP",False,False

When I first increased my calorie intake, the thoughts became more intrusive",False,False
