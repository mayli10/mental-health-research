Even when you actually have a thing that isnâ€™t psychosomatic caused by anxiety you can still be super anxious about health stuff (which you obv are aware of!)  Spider veins can be layered - my mom just got some done and it looks awesome, they are just gone! Iâ€™m sure youâ€™re gonna be fine. I am literally in anti anxiety meds for health anxiety so i reeeeeally get this hard and Iâ€™m sorry!!! Mint tea is actually a natural anxiolytic - itâ€™s a rescue anti-anxiety remedy I use in a pinch. Maybe see if that helps take the edge off the anxiety ðŸ’•",False,False
