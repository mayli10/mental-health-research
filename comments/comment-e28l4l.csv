I take seroquel, lithium, lamictal, and latuda now which all made me gain weight. But at the end of the day its calories in calories out, so I can control it pretty well. Good luck with it.",False,False

I was on lexapro in the past and I don't remember it causing any weight changes, but I was taking a bunch of other stuff at the same time. also many times when a medication ""causes"" weight gain it actually causes either an increase in appetite directly or a reduction in symptoms (like depression) that were suppressing appetite.  all that to say no side effect is guaranteed and many side effects are listed even when they are not common. I hope it helps you though!",False,False
