I do this with junk food, fruit, veggies, and cans of soup and whatnot. I also hide them in the fridge. Otherwise itâ€™s all gone by the middle of the week.   I also have a drawer full of snacks/candy/chips and 40% of it goes bad. I also give some away. I spend a lot of money on food and waste it. I just like the assurance of opening the drawer and seeing it full of food for some reason lol. Also for the high I feel from the self-control of not eating it.",False,False

There are so many baked goods in ziplock baggies hidden in the back of the bottom drawer in my freezer right now. I also have a binge stash in my room in a huge airtight container and a backpack of unopened binge foods, but those usually are just purchased by me anyway.  I just want to be able to eat (well, more like binge) them at my own leisure, without feeling like someone is going to take them away if I don't eat them right then and there.  I absolutely HATE and dread not having control over my food, and this helps calm that down A LOT (and it was a huge binge trigger of mine for basically all my ED life, so it really alleviates a lot of stress)  I suppose it developed from my people-pleasing childhood self not wanting to get caught and scorned at for eating junk food by my mother, but oh well, what can you do /shrug",False,False

So of I want to trust that those things will still be there when I go looking for them, they have to live in my room.  Tbh it makes it easier for me to binge in secret, which is a downside, but it's what we do.",False,False

As a result I have a relatively stocked fridge/pantry despite the fact that I'm not eating much. It's not like it would be hard for me to go to the store if I wanted something but I just love the feeling of being prepared and having things on hand. Luckily most of it is non-perishable or at least lasts quite awhile so I don't waste  much despite this. All the perishable stuff I buy is low-cal (fruits, veggies, almond milk), so I go through it much quicker.",False,False

It's strange.. It makes me feel somehow safe to do this.. Like I could totally gorge on all these goodies if I want to but I have control and don't.,False,False

I've developed a nasty sweet tooth lately (possibly because of increased exercise?) and I eat cake and pastries embarrassingly often, and it feels super shameful when people recognize that.",False,False

I hate when I plan to eat something and then suddenly it's not there because someone ate it. So I literally hide my food, in the fridge, in the freezer, in my room. The thing about it is that considering that I don't eat a lot (unless I'm binging) it's hard for me to fit in my cals all the snacks that I hide.  If there's a sudden nuclear bomb attack I got snacks for weeks, I'm good.",False,False
