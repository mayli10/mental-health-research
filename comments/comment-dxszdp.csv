It seems people can't have any kind of social event unless there's food involved...like, I really enjoy the company of those people but having food there makes me absolutely DREAD those events. My boyfriend keeps telling me it's fine if i ""just don't eat"" because ""no one will force me, care or notice"" even if they don't know I have and ed..and I totally get he's trying to make me feel comfortable and supported, but that's such a fucking lie/cope.  Not only would that be so rude to my friends who have kindly welcomed us into their home and cooked for everyone, it makes them and myself feel so uncomfortable and like a huge burden/waste of space.  So I just end up saying fuck it, drink like there's no tomorrow (ha i WISH) and just eat 'normally'. Then just feel like shit and restrict even more following this, until the next social gathering.",False,False

I restrict every day so when I go out and have a night out and we end up consuming 3 cran vodkas and 2 slices of pizza at 3 am (re: me last night) i can laugh and be like ‚Äúi guess ive been working out a bit‚Äù. Also on date nights my bf loves food and we always end up eating some gourmet stuff I don‚Äôt want to spoil that moment so I accomodate it.,False,False

Like if someone texts our group chat wanting to get dinner I'll say something along the lines of 'I actually just ate, but I'll still come out for a drink or meet up later'. It makes it so I don't have to sacrifice my social life just because it involves food but I'm not pressured to eat.",False,False

It's weird, because I try so hard to seem normal, and I generally order what everyone else does, but I feel as though I'm ""cheating"" on my ED, so to make up for it I usually eat my meal in disordered ways (certain ways of cutting food, chewing, picking, ect) Its really rough when you want nothing more than to not care about food as much as you do",False,False

I have a phobia of being seen eating in public or even purchasing food from a local store in case someone I know sees me üòÇ Also eating on my own terms means I can calculate all the calories perfectly and eat my safe foods as I please so that I get enough value for my daily allowed calories, eating 300-400 calories worth of rice cakes as a lunch would look rather strange to others!....",False,False

Im too scared of people knowing i have a problem and I would be lying if I said I don't enjoy eating normal. Yet the voice is still there and I feel bad for eating.
