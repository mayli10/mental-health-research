So in a 12 oz (standard small latte size) there‚Äôs probably 3 oz of espresso and like maybe 4-5 oz of actual milk in there. there‚Äôs even less in a cappuccino because cappuccinos have much more milk foam and less steamed milk.   also, those calories weren‚Äôt completely useless, because milk has protein and iron in it, which are very good for you. not to mention that cappuccinos and lattes are 100000x more delicious than straight black coffee imo. but i completely understand how you feel and have felt the same way many a time üòî  hope this helped a bit! üíóüíó",False,False
