Your comment could be construed as a ""tip or trick"" even though it wasn't worded as such- and we need to walk that line carefully.  My comment wasn't meant to be a dig on you/your experience, but to make it clear (like we do when people talk about purging) that there are negative side effects.  A side effect of taking some narcotic pain meds on an empty stomach is vomiting.  You don't want to vomit after oral surgery.",False,False

But also, theyâ€™re not going to recommend you not take your pain meds following a wisdom teeth removal if youâ€™re not ready to stomach food. But thank you for the concern!",False,False

Well, she didn't get a chance to share it with me. I went home still pretty groggy from sedation. I slept for a few hours, then woke up and went and rinsed the blood that was in my mouth. Swished &amp; spit and there went one of the clots. I got dry socket. It was awful.",False,False

No straws for a while and donâ€™t rinse your mouth yet! You also canâ€™t eat popcorn for like two weeks afterwards.   I had all my wisdom teeth taken out last year. I know your pain. Good luck!,False,False

Dry socket is some painful shit.  I also want to just put it out there, as easy as it makes restricting, your body is healing wounds in your body and you will want some nutrients to heal those wounds.  I just got my last wisdom tooth out 2 days ago, and I'm terrified of eating most solid foods, but I've found some really good soups and (if you aren't veggie/vegan) bone broth is really good.

Kind of dreading and looking forward to not being able to eat   Whatever you do, do NOT use a straw! The suction can dislodge blood clots and Iâ€™ve heard itâ€™s really painful.
