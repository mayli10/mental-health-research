She’s right about the common misconception that they glamorize EDs (she’s spot on about the “wannarexic” being frowned upon!) and I agree with her that the censorship on the more militant recovery sites is counter-intuitive.  She’s wrong about the movie thing though, i haven’t seen it but what she described and says never happens, it happened to me on a big forum in the early days. The moderator pm‘d me and tried to lure me into paying a large sum of money to unlock their secrets to some mysterious “recovery” plan where I could continue to lose weight even though I was already severely underweight. Also encouraging CR with some compelling evidence from early studies that were not mainstream knowledge until years later. There was something quite dark about it.   I guess that’s what she is talking about when she says there’s a danger of two vulnerable people becoming enablers for each other. I don’t know what the solution for that is, but I agree that banning the forums is not it.",False,False
