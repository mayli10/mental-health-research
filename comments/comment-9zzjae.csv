I think that you need to make an alternative twitter account. That is not normal.  If it helps, Parents made me eat a bowl of GF rice cereal with dairy free milk AND FUCKING COCONUT.  I would have easily said yes to the cereal but the dairy free milk AND the coconut too?  Too many calories. NOPE",False,False

I don't know how easy it is to talk to your parents, but if they're even slightly rational people, maybe saying something like, ""I know you're concerned about my habits.  For better or worse they're my habits at the moment, and there's not much anyone can do to to make me want to change them right now.  Forcing me to eat and going through my social media--which I know comes from love and care--actually feels alienating right now.""  If you're into harm reduction, you could explain that to them, too.  &amp;#x200B;",False,False

They will worry until they die, and that proves they love you.   They are scared. They just want you to be happy and safe. Being a parent is hard. If you can't explain directly to them that you want more privacy, you may want to have family therapy. It allows you to speak to the therapist in your own words, then your parents speak to the therapist in their own words, and the therapist will mediate, avoiding all the negative talks.   If you want to have private social media, you just need to create new ones with fully private settings. They are virtually impossible to find for someone who is not too used to it.   Don't be too harsh on your parents, just try to put yourself in their shoes. If you saw them having habits that you think are harmful to them, you would worry as well ðŸ’•",False,False

At the same time, I can also imagine how hard it must be for a parent to watch their child (even if they're an adult) lose weight in an ""unhealthy"" way.    Is there a more effective way for your parents to express their concern that would be more helpful for you?  If there is, can you communicate that to them?  This may give them a way to feel more useful and for you to feel less monitored and for all of you to be able to have your own agency and control over the situation.",False,False
