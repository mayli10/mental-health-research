Lots of drama in my family and lots of ‚Äúkeep your mouth shut.‚Äù Hence a big reason why I do not want to spend any amount of time with them. I hope you can get the help and support you need. You deserve to be happy and healthy.,False,False

Does your mom support and believe you? I believe you and I wish I could help.   I always feel alone for Christmas even when I had family. I lied to what family I have left this year and said we would be out of town. But instead my husband and I will be spending the day together and not doing a single thing we don‚Äôt want to. I wish they for you one day. Feel free to DM if you need a friend. Merry Christmas to you.,False,False
