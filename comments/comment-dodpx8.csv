It’s so triggering,False,True

I have to be really in the mood and it's mostly to put me off binging) but I HATE the ASMR portion of it. Like I don't want to hear your mouth sounds, I just want to live vicariously through you bc I like food porn. But if I mute it then it doesn't work as background noise and if I DON'T mute it then it's just SLLURRPPMMM MMF MGN SLOM FRURP SSLLLRRRUPPPP all the time and I want to crawl out of my SKIN.  Like I wish mukbangs and ASMR weren't so closely linked y'know. I just want to try and imagine it's me eating four bowls of ramen, not get stuck in a wet wind tunnel.  Also, while I don't deny that there are probably a lot of mukbang-ers (?) with disordered eating, I think there's also a lot of camera trickery going on. There are usually lots of small cuts during the filming process so I doubt they're eating EVERYTHING. Also their ""finished"" plates usually still have a lot of food on it that's just been rearranged so that it looks like they ate more of it. And the angle/lens of the camera makes the food look way bigger than it actually is so it can feel like they're eating more even when they're not.  TBH I think our own warped perception of food is causing us to project a bit. Like... I know some eating shows are WILD, or at least presented as such, but a lot of them I watch and I figure out the calories and it's like... okay, you're not even hitting 2k calories and you haven't even FINISHED everything, this is probably your OMAD so no wonder you can maintain that weight.",False,False

The behaviors that over here are seen as clearly disordered are normal dieting tricks there. I feel so bad for all the people with EDs in Korea that aren't seen as having a problem and therefore can't get help.,False,False

It's barbaric and disgusting. They keep popping up on my recommended vids all the time (youtube region thing I guess?) and just seeing the thumbnails makes me so mad. I'm even ashamed that they're perceived as part of Korean culture. I don't want to be associated with that madness :/",False,False

Assuming it's just purging, that's some insane stress on the body. The whole ASMR thing has been gross to me, too. I have always hated mouth sounds in general. Weird this is, though, that since I've eaten less, I don't mind chewing sounds as much. Strange.",False,False
