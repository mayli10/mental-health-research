Being high makes me either pass tf out or it makes my head tickle and Iâ€™m to distracted laughing and staring at the wall to think about eating. Now, being drunk is a whole different beast. I canâ€™t stop snacking when Iâ€™m drunk even when I can barely move my arm to pick up the food.",False,False

I like to hike high, no munchies in nature unless youâ€™re really tryna binge some random plants lol and I like to watch movies high. Nap high.
