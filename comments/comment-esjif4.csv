Do this four more times.   It's going to be okay. Everything is going to be okay.   Give yourself permission to feel what you are feeling, do not judge yourself for your thoughts. Close your eyes and watch them pass for a minute. Let them run wild but don't engage, just observe them.   You are going through a really tough time right now. Things are hard, but it will be okay. Sometimes when things are hard we do things that aren't healthy or good for us, but reaching out is a big step that some people aren't able to do, but you did that! Give yourself some praise and credit that you did something that was really hard!  Remember it's 1000% okay to cry. Cry as often as you need to. Crying is normal and healthy. Remember to drink water so you don't get dehydrated, or some tea even. A warm drink can be very relaxing.
