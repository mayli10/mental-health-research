Aww I’m glad you liked what I said. It’s so stressful not being able to track calories, but listening to your body’s cues and picking semi-healthy options won’t hurt. Vacation is about getting away from your town, and your brain! Screw it, just screw it and enjoy a little! A little dessert/favorite junk food and a drink or two won’t ruin your hard work.   I’m so sorry about your boyfriend’s hurtful comment. I don’t think people realize how even one little thing is enough to put someone in a tizzy. And he’s dating a person, not a body. He picked you for who you are! I’m sure he’s very attracted to you for many reasons and I highly doubt he puts in a lot of thought about your weight . He’s thinking of who you are, something you said or did, whether or not you want HIM, and why he can’t make you feel beautiful. I don’t know one guy that doesn’t hate when he can’t make his girlfriend feel amazing about herself",False,False

I did mention that gaining weight was an issue for me to him, and he says he doesn’t care, but I know he wishes I was smaller. Even if he won’t say so. Because he said so before, just once, and it was horrible to hear, and I haven’t gotten over it. No matter how many times he apologizes to me or says he thinks I’m beautiful I will never forget hearing what he said — it was probably half a year ago or so but it still stings like it was yesterday, and I don’t think I’ll ever be over it.",False,False

If you’re not ready to talk about your BED, you could mention the petite gone wild and weight gain attributing to your sex life issues. Otherwise you’ll be at a stalemate and may not be able to recover from your issues.  And hey weight gain happens. Don’t beat yourself up. Your body is trying it’s best to take care of you but is just a bit confused by your BED. Think of your body as your home. No matter where on the globe you are, you are home. Your body is your home. It can’t be possessed by anyone else but you.   Gosh I have the best book suggestion- it’s where I got that idea from!! I can’t remember the name of it to save my life. It gave me perspective on what the human body is. There’s a whole chapter about the human form and it’s connection to spirituality. I’ll edit it in if I remember. I’m honestly pretty baked so if I’m rambling and not making sense, I apologize.",False,False

My SO is in to curvy/busty/big booty women on the high end of normal BMI. Guess how well that settled with my ED? I have a passable ass, but am so flat chested I have to shop in the adolescent section for bras. I am at the rock bottom of normal BMI.     How does it settle? It destroyed me for a while. Then I figured fuckit. He can find someone else if it is that big of a deal and he is very complimentary of the way I look so it must not be a big deal.     I also see it like this- let's say you live in a beautiful place, say Hawaii where it is absolutely gorgeous. You love it there. Never would want to move. Does that mean you are never going to take a vacation to check out the mountains of Colorado? The Grand Canyon in Arizona? No. Of course not! That would be silly! Why? Because they are different, and different can be fun.     To further drive my point. If you were a tiny teen shape how do you know he wouldn't be looking up ""petite busty thicc milfs?"" Sometimes it is about the variety itself rather than a specific type.",False,False

My boyfriend likes smaller girls and girls who look young — and I’m a year older than him :/ I guess my saving grace is I still look like a teenager? Idk.  I was on his laptop using reddit one day, and the porn subs he looks at include petite gone wild and stuff like that, and it really gets to me since I gained like 20 pounds since we started dating after my BED came back haha. He doesn’t know about my ED yet (he knows I used to be anorexic but doesn’t know about my BED) and I don’t think I’m gonna be telling him any time soon. No matter how much he tries to convince me that he thinks I’m beautiful, I know I don’t look how his “ideal” girl would look.  At one point I just couldn’t take my shirt off in front of him anymore, and it really upsets him now because it’s been months and I still just... can’t. I physically can’t or I’ll cry or freak out or feel a panic attack coming on and I can’t even let him know how bad it is for me because I’m too scared of how he’ll react. BED has honestly almost ruined my sex life with him and I’m still working on it.  I tell myself it’ll get better when I’m skinny but :/",False,False

He's mistaken for a woman a lot by other people - I am 100% gay.  I find him VERY attractive, and tell him so very often. I am extremely insecure and I tell him a little about my bulimia, my dysmorphia, and my dysphoria, and he's always very reassuring that regardless of who he's been with in the past and whatever porn actors look like, he finds me attractive and even finds parts of me that I HATE about my body attractive as they are, even if he supports my fitness goals to lose weight.  It takes a lot of open and honest communication!!! As terrifying as it is, your partner knowing about your ED can help. I hate him knowing when I'm relapsing because I don't want to be stopped but he's supportive of me when I express the desire to be better",False,False

I struggle to have confidence or take initiative, and for the longest time i didn’t relate this to my ED but I know it must play a part; since I don’t view myself as thin or attractive or pretty 90% of the time, it makes me insecure in sexual terms so I feel like I can’t be sexy or seductive.  This sucks for both me and him, since obviously confidence is a turn on ™ for some guys (including my bf!) and I WISH I was more confident and happy with myself to be better. But I’m not.   This is rambly a maybe more of a vent than advice, so I’m sorry if that’s the case. All in all, I can begin to understand how you’re feeling and how you feel insecure in what your bf might want. For what it’s worth, I know my boyfriend has reassured me multiple times about me being enough and hot and sexy so many times over; yet I still struggle sometimes. It’s likely the same with your partner, that to then you’re the centre of the universe and there’s no one else they’d rather be sleeping with. our minds are just bitches and play tricks on us to make us feel like we’re not enough.   ^(oh god this comment is such a mess I’m sorry)",False,False
