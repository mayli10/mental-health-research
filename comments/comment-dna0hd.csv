Given our BMIs are similar, I hope we can continue to remind ourselves that we are not fat and come to a stage where we are at peace with our bodies. I'm working hard to do this everyday to try and uplift myself and not talk myself down like that.",False,False

It's possible that someone at that BMI could have low muscle mass and be out of shape due to poor nutrition/lack of muscle-building exercise, but it's unlikely that anyone with a BMI of 18 would be considered by others to be fat.   At any rate, you are good enough as you are. Treat yourself with kindness and give your body the respect it deserves—you only get one and it'll be your home for the whole time you're here. Please take care of yourself.",False,False
