I usually call myself recovered on most days and feel super great being a very average happy healthful weight then I realize ‚Äúwoah yeah I share plenty of symptoms with everyone here... time to rethink what it means to have disordered eating again for your sanity and try a new perspective‚Äù   It helps to have kind of a place to learn and understand..   The line between what defines a behavior as disordered can be pretty blurred sometimes. Some folks on dieting forums do things some people here mentioned and you‚Äôd be surprised how normalized even things like fasting can seem to others in fitness circles so it‚Äôs hard to contextualize at times.   Maybe I‚Äôm giving people the benefit of the doubt, but at least in my case. I‚Äôll admit... yeah it‚Äôs hard to tell what‚Äôs ‚Äúnormal‚Äù very very often.",False,False

For example, a fat person skipping meals or eating a tiny salad with no protein and minuscule nutrients would often be praised for being 'healthy'.  This is a subreddit where people with eating disorders come to vent and share the thoughts they bottle up all day, every day. Who do we help, exactly, if we started accusing each other of 'showing off for anorexic brownie points' when more likely somebody was simply searching for validation they they are indeed 'sick enough', and that their disorder should be taken seriously despite not precisely fitting the bill for what other people think an eating disorder should be?  Of course people HERE don't think their symptoms aren't symptoms - but that's not what this is about. I hope I don't sound harsh. I'm aware this subreddit is filled with a lot of very sick people, myself included. I also think it shouldn't turn into a place for egging each other on with our unhealthy eating habits. But I don't think accusing people of being 'show-offs' about their potentially life-threatening disorders is helpful. I hope you understand.",False,False
