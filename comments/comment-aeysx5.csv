But I am an avid runner and most days I wonder if I just stopped working out all together it would get easier to drop ANY pounds.

I went to an amusement Park last year for a few days in a row and did a ton of walking. My weight wouldn’t go back down for weeks and this was when I still had plenty to lose so it was extra frustrating. ,False,False

My body has been a train wreck for weeks and is not behaving the way it’s supposed to and it’s making me more and more crazy and I’m resorting to more and more risky behavior. ,False,False
