Interestingly enough what you described is what my exact thought were (having a heart attack and dying). I should be getting an appointment with a therapist for anxiety soon so Iâ€™m hoping that there is help available. Thank you for the kind words ðŸ’•ðŸ’•ðŸ’•,False,True

Anxiety is a horrible bitch and can give nasty physical symptoms. My mom suffers from anxiety and went to the ER cause she legit thought she was having a heart attack and dying, but it was just a really bad anxiety attack that manifested into physical symptoms  Whatever it is, you can get through it, and youâ€™ll get better ðŸ’“ ",False,False
