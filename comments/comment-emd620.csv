I guess because it’s well documented that diet soda is “used” in EDs for “abusing liquids” (filling up on them to avoid food) and as a replacement for the real thing. Given that connotation and because OP’s therapist specializes in EDs, it seems like a weird choice. I’m guessing that most ED dietitians don’t encourage drinking diet soda, but idk.  Other things I’d compare it to just to put it in a scale: therapist eating food — that would definitely be weird, no? Doesn’t the introduction of food and bev make a space less safe for patients with EDs? Or, if a medical doctor came in with a soda, diet or not. That would feel weird and unprofessional. While you’re with a patient, it seems like a sound decision to refrain from drinking your soda, even if it’s a drink that lots of people drink.  I can imagine fixating on that soda quite a bit. Yes, I get that my triggers are my own, but it would be nice if they were respected by my therapist when I’m seeking help for them. There are several people commenting that they’d react negatively too, so I’m sure OP isn’t the only one their therapist bothers with this.",False,False

To repeat my example it would be highly in appropriate for a licensed alcohol and drug counselor to take even prescription medication in front of a patient. Even over the counter when you are dealing with drug addiction. Why would a person who's sole job is counseling eating disorders drink a DIET drink in front of a client especially in session?,False,False

I know ED people are obsessed with Diet Coke, but it's a soda. She's not chugging a bottle of laxatives or body shaming anyone. I feel like this is an unusual enough trigger that OP should probably at least mention it before we start calling the therapist out. (I also think your comparison is a bit much.)",False,False

And you should tell her it is. Therapy is supposed to be your safe space and she couldn't be more out of place sipping that diet soda then a Licensed alcohol and drug counselor sipping a martini in session. Highly inappropriate.  And even if she changes the fact that she is so dense she doesnt know that coke zero could be a trigger means she probably isnt that insightful and you could do better as far as therapists are concerned.,False,False
