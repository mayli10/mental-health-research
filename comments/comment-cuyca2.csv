I use it on my face, lips, body, everywhere. I buy plain cocoa butter, melt it down and combine it with a couple cattier oils. Once it cools, I whip it until it looks like frosting and a small amount will last me for months. Alternatively, you can just look for body butters. I apply it after a shower and then as needed throughout the day if I‚Äôm really dry.   Sweet almond oil is my favorite when it‚Äôs warmer out or if my skin isn‚Äôt overly dry.",False,False

Bath oil to put on skin right after shower/bath. Dont rub your skin to dry off but pat it dry with a towel.  Also the thicker lotions that are sold in tubs are better for hydration than pump lotions. If really desperate/broke the cheapest and most effective skin moisturizer is crisco ( yes the stuff that normal people cook and bake with). It will stain sheets/clothes but is works great",False,False
