I hope this doesn‚Äôt make you more scared but my SO broke his tooth on an apple seed and left it without going to the dentist. He had on and off pain for a few months. Then sixth months later he woke up with a swollen cheek and severe pain. I forced him to go to the dentist then, but as he left it for so long he needed to take a round of antibiotics to get rid of the infection/abscess and come back in two weeks later to have the rotting tooth pulled.   I‚Äôm not a dentist or doctor but I think if you go now you will have a better chance of saving the tooth and you will get the anxiety over with sooner. This could be a wake up call for your health if that‚Äôs affecting your teeth but maybe that could be something that will help you make small changes in the right direction.  Regardless I hope everything goes well for you and I‚Äôm sending you positivityüíïüíï",False,False
