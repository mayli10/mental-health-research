I read this LPT a few weeks ago and I keep thinking about it because my job is slowly becoming unbearable: “if you have to wait till your boss is in a good mood to ask a question then you’re working in a toxic environment”   I really hate my job but I don’t have many other options and I’m making pretty good money.   He’s made some horrible comments about my weight. Like has straight up asked me if I’m anorexic in front of others. Makes jokes about how I eat the same salad everyday. Asked what kind of meds I’m on (I had to take a medical leave when I had a suicide attempt last year and I eventually opened up to him about it because he told me a story of his own trauma when he was my age so I thought he would get it but I’m now finding out he’s an ass), and he’s told me I’ve changed since my attempt and I need to fix myself. The past few months have been hellish and my ed has been full blown.   I’m fucking exhausted. He scheduled me three doubles this week even though I’m such a horrible employee and he is on my ass about everything I do. It’s such a mind fuck. It honestly wouldn’t be bad to just get fired lol.",False,True

ED brain: Obviously this would not have happened if you were skinnier, time to not eat! Also ED brain: God you’re annoying, everyone is sick of you, why don’t you just sit in your room and eat everything in your house bc it’s all you’re good for anyway 🙃",False,False
