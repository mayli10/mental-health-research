I‚Äôm just trying to take it day by day. I like the part you added about not getting set back to zero if I do it too. I need to remember that recovery is not all or nothing",False,True

Ok, I made it x days and today I purged. Let‚Äôs see if we can get through tomorrow. Once I stopped thinking about it in length of time streaks and instead think of one day just one day it got easier (when in recovery mind).   On /r/stopdrinking they say IWNDWYT, for I will not drink with you today.   Take it one day at a time. If you purge, you‚Äôre not set back to 0 because you have the knowledge and skills you gained during those xx amount of days. As with all of recovery. Focus on the now.   ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è",False,False
