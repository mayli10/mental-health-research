It's awesome youre taking steps to keep from isolating too much. I'd mirror the comments other users mentioned about speaking with a counselor. It took me years to muster up making an appointment but after I finally got going I was really glad I did.   You are enough, but all the same, best of luck in all your goals! I hope you can get back to feeling healthier and mentally reframe some things to help you get to a better place. ",False,False

I do see a therapist currently but have never brought up my disordered eating habits, likely because I‚Äôve been trying to tell myself they weren‚Äôt a big deal. I appreciate the support.

I do see a therapist currently for other things (depression, anxiety, OCD) but have kept my disordered eating habits to myself. I have had similar thoughts about the diet groups too and have found myself unsubscribing from groups that triggered thoughts or desires to binge/purge. ",False,True

If it‚Äôs at all possible, seek help from a therapist AND a registered dietician. If you‚Äôre a student, your university probably has free or low cost options. If you are working, find out if your place of employment has an EAP. Both are short term solutions as there will be session limits, but it‚Äôs a start and will give you time to look into more long term options.  2. Stay away from dieting/fitness groups. There are plenty of supposedly healthy communities on Reddit and elsewhere that focus on specific diets/calorie limits/exercise regimes/etc. While they‚Äôre not all bad, I see a whole lot of misinformation being spouted off as fact in these groups. They‚Äôre also often quite extreme in their viewpoints. It‚Äôs a slippery slope even for non-disordered people, but even more dangerous if you‚Äôre prone to ED behaviours. Tbh, I think they promote disordered eating a hell of a lot more than ‚Äúpro ed‚Äù communities do. If you want support/accountability to lose weight in a healthy manner, that‚Äôs what your dietician and therapist will be for. Turn to friends or family who you can trust for support. But don‚Äôt kid yourself into thinking that ‚Äúhealthy weight loss‚Äù groups are a safe choice. They‚Äôre not. They‚Äôre just a breeding ground for a different set of rules and obsessions.  3. I know you want to lose more weight, and I‚Äôm not saying that you can‚Äôt do that eventually, but right now it‚Äôs really important to focus on getting your mind right. Now is the time to learn healthy coping mechanisms, develop a healthy relationship with food, and learn how to live a sustainable and healthy lifestyle. I know it‚Äôs easier said than done, but your weight can‚Äôt be your top priority. Focus on your health. Take care of yourself.  It won‚Äôt be easy, but I‚Äôm rooting for you. The sooner you get help, the better off you‚Äôll be. Good luck üíï",False,False

However, not everyone develops a full blown eating disorder, which it sounds like you have. You may not want to hear this, but if you want to have a normal relationship with food you need to seek medical/professional help ASAP because your behaviors are serious.    My advice would be to find a therapist (who specializes in eating disorders if possible) and a dietician. They can help get you out of this cycle. However, it is possible and perhaps even likely you will have to at least temporarily stop trying to lose weight - your restriction is fueling your binge eating. I know that‚Äôs probably not what you want to hear, but it‚Äôs the truth. I hope my comment does not sound judgmental or like I‚Äôm scolding - it just really struck a chord with me because my stats were similar to yours when I developed severe bulimia. The weight loss is not worth the misery this can spiral into. I wish I could go back in time and stop it before it got to that point. Best of luck with everything.",False,False

I wouldn‚Äôt think it‚Äôs uncommon but I don‚Äôt have the statistics on it   Are you looking for help? I find therapy really helpful and connecting, and group therapy especially being connective in feeling less alone  I get still wanting to lose weight but I wonder if in this current state it isn‚Äôt possible to do it in a healthy manner (although to be fair you might not care). I do not want to or mean to push recovery on you but there‚Äôs a fair chance that if your body does naturally want to lose weight, it will if you consistently follow a meal plan and don‚Äôt end up bingeing and purging as often  Here for you, OP",False,False
