You‚Äôd need something like 200-250g of salt in one go to reach 50% morbidity (meaning, half the people would die and half would survive). That said, it is enough to cause yourself some side effects. As others have said, drink plenty of salt-free water, but you also need to get some potassium and other electrolytes into yourself. Bananas and the lower sodium form of Pedialyte are probably your best/easiest accessible bets.   Obviously, if you start feeling poorly, you should head to the ER/A&amp;E.",False,False
