But man, I used to restrict so easy and now I log my lunch and it’s like fuck there goes half of my limit for the day!! I guess I have to start being really strict. Fml",False,True

It was the breaking point, and that’s when I had to get serious again.  I started by cutting out all the chips, sweets, and junk that I was eating. Completely. Which may or may not work for you, since everyone is different. I replaced them with fruits and other low-cal snacks.   After a couple weeks passed and I got used to eating differently, I started calorie counting, exercising lightly, and averaging around 1,200 each day. It became obsessive and I started restricting to 800 near the end of the summer, and by mid-September I was down to 115. I’m not saying this is the healthiest route to go, but the weight shed relatively fast and I was still able to binge every few weeks. I also let myself have days when I could eat whatever I wanted, “healthy” or not, but stay within my calorie limit.  I got down to my lowest weight in early November, which was around 108 lbs, and have been maintaining at ~110 ever since. I’ve had to deal with a lot issues though: period loss, hair loss, vitamin deficiencies, feeling lightheaded, all that jazz. I would advise you to take multivitamins and keep your restriction to a safe, healthy amount where you know you won’t have to go through all of those health issues. I’m sure you can do it! Feel free to pm me if you have any questions",False,False

I could try to get the former under control but the later is an important part of my relationship and I don’t think I want to give that up. My bf stays fit as hell even with all the going out to eat because he works out every day :(,False,True

If I wasn’t hungry than I had to wait. After a couple days it was easier to control it. Also, I’ve been eating fruit and vegetables out side of my one meal a day.   I’m a hundred pounds more than you. Eating is a huge problem for me and I’m working on losing but I just can’t seem to say no to food. I ate an entire extra large pizza by myself this week in an hour :(",False,False
