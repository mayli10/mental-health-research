I’m having by far the worst episode I’ve ever had and I’ve lost  (TW NUMBERS) 20lbs But I’m stiiiiiiilll OW, so.... I mean let’s see how I’m feeling when I’m UW, huh????",False,False

TW numbers below:  At a BMI of 12, I didn't feel like I would be sick enough until I was at a BMI of 10.  Now I'm at a BMI around 18, and I feel like I need to be back to my LW before I can start seeking professional help again. It's just another lie your ED will tell you, you will never be low enough, so don't hesitate to seek help and recovery now.",False,False

More along the lines in how long the relapse has been. I’m pretty confident in being “sick” enough or whatever; but this relapse has only been like 2 1/2 months and I’m already getting pushed to “recover” while my last however many relapses would be like. A year, minimum.   So I’m like, how can I even be that bad if it’s barely been 3 months. Like whatever about my resting heart rate and constant near fainting slash actual fainting and perpetual brain fog and inability to process 60% of the foods I do eat. It hasn’t even been half a year yet! Whatever.",False,False
