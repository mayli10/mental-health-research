Just because you don't fit into a perfect box doesn't make your illness any less real. Just reading your last two paragraphs tells me that. A normal person would probably mindlessly eat a snack because they were too hungry to wait, then eat the sushi, and not think about it for the rest of the day and forget about it by the next morning and carry on with their day as if nothing had happened.  The behaviors are mostly the symptoms or manifestations of our ED's; it's the thought processes that are the real issue (barring accidentally killing yourself through starvation, stomach rupture, etc.)",False,False

I actually sorta just had a mini binge.  I mean, IDK what qualifies a binge but my parents went to go get dinner food and I just couldn't wait any longer and I had like 500 calories worth of stuff in a very short amount of time, and they're going to go and get sushi for me, and I'm getting 3 rolls which will probably be around 1000 more calories.

And..more often than not, by the time three months hits and you've been ""planning"" b/p sessions weekly, if you try to quit, you won't be able to. It's usually an illusion of control. You think you're in control of it until you try to quit and realize it has control of you.  And again, just so you know, a person could be anorexic and eat like 1500+ Calories a day.

I'm *guessing* it was because I was drinking heavily at the time? BUT HE DIDN'T EVEN ACKNOWLEDGE MY SUGGESTION! He clearly heard me. He should've at least explained his reasoning for not wanting me on medication? If I knew I could get medication, but I had to quit drinking for a few weeks first, I could totally do that. I wouldn't need to self-medicate if I had medication. I quit alcohol 'cold turkey' for 4 months to lose weight, during which I lost 25% of my body weight, and only started drinking again because I was home alone for a week (like I'll be again this year), then my other cat unexpectedly died, which led to me binge drinking again.

Funny how you're told that self-medicating is bad for you, but when you ask for actual medication, your suggestion is not even **acknowledged**, so you leave without medication, without knowing why you weren't given medication. Self-help booklet? Fuck off. If I could help myself, I wouldn't have asked for help. This was almost 2 years ago now, but I'm still so bitter. I haven't been to a doctor since, lmao.   2. Also I'm bitter that my mum decided she'd go on holiday this year for a week, without warning me first, and telling me about it ON MY BIRTHDAY. LIKE GEE THANKS. I'm REALLY going to enjoy being home alone for an entire fucking week. Totally not going to sleep with a knife under my bed. Hope I don't stab myself when I, inevitably, get drunk to cope with being home alone. I'll have to get my grandma to look after the dog. I can look after a cat, but not a dog. She wouldn't get walked daily if I was left to look after her, and that isn't fair. My grandma will walk her daily.   3. So the NHS App is finally working, but my GP Practice hasn't made it so any appointments can made through the app (yet?) They probably never will. Great. Not that I particularly want to try and ask for help again, but it'd be nice to have the option. And I can't ring them because of my fucking anxiety and social awkwardness.",False,False
