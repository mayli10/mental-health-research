My waist is 24. Their pants stretch to a size 2 which is a size UK 6 so yeah I shouldn’t expect their pants to fit me. I did say ‘I don’t know why I thought it’d fit me’ in the OP.   It’s clear your intentions with this comment was just to make me feel bad about myself because you knew that I said I didn’t know why I thought it’d fit me.  As it turns out, I have recently brought two Brandy Melville dresses. One of them is the same material as the Karla dress and one is a flowy velvet material. They both fit me perfectly. I haven’t lost any weight. I will continue to buy clothes from Brandy Melville because I like them and I have a wide collection of Brandy clothes, including dresses that you say can’t possibly fit me because of my size, that fit me perfectly.",False,True

But Brandy Melville clearly states that their clothes size range from 000-3. You clearly arent, so I dont get why you're bashing this clothing line for not carrying your size? Just buy your clothes somewhere else and quit complaining.",False,False

I have big boobs and sometimes I'm an AU8 (US4) if the clothes have stretch, but sometimes if they don't I barely fit into an AU12 (US8), which is ridiculous because then it ends up hanging off me in other places and looks atrocious. I swear, some brands like don't understand how women's bodies are proportioned?? They go, ok small size so we will give no allowance for boobs/butt/back which is crazy - you can be thin and still have some boobs or a broad back at least, most women aren't straight up and down.  High-waisted jeans are the worst for me - looser pants are ok, so I still buy high-waisted work pants but I have given up on tight high-waisted jeans, it's like they don't account for your butt at all so I buy a waist size that is 2 sizes too big at least and then I have to wear a super tight belt. You can be skinny and still have boobs and a butt!! US6 is small, it's just stupid brands proportioning their clothes terribly (although mentally I often feel fat because of my boobs and butt despite being thin besides them, so I know how you feel).",False,False

So funny that you just posted this. I'm the same size as you roughly, and I'm just glad I can fit SOME stuff now. Just bought 2 tops, and I already own 1 top and a pair of the black stripey pants. Would love to eventually fit into one of their dresses. ",False,False

I was going through the agonizing pain of trying on swimsuits at target, needless to say I’m going to start restricting harder aswell. It’s truly a vicious cycle. ",False,False
