I always round up anyway but sometimes I'll just add a few hundred just in case because I don't trust myself or calorie counters.

Sometimes it‚Äôs really hard for me to tell if I‚Äôve ‚Äúbinged‚Äù and eaten an absurd amount of food or if I just ate what the normal recommended daily intake would be for the average person because I‚Äôm so used to trying to consume as little as possible it‚Äôs thrown my perception of what a normal amount of food is completely out of whack.,False,False

I think my poor organisational skills and tenuous grasp of basic maths have made my disorder worse/more entrenched. I estimate calories and have a sporadic, ill-planned diet, and I know I must be overestimating judging by weight loss, but I can't reason myself out of it. I feel like if I was more rigid and exact I wouldn't have this problem, maybe I'd maintain, but who am I kidding üíÖ",False,False

To feel safe, if I get something that isnt weighed or prepackaged, I just round up to the next hundred. So if I ate how much you ate, i personally would round it up to 600. I'm not saying this to freak you out at all, but rounding up may help you quiet that part of your brain that's saying you ate more than you did",False,False
