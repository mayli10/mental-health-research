I tested the 3 lb weights on my body weight scale... not food scale. Iâ€™m not sure of another example of something to weigh on a body weight scale ,False,False

I have 2, 3 lb weights and my scale said 6.0 when I weighed them together.  Maybe try finding something youâ€™d know the exact weight of and try again   Like a nickel is 5 grams for example... thatâ€™ll only Help you on a small scale so unless youâ€™re buying weed I donâ€™t see this being helpful ðŸ˜¹   But maybe find something thatâ€™s universally a heavier weight and see which Is more accurate ",False,False
