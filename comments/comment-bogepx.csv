During the time period I have written about above, I was never conscious about my body or eating (until damn near everyone around me started mentioning it). It just wasn’t something I paid attention to.  There is a key component that I had left out of the above. From the religious tradition I was raised in, I had come to the conclusion that hell was an external, literal place of torment. I believed that any who had not “repented and received Christ” would be in hell. During this year mentioned above, this became very concerning for me.  I would obsess about sharing “the gospel” with people. I’d spend extended periods of time in my truck, lying down, weeping because i thought that everyone was going to go to hell (myself included). I would drive out to the cemetery and a lake outside of town; id sit out there and cry because I didn’t know what to do.   This helps provide context, I suppose. It was so puzzling to me how none of this seemed to bother those around me. How my family could not be bothered by this. This also was manifested with the food thing. But for me, it was never about food. My family made it all about food though, and it eventually developed into a food thing.   And I feel that when people see me now, they’d be like “oh, that was bound to happen,” or “I knew that was going to happen.” I would disagree with this sentiment though. It’s like, well, have you ever soaked an egg in vinegar?  When you soak an egg in vinegar for an extended period of time, the outer shell becomes very soft and sponge-like. The substance seems to alter, change, but the essence of the egg is still in tact. It doesn’t become something else; it is still an egg. So, when people try to drop it and watch it bounce (due to its sponge-like outer layer), it can only stand so much — it is an EGG. It’s like someone trying to bounce an egg over and over and over again, and it finally breaks then they say, “oh, well that was bound to happen.” It’s still an egg.   [the egg analogy doesn’t make much sense, sorry. It was my fifth grade science project and a parent ended up breaking the egg at the end of the science fair.]   Sorry for my tirade(s).",False,True

I know your eating habits will be of the most interest to people but to be honest the many mentions of your religion are what I find very intriguing. You have obviously been doing a lot of soul-searching these first few years of college and trying to find something that you felt secure putting your faith in. I think the whole ""questioning everything"" and embarking on this spiritual quest stirred up a lot of unknowns for you-- an existential crisis perhaps-- and it seems to me your disordered eating manifested itself as a way to adhere to some self-imposed ethical and moral system in order to quell some of those insecurities and feel more in control. There are a lot of cases in history of religion and disordered eating/fasting as a sign of piousness, I'm curious if this one video triggered this to come about or if this is more linked to your religious beliefs and how your life choices align to them. Anyway, this was very interesting to read and thank you for sharing your story.",False,False

It is more of the foundation(s) of what I’m not experiencing. If they makes any sense.   Essentially what was no issue at all developed into a massive issue — largely in thanks to the irrational thoughts I had as a result of this bizarre experience.   It took a long time for it to actually start happening though.,False,True

I am however curious to get some clarification on aspects of your post that you haven't really mentions, if you don't mind me asking questions I feel like I might be able to help further.    \- Are you concerned that what you are eating right now is unusual? and if so is it the types of food or the over all calorific intake?    \- Is part of the changes you have made to your diet been consciously because you want to loose weight or continue to be the size you are now?  \- Do the restrictions you have put on your diet make you feel good, in control or superior to others?   \- What brought you to the Proed and the EDanonymous subreddits?   \- Do you think you have an eating disorder or do you think perhaps you are not making the healthiest choices with what you eat?",False,False

I’m in a very weird place right now, and it feels like I’ve dug myself into a hole that I’ll never be able to get myself out of. I’m frustrated at the decisions I’ve made, ones I would not have made had one minute thing gone differently.   I guess I just felt like venting. I was at work, too, doing nothing, so that helps.

I totally get not wanting to eat animal products. I've been vegan for over 2 years now and vegetarian for 8 years before that. There are healthy ways to fuel your body and gain weight, if you are interested.   I can't really comment on the religious part, sorry. I'm an atheist. Perhaps you could go to a church and talk to the leader there (not sure your denomination, sorry. Priest/minister/pastor?).   It sounds like you have a loving and supportive family. That's really nice. I could see how it could also feel overwhelming, having so many people fuss over you. I know I would hate that.",False,False
