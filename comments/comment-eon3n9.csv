Like, I’ll forget to finish chewing before I try to swallow and end up choking. Or I’ll chew for wayyyy too fucking long. Or I’ll look back and forth from my plate to my utensils and back again, trying to figure out how exactly I’m supposed to get the food into my mouth.   And yes, I straight up just cannot swallow sometimes. That’s a relatively new thing for me but it’s been happening quite frequently.",False,False

Or also sometimes my mouth just feels so dry that chewing food is unpleasant. Like everything seems to turn to thick paste in my mouth. Any appetite I had vanishes. It doesn't even seem linked to dehydration or anything, my body just hates the idea of eating sometimes.",False,False
