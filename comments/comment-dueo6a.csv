I think you're also at increased risk of injuries. I would seriously consider increasing your calories if you are doing any type of distance running.,False,False

I loved running but I restricted and I thought I got help before I would be forced to stop running but it was too late and now I can’t do it at all. My heart rate is way too low and you can have all sorts of issues like passing out and it’s really difficult to be at your peak in running when you’re not eating enough. I would say if you really love running and don’t want to be forced to quit see a nutritionist or therapist as soon as possible because restricting will take that away,False,False

But yeah, easier said than done of course.",False,False
