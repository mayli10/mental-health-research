Recovery and the process of recovery sucks. It's hard, uncomfortable, and sometimes feels impossible. But it's sooooo so worth it in the end. It's like how chemotherapy is painful and sucks and feels pointless sometimes for cancer patients, but in the end, they can often go back to living a normal life.",False,False

I'm about a month into recovery and while I'm not weight restored yet, I've started noticing that I have more and more moments where I forget about food. I'm still obsessing A LOT but I feel the grip of my ED loosening each day as I maintain a higher intake + gain weight. Obviously everyone's recovery goes differently but I would say the key for me is consistency. I often feel like giving up because at beginning you're still obsessed, hungry and worst of all, you're gaining. It feels like the worst situation, but it really is the only way to go. Good luck!",False,False
