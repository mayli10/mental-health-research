BMI 13.5, eating only an apple for breakfast, banana for lunch and a bit of rice for dinner. Afraid of most foods, afraid to gain or maintain weight.  After 3 or 4 years progressed into drug use and stopping solid foods completely, only would drink skim milk with 7 teaspoons of sugar in it, several times a day (no solids for over 12 months)  Shortly after I started CS, that became a 15 year long habit, and was still around even during my phases of weight restored “recovery”.  20+ years in, it’s become hard-wired. I don’t even know when I’m doing it now. I eat whatever I like whenever I like, but I know something must be up because I’m significantly underweight and I have severe body dysmorphia.   It becomes a lot more insidious the older it gets. Harder to recover because I’m no longer in touch with what it’s doing, it’s mostly subconscious 😬",False,False
