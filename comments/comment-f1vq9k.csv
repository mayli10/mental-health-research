(I really believe that actions can change mindsets; repeatedly challenging myself to eat certain fear foods has made me genuinely more okay with eating them yay) So basically the guilt wouldn’t last forever if I commit to taking better care of myself.  Whereas if I continue with overexercising (and other bad behaviors lol) I’m not challenging my disordered thoughts. And I’ll hence continue feeling guilty/disordered forever.   I also try to keep myself busy with other things that are important or meaningful, in the time I would otherwise be exercising, eg. actually catching up with my uni work rip. I’d still feel kinda guilty, but at least I can remind myself that I did spend the time productively on something that genuinely benefits me, which helps me feel better.   Big thing for me is also to remind myself that underrating/overexercising inevitably leads to bingeing for me lol.... and I hate bingeing it feels awful and horrifying and ultimately makes me gain weight lmao. So in many ways it would feel better to eat more/consistently and exercise less simply to avoid bingeing.   Good luck and stay strong &lt;3",False,False
