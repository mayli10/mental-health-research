ewn4ma2,t3_c0bzt5,t1_ewdyyav,Written23,1,2019-08-11 19:06:54,/r/EDAnonymous/comments/c0bzt5/my_therapist_said_something_really_triggering/ewn4ma2/,"Yes, 100% find a new one. A therapist is supposed to challenge negative beliefs, but not dismiss concerns/beliefs/worries bc that gets you nowhere. Like , you should be able to confide anything in your therapist and no worry that they're just going to be dismissive, even if they're trying to 'make you feel better'. Statements like ""Well at least...."" Or ""At least you don't..."" are very dismissive.  I'd really try to find a new therapist if you can. It can be hard, but this site ( https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/therapists ) lets you put in your demographics and search for available ones in your area.  You can contact different therapists on there and see if they are in your price range/take your insurance/seem like someone you would connect with.  It is super important that you don't settle for a therapist who isn't doing anything to help you. Think of this as a service they are providing you (as well as you needing to also put in the work to take the help they give and apply it to you daily life), so if they're not serving you a purpose, it's best to find someone new.   https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/therapists",False,False

Thank you for replying by the way. It means a lot. I brought up the comment to him and he said he understood. But today, actually, he said something about how I need to remember to be grateful for thing (I am already v. grateful for my life and feel I don't deserve the good things!) and he said one thing I could be grateful for is my ""health."" I was like...blown away that he considers me to be ""healthy"" and challenged him on this. He said ""do you have trouble viewing yourself as a healthy person?"" And I was like, let's talk about what ""healthy"" means; I am significantly underweight and still very much caught up in the disorder. He goes, ""well it's not like you have cancer!"" And I am still just completely blown away.  What did you do when your therapist said that? Did you find a different one? Thanks again.",False,True

The first time I tried to seek treatment I poured my heart out to a therapist and his response was ""You're a pretty young woman, you don't need to do all that."" .... So yeah. Sometimes therapists are oblivious/don't know how to help with ED/don't realize how deep this goes, like mentally. Either confronting him or finding a new therapist is the best you can do. You deserve better.",False,False
