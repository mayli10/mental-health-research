It's used as a gaslight to enable eating disorders infinitely.  It slips into everyday conversations and people (who are underweight/emaciated or what have you) become judgemental of food they see people eating  They are selectively blind and deaf to the fact that they're too thin and they have eating disorders. They pretend they're stupid and pick the eyes out of things, like your chocolate cake, which is perfectly okay.  You shouldn't need therapy and all of this self-talk after eating chocolate cake ffs because you collided with a mental patient on the loose. At a point it becomes mentally ill to be still lecturing/judging people, obesity hype is no excuse",False,False
