Soccer is a lot of running (though it’s more “burst”) as-is, and if practice goes for a couple of hours, you’d be working quite a bit. Running/working out on off-practice days would be fine, I’d think. And you could use the excuse to your mom that it’s to keep you in shape for soccer (in my experience, it is usually actual advice from coaches, anyway).   Plus- you’re still in school! And school is important!! Homework is a priority, and if you do end up not eating as much, being super tired AND hungry is going to take a lot out of you and trash your focus when it comes to academics. So I would advise only having one of those things working against you (obviously health would suggest having neither).   In the end, you know your own limits best. I’d avoid doing anything that’d effect your future, though.",False,False
