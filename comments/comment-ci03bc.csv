How could it not have had that effect though? Media romanticised the fuck out of eating disorders in the 90s and 00s and we went searching out pro ana stuff online so we could get in on that juicy beautiful twisted dark mysterious suffering special snowflake culture. Then before we knew what was happening we were in too deep and couldn’t get out.",False,False

To add to this, EDs are like any other mental health disorder in that severity ebbs and flows over time and different cycles. Just like you wouldn’t say someone w depression who had a few good days was “faking it” you don’t need to worry about that.  I honestly think that the whole “wannarexic” issue has made a lot of us doubt our own experiences which is really sad.",False,False

I poop twice a day even when I’m heavily restricting. I can’t relate to the “lol haven’t shit in a year” posts at all (outside of occasional protein bar binges, which are a different animal entirely).   You’re not faking it just because you didn’t track for a couple of days.",False,False
