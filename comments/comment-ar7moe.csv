I wasnt even trying. I just kinda lost interest in food and every mouthful made me feel like I would vomit.  Not saying that would happen to you, but it sounds like taking your meds will be crucial for you, and maybe knowing that it may actually lead to weight loss can help you out",False,False

Weight gain from meds is virtually all via increased appetite, and so people with restrictive EDs tend not to suffer that effect because of not eating in an appetite directed way in the first place. If it would help you stay out of inpatient and maybe feel a little calmer, try taking the meds - very, very, very improbable that would lead to gaining in itself. ",False,False
