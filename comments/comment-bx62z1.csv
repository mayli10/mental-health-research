But I feel like there is some merit to their recovery and their way of expressing it. I have the current ""Instagram shape"" ie, flat stomach, C cup size but not like folded over?,small waist with wide hips, big thighs but somehow a thigh gal, big butt, skinny shoulders with collar bones... I fucking hate it. In fact I think the trend for liking it is disgusting. It grosses me out that all these girls are out these injecting gross shit into their thighs and asses to fake the thing that has haunted and tortured me since puberty. I just want small thighs and upper arms, but no, I lose all my weight from my waist but (and probably because it's easy) I don't give a shit! I only focus on my blubbery thighs and dream about how a waist can be sinched but not my legs.....    Blah blah... Long story short they could equally have hated their natural curves and I think it takes a lot of mental health repair and recovery to see the ass as an asset ;p, or in general to go from wanting and chasing sticc to loving the thicc they have. I'm not there and I can't even stand the trend, let alone the ""perfect"" features I naturally have. I only consider the ones I don't perfect. And there in lies the disease.",False,False

I was praised, then I got burned out and decided to try to eat better and work out normally. Ultimately I gained weight back into a healthier range with muscle (but a little chubby over it all because cortisol) and everyone was telling me how dissapointed they were that I gained weight. Straight up told me that they were dissapointed in me. Anyways, this was a personal lesson that just proved to me that there is no 'recovered' unless still thin and pretty.

Recovery is when food has it's place. You eat, you move on. But you don't put it on this massive pedestal or document every single morsel. I see recovery as seeing food as neutral with peaks of pleasure (social events etc). And when the food is pleasurable it's punctuating another happy experience - it doesn't make up the entire experience. For example your birthday should not be ALL ABOUT the CAKE..or some day that we look forward to because it's an excuse to binge or 'cheat'.",False,False

Recovery obviously involves weight gain. Often we will get back to our previous body that we thought was horrible. And if recovery allows you to love that body you previously hated, I think that is a win.

I mean, a lot of her Instagram pics have angles with her butt in front of the camera. There's nothing inherently wrong with this, but since she had an ED I feel she might still be struggling with body image issues, and she wants commenters to say she's hot. Also, her photos aren't all super related to recovery, but she still mentions it in the tags. For example in a recent post, although she's not really in a pose that highlights her butt:  &gt;Kiss whoever the fuck you want üè≥Ô∏è‚Äçüåà #myfavshirttoweartofamilydinners #happypridemonth #happybeingme  #thickthighssavelives #embracingit #pride #loveislove #selflove  Umm... okay?
