efwphwv,t3_anssam,t1_efvtkl4,OkWorking7,1,2019-02-06 17:58:22,/r/EDAnonymous/comments/anssam/peach/efwphwv/,Yeah I just added people from the threads on this sub. Then after a bit of using you start to become familiar with the different people you have on peach. Tbh I'm really surprised by how quickly and easily I formed connections with people based on such minimal reactions (I don't really like to DM heaps but I like/read every status and I leave comments fairly often). It's such a warm and supportive community on peach and I regularly see posts of love and appreciation for peach pals.,False,False
