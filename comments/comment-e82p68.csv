What is the point of keeping sexual pictures of someone else you were involved with, once you enter a new relationship? It crosses lines. You should really discuss how hurt you are that he didn’t just delete those pics. This isn’t your fault.",False,False

There are layers here, and sounds like some intentional hiding/lying. I also understand that actually seeing the pictures would be a mind-fuck. That's something I haven't experienced, so I'm sorry for that...  I just wanted to make sure that you understood that just because the pictures exist doesn't diminish you in any way. Don't compare her body, etc to yourself. Be honest with him, but be careful to not disparage yourself. Don't put that out in the universe. It'll take some time to get over what you saw, but it'll be worse if you start internalizing those comparisons. Be strong and he'll react to that. He's lucky to have you, end of story. Good luck ❤️",False,False

ETA: thank you for the kind words though, i know it’s definitely my insecurity and ED playing a major role in how i’m feeling right now, and i am hoping to see him in a few days to properly talk about how i feel face to face",False,True

I'm a girl, and I'm with a guy, we've been together for 8 years (!!!). I love him with all that I am.  I also have a  secret folder that has nudes of a bunch of my exes (including some videos lol).  I keep them because that past is a part of me. The sexual side. My exes thought I was hot and vice versa. I keep them, even though I rarely look at them. I could delete them, but why?  I was a complete person before I met my significant other. And if we break up, I'll still be a whole person. A person that had a life before him. If I keep old pictures, it has nothing to do with him. I won't ever cheat on him. I don't masturbate to the pictures, it just reminds me of who I was at that moment in time.  Honestly, my current guy is lucky as hell that I had previous partners because I learned a lot, and we have a super awesome love life. I was a prude when I was young and I'm lucky I outgrew that.  Anyhoo, you have a choice right now. You can choose to not be insecure about this. There's really no reason to. He has a past and so do you. If he's sorry you found them, and he doesn't talk about his exes and his sexual history with you, I don't see a big issue.  Exes are exes, that's that. I have exes that are hot as fuck, and we had crazy sex, but the relationship didn't work for whatever reason. I can still acknowledge that, while respecting the relationship I'm in. I wouldn't trade those exes for what I have any day!  Take care ❤️.",False,False
