That's how I've been diagnosed when it comes to that, and I do it more often than you. However, the not eating could be anorexia without the nervosa, or some other eating disorder that isnt characterized by mental distress and control of food intake. I would definitely take it up with your doctor. And stress that you arent purposely doing it and you just forget because you have no hunger. I hope you can get some help, much love",False,False

Your advice is very helpful and I appreciate your kindness. Its comforting to know there are people I can talk to who understand and dont judge. Anything regarding mental health has always been so hard for me to talk about, as it is with most people.   I will try to do what you recommended. Thank you again! ",False,True

Big red flag there. Even with anorexia I've never been a binge eater or purged through vomiting, laxatives, or exercise. I would say that if you're doing those things, even just occasionally, that something isn't right.  As for not eating for days, that's an even bigger red flag. Healthy people have two or three meals a day. Going close to a week with absolutely nothing is a huge deal.  It sounds to me like you do have an eating disorder. If you feel that you can you should try to have at least one meal per day minimum. Preferably you would want to eat enough to maintain your BMR (Basal Metabolic Rate), which is the amount of calories your body burns in a day for it's basic function. If you want to know your BMR so that you know the minimum you should eat I could link you to a calculator. Normally I wouldn't because that could just encourage people to eat less, but in your case it sounds to me like it might encourage you to eat more. And of course eating more would help with your headaches and your sleep problems. When I used to get migraines my doctor suggested eating foods high in carbs (she suggested bagels) and also having caffeine. I found that to be very helpful advice.",False,False

And no matter what anyone tells you, you're not taking out, or overreacting. You hadnt eaten in days, which is so scary, regardless of how your mindset plays into it. Even if it was an accident, there's obviously something traumatic going on for your brain and body. You deserve help and the ability to sort through this. We're here for you.",False,False

You sound like you have a lot of complicated feelings wrapped up with your body and mental health. I don't know what kind of disorder you would be diagnosed with, or if it would necessarily be an eating disorder, given that it seems like the food problems are coming out of something else, and might be resolved by figuring out the root anxieties beneath them. I really recommend trying to see someone, and definitely seeing a dietitian so you can take care of your body while addressing your struggles. A malnourished mind can't heal itself. ",False,False

It sounds like you are not living with your parents, so are an adult? It could be stress. It sounds scary to talk to a doctor about stuff like binging and purging, but you will feel better after. Good luck and I hope you get everything figured out soon. ",False,False
