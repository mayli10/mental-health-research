After going no-contact for a few weeks you might even find that you don't want to resume contact.  &amp;#x200B;  I had a really similar experience, very recently. Broke up because he couldn't handle a relationship, stayed friends, ended up sleeping together again. I ended the friendship because the way he was treating me was really hurtful to me, despite how I felt about him and how much I cared for him. A month later, I'm absolutely confident I made the right choice. I don't know your particular situation, but take a really long hard look at your relationship with this guy and think about whether or not it's actually healthy.",False,False

On one hand, if he doesn't fuck around with other girls to your knowledge and for all intents and purposes, acts like you're in a relationship without the label then it should be fine. But on the other hand, I'm afraid you'll be super hurt if he doesn't anything that would be normal for FWB but not people in a monogamous relationship. I suggest have a serious talk with this dude about how you could make a relationship work and if that doesn't go well, you need to cut your losses because this could be a disaster waiting to happen.",False,False
