I wear skinny jeans that I bought years ago that are loose. Same with my shirts and jackets, itâ€™s ridiculous.   Good luck to you on your journey, too!",False,True

When I was at my lowest weight last Autumn, solidly in the underweight category, I thought I looked bommmmb. Then I saw some pictures of the fucking actual skeleton I was becoming that were taken at a Halloween party. I went as Princess Peach and the fucking elbow-length gloves I was wearing were too loose. I'm not cured by any means, but it was a wake-up call and it helped me to stop weighing myself.     I hope that you are able to do good healthy things for your body and your mind after this!",False,False

First, *hugs* I am so beyond proud of you for choosing to be a happier you. It sounds like you have been miserable for a long time.  Being able to recognize the true problem is so vital in your new journey and I think this really was your â€˜oh shitâ€™ moment.  Please please please remember the happiness within this moment when you feel like quitting recovery from your ED and suicidal thoughts. Please remember there are so many more laughs with your friends to come.  I know this is hard and scary (I have gone through recovery 2x before it finally â€˜stuckâ€™) and my DMâ€™s are open for you anytime.",False,False

Hope the TW is right because I list actual methods and I personally get really distresssed when the topic concerns suicide.  I just really needed somebody to share this story with because the photo really changed my perception of myself.,False,True
