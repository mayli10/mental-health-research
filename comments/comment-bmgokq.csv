Right now, everything seems like *so much* for you. I get it.  You lost 10kg before. I know that you had a mysterious illness and you lost it in 4 months, but you can lose it again and *slowly*. Weight gain is not forever.   I get the feeling jealous about friends. Try to put them in a separate box for now. You can't control her weight, she can't control yours. In a different box.  Losing weight for your boyfriend. I get it, you want to lose weight, you're not having sex. Make a plan. Don't set yourself up to fail through restricting and then bingeing. I used to restrict for ages and then binge like a motherfucker and I would just cycle through the same 5kg over and over again. You *know* how to lose weight easily. TDEE - 500. It might take longer than you initially want, I'm sure you (like me) would love to wake up tomorrow and be your GW. That's not going to happen. So, one thing at a time.

But if you don't reach it, but you've been doing what you can to lose weight, you're a damn sight closer than you would be if you hadn't.  You're not a failure, you're not a whale, you're not fucked. Shit got fucked in your life right now, but everything just needs to be slowed down. Take some time for you. Write in your diary. Turn off your phone, whatever. Just take some mossalto time and gather your thoughts. You got this &lt;3",False,False
