Back when I was restricting heavily I would get dizzy in class. Now I’m not saying I want to be dizzy and pass out, but it sucks having someone say they could TELL I had eaten food. ",False,True

I'm sick of thinking about food all the time, stuffing myself, then hating myself then over exercising. For all the anxiety, obsession and self hate, I have nothing to show for it. I need to stop the binge cycle, start restriction, sort out my self control and get a fucking grip on my life. I want to be the skinny girl, I want people to start worrying. ",False,False
