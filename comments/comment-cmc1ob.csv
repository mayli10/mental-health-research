It's hard to pin down an exact point, but I started being dissatisfied with my body in late 2013. My parents started a moderate treatment program for me in early 2014, but by the end of 2014, I was at my worst. Thankfully, things turned around then. I didn't last long without treatment but I quickly got worse. I do think the predisposition towards anorexia has a genetic factor as the amount of discontent I felt with my body was minimal and only grew as I let my behaviours become more disordered. My family was on a trend of being healthy but restricting certain things in the name of being healthy; I had a retainer and couldn't be bothered to eat snacks because of all the brushing one has to do around that; I was on a bit of a self-improvement kick. Lots of factors but let's not forget that it is likely a combination of nature and nurture.  3. Behaviours? I don't want to be triggering, so let's just say the whole shabang: overexercising and not eating food in all its ways, shapes and forms. Obsessive calorie counting and calculating; lying constantly. Body checking, etc. Yup. I was a textbook case.",False,True

My parents decided on family-based treatment for me and made a meal plan for me. I think they followed Minnie Maud eventually -- at first they took a more moderate approach but then I think they amped it up as I didn't respond to a more moderate treatment. My parents were my ""team"" -- when they amped it up, they were watching me 95% of the time I was awake. ""Just eating"" would *definitely* ***not*** have worked for me -- the only thing I was eating was every single lie the eating disorder fed me at that point! I would dare to say, in fact, that ""just eating"" is never going to be a viable method of recovery for anyone with anorexia.  2. I was fairly underweight. At first, my parents might have underestimated how entrenched I was in the ED, so I only got worse during the first few months.  My weight is now at a healthy level, though, after going through recovery -- not that I weigh myself much anymore. I'm hoping to put on more weight in the form of muscle (lifting and eating to bulk)! I think I'm heavier than I was pre-ED, but I'm also older, and I think I look better than ever tbh.  3. Ya know, I never got the urge to binge or had extreme hunger to a level of binging. Sorry, I can't speak to that one.  4. What a process it was. Well, it was 4-5 months of ""pseudo-recovery"" where my parents took a moderate approach to recovery for me. Then, there was a solid and very intense period of about 2 months before it was time to go to school. Then, I would say it was another year/year and a half until I actually had the strength to take food to school and eat it, get extra if I was hungry, not waste mental energy worrying about it, etc. At that time, I'd still have the odd ED-related thought, but I was strong enough to push it away quickly and continue on with healthy behaviours. So, I'd say recovery took a couple years for me. 5. Haha! Oh, I believe I am fully recovered. Absolutely. This hit me recently because I had completely forgotten about anorexia for months and then it dawned on me last month: *oh yeah, I had an eating disorder before, eh?* But I am definitely not the exact same person I was before. I think I have become more mature, and a better person. That could be just age, and not going through an ED. But there's something about surviving a life-threatening disorder.  I still am ""me"", but I'm a stronger version of myself. At least that's what I think. 6. Aha, I see Well, I encourage you to check out this video: &lt; [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CxLvcaxb5Fw&amp;t=2s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CxLvcaxb5Fw&amp;t=2s) \&gt;. This is from a lady who is not underweight, but has realized that her body is giving her extreme hunger cues, and she's decided to follow them. She references setpoint theory, for which I encourage you to look up Kayla Rose on Youtube. Kayla comes from a similar background: not being skeletal, but being underweight, and recovering through listening to hunger cues. She has lots of videos, but the gist of it is that she gained a lot of weight as she listened to her extreme hunger, kept listening, and eventually her body returned to its setpoint. **Disclaimer:** you talk about someone who is not ""massively underweight"", is experiencing extreme hunger, and is needing to gain weight, which is why I have linked to these Youtubers. I would NOT suggest trying to ""listen to hunger cues"" for someone who has anorexia or someone who has become so unhealthy that they don't experience hunger cues anymore.  Thank you, I wish you all the best as well! I hope you feel inspired by Stephanie and Kayla if you do watch their videos.",False,True

I looked like a bloated stick figure when I was recovering. It was terrible. I was constantly uncomfortable with a huge stomach and yet my extremities were still relatively skeletal. The bloatedness was part food retention (cause I couldn't take a shit for the longest time) and part water, but also that's where a lot of weight went initially. I didn't get any chest fat so can't speak to that unfortunately.   HOWEVER -- today, roughly 4 years after actually choosing to recover and starting that journey, my body's felt safe enough to redistribute the weight, and I'm healthy enough I don't get bloated (and I don't freak out if I get a healthy food baby after a good meal, haha! body knows what it's doing!).  I think maybe 2 years or so after choosing recovery, my body was mostly redistributed and not in conservation mode anymore. So what you're experiencing is normal. Just don't stop short! If you stop short of a full recovery, your body will go *oh no* and keep doing weird, unwanted things like retaining weight in strange places to try to keep you alive. You gotta go the whole way. Promise it'll work it. It's just how nature be.   Good to hear you're recovering! It's damn hard, but you can absolutely do it.",False,True

Well, I knew I had a problem when I could no longer just eat when the situation demanded it or when I knew I should. As I wrote at one point, ""If I can’t go back \[to normal eating\] that means it’s \[the ED is\] controlling me"". That was when I knew I had Done Something ^(TM), but I really didn't think it was that big of a deal. What really convinced me it was a big deal, and actually brought me to the point where I was ready to commit to recovery, was seeing how my sickness affected my family and those close to me. Even when I didn't think there was anything wrong with me being unhealthy, miserable, and really just an impersonal piece of trash in general, I could see how hurt, frustrated and sad my family was. That, for me, was the real problem.  As I started to recover, I started to begin to see the reality that was causing this problem of my family being so upset and hurt.  I had zero normal, healthy behaviours around food. I, despite what I told myself, had a huge lack of energy. I couldn't take a shit. (That, my friends, is a  P r o b l e m.)   This leads into your second question. Through recovery, I kept going because I had committed to it, because I couldn't justify making my family suffer just so I could suffer. The source of my motivation was external. But, as I recovered, I began to enjoy my health personally: I started to appreciate all the things I could do, and I started to realize *I* liked life a lot better when I was healthy (had a personality, had energy, could take a shit again, etc.)! So, it went sort of the other way around for me: Recovering made me realize that all this was in the best interests of my own health. I think that's a good reason I haven't relapsed. I like this healthy me, thank you very much, no disorders allowed.  Hope that answers it for you!",False,True

I think the thought (though I may have never consciously thought it) ""I'm not sick enough"" was something I had to *overcome* in order to choose recovery. I did have the attitude that I didn't need help, that I was fine. However, somewhere, deep down, I'm quite certain everyone with an ED knows that they are, in fact, sick -- I know I did, even if I wouldn't admit it to anyone. When I *did* decide to recover, I allowed myself to accept the reality I had buried and I was actually able to think and believe: *oh shit, I* ***AM*** *sick, I'm in trouble.* This happened especially since as you start to recover, there will be many unpleasant physical side effects due to the changes, which certainly remind you that you *are* quite sick and in trouble and you *have* put your body through a whole lot of hell and you *are,* in fact, not alright. Part of recovery is realizing/accepting that you are sick, and even if there are people more sick than you, being sick is not a competition and you seriously need to get your life back on track: for whatever reason you have that motivates you to choose recovery.   Consequently, of course I struggled with the thoughts that I was ""recovered enough"" and, you know, I was no longer ""sick enough"" for recovery. But the fact that I had chosen recovery, and reinforced the reality of my condition to myself that I *was* sick and it didn't matter how much anyone else was sick when it came to my recovery, kept me on the right path and I avoided relapse.  If you feel like you're ""obligated to relapse"" due to not being sick enough, that would be a **huge** warning sign for someone in recovery -- I'd strongly suggest someone in that position to go back to their reason(s) why they chose to recover, and focus on those, to get that hellish ""not sick enough"" feeling out ASAP!  As for independence: It was a gradual process. My family did family-based treatment for me. At first, they were with me 95% of my waking hours. As I proved more and more that I was able to follow through with healthy behaviours, and that I was strong enough to resist the temptation to go back to that deceivingly ""comfortable"" place of following disordered behaviours, they allowed me to have more independence. Of course I struggled, and sometimes I *did* go back to disordered behaviours. For example, when I had to eat a lunch at school, sometimes I would chicken out and not eat it. **However,** I started to have the healthy response to these mistakes: I'd actually see them as mistakes, and feel ashamed that a simple lunch had defeated me. (Who would win in a fight - A Human VS Waffles? *the human should win every time, smh, laaaame*, that's what I started to think.) I'd muster the courage (most times, admittedly, not every time) to tell my support team what I'd done and agree to try to make up for it. Every time I was able to correct a slip-up, I got stronger and less likely to follow ED behaviours the next time I was tempted. In short, practice makes perfect, and that initial commitment to recovery (knowing your personal *why* behind recovery) should be something you go back to again and again when you feel like giving in to disordered instincts.  Sorry for the long answer, but hope it answered your questions!",False,True
ew1p7rb,t3_cmc1ob,t1_ew1ksc4,spelonberry,1,2019-08-05 13:05:51,/r/EDAnonymous/comments/cmc1ob/recovered_ama/ew1p7rb/,"Hey man, that's a loaded question there!  The answer is *intuitive eating*, which is just listening to your body's (**real**) hunger cues. And as we might all know, intuitive eating is pretty much the exact opposite of any eating disorder. During recovery, it is necessary for your support/treatment team to count calories for you to give your body the resources to heal itself and restore your natural hunger cues to where they should be. When you've recovered, you will (gradually!) be able to stop thinking/worrying about calories, and you will be in tune with your body's natural hunger. Now, I eat intuitively -- without consciously thinking about eating in the way I used to. As a result, I am at a healthy body weight and do not count calories at all!  As a side note, sometimes, during an ED, you (meaning me, this is my experience) may have messed up your body so much you don't feel natural hunger cues, and so don't eat. This is NOT intuitive eating; intuitive eating comes from following natural hunger cues that occur when you are *healthy*, not when you are sick. Therefore, you *have* to go through recovery completely, and get to a healthy place, in order to get natural hunger cues and be able to eat intuitively.  Thanks for this question and I really hope, if you do not currently have natural hunger cues or eat intuitively, that you can get to that place, because it's very freeing to be able to eat whenever, whatever, and be healthy and energetic ^_^",False,True
