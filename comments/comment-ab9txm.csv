Thank you so much. I think I just wasn’t ready to share my thoughts to the world yet. I’m relieved that someone out there knows what it feels like but at the same time, that feeling sucks :(.  Thank you for your kind words! Have a wonderful day &lt;3",False,True

I’m in a drama class and I did my acting monologue that has themes of disordered eating.. and wonder where I got the excerpts from.. WINTERGIRLS  I still cry at the memories of me performing to this day. It was 3 months ago and I’ve just kinda repressed it. Big whoops.  But I should before you think second thoughts that acting is very different from writing! When you write you get your thoughts out clearer, and people are less likely to make assumptions based on your look and character BY FAR. Not to say writing it out would be easier but if you worry about someone thinking of you explicitly unless they know you personally, I wouldn’t but I don’t know  I also have realized I actually wasn’t mentally prepared to fully express my pain and thoughts to an audience, I could barely express them alone.  You probably wrote well! Good luck! :)",False,False

While logically I know I don’t have to share my work with other people, I always end up making excuses and publishing it anyway. It’s reassuring for someone to put into words that no, I don’t have to share my work. It really does mean a lot to me.  I think I might end up taking some elements from the story and weave it into a longer one focused on recovery. I absolutely want to write this story, I’m just not ready yet.  Thank you for your kind words &lt;3 ",False,True

On the one hand, sharing it might be cathartic since EDs tend to be very secretive obsessions that get us stuck in a rabbit hole of isolation, but it’s really understandable that you wouldn’t want anyone else to read it. Maybe you could take parts of what you have now and weave it into another story/essay (idk if you’re writing fiction or not) and have it be clear from the context that it isn’t autobiographical. Also at the end of the day, just because you chose to sign up in the past doesn’t mean anyone is entitled to read your work now and there is no shame or problem with choosing not to share your work.
