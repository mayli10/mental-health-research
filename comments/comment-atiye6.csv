And then I make a pact with myself to eat a lite but normal amount of food the next day... think like 1000 calories or 1200 but mostly just fruit/salads/rice cakes. This way I avoid having another restriction/binge cycle the next day since I’ve already had the binge. From this day I’ll continue with whatever crazy restriction I was doing before. But yeah, lots of fluids, take some vitamins and remind yourself that it’s a shitty day and tomorrow you will do better. ",False,False
