Tell her you know she means well/her heart is in the right place, but that x, y, z tend not to help but a, b, c, do. Be open to hearing her thoughts and compromising.",False,False

Honestly it's bit out of line for them to be ttying to make you eat in front of them? Advisor/advisee relationships are mainly professional, IMO they should just leave it at you're not comfortable.

Is it possible for you to just get a drink (diet soda or something?) as a sort of compromise?",False,False
