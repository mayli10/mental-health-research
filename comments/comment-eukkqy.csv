Like isn't that perfect fodder if you want a dramatic story? It doesn't need to be the physical state of the person that's ""dramatic"" ðŸ˜©  I agree that ED representation is terrible, I would be very triggered if I was living in Norway I think. I'm so sorry.

Pretty sure it is an eating disorder here? Or at least I've heard it being spoken of as an ED here before.

And that the organization for ED-support in Norway is receiving a lot of calls from sufferers and their family members who are bewildered/concerned/triggered and sufferers who cannot walk through certain places in the city where that poster is because they get so triggered by it. I wish they could have chosen another picture for the poster at least. I also heard that they edited the poster somehow to make the girl look even more disturbed/sick than she was and I'm like??? what the fuck, why was that even necessary",False,True

I mean, I have nothing against movies about anorexia per se. As you said yourself, representation is GREAT! But because all (popular) movies I've heard of that are about eating disorders are almost ALWAYS about extremely underweight girls, I feel a bit bitter. Like if one (1) movie was made that told the story of a normal/overweight person struggling with an ED, I wouldn't mind as much. But when *everything* is almost solely about underweight girls (movies, newspaper articles, stock images about eating disorders, campaigns etc.) I just feel so incredibly invalid.   What also sucks is that when these movies come out, in the weeks following their release you get a surge in articles, movie reviews, and conversations about this movie. And because the people behind them, in most cases, are not disordered themselves/do not have much knowledge about eating disorders, they paint this one dimensional picture of EDs, and together with the posters that are everywhere (in the city, cinema, newspapers, facebook) and people saying things such as ""oh poor soul - anorexia is such a deadly disease!"" or something along those lines this period after the release becomes SO unbearable.   And like yeah this movie represents eating disorders/anorexia but imagine opening up to your family/friends/doctor/psychologist after such movies come out if you're at a normal weight or you're overweight? Especially when everybody and their mother has seen the poster (just google ""Selvportrett 2020"") with the extremely underweight person because it's literally everywhere. Most people, even anorexics themselves (!) are not even close to being as malnourished and sickly thin as she was! I can also imagine that all of these reviews and people saying beautiful words about the girl that passed away from anorexia can sort of romanticize the disease? I mean, when you see all of the positive attention and loving words and the ""oh poor bird!"" type of sentences being thrown around, wouldn't the sick part of your brain lowkey want to achieve *that*?   I suppose that normal people don't even think that far because they look at her and think ""huh, why would anybody ever want to look like that?"" while I know that some of us may look at her and the attention and kind words that she has received and look at that as some sort goal to achieve.",False,True

I compare it to other representation:  Depression representation is the lonely, disheveled man who lives on takeout and avoids sunlight. And it's good that depression is represented, and that people who ARE like this are being noticed, but it's nowhere near enough to demonstrate what depression is like or that anyone can be affected by it.  LGBT+ representation is white, effeminate gay men. And it's fantastic that they're getting represented... but it does not represent a large portion of the LGBT+ community, and doesn't even represent gay men as well as it could.  Disability is a deformity or being in a wheelchair. Poverty is living in a shack unable to buy anything. Addiction is going missing for days on end and being found in a crack house. Self-harm is a young, teenage girl who feels lonely.   The fact that these things are being represented? That's great. Genuinely. But is the representation anywhere near enough? Absolutely not. And we as a collective need to keep striding forward and keep moving until as many people as possible have at least some form of representation that they can relate to.",False,False
