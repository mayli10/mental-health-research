Mine doesn‚Äôt really, but then again I haven‚Äôt been completely open about it with her yet. She wants me to do step 4 soon though, so that‚Äôs gonna have to change.   I relapsed the first time after too. The world is harsh, girl. That‚Äôs a great attitude to have though! I really believe that you can do this.   They are both addictions in their own way, one is just to a process and the other a chemical. Both suck either way.   Best of luck to you too, doll! üíï",False,False

I believe the steps will be a huge help, my sponsor also suffered from an ED so that‚Äôs great being able to have her support.  I‚Äôve done rehab, it was great in its way but the real world got me &amp; I relapsed twice after. Inpatient for my ED seems to be the only way out, but so be it if it has to be!

I don't have much advice as I am going through the same thing (ED relapse after getting into recovery for alcoholism).  All I will say is that in my case, NA (AA around here isn't great) meetings really help me. Just to talk and vent about my ""addiction"". No-one has to know which one I'm talking about, my ED or my using. I can just share and get advice based on the steps, and that's beautiful.  And please give inpatient a go. I went inpatient for my drinking and it honestly saved my life. Yes, I'm back in my ED bullshit right now, but I'm able to minimize and manage it far better than I could have without inpatient.   I'm lucky to be alive too. Let's both try to keep fighting through this. Feel free to message me any time.  ‚ù§ ",False,False

I noticed the difference within one week, it was like a light switch going on.

It's one of the reasons why I have a floor for weight loss because my mind actually gets unbearable when I'm underweight.   I think a good chunk of my first recovery was getting some chronic therapy and being able to tell myself that I'm allowed to exist.   Really reaching into my inner child and saying it's okay if you exist.   Now I'm having another relapse but this time it's less about disappearing and more about control. But I'm working on it. ‚ù§  Getting to at least a 18bmi will likely change your brain a lot because right now it's literally starving and it can't possibly think straight. ,False,False
