You sound like a really strong person to be able to try to get an education and fight an eating disorder. Also please check out if your school has any discounted therapy or group therapy. I know my school had one and you got three free visits with a therapist for free and I think it was income scale from then on. Itâ€™s not perfect but it may be able to help some or at least help you find other people on campus who are struggling with the same issues.,False,False
