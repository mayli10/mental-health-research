I think also Iâ€™m at this point in my life where I have much more important things to focus on if that makes sense. In high school, I could allow an eating disorder to swallow me up. Now, between work and college I donâ€™t have the time to give in to the things that used to have such power over me.   Everyone has problems it seems. As a society, weâ€™re much more accepting of mental health issues now than we were 10 years ago. Maybe I just feel more comfortable around others knowing that everyone has something that weighs on them like my ED used to on me.   Your comment about being bad at recovery and at eating disorders resonated so deeply with me. After all this time, if I canâ€™t get either right, I might as well settle for what I can get.",False,True

My bf is telling me to eat more and that he is worried about my recent weight loss....however, in my mind, I'm not even close to the all consuming obsession regarding food/weight/exercise, especially because I'm not weighed down and distracted and the weight loss is so minor in comparison to years ago at my PEAK disorder.  Like, I'm reacting to my current environment change by restricting a little more, taking the longer way to walk to work, avoiding certain 'bad' foods...though I never stopped doing all that, I'm just more strict and the rules have amplified in variety recently. These days I just feel low yet almost ambivalent when I notice some weight gain or if there's a social meal I can't quite get out of. As you said, although I stress a little and care a lot deep inside, it feels different than previously and in reaction I mainly just shrug, water fast for a few days and get back to a somewhat 'right place'.  &amp;#x200B;  I feel like I'm bad at recovery and bad at having an ed.  This is such a vocal and annoying backseat driver in my life, but at this point, how is this any different to everyone else in society who is bogged down by the societal pressures to watch their weight, what they eat and excessively care how they look.",False,False

What I call my ""recovered state"" is basically not being dragged down as much, being closer to a healthy weight but still living with almost all the behaviours. When I relapse it's only a matter of precision for me, like I start weighing everything I eat to 0.5 gram accuracy, I step on the scale more and have more strict limits to when, what and how much I eat. But I never stopped counting calories, never stopped counting steps, never stopped weighing myself etc. When ""in recovery"" I still have a calorie limit it's just higher but I never go above that even with the most positive attitude towards actual recovery. Typing it out got me thinking if what I consider recovered is basically a less severe active ED, what does proper recovery even look like? Damn.",False,False
