Unfortunately everything you said really hit home. I have been toying with the idea of trying to curb purging, at the least (an attempt I’ve made many times) and I saved your comment to look at when it gets hard. Thank you again :)",False,True

I know that my ED is my way of managing stress, but it works. I don't actually stress about the ED, it just makes other things feel better. It's why I doubt I'll ever even attempt recovery, because to me it's not actually a problem.",False,False

Saw that somewhere recently and your post made me think about it. I’ve absolutely been at points where harm reduction sounds like a safer bet than recovery. But I want so much more from my life in the long run than harm reduction, so I keep plugging away at recovery for the sake of a future I want.",False,False

Most addicts get to a point where they need they need to use in order to just get through life, and taking away the substance makes them dysfunctional. Whether it's coffee or drugs or alcohol, you don't realize how dependent you are on it until you take it away.  I guess the eventual goal of recovery is to be happy and functional without ""using"" ED anymore. But when you're accustomed to using all the time, that initial period of ""quitting"" restriction or b/p is gonna suck a lot.  Which is why getting better is so goddamn hard.",False,False

Both starvation and b/ping can give you the most insane adrenaline rushes. Couple that with that a lot of us don’t have regular sleeping patterns, abuse caffeine and other stimulants, and you get a pretty classic case of mania. And you get into a rhythm with it. It becomes safe. It’s a hell of a high. You feel better. You think you look better. You’re on top of the world. But you’ll crash, I promise. This is the point where eating disorders get dangerous, when it stops feeling crappy, and starts feeling like a hell of a rush and a crazy power trip. Just please be careful.

This also has mental effects.   When ED behaviours become easy, that’s when the physical effects become more of a danger. There’s no mental barrier preventing you from just full-on engaging in your ED behaviours with your guard down and it does usually unintentionally get taken to an extreme over time. It’ll seem easy until the health consequences take hold and then it becomes stressful again.   I know exactly how you feel, but if it seems too good to be true it probably is. Eating disorders have a way of convincing us that everything will be alright...until it isn’t lol.   Although I’m happy that you’re feeling happy, I’m also somewhat sad because I wish you could find happiness in more healthy and lasting ways. I hope you stay safe and I wish you the best of luck in finding health and happiness, please be careful &lt;3",False,False

I just see posts about how people feel trapped in their ED in a bad way - they agonize over every decision, beat themselves up daily, and isolate into their behaviors. I used to be that way, too.

Without the behaviours, we are still disordered and it’s the ED which causes us to stress so much about normal eating.   The only options really are either genuinely recovering to remove all the stress and negativity associated with eating normally, or continue with the behaviours to temporarily remove that stress (although in the long run the second option is much more physically and mentally taxing/damaging, and is likely lead to your eventual downfall).   Unfortunately, since the second option is much easier to choose right away, most of us (including me) just go with that until it ends up going way too far. Instead of finding newer coping mechanisms for problems and dealing with food stress in a healthier way.",False,False
