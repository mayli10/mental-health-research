I went to the beach recently and the first day or two I wished I had nicotine and caffeine but by the end I was completely fine without it.  Again it may not work, but changing your day to day when quitting may help by breaking up some of the psychological triggers. ",False,False

Either slowly using less frequently or slowly cutting dose. Record your use and maybe give yourself little rewards for steps along the way. Something with light caffeine could be a good substitute  every once in a while if you need one.,False,False
