I might have misread. Saying triggering stuff isn’t excusable. Maybe she just needed to vent but still I see where you’re coming from. We can all work on our empathy, Good luck",False,False

I find it very hard to be empathetic to other people sometimes just because my brain is so intensely bad all the time.  Like I'm working on it but it's not easy . I don't like guilt trip her or anything tho , and like I don't think it's a lot to ask for her to not say triggering stuff",False,True

Maybe she needs some support too and somebody to worry about her right now. If you can’t give that that’s totally understandable and maybe let her have just a week for herself to cheer up and you to, but not guilt tripping her or asking her to not only be sad herself but show concern for you and even she aware of her eating habits specifically for you. I hope this doesn’t come off like I’m blaming your or being judgmental, sorry",False,False
