I remember we had to take a picture sitting on a counter and all I could think about was how uncomfortable I felt because of my ""rolls"" when sitting down. I was bullied at school AND at home by siblings DAILY.  Which made everything for x100 worse.   got worse (body image) in middle school(when I experimented with purging) especially because all of my friends were extremely petite (naturally) my best friend was about 4'11 and weighed like 90 pounds. My other friends were this small as well so I always felt so fucking HUGE. I was probably 5'1 and just a bit chubby. I have always been insecure, since I could remember.",False,False

Which is super fucked up when you think about it. My mom was helping me undress for my bath and I just started crying cause I was so embarrassed and ashamed of my body. Thing is for most of my life up until I started college I was either normal or slightly underweight. Always did dance, etc. I'm hispanic and there was a strong pressure by my mom and the women in my family to always look a certain way, so I did, and I hated it, but I'm aware enough that my body growing up was definitely one that most girls my age would actually be jealous of. I'm 24 now. Granted I know that the dysphoria (I'm NB) played a decent role in triggering the ED full blown what with me feeling like my body didn't look the way it was supposed to, but it feels like its always been there under the surface.",False,False
