Hence why purging is an inefficient means of weight loss. I‚Äôm pretty sure it was on a study that compared big b/p sessions to smaller b/p sessions (in terms of caloric intake), which concluded that despite intake, caloric retention remained relatively static. I‚Äôll try to find it.",False,False

In the beginning, I would just eat one small meal a day and it was fine. Over time, my thought process somehow went from ""okay, half an hour to eat (eats something small)"" to ""holy fuck eat everything now"" like idk how but taking my retainer out now triggers a binge pretty much every time I eat. I'm about to ask for the little bar they glue against the back of the lower front teeth cause I'm losing my mind.   I would say to be careful of that just in case it could happen, but idk if I'm just weird. Good luck with your invisible braces! I hope you get the results you want üíú",False,False
