I know how you feel. But it is probable that he feels the same way and just let's it out in a self demeaning comedy way.,False,False

That’s an amazing accomplishment all around, submitting the mountain and choosing to fuel yourself for it! You DEFINITELY have nothing to worry about and were very likely still at a caloric *deficit* with that kind of activity. I’m really proud of you for eating the pizza and sincerely hope you can do it again. And yeah, it definitely doesn’t sound like your order was super high cal at all.  That’s a really insensitive comment your boyfriend made (not to mention an irrational one in the context)—and while my instinct is to be furious with him, it sounds like he may have some issues of his own if not a full blown ED? ...? Because like...even considering that he had cheese on his own order, the way he was thinking about that *POST MOUNTAIN CLIMBING* pizza overall seems...uh, a little bit off.  If he’s struggling in some way himself, it could definitely be skewing his perspective. I hope you can keep that possibility in mind instead of internalizing comments like that. :/ It’s not about you in all likelihood, but maybe it’s something you guys could discuss further at some point? I don’t know.   In any event, you did NOT deserve the oinking! God. Not that anyone ever would, but like. It truly doesn’t even make sense.  Years ago, I worked at a state park in North Carolina. I was frequently stuck at the concession stand which sold mostly junk food, which I thought was super weird! But I would see a lot of extremely serious hikers and mountain bikers come through (amongst many other interesting characters, haha). Sometimes I would apologize for the slim pickin’s and was shocked to see that they often didn’t care...lol. I will never forget this one guy who had the body of a leaned out fucking Greek God who shrugged and said, “I just biked 13 miles. I’ll have a Snickers and a Coke.” (13 too! And I’d bet that wasn’t all he ate.)",False,False

I'm so glad you chose to fuel your body, it was still under maintenance but who knows what could have happened if you didn't? Also, that is a huge accomplishment, congratulations, I'm happy that you chose to reward yourself because you deserve it. And as much as I wanna be like ""leave him and fuck his dad"" people who dont have EDS can hurt us all the time without even knowing. I'll suggest saying that that hurt you or made you uncomfortable as has suggesting that you're also a pig; which you aren't. And your pizza didn't even have cheese on it, I assure you it was fine",False,False

It clocked me in at a whopping 2500 calories from the hike alone (ignoring my BMR). I “pigged out” (really felt like a pig) with 3 sushi rolls and some froyo. Still lost weight. No fking way you truly pigged out considering your level of exercise and the content of the pizza.  My husband makes me feel like a pig sometimes because he can eat the same “quantity” of food as me and feel stuffed the whole day while I’m still hungry but his pizza, for example, will have sausage, pepperoni, pineapple, and double cheese while mine has sauce, spinach, and tomatoes if I’m feeling daring. Of COURSE he’ll feel like a pig after that and of course I’ll be hungry after that.  Remember to mind the true content of your food. He’s oinking because he actually had cheese on his pizza.",False,False
