It's doable, but I was also at a point where I was moving across country on my own to start a new job in a new place where I knew no one, so I was too anxious and nervous and trying to make friends that I just...let go of the habits. Plus I was actually starting to like myself a bit.  (I say ""recovered"" because I relapsed like 3 years back, but that was due to a shitty abusive relationship and not because I handled recovery alone!).",False,False

If the change comes from you and you're motivated to recover it's always easier than if you don't want to recover but are made to eat normally etc. Then you'll just relapse. Strength to you if you decide to recover ðŸ’•,False,False
