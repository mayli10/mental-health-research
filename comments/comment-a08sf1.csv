It’s like the final boss on ultra hard mode. It sounds like you are able to identify a lot of the triggers about Thanksgiving that made it tough to stick to your recovery. That awareness is so important!! Try to be gentle with yourself. Recovery won’t be perfect and will include lots of ups and downs. This dip is temporary.  It sounds like calling your therapist might be a good idea. Even if they don’t respond ASAP, it is good practice in asking for a bit of extra support when you feel you need it. If they do respond before your next session, hopefully your therapist will have some guidance to help!  Sending you lots of compassion! &lt;3",False,False

He's always said I can call whenever I need to, but I've always used that as ""call if you're going to do something that might kill you before your next appointment."" Restricting won't kill me, at least not before Tuesday. ",False,True

If protein is working for you, go with that. Do liquid calories scare you? Or could you maybe eat a berry smoothie or a juice of some sort? I know that helps me when I feel like food is just absolutely off of the table for me. ",False,False

My original plan was to fast but I was able to talk myself into protein. I also live on my own.
