I read it yesterday after just barely stopping myself and it meant a lot and said a lot to me. I didn't purge at all yesterday despite thinking about it relentlessly and it's just gone 11pm now today and I haven't today either. This is off the back of what felt like endless daily purging that started in like October? Maybe? Dunno when exactly it went from 'frequent' to 'constant' but it was really killing me.   Today I ate and I ate a lot but I didn't binge and I really enjoyed and thought about all of the food I ate. And I haven't purged. Hopefully the urge dies down with lack of fulfilment.  \#newyearnewme  Again: thank you. So much.,False,False

I was first diagnosed/hospitalized in 2010, and it feels scary to be taking my ED into this new decade. I find it hard to connect with my original diagnosis now that it's transformed into over exercising rather than pure restriction. I've never been so functional at such a physically unhealthy state and everything is going well in my life - I am incredibly lucky to have a career I love and pays more than the bills, but my relationships with certain friends and my sister are severely faltering. They say they're uncomfortable around me and don't want to see me in the way I am. But I've been way worse, and feel shockingly functional right now.
