I see a lot of the same stuff working in a kitchen in a pub. People complain about the (restaurant)-20 and complain about gaining weight but then eat the same crap on the menu that is way to Rich to have every day.,False,False

Regular customers at coffee shops are the most deluded people when it comes to daily intake.  We used to have a woman who got a venti whole caramel macchiato with 10 pumps vanilla and extra caramel drizzle and when i me a extra she wanted 10+ seconds of just squeezing the tube into the drink and always got a bacon egg croissant. A lot of my coworkers had no idea what they were eating either and would get huge full fat milk sugary drinks with carby carby desserts and when theyd complain about weight gain and i pointed how much they were eating in one meal at work compared to daily intake theyd be :O.   I so rarely allow myself anything from there but the egg white sous vides or some guac with sweet potato chips are a vice.,False,False

I probably get a sweetened drink once when they come out for the season maybe once a month. I like fun coffee but thatâ€™s like eating cheese cake every night.,False,False

Like a banana loaf and a caramel macchiato? Thats an insane intake. A lot of people have no clue what their daily intake is or what cutting down is. I hope diversity day goes alright for you,False,False
