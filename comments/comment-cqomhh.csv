I'm not sure if or when I'll get there, but it would be nice.  I'm pretty fit at this point, and even have abs, but it wasn't easy getting here and the fatigue from undereating has been crazy. I'm going to keep working on increasing my calories slowly to amp up my metabolism until I can feel energized again. I'm wondering if I can ever feel energized at this weight though, I mean, I'm not underweight so I think it should be possible. I hope to not gain any weight with these increases since my TDEE is theoretically 2200, but I expect any gain to be mostly muscle because of how consistent I am with strength training. My metabolism has probably been butchered though ): Even being steadily around 126lbs after 2 months of 300 extra calories a day has me spooked when before that I'd see 124-125 more frequently that I do now.  Sometimes I feel like because I never severely restricted my calories or purged by vomiting that I don't have an ED. I've never been underweight either, I'm just on the cusp. I haven't been diagnosed and know that self-diagnosing isn't a good idea, but I haven't discussed my food issues with a professional. I have an appointment with a counselor next month which will hopefully help me figure things out. My anxiety around food is too insane. I have a work lunch on Monday and have already spent half an hour analyzing the menu I don't want to have to choose from, and still don't know what to eat, but I can't order nothing and sit there not eating like a weirdo.  I used to be 200lbs! The heaviest I saw on the scale was 198, so I could have been even more than that at my heaviest. Moderation is really hard when it comes to eating, but the fact that you're eating intuitively is amazing already. I remember the days of stuffing my face with any and all food I wanted haha. That was NOT healthy, but definitely felt easier.",False,False

I have gone through kicks of taking exercise seriously, but kind of fell off. I was only weigh lifting a little bit back then so I think most of my weight was being carried in my thighs and butt from biking. My dream is to be a fit 135, but going to the gym causes me so much dread.  I was all over the place. Lots of fasting or aiming for 500 calories, with some normal days, and lots of bping. It was so awful and unsustainable which is why I decided to finally try to quit it all. I am so in awe of people who don't binge. Basically, I had to quit purging which incentivized not bingeing and to quit bingeing I had to eat enough. It's what they told me I'd need to do for so long, but I never believed them.  I've never been overweight, but I've been close and don't want to go back there. I am really afraid of it still which is why I still occasionally weigh myself. It is very scary. I have to be pretty mindful about my choices. I still pick low-calorie alternatives to a lot of foods and have to talk myself out of eating ice cream and candy bars on a daily basis. I still eat everything I want to, but I lack a lot of intuition as far as moderation goes.",False,False

Then there would be food at the party which would take 50% of my mental effort to avoid, so I couldn't socialize properly. And if I snapped and ate food, my look would be ""ruined"" by my protruding stomach.
