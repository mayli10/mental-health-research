The main benefit of it is that it aids with sleeping while being non-addictive so you can‚Äôt become dependent on it. I‚Äôd say you‚Äôre safe.,False,False

My issue is more staying asleep than falling asleep and the trazadone actually seems to work better for that (for me) than ambien or lunesta.   I‚Äôm not using it currently b/c my body started to react weirdly (getting that restless feeling like akathisia - which isn‚Äôt a side effect I‚Äôve seen mentioned so maybe I‚Äôm just an oddball). Never had any weight related side effects. It was helpful for quite awhile for me. Hope it‚Äôs helpful for you too!,False,False

I gained weight later, but that was for different reasons üòÇ  I was apprehensive about it too, but I didn‚Äôt have any side effects other than actually being able to sleep at night. YMMV, but I hope it works for you!",False,False
