The suicidal thoughts in particular I know can get really exhausting and overwhelming. I’ll second the suggestion to talk to someone you trust (friend, doctor, etc). You don’t have to find your way out of this alone &lt;3   I’ve got a history of suicidal thoughts and self-harm. They’d been improving significantly, but when I fell back into my old restrictive habits a few weeks ago I noticed that they suddenly returned with a vengeance. I’ve got a few hypotheses as to why this might be...   - I think the lack of proper nutrition has a chemical effect on my brain and body. After all, more and more studies are showing that nutrition is a powerful tool when combatting mental health issues. - The fatigue that comes during significant restriction majorly reduces the odds of me engaging in the positive activities that help me stay stable. I’m likely to just curl up on the couch with the tv or a book I’ve already read before. - The restriction for me often comes from a place of self-loathing or a desire to punish myself. Which has a lot in common with the self-harm and the suicidal thoughts. So I think my brain just becomes wayyy likelier to go to those places...as if these thoughts/behaviors that are sort of all linked together.   As far as dealing with intrusive and repetitive suicidal thoughts, for me the most effective thing is to distract myself. I’ll tend to just sit there with the thought and let it go round and round, building momentum. But for me the suicidal ideation is almost its own addiction, so I super duper can’t afford to feed those thoughts. Fighting it directly doesn’t help since that’s basically “don’t think about pink elephants”. Instead I try to say “Oh, there’s that thought again. Ok. Time to refocus on (...)” I’m lucky to have access to a good therapist and also someone for medications (though no med has helped directly with the thoughts). The therapist in particular is helping me develop healthy tools to deal with life and how I feel about life.",False,False
