When you simply CAN'T react to someone the way you want to, whether bc they hold authority over you (like in your situation at work), or bc they're family or whatever, you try to regain control over the interaction by ""punishing"" the other person in this manner. Which of course means that they are STILL controlling you, in a way, but that's ED brain for you.   Like, I can't exactly shout at mom that she's insidiously toxic and manipulative, so....instead I restrict my diet in ways that both enrage her and satisfy my own need for control. It's my only coping mechanism :/",False,False

I know it is malicious, but I find that itis more to myself as a way to (prove?) that I can hurt myself better than anyone else can hurt me.",False,False
