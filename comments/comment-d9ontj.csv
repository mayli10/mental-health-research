I'm pretty sure this ""holier than thou"" attitude makes everyone around me feel bad about themselves, most people love food for how it tastes, nearly every celebration is centered around a lot of food, and yet everyone knows deep down that treating food like this is just setting back their dieting goals. By being so headstrong when explaining my eating philosophy I feel like I'm touting my disorderly ways as superior.   The worst part is that I've never had anyone argue back against me when I explain myself. People criticise me non stop for fasting, people are always asking me to stop losing weight, but as soon as I say ""I don't want to eat for pleasure, I only eat for nutrition"" all I get is hurt stares.",False,False

One day someone offered me ice cream and I was on autopilot( normally i am very calculated when speaking) and said that I wasn’t planing on being a fatass. I immediately apologized and explained that I have a weird relationship with foods that I don’t have as safe foods.,False,False

It’s super embarrassing. Especially since I really don’t judge other people for their weights.  You save sounded pretty decent to me. People unintentionally hurt others feelings all the time. Nobody’s perfect. At least you realized what happened and tried to fix it.,False,False

Mostly just screwed me in the boob department, and it’s likely it had a hand in me developing endometriosis (scar tissue in my uterus, so it’s kind of deformed and hard for me to ever get pregnant), and my menstrual cycle is so crazily fucked. My hips developed hella early (like 10 or 11- wide hips runs deep in my family), though, so honestly I’m just debating about getting breast implants.",False,False

Numerous times. I feel like our ED brains just program us to ignore those around us and just blurt out shit like this. Lmao,False,False
