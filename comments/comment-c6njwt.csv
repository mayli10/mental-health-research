Stay strong. You're doing a good thing by seeking recovery and something is going to work out to make this a positive experience for you, I'm sure. Good on you for being proactive with your dietitian to find workarounds.",False,False

Really I do have a complicated medical diet. I was in the medical hospital recently (unrelated to ED) and they fucked it up (until I was well enough to give clear directions).,False,True

I’m trying to not catastrophize and have sent them some workaround ideas and am brainstorming with my dietitian so maaaaybe we’ll work something out.   But I was/am pretty upset. I felt really scared and alone and hopeless when I got the call.,False,True

So like if you were allergic to tree nuts and they wanted to give you a peanut butter sandwich they would just stop treating you?,False,False
