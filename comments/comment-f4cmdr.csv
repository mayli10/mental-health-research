They are probably waiting for you to reach out and allowing you time to take space when you need. Sometimes friendships can turn into a bit of a stand-off where one is waiting for the other to reach out. They likely don't know the extent to which you are struggling and you might need to reach out and let them know.,False,False

If my friend went MIA I would assume they want to be left alone until they are ready to talk. And that’s what it really was for the first week right? I know it’s scary but if I were you I would write out a short message saying hey want to catch up soon.,False,False
