The average person intake would 2250 but I've never heard anybody not separate it out by sex. I think it's kind of a useless thing overall tho. Height is too impactful not to factor in.",False,False

Which is kinda useless. But that makes the meal kits even worse if so.",False,False

I have more people to feed though than me so it won’t go to waste. Some of the meals I just can’t do myself. Pasta and bread is a no for me but it’s several meals for my kid. I’m just going to kind of do my own thing with the ingredients. If you simplify some of the food you can remove a lot of calories. Like the rice bowl no chips, no sour cream, no cheese will help some.",False,False

It's nice to have some meal kits since they do have variety and like, high cost ingredients.   You should maybe see if maybe some of the grocery stores by you let you make your order online and then you just go in and pick it up! Sometimes that helps me gets over the panic of shopping, or at least have the anxiety attack in the comfort of my own home lol. I also signed up to receive the like flyers in the mail cause some stores have coupons in there. Smart and final usually has a 10% off coupon each week and good produce prices.",False,False

Plus I make much better meals, much cheaper and healthier that actually fit my dietary restrictions!!! I’m glad I took up the offer of free food tho tbh cus grocery shopping always gives me panic attacks at the store and I’m broke as hell rn so at least free food??

When I first moved out of my parents house I gained sooo much weight partially cause I did the rounds on all the discounted and free meal kits. Gobble was the freaking worst and I didn't even realize it til later. Regularly had 1200 calorie meals.  It's honestly like, insidious. All these meal kits promote themselves as being healthy but they really aren't. The average woman needs 2000 calories to maintain her weight, it is not cool to make these meal kits over half that.",False,False
