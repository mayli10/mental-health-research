Honestly shifts are so busy when you work on your own it gets easier to forgo food. 4 days off a week are nice and allow me to focus on the gym. Hang in there. School is hard. But I love the job so much and am excited for your future!!,False,False

I know how awful it is to feel like things are out of control and you're spiraling. Is there any kind of mental health professional you could be seeing right now? Not as a fix or an answer but just, ya know, as an option or an anchor to a perspective outside of nursing school or whatever? Idk I never get mental health help so I'm not tryna preach but I just really feel for you :(",False,False

Congrats on sticking w school and Iâ€™m sure youâ€™ll get it together once youâ€™re done school, that shit is fucking tough. We canâ€™t blame ourselves too much for using such a huge coping skill we have during such stressful times",False,False

But my RN program was harder than anything since. Forgive yourself for eating right now. You need the calories to study on that level. You can always lose the weight after you finish your program. If you do anything now, try to exercise. In my nursing program, I recorded myself reading my notes and I listened to it while doing the elliptical.... Sorry you're going through this, though. I've gained 50 lbs in grad school. Just starting to lose it again...",False,False
