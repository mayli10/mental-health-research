I used to normally always weigh myself in the morning after I woke up because that’s when I felt like it would be the most “accurate”, but I eventually realized that any sort of number on the scale would just make me miserable. I wanted to stop weighing myself because I knew nothing good ever came from knowing the number, and so I started making myself drink a giant glass of water right when I woke up.   Since I just drank a bunch of water, I wouldn’t want to weigh myself anymore since it would obviously be higher and not completely accurate. And so I haven’t weighed myself in probably a few months now, I can’t really remember the last time I did.   I definitely feel happier not knowing how much I weigh and the urge to weigh myself would slowly go away as each day went on. Plus - drinking all that water in the morning would help me stay hydrated and feel better physically (and mentally!)   I’m not sure if this would work for you, but I figured I would just share my experience. I hope that you can find a way to stop weighing yourself too, or to at least find something that works for you and helps you feel better.  Wishing you the best of luck~",False,False
