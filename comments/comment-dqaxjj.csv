I don‚Äôt self harm or anything, but I‚Äôm worried about my eating. It‚Äôs hard to eat during grief even if you don‚Äôt have an ED so I am struggling. Thank you for your lovely reply. It means so much.",False,True

It isn't safe.  If you can try nutritious liquid calories, that might be the easiest way to handle hunger/food right now. Feeling empty and sick on an empty stomach is a really shitty combination with grief. I get it if that just isn't an option right now, though.  She's at peace now. Nothing will ever hurt her again. I'm so sorry she's gone.",False,False

I didn't answer because it was very late and I was tired. We had been split up for years an we had not spoken to each other for a few weeks. As far as knew things in his life were okay. I figured he was just drunk-dialing me. I was wrong.  It took a long time to process and I'm not sure I'll ever feel truly okay about it but Rivka is right. As much as we want to believe that we could have  made some difference, it's likely we couldn't have.  I'm so sorry that you are going through this. I'm so sorry that she suffered and was in so much pain and I am sorry that you are right now.   You aren't responsible for anyone else's actions. This wasn't your fault. You will get through this.",False,False

I've been on both sides of suicide and I just want you to know that she was going to do this whether or not you called. You were a good friend to her and I hope you can find comfort knowing that you made her life a little better. You deserve peace. üíì",False,False
