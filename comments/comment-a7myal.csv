But I don‚Äôt anymore!! And it‚Äôs so much better not having to worry about the million problems and things and shame it creates (not that we should be ashamed I just did sometimes)   I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll ever be able to sit down and eat a ‚Äúfull‚Äù meal so I don‚Äôt..I do eat but very carefully and if that‚Äôs what I have to do that‚Äôs okay.   It did take awhile for me to stop having urges to purge and when I get stressed I still kinda want to but I have a bunch of other coping skills  Distraction never worked for me..honestly the two main things that keep me on track is not allowing myself to eat to the ‚Äúpoint‚Äô that I have to purge (I‚Äôm fine to eat a big salad for instance but I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll be comfortable eating ice cream ever again)  Reminding myself over and over that it will get better (bloating..changes in pooping..omg the bloating and it DID get better)   And tempering this poor girl and not wanting to end up like her poor soul xx ",False,False

Everyone who thinks it is ok to b/p needs to see this. I asked to be convinced, and you have certainly. I appreciate that you were nervous to share this but did anyway. I'm not sure much else would have truly stopped me...this story made me cry picturing myself or anyone else here in that state.  We deserve so much better, no matter how horrible we think we are. Thank you so much for sharing this. ",False,True

Everyday is a struggle but I refuse to give up. I want to get better so bad, but like you said... it's SO incredibly hard to stop this cycle when it's been going on for so long.   Even if your reply didn't help anyone else, just know you really opened my eyes today and at least this very moment I don't ever want to binge again. I can't imagine someone finding me like that.",False,False

It sounds weird but I feel *really*good if it helps you  I wish I had of seen it earlier, it had such a huge impact on me when literally nothing else did, not the years and years of Drs..family..books..therapy..scare tactics..  And I kind of feel like I‚Äôm a way of that poor girl could see us..she would at least know her death (and the subsequent stuff about it online, can you imagine) was not for no reason.   Something beautiful can come from something very sad. Baby steps..you got this xx   (Every time I went to purge after this literally I couldn‚Äôt even though I wanted to I got scared of purging..and really that‚Äôs not such a bad thing if it potentially saved my life..)   If you want any help or tips to adjust or how to distract from not purging please let me know I‚Äôm not expert but I can tell you what helped me, it‚Äôs tough giving up something that is ingrained..just think of that picture I know it‚Äôs gross but don‚Äôt let that be you sweetheart xx ",False,False

It made me so very upset to think that one day it was very likely on a long enough timeline ( I‚Äôd already been vomiting daily for about 14 years before seeing this) someone might have to find me like that  And literally it‚Äôs what made me stop..every time I‚Äôd go to purge I would think of this image   http://www.2medusa.com/2008/09/bulimia-killswarning-graphic-pictures.html?m=1  I‚Äôm not saying it cured me it was a hard struggle to get over the feelings ..and now I probably restrict more than I should but vomit ?
