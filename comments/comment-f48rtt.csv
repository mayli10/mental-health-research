I just don't have the energy to high restrict for the sake of my physical health anymore. I don't have the energy to meticulously meal plan something that won't even be satiating out of 500 calories or wait until 10pm for an OMAD that'll take more time to cook than it will to eat while drinking copious amounts of Coke Zero in-between.  It's too tiring and energy consuming. But I want this weight off of me as fast as possible and I'm willing to subject myself to misery for a month or so if I have to. Just so I can reach my GW, any close GW, and let myself enjoy maintaining. I don't want to restrict because I don't have the time and energy for restriction. All I can think about is how I want to fast, go as long as I can go, lose as much I can lose. ""I'll slow down later,"" I tell myself. Whether or not that's true is up for debate but the lies I tell myself are the only things keeping me going right now.",False,False

I’m only an inch taller than u. I have a head cold which usually means I am gonna drop weight... even just a couple pounds and then it’s on to the next goal.,False,False

Restricting makes me anxious and irritable, gives me nightmares, and ruins my health, but then I keep coming back to it because of that false sense of happiness.",False,False
