I totally agree with you I think I’m just playing devils advocate. It’s like people doing blow in movies. It’s not “shocking” that chick is super pretty. But it’s not really their responsibility to show how drugs are “bad” ya know. You’re right tho,False,False

Esp for young people watching who may think it always looks like that and it gets them to start. And crazy purging generally gets to be everybody’s reality. I’ve had purge sessions where I don’t look so crazy or gross after but they become few and far between after a while. Also she literally stands up and looks amazing. Not a stray hair out of place or watering eyes or any sick anywhere. It’s irresponsible to portray it like that even if some people somehow never experience the grosser side of purging.,False,True

It is the ugly side but it’s not everyone’s reality. Just throwing out another angle to look at it.,False,False

It’s so irresponsible and as a show that touts itself as being empowering for women it’s really a slap in the face. I even messaged Netflix on twitter to complain.,False,True

Fuck Hollywood for glamorizing the disorders that ruin lives.,False,False
