You're obviously more than a warning tale but I think it's good to share this with other girls who are tempted to abuse lax.  When my ED first manifested I used laxatives a few times, but then I read an article written by a woman who abused them for years and it scared me off. I'm not glad that she had to deal with all of that but I'm glad that she shared her story for others.  I hope you're able to get the surgery and it goes well!",False,False

I still drink caffeinated coffee and haven't been told not to but I haven't asked either.  I have always used dulcolax pills and they're designed specifically to stimulate the intestines which loosens poop and looser poop has made other muscles not need to work as hard. They got lazy and basically collapsed. I'm adding my own theory over the top of what I have been told here now but I use lax to pass a binge so I imagine that lazy muscles trying to push through loads of waste probably doesn't help.  ...so I guess any over use of anything that makes muscles not have to work as hard could cause issues. Maybe I should cut out the caffeine. Damn. I love coffee.,False,True

I usually don’t abuse lax, and this is a helpful reminder for when I think about using it again.  Quick question: does this also apply to food that stimulates the feeling of a lax (like candies)?",False,False
