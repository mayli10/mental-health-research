I‚Äôll never complain about pretty pictures of food, and some of the stuff on there legit looks good, but I will never understand the proliferation of badly lit orange pictures of greasy or watery or droopy food with those reliable captions about calories and fullness. I much prefer the honesty we get on here about how sad someone is that their forty-five calorie lunch was stolen from the office fridge so they‚Äôre having a Monster Zero instead üòÇ",False,False

I thought I was the only one who felt this way. I'm like, I know I have a skewed idea of how many calories is too many, but 600 calories for THAT??  The saddest ones are salads where the OP clearly hates salads. They're like ""filling lunch salad for 600 calories!"" and it's like... for 600 calories, you could have an equally nutritious meal you actually LIKED. Salads are useful to get lots of good veggies into you and to bulk out a small amount of calories (in dressing, cheese, nuts, etc) with lots of low-calorie salad veg. If your salad ends up being 600 calories you fucked up, unless you're eating it because you genuinely love salad.  I just wish I could tell people they don't NEED to EVER eat a salad if they don't want to.",False,False
