That would mean model weight would be 49 kg. That's 108 lbs. Okay so ^(that's actually how much I weigh)  But I mean I totally see how that can be a problem If you were 147cm (4'10"") tall that would be 27 kg (59 lbs) which would absolutely not be a healthy weight. I know the MI scale is different for Asians, but that would still be a BMI of around 11 which is way too low. And I really don't get where these magazines got off telling women to be under 49kg regardless of height. I mean, I'm only two and a half inches taller than average and clearly the intention was not for people like me for a lot of reasons, but there are women over there who are as tall as I am. At 49kg I'm underweight. There are women over there who are taller than I am. If they were to follow these rules they would be severely underweight. The ""model weight"" guideline obviously wasn't made for the tallest people in the country if their heaviest guideline is 49kg which means they're just blatantly telling young girls that they should be starving themselves to a point of major sickness in order to be considered pretty enough. It's absolutely disgusting. I'm glad these magazines aren't around anymore. I hope the kids of your countries today haven't been passed down these terrible guidelines.",False,False
