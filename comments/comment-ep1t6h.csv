Breathing in feels pretty normal but breathing out feels weak and shallow. The most amusing consequence is going #2 reaches an even higher difficulty level because I can’t breathe properly, lol. Someone here suggested maybe it’s my body trying to adjust to glycogen depletion, but it’s happened even when my restriction incorporates carbs (so I dunno whether I’m actually in ketosis or not). I’ve tried so many google search terms but nothing so far..,",False,False

These could result from decreased respiratory muscle strength and/or abnormal control of breathing.  (hypercapnia is excessive carbon dioxide in the bloodstream, usually because of inadequate respiration. PFTs = pulmonary function tests and PEFRs = peak expiratory flow rates.)",False,False
