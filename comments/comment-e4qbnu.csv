I have OCD and have had similar thoughts about developing psychosis. It's a very positive thing that you don't want to develop an eating disorder. Have you done much exposure therapy for OCD? Techniques from therapy would likely be helpful here.  Given that you've got a positive relationship with food and your body, and have actively managed to gain weight, these things are likely protective against developing an ed.",False,False

OCD really plays on ‘what ifs’ and can twist thoughts and facts around. And health anxiety is a very common focus of OCD thoughts, and this seems like a type of health anxiety for you. Given that you don’t think you have body or food issues right now but seem to be more concerned about developing them in the future  That being said, you’re quite possibly at a high risk of developing an ED, just by virtue of obsessing over the possibility.  Are you seeing a therapist for your OCD? Or is there a counselor you could talk to? You should really talk to them about this concern before OCD makes your anxiety around food any worse.",False,False
