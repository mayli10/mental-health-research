If so, could you tell them about what you're going through? If not, I'd really suggest reaching out now. You sound like you're in so, so much pain, but this definitely need not last forever if you get the help that can benefit you.   You're *definitely* not all those things you say you are. I don't wanna be invalidating but... when we're in a bad headspace sometimes our thoughts get twisted around and we don't see things properly and hate ourselves even when we don't need to. I may not know you but I'm sure you have many, *many* good points, just like any other human being. And you're someone who's just trying their best and wanting to feel okay.   I know it's really really hard but please be kind to yourself okay :( treat yourself the way you would treat anyone else. You deserve forgiveness and peace and confidence, even when you don't meet your own expectations.   Sending love. Stay strong &lt;3",False,False
