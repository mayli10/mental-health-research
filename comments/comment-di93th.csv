I remember one time I ate some veggies and chicken from a restaurant I didn't fully trust and I ended up so sick and in so much pain I was stuck in my bed for like 5 weeks. It was a few weeks before I could even manage to drag myself to the clinic. That is an insanely long time for me to be sick as it usually takes a few days at most to get better when I overeat, but it can be a huge problem when I do. Like the other day was Thanksgiving and I tried to eat a small portion, but the turkey slice I grabbed was bigger than I wanted even though it was the smallest one. The mashed potatoes and stuffing were also pretty sticky so when I tried to scoop them I could get them off the spoon without taking way more than I wanted. I hate wasting food so I ate everything, but then later that night I was in so much pain that I couldn't sleep. I tried purging, but I think it was too late for that. I drank baking soda in water because I heard that can induce vomiting but still had to try sticking my finger down my throat. Neither worked. It seems I have almost no gag reflex. The baking soda actually settled my stomach a bit too. I know that one time when I got really sick an acid-reducing medication helped, but another time it made me feel worse.   From everything I've researched I don't personally think I have gastroparesis, but your post was very relatable. I think I might have a kind of inflammatory bowel disease like maybe Chron's disease or something. The symptoms of those match up the closest to my symptoms. It's not a total fit, but I guess not everyone has the same symptoms. The only better fit in terms of symptoms is histamine intolerance, but it doesn't seem like eating low-histamine foods or taking an anti-histamine helps me at all in that regard. That just helped my allergies. Of course, I did start taking it at the same time as the medicine that made my stomach problems worse. I'm just kind of hoping the gastroenterologist I saw starts giving a shit about me at our follow up appointment so I can figure out what's actually wrong.",False,False

I should have lost around 5 lbs between visits to see my family based on my eating habits and increased activity, but somehow I managed to stay the same weight. It's like I can never get my body weight to do what I expect it to. When I was ready for recovery and tried to gain weight I ate like crazy for a whole month, like fast food twice a day with snacks and stuff, but only gained 1 lb. It took me a while year to get up 15 lbs after being very careful about my health and not trying to rush things. I ended up in the hospital one night because I have a problem where eating makes me sick and it got really bad as I gained more weight. I lost about 8 lbs in a month without trying after that. I sort of gave up even trying to maintain my weight since it wasn't even working and just made me feel worse. Now I eat like 300-500 calories under my TDEE every day (*varies by how I feel, can even be way less sometimes*) and I have not lost any weight in over a month. Even without losing weight though I feel like I'm starting to get problems that occurred when I was at my lowest weight and I could swear I look thinner. Maybe I just convinced myself I do because I wasn't bloated one time and I can see my veins easier than I used to. I suppose I did make some big prescription changes about a month ago which have impacted my health, so maybe my metabolism has dropped? I know that one prescription doesn't give me headaches like the one I used to take did, but it does interfere with my abdominal problems a little bit. Perhaps it's causing me to retain more weight. Like maybe water retention or something. I really couldn't begin to guess. Maybe I'm not the kind of person you wanted to respond to your post.",False,False

If I keep eating to appear ""normal"", I feel intense nausea as if I've just been on a mega binge, to the point I daren't move for fear of throwing up.  The most recent case happened at the weekend, and I could do nothing but lie on my side for 4 hours. I had to walk home during that time though (separated parents), and I cried pretty much the entire way due to the pain.  The following day, my stomach was super unsettled (re: kept having bm's) and really tender in the middle of my torso in line with the bottom of my ribcage. Just touching it caused mild pain. It's still like it today, 2 days later, though not as bad.  I'm pretty sure it's gastroparesis (delayed gastric emptying), but I can't know for sure unless I have tests done. Not surprising though considering how long I go without food, so my bowels and stomach don't have much work to do, and subsequently aren't used to functioning properly.",False,False
