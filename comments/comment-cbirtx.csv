It seems like he's prioritizing his sexual relationship with you over your physical and emotional well-being, which is not okay. And even if it wasn't just sex that was his priority, even if it's really the emotional relationship he values, it's still not more important than YOU and your health. I don't know much about relationships but I'm just getting bad vibes about it from what you said in your post.",False,False

If he wants to maintain a relationship with her he should be understanding that it will be difficult at times.",False,False

She told him that there was no other solution, and that it was what she wanted to do.   Imagine dating an alcoholic and getting them sober after a lot of effort. They become distant, and they insist that the only way to fix the situation is to go back to drinking.  You can't fight somebody else's addiction for them, and it sounds like he's given in.",False,False

I am sure I am a hypocrite because I feel the same way and have done that exact thing but I can tell you its not just the sex, its letting yourself be vulnerable again physically and mentally with him. Im sure he is frustrated and thinks by letting you do what you want at least its a step toward you both feeling comfortable with eachother again. Id try to open up more to him and let him touch you, and be affectionate slowly but surely and try to accept his touch again. Its not easy but its worth it. You dont need to be an island.",False,False
