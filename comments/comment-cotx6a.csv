These behaviors can involve food or may relate to body image or mood. Judging by these behaviors alone would be insufficient: many people eat health foods or consume large quantities of food and do not have eating disorders. The quantity of behaviors may be an indication; for instance, this person engages in behaviors multiple times per week or even per day. This being said, many people keep their behaviors a secret and it is therefore difficult to gauge based on behaviors alone. &gt; &gt;The level of obsession around eating disorder thoughts and behaviors can distinguish disordered eating from an eating disorder. It can be normal to think about food when hungry or what one might have for the next meal. For those struggling with an eating disorder, however, the thoughts are generally all-consuming; the individual thinks about calories, taste, food avoidance, or where to buy food, etc. This level of obsession can impair focus, the ability to stay present, and sleep, among other things. While it’s difficult to judge how much time and energy another person is spending thinking about food or using behaviors, the individual may offer this information or it may be evident that they spend more time in the grocery store, or perhaps isolate more frequently, and their general behaviors and patterns have changed. &gt; &gt;Finally, the level of functionality is a distinguishing factor. When someone’s eating patterns take them away from normal functioning, this can be a strong indication of an eating disorder. This can include a woman who will not go out with friends because of the fears around their judgment while she eats. Or perhaps an individual does not attend work or school on more than one occasion due to behavior use like a compulsion to exercise. While these examples may sound extreme, those struggling often cite impairments of their social functioning as well as other obligations, due to their eating disorders.  tl;dr Our culture perpetuates disordered eating, what with a focus on dieting and ""good/bad"" foods. This increases the risk for someone to develop an eating disorder, but disordered eating isn't always a precursor. Eating disorders are all consuming, from the thoughts that plague your mind, to the behaviours you engage in, and effect many aspects of your life, not just meal times.",False,False
