Going to try hard to stay positive after having a few meltdowns this week, thanks for the wishes and advice ❤",False,True

It's really a helpless feeling and I hope that I can at least get my mobility back instead of being stuck at home all day.  In hindsight, I'm not sure whether crossing the marathon's finish line limping was sheer commendable determination, or my legs were just powered by my ED brain.  Thank you for your thoughtful reply, it really means a lot ❤",False,True

Let me say, however, after the surgery you should be eating more than usual. If you eat less, it will take a lot longer to heal and you may not heal properly. I'm sure they will have you doing physical therapy. Maybe mention in there that exercise is your stress relief so you're looking for something you can do while recovering. They'll be able to give you exercises to keep (most of) your body strong. There are ways to get cardio in without running, like one of those exercise ""bikes"" except with the handles you move back n forth? I'm sure your doctors and physical therapists will be happy that a client is actually trying to stay in shape rather than use it as an excuse to do nothing.  Anyways, again, I'm sorry. I'm the same way as you with exercise so I can understand the devastation of just having to stop. Good luck",False,False

I hope the surgery helps keep your knee in good shape for the future. ❤️  Are there any exercises you are cleared to do that wouldn’t aggravate your knee? Swimming or yoga or something? Not that you need to, but could possibly be something to help you feel a bit better physically and mentally.",False,False
