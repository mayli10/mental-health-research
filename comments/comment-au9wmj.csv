Severe restriction is a huge binge trigger for me. It's really best for me to just give up both extremes and learn to embrace moderateness.,False,False

I found it helps too because I space out how much I eat and since it takes 20 minutes for the brain to register the body is full, most of the time the binge urges pass before the alarm is up.

And about your second para, i couldn’t relate more lol. That’s exactly what happens with me. ",False,True

And when I am not fasting, I let myself eat things I was craving. (I’d buy single servings of sweets.) when I break my fast, I try to eat until satiety. Then I put a timer on if I feel the binge urges. I have to distract myself for the duration of the timer. When the timer goes off and I’m still feeling hungry, I’ll have something small with water. And repeat the cycle if I still feel like I want to eat.    The most important thing tho and the hardest thing to combat is the feeling you ate something and now you’ve undone everything so you eat even more. I find when I’m in that sorta mind state, I’ll eat even though I’m not hungry but because I can which is dumb lol. ",False,False
