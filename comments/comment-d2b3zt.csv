Some of it is a bit too ""woo-woo"" at parts but I overall really like a lot of the messages driven home (especially in the first 50 pages!).  If your body doesn't want to lose the weight, I honestly wouldn't try to force it or you'll just hurt yourself. You sound like you're doing a lot for yourself already! The stress of law school may be throwing your hormones out of whack, which is throwing your body out of whack. Are you bringing yourself further stress with your extracurriculars? Make sure you make time for yourself to do activities you actually enjoy, not being miserable at the gym (if you are miserable there, that is).  Little bits I enjoyed from the book:  ""The most basic form of self-love is caring for yourself. It's not about green juice or water or vitamins or meditation though. It's about doing what's in alignment with you.""  ""Caring for yourself is loving yourself. I started to look at what self-care meant to me, and when I was honest I realized I didn't really like kale salad, I was sick of green juice, and I was burned out on yoga.""  ""Self care has nothing to do with what you do but with why you do it.""",False,False
