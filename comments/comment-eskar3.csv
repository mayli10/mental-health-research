Yeah I was having some binge days and my dad was like where is my big Reese’s peanutbutter cup ( I got him those big 1/2 pound Reese’s cup for christmas) and I was like ohhh well I ate them. And I hate his chocolate covered pretzels and a whole thing of chocolate peanutbutter icecream. All his. I felt so bad so I gave him some money and he always comment “your still hungry” LIKE NO I’m not hungry but I haven’t eaten for days soo. 😂 and then the next day I didn’t eat.,False,False
