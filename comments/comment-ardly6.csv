I swing between binging and extreme restriction, and have had issues with purging, but I always thought I was just a fatty who had poor self control and couldnâ€™t stay on a diet. Public school health class and pop culture made it seem like EDs were about pretty teen girls who were gracefully starving themselves for male attention because of evil magazine ads and fashion. When I finally read real stories about food issues and emotional eating it was like the lights finally turned on. Itâ€™s not what you do that defines you, itâ€™s why you do it. ",False,False
