I've been trying to avoid the nausea pills just cause I dont like to take pills ever since I tried to od and got extremely sick but I might have to do it.  I'm just worried if I tell my doctor she is going to put me in the hospital or something because that has happened before but i was suicidal at that time and I wasn't sure if they could put me in the hospital for being pregnant and not gaining weight since technically you are harming yourself and baby.,False,True

A lot of people do things that can be harmful before they know they are pregnant, and have totally healthy babies. My sister drank a lot of alcohol before she found out and my nephew was fine. Just please try to eat enough now that you are aware!  Is it easier to have liquid calories? Can you have things like Ensure or something if eating is hard for you? Would something calorie-dense work, like peanut butter?  Definitely talk to your doctor. They can give you medicine to help with the nausea. And I know it might be hard to admit but if you can, please tell them you were restricting. Your doctor can figure out better than we can if your baby is at risk because of that.",False,False
