But if you need to talk let me know! I understand both sides of this bullshit!,False,False

I just couldn't get to know people and it fucked me up big time and I ended up losing an opportunity to get to know someone beautiful and worth getting to know.   &amp;#x200B;  As much as it doesn't feel like it, you are in control of the date just as much as he is. You have a say in literally everything you do, from the activity your date is centered around to the sexy time you do or do not have. It's all important that you're comfortable with it all.",False,False

The bad part is that when my bipolar is bad, my ed gets worse, so it’s like compounded mental illness. Life really fucked us :,)  Sending lots of support tho!! It’s a tough time but I know we can get stable and recover, I’m just not there yet",False,True

I also have bipolar disorder and man did we get fucked! Like one of the two is bad enough but shit. We got two! And they’re both things that make people think we’re crazy.  I tell people I don’t date because I don’t trust anyone which is actually true but honestly I’m more worried about not being able to hide things from them which is NOT healthy.,False,False
