He's totally normal and healthy which is why he's trying to manipulate his toxic partner into un-breaking up with him. //s   See how silly that sounds!? If you feel like you're going crazy and his version of reality keeps changing but is overwriting yours, you are being gaslighted. In fact, the end goal of toxic people is to make other people feel toxic and throw suspicion off themselves. If he's making you feel crazy/toxic.... It's working and he is for sure toxic and you should get far away! Why would he WANT to be with a toxic person if he was being truthful?",False,False

Life feels too long and something not that great is always bound to happen. The two arrows of suffering really resonates with me. The first arrow hurled at you is the external stuff that you can't control and the second arrow of suffering is the one you shoot yourself.

He ""admitted"" his faults and I thought that was enough - to be aware of what he's done.   In the beginning he was obviously manipulative and was going to leave him but kept giving him chances. I guess things didn't lessen or get better like I thought they have... It feels like he just got smarter about it learning what to say and what not to to keep me around.",False,True

I worry I'm the toxic one because of what he filled my brain with but I've noticed a pattern that he tries to stay calm in situations but he longer things don't go his way, his demeanor changes.

Toxic people will always try to manipulate you and use their charm to pull you back in, but you know that you're right and you know that your gut is far more trustworthy than he'll ever be. Just keep reminding yourself of that.  Don't be ashamed that it took you two years to get out of this. Be proud that you managed to get yourself out before it became three years, or even more.  I know it's stressful, but you did what was best for you and know that your life is going to be so much better without his presence poisoning it. üíó",False,False
