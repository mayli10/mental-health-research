I really don’t know how I can live with these thoughts for the rest of my life. It’s absolutely fucking miserable.   My fiancé really wants me to go to therapy &amp; I’m considering it but if I’m always going to have these thoughts and I’m just going to have to just deal with it then it doesn’t even seem worth it  I need the thoughts to go away,False,False
