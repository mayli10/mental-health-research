I do this crap all the time. Just like wondering why I‚Äôm huge and counting their meals like ‚Äî- wtf. Obvi he doesn‚Äôt know I‚Äôm doing this but I hate when men are like ‚Äúeh didn‚Äôt eat today‚Äù meanwhile inside you‚Äôre dying after not eating for like only 3 hours üòÇ,False,False

I do the same thing with my partner-- he's a very skinny dude who forgets to eat all the time (jealous, haha) and I feel like a concerned mother hen. Have you eaten enough today?? That's a pretty small portion, can I get you seconds??  However, from your post, you don't sound like you're being nagging, just that you care about him. If you keep these thoughts confined to your head and don't get too upset about it when he doesn't eat what you'd like him to, it isn't a problem. Plenty of people with ED's enjoy providing the people they care about with food.",False,False

He eats the same breakfast and lunch every day and it‚Äôs 99% carbs (with the remainder being fat) so I try to make sure I make something high in protein every night for dinner. If I make something low-cal, I make sure he eats significantly more than me so he‚Äôs getting enough. Thank Christ cauliflower and kale are two of the vegetables he actually likes, so I riff on those a lot. It‚Äôs less an obsession than just a really vested interest‚Äî I love him and I want him to be healthy. He also hates most fruit so I also try to cook things high in Vitamin C. ",False,False

Idgaf about his calories (he's perfect weight), but holy fuck the amount I have to bite my tongue and internally scream because he ate something high in saturated fat/sodium/whatever is ridiculous. *Never mind all week I've lived of coffee, protein bars, and crackers...*   It legit is one of the few things he actually gets pissed about me being unreasonable about. But it's so internally distressing for me, I wish I could switch it off.    I've found forcing my attention to positive components of his diet (lots of fruit!) has been beneficial. Another helpful thing is having a relatively consistent ""base menu"" we eat, with room for flexibility and variety, and one agreed no judgement meal out per week. ",False,False
