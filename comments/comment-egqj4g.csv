So doing the dishes, vaccuming, chore things I guess.  Maybe getting out of the house, going to a park, or going for a walk- in which you dont have to talk you can just listen to music.   Not sure if you live with your step mom, so maybe chores are out of the question, in that case does she like flowers? Flowers are usually pretty good.  If you both do memes, send her some funny ones, its nice to know that someone thought you would like something, and are being thought of.",False,False

Getting more quiet time to relax that she wouldn't normally have could be a really thoughtful gesture.,False,False
