Just get through the moment and then use every tool that you have to get yourself back to a place where you feel okay after the fact.",False,False

Or just say you don't want all that and you like oysters plain. They should have them in the shell if they're an oyster bar. You usually get a few at a time, like 3 for $6 or whatever",False,False

I really appreciate your advice and support. Part of me just wants to run away as fast as I can, but that's the life I've been living for eight years now and it's so lonely.  I wish I could believe that one meal out (even if it's ""too much"") won't do anything bad to my body.",False,True

I know it's probably stating the obvious but oysters are low calorie. Mussels and clams too. If they have a dish with mussels in broth it looks like a lot of food but mussels are tiny. Just skip the broth.,False,False

You could try asking for a different dressing on the salad, one that feels safer, claim issues with dairy? It wouldn't look as strange as eating a dry salad, and the fat in any dressing helps with vitamin absorption. I really want to encourage you to go to this lunch, and to do your best to get a """"""normal"""""" meal. Remember that you can always take breaks and step away to the bathroom to regroup if it's extremely stressful to you. Also, if you can try something besides the salad, a lot of times the portion sizes are larger than a normal portion, so you could split it in half and bring the rest home. Try to focus on the conversation when you're there, and then do some self-care when you get home. You can get through this.",False,False
