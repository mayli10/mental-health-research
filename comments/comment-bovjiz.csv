I think you should accept feeling like shit before accepting anything else.    Then you can say fuck it and put on some comfortable clothes that you don’t feel absolutely disgusting in and go have some fun! And work out! And go on walks/hikes/bike rides.  Then eventually your new habits will help you lose weight (maybe don’t aim for your LW since you’re in recovery! Please don’t undo your recovery) And if you do strength training you can gain muscle. You’ll feel stronger which is insanely motivating.  Two years ago I had gained anywhere from 20-30 pounds and felt exactly the way you do now. I stayed in and got high and ate whatever I felt like. That only made me gain more haha. But I forced myself to care about myself and picked up weights.   I will be 100% honest and admit going to the gym for the first year was awkward as hell for me. I only wore baggy T-shirt’s and kept my head down. But now I’m ready to push the beefy dudebros off of the bench when they’re in my way lol jk  But now I looooove weight lifting and am addicted to getting stronger. It’s so awesome knowing I could barely do a 10lb (22kg) bicep curl and now am doing 25lb (55kg) bicep curls (on a good day lol) maybe not so humble brag, but I’m fucking proud. Getting stronger is something I look forward too.   Anyways I just wanted to give an example of someone who knows intimately how you feel. But my point is, getting off the couch and getting sick of feeling sorry for myself were the best things I ever did. My life in SO many aspects had changed because I decided not to give up on myself. Yes I still have disordered thoughts and struggle EVERY SINGLE DAY. but the struggle is less now that I have something to feel good about. Shit even if you pick up a hobby like painting or writing, that could help your confidence ten fold.   Also hit up some friends to hang out with! Don’t be all alone. You deserve better.    Just don’t give up. Vent here when you have one of those bad days.",False,False
