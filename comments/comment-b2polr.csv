Im pretty sure my ED developed mostly because of my mom. I had hated my body and wanted to lose weight for years but never did anything about it till my mom started saying how I was eating to much, why am I eating so much, Im wasting all of her money, stop eating so much, etc.      Her comments made me start starving myself all day until Id come home stoned and possibly drunk and binge on food because I was so hungry.      I think she might also have an ED. Always cold, “Im not fat cause I eat to much, Im fat because I dont eat enough”, carefully portions out certain foods by the number of items on the suggested serving (like 20 pieces of chips type of counting, not using a food scale) and gets mad if you take one, into fad diets, ect.      She also has a drinking problem. Like she tried giving me a lap dance at my Gpas 50th bday when I was 12 because I had severe anxiety and wouldn’t go dance. Shes done other crazy shit while drunk.",False,False

I'm so sorry you had to hear that from someone that should be a source of support. The silver lining may be that you can RECOGNIZE that it's fucked up and that it's not a family cycle you want to continue for yourself. I know it doesn't help in the moment, but honestly, if you're trying to break that kind of toxic family legacy (alcoholism, EDs in general, addictive tendencies) recognizing it for what it is and resisting it is such a huge, important thing -- the fact that you hadn't purged in two months is fantastic and you should be proud of that.
