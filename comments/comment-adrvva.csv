Trust me you're waaaayyyyy better off. First you tell yourself ""just this once"", then only after dinner, then you"" only did it twice today I'll restrict tomorrow."" Then one day you wake up in the morning and do it and next thing you know you've spent an entire year doing it all day every day and you have no idea how to stop! I would give anything to just be a restrictor/faster! ",False,False

But trust me, after 25 years of AN I am sooooooooooooo glad now that I can’t make myself purge. It’s literally a gift for me from the universe, because I’d be kidding myself if I said I would have done it in moderation or had been able to stop.  I’ve seen what it’s done to others, people close to me who are in a really bad state now because of it. We really are the lucky ones",False,False
