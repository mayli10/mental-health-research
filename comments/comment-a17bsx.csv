Went back and forth between restricting and b/p for a few years, then “recovered” and gained some weight. I know it sounds ridiculously simple but the binge urges just stopped once I allowed myself to just eat like a semi normal person. I think it was a combination of not having the mindset of “forbidden” foods, and not being at a dangerously low weight anymore where it felt like my body would override my brain in a way and make me eat.",False,False
