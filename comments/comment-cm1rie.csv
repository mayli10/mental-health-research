It reminds me of a study where researchers got anorexics to put on nylon body suits. They distorted the size of their body and cut off the head portion and showed them to participants to pick out the real, unedited picture. [I can't find that particular one right now but here's a similar one that used 3D scanned-in models.](https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Illustration-of-real-body-shape-variation-across-each-row-in-individuals-with_fig1_321135425)   What bugs me about it is that we don't diagnose people with BDD like this. As far as I can tell it's why the pain scales doctors office's use are considered a problem. It's all up to someone's interpretation and the chances that the DSM includes them in the criteria. It's the same thing people have been saying about anorexia's criteria being too restrictive.   BUT IDK. I'm not qualified to dissect the DSM or anything. It's just a lil sus.",False,False

Body dysmorphia quite literally makes you see your own body differently than it really is. I often look in the mirror and see my body and think I look bigger than people who I know objectively are bigger than me. Something I've noticed in conjunction with this is that it's only my body that's effected by it. When I'm fully dressed and therefore covered by my clothing (this is especially noticeable when wearing form-fitted clothes) I don't have those issues because I can't see my body. A form-fitted shirt and skinny jeans that are loose on me make me look thinner to myself which is weird because they objectively should make me look bigger.,False,False

It's simply common among people with eating disorders. Perhaps there are people who don't understand BDD and think they have it, but I imagine that issue is very small, that it's not common.

It is a societal problem, yes, but everything is, so that doesn't help.  Walking around saying ""Oh my god, my friend called me anorexic yesterday because I'm so skinny haha!!"" is just straight up no questions asked fucking rude, and for us disordered people I think it's honestly easier to tell whether someone genuinely struggles than we'd like to admit. I'll always think that it's okay to make assumptions, if only to keep them to ourselves. They're just opinions and impressions combined into a conscious stance on a person (or anything else).  I have the right to call the girl around the corner who makes jokes about ED's and her own legs in an obvious ""fishing for compliments"" manner- while she's backhandedly shittalking the overweight girl at the other side of the room- a snarky bitch, whether I think she's disordered or not, and wherever her behaviour is coming from. I'll assume she isn't struggling with an ED because she is disrespecting the possibility that that other girl is struggling. I don't have the right to take this as far as shittalking her or putting my assumptions out in the open, possibly misleading others, but I do have the right to hate her for how she's dragging the image of ED's to shit and to criticize her for her behaviour, if only in an attempt to empower myself.

I probably put much too much significance on the way certain parts of me look and how much fat I have on me, and it affects how I see my value as a person, but I think my view of my body is pretty accurate nonetheless.

And when I say that, I don't mean that it's not a problem. Of course if it makes people suffer it's a problem, but calling it mental illness almost makes it seem like we think these feelings are weird or unwarranted. If that makes sense, you know? Plus our history of calling anything and everything mental illness...   It just kinda makes sense to me that we would end up here.

We discuss how seeking validation in this way is not healthy and how to address the thought processes behind it. So no, I am not making any assumptions and know exactly to question why a non disordered person feels the need to disagree.  But yes, it still bothers me. Because it limits the way in some people can acknowledge their own disorder (e.g. but everyone feels that way, all teenagers hate their bodies ...) as well as self-confidence then being treated as a negative trait, as ""people should be humble not cocky"". It encourages people to put themselves down, which becomes harder and a pattern for those who are already struggling.   So yeah, it still annoys me when I see people I personally know who have plenty of self confidence post pictures with captions like ""I look so fat in these pictures"" or ""omg all my friends tell me I'm anorexic bc I'm so skinny"" or ""I'm so ugly there but I'll post it anyway"" because they seek validation from others and get likes or sympathy.
