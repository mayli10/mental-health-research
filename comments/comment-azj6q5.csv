For example there are fair skinned Indians, and dark skinned Koreans. Does it make them any less of their race simply because the color of their skin is not the norm? No. So I don't understand why people make remarks that 'tanning is racist' (a post on Instagramreality picked on an asian model who got a tan, saying that she's 'just a pale asian girl' irl) or filling your lips makes you want to be black.

You do you and if it helps you then good for you but personally,  I’m not down with that sub at all. There’s a lot of hating on people and posting pics of them at their worst or unaware they’re being photographed, which is just mean spirited in my opinion. Let people present themselves as they want to and move on with your life already.     I get the point that it’s supposed to help women not compare themselves to impossible standards so if that helps some get to recovery then good for them. But my ED is rarely about comparing myself to some obviously airbrushed model. Mine has been about hating every inch of my body and wishing there was less of it because I feel like a worthless human. Or it’s about having one thing in my life I feel like I have control over, I can hide, I can keep.   And those “nice guy” comments are the same thing men, and some women, have been doing to women for decades. “Make up is false advertising”. “You don’t need to wear makeup, you’re beautiful as you are.” Blah blah blah. But only flirts with/become friends with girls who have makeup on.   Blah blah blah. “Let me control how you present yourself to the world and what you do that feels good to you.” I’ve called out so many guys in this. I’m like, “You’re friends with me and my girls who all wear makeup. But no one has ever seen you even speak to Lisa or Cassandra or Helen who never wear make up or get their hair done”.   I swear a lot of them live in this weird cognitive dissonance place where they want a woman who just grew up looking photoshopped.  I just feel like that sub is a pit full of insecure people trying to take others down and that spirit is toxic to me.  But if someone is in a place where it helps them feel validated as real, then that’s good. I’m just not in that place in my life right now. ",False,False
