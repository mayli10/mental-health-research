Its basically a roller covered by needles that makes microscopic wounds in your skin, so your skin makes new skin to heal it. I've done it and got lots of compliments on my complexion.   Do your own research because you have to be very sanitary with it, don't do it too often, get the right size needle for body area etc.   I hope it helps!",False,False

I gained some weight during a growth spurt so my thighs were covered in them- deep and red and looking almost like scratches. They're all white and practically invisible now, I only really notice them by touch those days.",False,False

I've only gotten them from a growth spurt when I was a kid but a couple years later max (I don't really remember as I didn't care if I had stretch marks or not back then) they were fully faded with no cream even. As an adult you have to know where they are to notice them or the lighting has to be very specific. Sorry to say they won't vanish overnight but it's something ðŸ’ž,False,False
