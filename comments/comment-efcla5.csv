I'm vegan, but I wish I wasn't so I could egg whites and greek yogurt and other low-carb, high-protein food.   But I agree that you need to put yourself first in this situation. Eat foods that will help your recovery and make you feel good, whether they're plant-based or not.   For the bloating, what's helped me is drinking smoothies and eating cooked foods instead of raw food. Those will help break the fiber down which makes it easier for your body to digest. You can also try taking some digestive enzymes before your meals to help your body break the food down.",False,False

You get the protein, texture, and taste of scrambled eggs without the ""cruelty"" aspect. Sounds like you may have orthorexic tendencies. Regardless, I hope you do the best to take care of yourself, even if that means including small amounts of animal products in your diet.",False,False

I donâ€™t know if itâ€™s a crutch, I donâ€™t know anymore. I just feel such intense guilt surrounding different foods again and itâ€™s a lot for my brain. Iâ€™m just trying to do the right thing, but also the right thing when it comes to my beliefs.",False,True

Like if I could at least have egg whites again it would be so much easier to make tasty safe food.  But really, I think you need to put yourself first with this. If you think adding these safe foods (maybe even just in small amounts) back into your diet will help you eat more / make recovery easier then I would recommend that. But if they are just there as a crutch to aid your ed getting worse, then maybe it's a good thing to not consume them?  Also, idk how long you have been vegan for, but if it's recent, my body personally started getting used to the higher volumes / fibre after a while and then stopped bloating as much, but maybe check in with a doctor if it carry's on?",False,False

I just match the people around me for how much I eat. I think you have to have pretty excessive amounts of fiber to get bloated from it though? At least that's what it looks like from a quick Google search but it probably scales with body weight so you might need less to get the effects from fiber.",False,False

I deal with anorexia, have for a long long time. I donâ€™t binge, just eat â€˜normallyâ€™...or try to. Iâ€™ve relapsed so many times at this point.  The bloating comes from the fiber I think? I have no idea. Maybe from just eating a â€˜normalâ€™ amount.",False,True

At least when you binge you got that fiber to digest it quick :P but that sounds rough, I just go the anorexia route cause I'm too small brained to think about what I eat, so I just don't",False,False
