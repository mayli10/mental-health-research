If all that guys care about is how skinny you are (which, I've learned, is true sadly) than wouldn't that make you realize that the attention your friend gets is fake?

It really makes me realize how fake they are and that, sure, being noticed and cared about on a superficial level is nice... but it's not real and it's really just a tool for becoming close with people who see past your appearance. IDK, I guess I'm struggling with wanting constant male attention because I felt really, really bad about how I looked and than I started unintentionally losing weight and getting more attention- and because I didn't even realize how much weight I had lost, it ended up being one of those surreal things where everyone treats you different and perfect and you actually see the distinction of ""attractive/thin"" privilege.   &amp;#x200B;  Don't feel bad about being jealous of your best friend, I think that's something everyone faces- especially if their best friend is a Stacy.
