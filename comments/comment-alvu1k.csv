I have the Tazo Vanilla Bean Macaron tea. It smells like heaven and I taste....nothing. Added some milk thinking it might make it richer....nope.

I’m drunk at a study abroad party for the students leaving(that includes me) and I can’t have a good time because all I can think about is the 1,000 calories I probably consumed. I want to scream and cry but I don’t want to put this on my friends here and I feel so frustrated. This is the worst time for my EDNOS to relapse because I’ve been sick for the past 6 months of the 11 that I’m here and I can’t even enjoy this. Studying abroad allowed me to escape my abusive ex, but it will never let me break free of my eating disorder. I wish I could disappear, I’m so ungrateful for this opportunity. But woohoo, I haven’t purged in a month.",False,False

It's been a few weeks of slipping but I'm saying it to y'all so it finally means something I guess. I'm relapsing even if not fully as bad.   I have plans. Calorie counts. Food bought for this. Goal weights. Exercises. Laxatives and attempts to purge. Triggering myself to stop binges because I fail at purging.   I spent last weekend trying my damndest to force my body to fucking vomit for once. I researched it. Nothing. So I said fine that's it restricting by whatever means necessary. I'm about one more shame spiral away from Bronkaid. I spent a whole lecture calculating calories and tdee and all. I fucking love my numbers my precious numbers.  I need something to get me through to graduation I know that's why I'm doing this. I don't want help even though I know I should go get it. I have an appointment in April with my psychiatrist about medicine. I'll worry about it if I'm still sick then. I'm just not that bad yet most days. There's still some logic in there. Like I'm trying to high restrict because I know anything less than BMR is unsustainable on school days.   I can lose 15 pounds by graduation high restricting anyways. I know that's a goddamn pipe dream though. I've never dipped below my first goal weight. Haven't been UGW small in years and years. I just want to do something that feels worthwhile and this is all I can find. Happiness is the same as obsession at this point.  I'm off to either reread Wintergirls or rewatch My Skinny Sister. Thanks to Starving in Suburbia for distracting me from binging tonight.,False,False

Lol @ me.  I am not in control of this AT ALL. I don’t necessarily mind that I’m not in control of it, because honestly it feels good to let go and just let myself be consumed by this, sick as that may be. But who the fuck was I trying to kid by telling myself I was in control?!   I’ve never been big on denial, always been pretty well aware of my mental state, but evidently that’s not entirely true this time around. ",False,False
