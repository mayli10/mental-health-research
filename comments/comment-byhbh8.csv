My mom went through a shift similar to your dad’s. One day we were eating was I now consider “normal” foods, the next day it was LOW-FAT EVERYTHING, no cooking with oil, no butter, no salt, no salad dressing, and these horrendous unsweetened “carob sticks” instead of chocolate.    Orthorexia 101. Constant talk about losing weight and “healthy foods”!” and calories and OMG FAT-FREE.   I was a scrawny child; it didn’t hurt me a bit to eat those “normal” foods. As an older child I would secretly binge on anything I could get my hands on.  It didn’t affect my weight until I was in my 30’s - about the same time I put two and two together and figured out why I have no self-control around food. Bleh.",False,False

I can relate as my family environment and particularly my mom also played a  big role in developing my ED. And have lots of ruined memories over certain foods.  When I was reading your story I was actually wondering if your mom was bulimic also, since you recall her being underweight but at times buying and finishing off junk food. Regardless, I hope you are at least away from those toxic influences more often now. ❤️",False,False

Food was a HUGE comfort for me growing up, and a huge part of my relationship to other people - special meals shared with my dad, special times my mom let me help her cook (she usually didn’t let me and would have my other sister do it instead), the way my mom always remembered which particular things i liked or didn’t like... i don’t know how to think about food any other way.",False,False
