When I look in my own mirror or at a familiar place, I see excess flesh that needs to be removed. However, when I saw my reflection in a store I've never been to before, I saw thin legs with a thigh gap. When I was sitting on a gurney in an ambulance shaking from nerves and the cold, I thought my legs looked thin and my arm frail in the hands of the EMS provider starting my IV, even though that very morning I was squeezing and pinching my thighs &amp; stomach in frustration at home. I feel like Alice in Wonderland, constantly growing and shrinking from moment to moment.",False,False
