I just wanted to come here to say though, coming from someone who cancelled a lot of plans with friends for that very reason all throughout high school, I still regret doing that and feel more sadness from it than all the weight I’ve ever gained. It never felt like it in the moment, but those friendships are what would have made me feel better. They’re your friends because they like *you*, not because they like how you look. Just remember that they love you and as much as it HURTS to be so self aware of how we look, just see if you can rally yourself for a little bit to think of anything else but that. They love you, and you love them, and as shitty as weight gain is, it’s not a death sentence. You’re still you and none of this is permanent. Let your friendships heal you, hiding away from yourself and the world feels good in the moment but causes so much more pain in the end. I promise you’ll be ok ❤️",False,False
