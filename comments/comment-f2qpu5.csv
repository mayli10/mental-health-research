I feel about my face/hair the same way I feel about my body - like I feel like I have a generally reasonable idea of what it looks like +/- a margin of error hah. But I have weird BDD behaviors about my hair and face as well; for example last night I was getting ready for bed while my boyfriend was in the bathroom and I caught a glimpse of my hair and thought it looked good, so instead of changing my clothes like I'd planned, I sat perfectly still until he came back so he could see my ""good"" hair. Like, bitch, I'm sure you'd look the same, just put on your fucking pajamas??? Also whenever I put my hair up to exercise, I'll have to do my ponytail like a thousand times until it looks ""right."" I think my boyfriend always assumes I'm pooping when we get to the gym and I go to the bathroom for like 15 minutes before we start, but really I'm doing 1000 panicked consecutive ponytails.",False,False

And I and probs always will as long as I am constantly thinking about my own appearance. On top of my issues with eating, they make me buy shit I don’t need. I just spent almost $100 at Ulta on serums and creams and shit like that because I went through a phase where I compulsively worried about getting premature wrinkles.   If I could get it through my head that the way I look is not the most important part of life and dedicate less than 90% of my waking moments thinking about it I could probably solve sooo many of my issues. My biggest 2020 goal is to find a hobby or something I’m passionate about to distract from stressing about how I look so much.",False,False
