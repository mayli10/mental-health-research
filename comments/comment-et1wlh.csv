Or if I had I clearly forgot...that explains so much. I don't know anyone else in recovery. Most of the people I used with went down with the ship.  Thank you!,False,False

Electrolytes can get out of whack really quickly with EDs, especially if you're low restricting or engaging in purging behaviours. For myself, I try to combat this by having an electrolyte sports drink every day (there are no sugar ones available, and I recently found a tub of low sugar electrolyte sports powder in my local chemist which ends up being much more financially viable) and I also take a magnesium complex drink at night, which not only helps with the insomnia, but also has some other good stuff in it, especially potassium which your heart will thank you for!",False,False

I havent had withdrawal symptoms in about a year so it really caught me off guard. I was just trying to think of something that could have triggered it because Like I said ive been sober over a year. But thank you guys for the reassurance and information. I’m gonna do some reading on PAWS (haha) and bring it up with my doctor.,False,True

I was so relieved to learn about Post-Acute Withdrawal Syndrome (PAWS, lol) because I was getting worried my brain was permanently damaged. And I feel like my body is now super sensitive to my nutrition and hydration...which is frustrating. My body also seems to respond differently to some prescribed meds if my intake is really low.",False,False

I got weird breakthrough withdrawal symptoms off and on for longer that I want to discuss lol it took a long time. So long I don't think it was chemical anymore.  I would also often get confused when I was ""muggle sick."" I'd get a cold and within a day I had the shakes and the sweats and couldn't sleep....it wasn't only a virus. My body was just going for it.  It never occurred to me that it may be connected to restriction. Its been over 10 years since I detoxed and I don't get those symptoms anymore. Unless I'm particularly stressed and having nightmares etc....I don't want to say its psychosomatic but it probably is.",False,False
