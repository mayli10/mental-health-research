I was so fucking hungry and smashed a veggie burger that had a bunch of toppings, some fries, and we all shared Mac and cheese bites. It was my only meal for the day but one of my friends didn’t finish her burger or fries and I just stared at the damn thing the whole time.   It’s funny tho because I’ve known her for so long and we are complete opposite body types and our eating habits don’t make any sense to anyone. I’m 5’2 and my NW was 110 now it’s a lot lower and she’s 6’ and naturally weighs a lot more.   People will always comment on how I’m so ✨little and small✨ and how I probably can’t eat very much. But my friend will step in and be like “trust me this bitch can eeaaaat....^she can also not eat for three days^ “  But fr I love her and she’s one of the few people who knows almost everything about my ed.",False,False
