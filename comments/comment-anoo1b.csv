I don't care what this guy says.   I have a lot I could say about this person's attitude. I hope for their sake they have a good support system when they have to go through the loss of a loved one.   I mean, I had a great support system when I lost my father and still went into a major depressive episode. I quite my job and went hard into ed symptoms. I recently lost my mother and again have a solid support but fuuck. Grieving is hard.  I'm really sorry you have been made to feel this way about opening up. Please believe there are people in this world who understand and would actually be willing to listen in a non judgemental way. ❤",False,False

Anyone who tries turning around and saying that “ oh it’s just an excuse “ is just dismissive and frankly a bit of an asshole. The fact he tries saying it’s your fault just puts the cherry on top. I’m not saying you’re wrong for your decision to not open up to people but please speak to someone if you feel like your life or health is in jeopardy. Don’t let one asshole cause you to suffer alone forever. Sorry if that last part seems a bit harsh but you don’t deserve to have one person make you suffer even longer ya know. Stay strong and best of luck ,False,False
