She told me that if I could just occupy my brain with something else for five to ten minutes, the strongest urge would pass over. Obviously, everyone is different, but it has worked for me!! I distract myself by journaling, playing music, doing chores, and calling my parents just to chat. Anything to keep me from staying still and ruminating! Good for you on trying to fight that urge, I wish you the best of luck ❤️",False,False

Since you only get a set number of prescription pills, I couldn't really do that, and it helped me not throw up.  Brain Over Binge is a good book if you have the time to read it. If you don't, the crux is this:  your primitive brain is screaming at you to binge eat and then purge, but your advanced, human brain (neocortex) controls your physical movement.  No matter how much your brain screams at you to do something, you don't have to do it because it can't move your limbs, only the rational part of your brain can. You can ride out the urges.  (The idea came from treatment for alcoholics). Also, I found vaping (which I just quit) and bronkaid helpful.    &amp;#x200B;  NOTE: I'm keeping this up because it's asking for tips to STOP purging.",False,False
