How could we not be? We’re obsessed with food. It would hard not to develop an unhealthy appreciation for it. All of my daydreams and fantasies are filled with food. My Instagram is all food-centric accounts, I watch food videos on YouTube at the gym, I bake semi-professionally a few days a week, and I plan my binges meticulously, sometimes months in advance, to make sure they are the perfect combination of foods. I lay awake at night unable to sleep because I’m obsessing about food. It doesn’t make your ED “fake” that you like food lol, far from it.",False,False
