It’s well known in my family and work place and with all my friends that I have a restrictive eating disorder. I took some time off and was doing better. Unfortunately, the more I gained, the more the depression that my eating disorder has been masking has come back and now I’m both slowly starving AND too depressed to fix myself. I spend all of my energy trying to “look happy” and “look like I’m eating normally”. I have alluded to my struggle some but mostly- everyone thinks that “if she’s eating, she’s fine”. So out? Yes. Honest? Hell no.",False,False
