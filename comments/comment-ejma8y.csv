Binge eating disorders often aren’t treated as seriously as restrictive eating disorders and it’s awful for everyone involved.   But fat people aren’t universally supported for being overweight. They are frequently abused and mistreated, just like those who are underweight. Underweight bodies ARE “supported” (encouraged), ARE treated as sexy, and anorexics DO die because of it... every day... at alarming rates.   I do understand being frustrated with/critical of HAES but sometimes people on this sub overblow their perspective to the point of fiction. They act like the whole world ascribes to HAES (not even close) and that nobody ever portrays underweight bodies as positive or desirable (demonstrably untrue). The end result seems to be “fat people should be ridiculed again like they used to” which 1) don’t worry, they still are and 2) won’t help, just like mocking people with restrictive eating doesn’t help.   I know your point was more that you wish people with binge eating disorder got the help and support they needed, which is true, but unfortunately it’s not how it comes across. People very much do “care about overeating” if you mean “care” as in “pay attention to”.",False,False

I’m a normal BMI bc I balance my binge periods with restriction and it is the most brutal, lonesome, out of control cycle ... and because it’s so complicated, I cannot express my struggles to people outside of this sub ..",False,False
