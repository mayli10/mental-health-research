I wish I had been able to enjoy my pregnancy and postpartum without all of the ed stuff, but what your body is doing is INCREDIBLY AMAZING and you deserve to revel in its innate wisdom. You are brave. You are strong. You are not alone ðŸ’“ If you aren't already, try to reach out to your Dr or counselor so you have some support irl. I regret that I didn't, it might have actually helped me.",False,False

It's so hard to love or even accept your changing body, when you don't have an ED, much less when you do. The hormones are going crazy, your body hurts, and this little human is doing summersaults. It's fucking hard. Your frustration is valid. I don't have a lot of advice, because you know what you need to do for your baby, but I do wanna say I've been where you are. It will be worth it, I promise.",False,False
