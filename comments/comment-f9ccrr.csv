So that answers that idea in people's heads that diet soda causes weight gain, it's actually just a misrepresentation of the reasearch.  As for the filling effect yeah it suppresses appetite quite literally by just filling up the volume of your stomach, maybe that friend of yours has the above healthy halo type mentality or maybe it's cause they drink diet soda, burp out the gas quickly and suddenly feel more hungry than before cause it's a shock for your stomach to just go from super full to suddenly much smaller. But idk that's just a guess on my part.",False,False
