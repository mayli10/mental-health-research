Usually it isn't a problem and after conversations about it she'll usually get things together for a week or so before she gives up again. Most of the time it really doesn't bother me, I'm used to it. It's the outbursts that get to me. We've spoken before about how she communicates stuff like that but she's always angry in the morning, really no way around that. I understand it's one of her flaws.  Yes it can be frustrating sometimes but after 4 years of living together I've set up a system that keeps things neat.   I wrote this post when I was upset from her outburst. At lot of the frustration that was clear in my tone I know is just a defence mechanism. ",False,True

I do about 90% of the house work and she only picks up after herself maybe once a week? It wasn't that she reminded me about it but the way she did which was about 20 min of pure anger as soon as I woke up. Meanwhile she's left all her dishes from last night, craft stuff out, unmade bed, clothes on the floor all for me to deal with. IIt doesn't really bother me until she explodes about a chore I haven't done. I'll admit I do make mistakes once and a while but it seems deeply unfair considering she holds my actions to a much higher standard than her own.  I actually keep an OCD journal with my daily weekly and monthly cleaning. This was a very serious lapse for me. I'm trying very hard to be reasonable about this and not spiral into thinking about how worthless I am for being so useless to forget such a thing. It's okay though I was going to do some fun stuff this day off but I'm just going to deep clean the house and cars instead.   It's funny to read this because your perceptive on  this situation because it's very accurate to how I feel. Right down to the personal time as well!   I work 6 days a week at a restaurant so I usually run late. My girlfriend constantly complains that we don't get to spend much time together and that she has to spend most evenings on her own. (Usually from 6 when she is off work till 8-12 depending on the day). So usually when I have days off or early days or time before shifts on the weekends,  I spend them completely with her. I absolutely crave time alone so I can do chores ( she doesn't like it when I do them in front of her) run errands or work on projects.  I would completely understand if she wanted personal time in the morning but she's asked me to make her coffee in the morning since she doesn't often have time.   ",False,True

I'm used to having weekdays to myself until work is over, so on a day where my partner is home all day with me, I usually assume Iget one or two hours to myself in the morning while he sleeps iin. so when he wakes up a minute after me, I get irrationally annoyed. because now I have no time to myself for the whole day. I don't say anything outright because either can't really justify why I'm annoyed, but I'm an introvert and I like having my own time. our computers are in the same room, so when we're both up we're basically sharing the same room for hours and I'm forced to use headphones to do anything with sound. its not that I dont like spending my day with him, I just need some downtime even from my partner, and losing it when I didn't expect to throws of my plans and agitates me even if it shouldn't.  this is all to say this is just my relationship and I don't know yours. it sounds like maybe your girlfriend was being unecessarily harsh or rude. maybe she is slightly justified because you see these things as no big deal and she sees them as disrespectful to her space. maybe she's overreacting. I'm not there. but I just wanted to help understand a bit if I can",False,False
