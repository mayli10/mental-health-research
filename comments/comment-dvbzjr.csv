It doesn't apply the same way to very tall and very short people, and then there's also the factors of frame size, body fat %, muscle, fat distribution, etc. I've seen a lot of people with much higher bmis than me who look way skinnier on first impression just bc they have tiny sinewy upper bodies and small chests whereas my body fat is distributed quite evenly  tl;dr bmi is (mostly) fake dont take it too seriously",False,False

I always thought I was 5'5.5"" at least, closer to 5'6"" but recently measured and got 5'5"" even. I wonder if some of it is the extra weight gained since I last measured close to 5'6""...weighs me down even more during the day.",False,False

I have always thought I was 5'4. The other night I was reading about how you shrink during the day so my husband and I measured each other lol. I haven't been measured at the doctor in who knows how long. I actually did solidly grow an inch in college which was the last time I was measured, at least a decade ago. I have never thought of myself as short, petites have never worked for me even though petites are for 5'4 and under. So it is possible. Also again i am a full 5'5 in the morning.  5'5 would change everything. That would be amazing. I updated my flair to say 5'5 but I feel like a fraud. Which height should I use? Part of me is like take the 5'5 and run baby! But the other part of me is like no you fat disgusting lump. I also am not trusting the scale at all, since I look bigger than ever. The internet isn't giving me good answers. My husband uses his morning height. I also feel like most regular people add an inch at least lol so what do I do? I am obsessed with bmi, comparing and contrasting with others, looking up different bmi's so. I feel totally confused, I have no idea what I look like, now I have no idea how tall I even am??   BTW today I have been feeling like a fat fraud, my therapist wants to see me 2x a week and I'm like you don't deserve that there is nothing wrong with you, you are not thin, you are just a whiny fat cow.",False,False
