I feel like I have better luck if I avoid sugar, simple carbs in general, and things with a lot of aspartame. Having a nice savory dinner, even with rice, usually can keep me satisfied, but if I start eating the wrong things? Game over. My brain seems to be all or nothing when it comes to those good good carbohydrates.",False,False

I will not feel hungry in the slightest and then eat at my set mealtimes (trying to eat more regularly to prevent binges) and then once I start chewing it's like all of the sudden I want to keep going and never stop.

When you are at your body weight set point, eating makes you less hungry, every single time you eat, unless you are eating hyperpalatable foods that sabotage the hedonic system.  &amp;#x200B;  I remember one of the most frustrating things about ""maintaining"" my weight at a lower weight than my body weight set point, or when I was losing weight, was that I was more or less hungry all the time, regardless of whether I ate or not, and oftentimes eating more would make me more hungry. This was my body trying to re-establish homeostasis and me overriding it, which was one of the elements that led to me developing an eating disorder because eventually this drove me insane. I spent well over a year in this state. Most bodybuilders when recovering from the starvation-like state they induce to get on stage will binge eat because your hunger cues simply don't work properly and the body is desperate for food when you are very low on body fat (compared to your body's preferred set point).  &amp;#x200B;  Now that I am physically recovered, this is no longer an issue. I can pretty reliably eat according to how physically hungry I am, and I do not gain weight. In fact over the past few months, based on the data I have, I seem to have lost more of the body fat I acquired during my AN rebound bodyfat overshoot (from the extreme hunger phase), while gaining muscle.
