But you're talking about buying/ obtaining a controlled substance from a coworker. That's all sorts of dangerous. If anything goes wrong at work, he could rat you out or threaten to. Or claim you stole his prescription. Or he turns it into a quid pro quo thing ("" do this for me and I won't tell our boss "")  It's really risky just from a personal security point of view. That's so much potential anxiety and risk. Please be safe.",False,False

And it made me look straight up worn out. I don't recommend it.   Also, I'd binge when it wore off.",False,False

I feel like an idiot because I even considered it. The fuck is wrong with me. I was telling him I have been having insomnia and trouble staying awake and he offered it as he's got a bunch of extra. He's a nice guy, I don't think he'd try to hurt me. I just hate that my brain jumps to ""oh this will help me eat less!""",False,True

But from an outsider, you really should not. You never know if they could be slipping you something else for some reason. And if you've never been on adderall you dont know if you could have a bad reaction. Plus it's just not safe to take other people's prescriptions:/ i know it's so tempting for the appetite suppressant but that isnt even a 100% guarantee so just at least consider the other stuff i said  If you do start taking it please be as safe as possible",False,False
