I almost never order what I actually want bc it’s too many calories. I can’t handle eating at restaurants without calorie counts (and I don’t even like chain restaurants really) so it’s not even worth eating out.  I even maintained a slightly underweight weight before my eating disorder by just eating when I was hungry and eating whatever I wanted.
