They are only 15 calories a tablet (you dissolve them in 16oz of water), and they don't have all the extra sugar and calories that you find in Gatorade. I also sometimes indulge in a serving of Triscuits, as they are fairly healthy and are a ""safe"" and salty carbohydrate.",False,False

(The times Iâ€™ve heard of someone being taken by surprise is when the person was engaged in an intense endurance sporting event.)   You can find the daily intake recommendations for the various electrolytes. If I need to supplement a little, I use poweraid zero or propel. If I need a lot I mix up a water bottle with pink salt (sodium), nu salt (potassium), natural calm (magnesium), and mio (for a better taste) and sip over a couple hours. But I usually only need the latter when fasting. I just go by how Iâ€™m feeling - eg. if Iâ€™m feeling dizzy or headachy.   And bear in mind that electrolyte balance is also a function of appropriate fluid intake!",False,False

I know itâ€™s recommended for stuff like vomiting and diarrhea, where your body loses a lot of electrolytes. Gatorade is probably fine, tho I still havenâ€™t seen the zero calorie stuff around where I am ðŸ˜ž",False,False
