Get a piece of paper and cut it in tiny strips 1) scrunch it up 2) make those stars from 2010s that pop up. Lmao it's the thought that counts.

Like, I just want to enjoy the holidays not be reminded of how poorly I’m doing. Idk. My SO got me Jonathan Van Ness’s book which talks about self care and self acceptance, but it’s an easy read and he knows I love him.

I’ve read a many of books about EDs but none of them really made me want to get better. The only thing that helped me was deciding to apply for the military.

They can either be beneficial self-help books with genuine information, or they can be memoire style which some people honestly find triggering.   Maybe take a look at the eating disorders anonymous book on amazon? It’s 12 step guided recovery literature based off of the Alcoholics Anonymous program. There are lots of eating disorder or anorexia anonymous meetings you can call into also which some people find super beneficial.   I think getting her some nice self care stuff would be really thoughtful? Maybe bath bombs, bubble bath, face mask, journal and pens, candle, socks, warm blanket, etc.",False,False
