As much as I logically know it's probably not the way I feel it is, feelings are very hard to ignore when they are so all-consuming.",False,False

I was overweight most of my life and while I actually wasn't self conscious about it at all back then, I really jumped on the ""I'm a skinny person"" train once I got skinny. Felt kinda good. Then that turned into ""I'm a tiny person"". For various angsty reasons that I won't go into here, but I'm similar to you now in not wanting to take up space.   But the thing is, I don't even like being small... if I could change one thing about my body that isn't in my power to, I'd wanna be like \~6 feet tall. For my SU fans, I'm built like [Peridot](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/five-nights-at-freddys-rus/images/5/5b/Steven_universe_smol_peridot_by_comhurri-d9bc7lt.png/revision/latest?cb=20160517155139&amp;path-prefix=ru) but wish I'd been built as [Jasper](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/villains/images/c/c4/HelmetJasperDP_by_Lenhi.png/revision/latest?cb=20170130161626), lmao.   I could become a mini-Jasper... If I can bring myself to feel like I deserve to exist in the world again. And have the courage to take up space ",False,False

So many use thick or some version of it as a compliment.. I'm not a girl who wants to be thick. It's honestly one of the worst things for my self esteem when a guy tries to compliment me on being naturally curvy. I'm actively trying to suck these tits and ass back into my body. Dont tell me things that reinforce how much I'll never look like anything resembling a conventional model.  Even at my lowest weight, I cant stop being ""hippy"" and ""slim thicc"" ",False,False

I'm a little taller than average. Still, lately people have been treating me like I'm really small and it's starting to feel like it's another part of who I am. I've always been the small one in my family, so growing up small was definitely part of my identity. Until high school I was usually the shortest or really close to the shortest of all my classmates. I'm transgender so in high school when I was still living as a boy I was technically still shorter than I should have been, so really up until I started my transition in college I was always the small one. Once I started living openly as a girl and started being compared to other girls who were shorter than me I kind of lost that. I'm really glad to have it back in a way, even if it's not the same as before. I get to be the small one again. It's just that instead of being small for my height I'm small for my weight. It's too bad I grew that couple inches the summer before grade 9 or I could have both right now.",False,False

I'm quite tall and have relatively broad shoulders, which people have commented on my entire life. My childhood is marked with constant comments of ""you're so tall!"" and while I was never overweight, I've always just associated with being 'large' and occupying space. I've lost a lot of weight in the last year or so and I've been getting sporadic ""you're so small"" comments but it's a massive struggle for me to take any of that on board because I've spend my whole life associating with being 'large'.
