Which is all a lot of people with depression have energy for, hahaaaaa.  But I also relate to you. Any time I mention that I eat more when I get stressed, whoever I'm talking to says they STOP eating when they're stressed, and they can tell if they're stressing too much because they lose weight. And I'm just sitting there like üôÉüôÉüôÉ I'm sure that's just as hard for you to manage as overeating is for me but can you PLEASE shut up my fat ass can't take it  Anyway, FWIW I'm right there with you. My depression meals are easily thousands of calories bc restriction is always the first thing to snap when I get stressed hoohee",False,False
