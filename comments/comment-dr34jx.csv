Having a small frame is nothing unique to Asians, at the end of the day what you look like comes down to individual metrics. I'm Caucasian, have a small frame and a BMI that's currently around 16.8-17 and I don't look one bit underweight. It's not about race.",False,False

I didn't mean to offend. I am East Asian myself and live in East Asia and I've noticed this in my own experience with my own body and the people around me as well as seen a few studies on it. I know my own experience is just anecdotal so you can take it with a grain of salt!! I'm really sorry.  I guess I'm just trying to say, i don't personally think that race has nothing to do with it. I lived most of my life at a 16 BMI and was always considered healthy and normal looking, just on the thin side. And yet many of the Caucasian people I've seen look very ill at the same BMI. Idk. Again, just my 2 cents",False,False
