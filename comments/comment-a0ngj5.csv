They are extremely sweet, with a marshmallow like center. I'm usually satisfied after 5 (and I'm a binge eater), and then I feel especially good that I didn't even eat a whole serving. They are the size of the large Hershey kisses! ",False,True

I love meringues they are like eating little clouds lol and often satisfy my cravings for marshmallows (not the same texture but similar taste and just slightly crunchy and soft melt in your mouth). And yes you can sub truvia - any sweetener will work as long as it's the same texture. In this one I think it says powdered so not liquid or granulated. If you only have granular though I've had success with grinding it in a coffee grinder or magic bullet.,False,False

I did the plain vanilla ones and I made chocolate ones by just adding some cocoa (I forget how much, sorry).
