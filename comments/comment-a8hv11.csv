It sounds like you’re really struggling and that the zoloft isn’t helping much. I really hope you’ll talk to your doctor about how you’re feeling. There are other anti-depressants out there and also there are non-addictive options for anxiety.  Feelings of wanting to be dead can start to feel par for the course, but it’s a significant symptom and it’s very important your doctor knows you’re experiencing this. They can’t help you unless they know what’s going on. (And in case you’re not telling them for fear of automatically being packed off to the hospital - commitment generally requires the person have some degree of plan and intent.)  Also that sounds like a pretty significant quantity of alcohol. Somewhat dangerous in itself but especially when combined with sleeping pills. As an alcoholic, I can understand not wanting to discuss alcohol consumption with health providers, but I’d really encourage you to let them know what’s going on. It’s such a very destructive path to be going down and it leads to some very dark places.   tl;dr Taking a double dose of sleep meds with alcohol in combo with the thoughts you express is cause for serious concern. I dearly hope you’ll talk frankly with your doctor. There is help and hope for getting out of the darkness.",False,False
