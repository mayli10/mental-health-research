Eating a deficit of fat in particular can cause you to lose your period. And it may take a while to gain it back, depending on how long your body has been operating at a deficit.   Itâ€™s very hard, but if at all possible you should try to eat more and gain it back. Not having your period, with all the associated hormonal dimensions, can be really dangerous to your long-term health and contribute to issues like osteopenia and worse...   Sending warm thoughts your way ",False,False

Was never underweight but I lost a lot of body fat (Iâ€™m an athlete). Recently got it back after gaining some fat back so yes, it comes back eventually but not if youâ€™re planning on eating less than you are now. ",False,False

I know for sure I'm not pregnant but it being so late is a little worrying,False,False

This exact thing happened to me earlier this month and mine was late by 3 weeks. I was legit freaking out over developing osteoporosis (measured myself against my wall multiple times a day) due to amenorrhea lol  I stuck to maintenance and exercised 40mins every other day, instead of 1-1.5 hours and alas, it came.   Make sure youâ€™re getting enough protein and not trying to burn off calories (no matter how hard it is) for a week or two. If all else fails, see a doctor! ",False,False

Period loss (thereâ€™s a fancy word) from eating disorders is very confusing.  Some people at healthy BMIs will lose it from extreme restriction and then there are people at pretty low BMIs that still have theirs.  If youâ€™re very concerned, first off talk with your doctor.  Second, try to eat nutrient dense calories.  Even if under maintenance, healthy foods can make all the difference.  As long as youâ€™re getting ~800+ cals of healthy food, your body should respond.  This is all based on my own current knowledge so probs not completely reliable, but wish you the best.",False,False

Iâ€™m pretty irregular too (What will it be this month? Three weeks? Seven weeks? Who knows!!) If you have an underweight BMI, amenorrhea is definitely possible - there seems to be a lot of variability in when this occurs so itâ€™s tough to say. If pregnancy is a possibility you might investigate that, though I donâ€™t know how early the tests can accurately detect.",False,False
