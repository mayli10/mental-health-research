All I think of is the next time I’ll eat. And I’ve thought I’ve just been being super healthy all this time!,False,False

Its really strange but relieving to be able to be so open about the pitfalls of all this and how much it really consumes my thoughts day to day. Lets hope better days unrelated to weight are upon us in the future as well (:,False,True

Maybe tomorrow will be better. Lol but that’ll depend on how much I’ve lost by the morning. Man this feels crazy. I’ve never said any of this to anyone before.,False,False

Now I just want to curl up and not deal with life, everything somehow feels more overwhelming than usual. I hope your day gets better buddy, you deserve to have a good one and not feel bad because of this stupid illness",False,True

I hate that it will make or completely destroy my day. Like if the number is lower I am totally doing a full happy dance in the mirror. If it’s higher I’m devastated all day and literally either no one will notice or they’ll roll their eyes because they say I’m “thin”.  Lose/lose    Hang in there. I know how you feel.,False,False

I shouldnt be THIS upset but here we are. It really sucks when one of the only things that brings me joy in this world is losing weight.,False,True

Yesterday I was feeling under the weather and decided to eat. I had 2041c. This morning I got up and weighed myself and I was about 3.5 lbs heavier. I don’t know what’s wrong with me. I should have controlled myself but I wish this didn’t like ruin my day... I pooped a lot today (tmi) sorry and I want to go weight myself again! It’s crazy. I don’t know how I got to be this way. Sadly I’m more mad cause I ate that much vs mad that I have a problem.,False,False
