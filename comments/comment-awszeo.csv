The only time in school anything about my body was ever measured was when my grade 8 teacher wanted to talk about some thing that I can't remember which had to do with the ratio between your height and your arm span. All I do remember is that I have shorter than average arms. Most people's arm span was equal to or a little longer than their height, but my arm span was shorter than my height. I think that's true because clothes usually fit me perfectly, but I have this one blouse with fake rolled up sleeves and they're supposed to be above my elbows, but they're not. They're annoyingly just barely below my elbows in a way to constantly makes them move around. I shouldn't have bought that blouse, but it looks so good on me.",False,False

I mean, when I was in school we often compared height for fun, but it was never recorded or anything. In physics once we were asked to use our weight to use in different calculations, but we didn't have to use our weight if we didn't want to, we could just make it up, and no-one saw our calculations anyway, it was just for practice. It seems very strange. There must be a way to opt-out if you don't want to do it. Perhaps talk to a teacher or someone to see if the rumour is true?",False,False
