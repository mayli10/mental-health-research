Huge trigger. I don’t know why they said it. Maybe they were trying to empower me or show me a rosier perspective. Maybe they just had a shitty bedside manner.   What it *felt* like was “Your pain isn’t real. You don’t have the right to be hurting.” But that’s not at all what they actually said or meant. That was my black-or-white thinking kicking in and making me think that if I took one step away from my worst that I was under an obligation to be totally fine.  But recovery is a huge continuum...and recovery is nonlinear...and recovery doesn’t have to be done perfectly. I can acknowledge the progress *and* the difficulties without devaluing the experience of either.  There’s a whole series of companion issues that I’m also working through...my identity being tied up with being ill, relying so much on external validation from authority figures instead of supplying some validation for myself, wanting others to take care of me even as I hate on myself...  But I can give myself a hug for the little distance I’ve come. A hug to acknowledge the pain I still carry and to celebrate the pain I’ve left behind.",False,False

I can't believe that ED professionals wouldn't understand how triggering it is to hear even things like ""you're healthy"" or ""you don't look sick""?? It's 100% understandable how that would make you want to just restrict more to grab their attention/care. That's not ""attention seeking"" behavior, it's a cry for help! The most painful part of ED imo is the mental state and self hate you may feel, the overwhelming guilt over eating even if you are managing to eat, etc. They need to focus on helping you resolve the way you're feeling rather than just managing the physical symptoms.  I found that university healthcare is often like that, though. I've had my university's mental health team get me involuntarily committed to a psych ward even though I clearly didn't need to be there, and I experienced a lot of the same treatment you're talking about when I was at a higher weight (they only got concerned when I dropped a lot, in part because I was triggered to show them I was sick enough too!). I think it's because you're a liability to your college if you're dealing with your mental health, and they really just need to make sure no physical harm comes to you while you're there. Getting an off-campus psychologist at least (outside nutritionist I'd say would be second priority, then outside MD and psychiatrist if you need them) may be more beneficial to you.",False,False
