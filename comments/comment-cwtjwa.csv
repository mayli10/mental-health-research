Secondly, never weigh yourself at night again. You know it's water and food weight, so just avoid the scale until the morning. It'll make you feel better to just never weigh yourself again, but I haven't reached that point myself so I can't give you any advice there. It's a good idea, but that's all I got. Just weigh yourself in the morning, after you use the toilet. Then put it away, hide it and distract yourself for the rest of the day. Read a book, cook something new, draw something, play a new video game, see how long you can go holding your breath. Literally anything that keeps you away from disordered thinking. Good luck!",False,False
