Down to the numbers (LW 44kg in August, CW around 63 at 163cm). Used to NEVER binge and then it just suddenly started. I've been getting it under control bit by bit and started losing again a bit but I just get so discouraged cause it seems unrealistic that I will be able to get back to where I was and if I can do it it will take so fucking long. So I feel you. Message me if you wanna talk :(",False,False

I’m 156cm and would do anything to see 46kg. It’s so hard. I don’t know what to say except I hope you find a way to be less hard on yourself because I haven’t. ,False,False

I’ve been struggling to stop binging and get my weight down a little, but the emotions are just so overwhelming and I feel so alone. I can relate to everything you just said, so so much.   Feel free to reach out if you need a shoulder - I’ve been suicidal and attempted a number of times; so if you just need to rant I’m here. ❤️ much love ",False,False
