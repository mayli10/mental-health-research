The whole entire movie just fucked with my emotions and I left the theatre sobbing. I was so sad for Nebula, and Gamora... Sad lives.   And then the end with Captain A and his woman just wrenched my fucking heart. Nobody will ever love me like that. I sat in the toilet and cried and cursed myself for wearing my amazingly thick but not waterproof mascara.",False,False

I really don’t get it. Why make the most tragic character a punchline of every joke? They weren’t even that good.",False,False

If they wanted her to be all mumsy she should have said like ‘take care of yourself’ or ‘be safe’. All the Thor scenes made me soooo uncomfortable, esp because most of them came with Rocket saying something snarky about how totally gross and disgusting he was. So many cheap gags.",False,False
