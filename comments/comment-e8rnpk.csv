His eating habits or physical changes wouldn’t effect my attraction to/respect for him.   My weight has fluctuated over 60 lbs since we got together and he’s still attracted to me. It was weight loss, but still a physical change. He is aware of my disorder and is very helpful. I would *never* want him to struggle with food, but if he did I would try to show him the same kindness he shows me.  I’m very lucky to have him.",False,False

I know it’s not GOOD, but I find myself attracted exclusively to very thin men. I don’t know if it’s me or if it’s my eating disorder but anything bigger than quite thin and I can’t feel attraction.   I really feel awful about this, but I’ve never been able to change is. So, yes, I would feel less attracted to them.",False,False

When he starts to feel badly about himself, that’s when I’m concerned, but even then it’s more of a concern for his well being than being put off. He’s never been massive though, and his weight distributes well even when he’s heavier because he has substantial muscle, so maybe I’m not the most unbiased source?",False,False

Like if they’re trying to gain for muscle or because they’re underweight I’d be happy to see them get healthier, if they had a medical condition or meds that made their weight temporarily go up I’d be understanding as long as they were working on their health, but if they gained just out of laziness/overeating/drinking/working too much etc than yeah I’d be a bit turned off if it was noticeable and unhealthy, but weight can be changed so it’s not something I’d breakup with someone for so long as they are trying to get healthy.   I said healthy so much but it’s true. You want the best for the people you love.",False,False

I’ve been reluctant to get in any relationships until I drop 10 lbs... I can’t even imagine being on the receiving end of weight gain &amp; having the other person slowly lose interest, so I would never do it to them.
