When I’m eating all the time everything is kinda like “yeah, that’s okay”, but after a fast it’s like “a muesli bar! Fucking delicious!”. A sweet crisp apple? Taste like the angels are tap-dancing on my tastebuds. Even the most average food is super tasty.",False,False

The other days I have planned binges where I scarf down a ton of food.  Kinda hate it but I love food and always over eat when it's good food,False,False

When I do finally eat even the most plain food tases AMAZING. lol I was literally satiated with some soy sauce in hot water the other day 😂,False,False
