I just wanted to die a slow death.   After that it became incredibly hard to go back to any restrictive behaviour because I live with my gf and I don't want to let her down.,False,False

I kinda feel like there‚Äôs a turning point in recovery, after which you (I) can‚Äôt simply choose to go back - made too much mental progress.  Something has to happen to cause a legit relapse, otherwise it just feels like play-acting a former life and I can‚Äôt stick it out - I don‚Äôt get invested or care enough to override the physical discomfort with initial restricting or over exercising etc. The body discomfort and guilt etc might still be present to varying degrees but the mental compulsion isn‚Äôt strong enough.   Like after my first ‚Äúepisode‚Äù of anorexia I spent a couple years bouncing around normal eating and periods of restricting before a family event triggered me into a full on relapse. I‚Äôve been in recovery now for over 2 years and do not feel a relapse is possible unless something major were to happen.",False,False

Literally how I‚Äôve been feeling the past 2-3 months.   I‚Äôm in a similar situation to you in a bunch of ways. Started the recovery process about 10 months ago. Got pretty normal behaviorally. But I feel like my mind never really recovered. Recently it‚Äôs been more and more wanting to go back to ED behaviors.   It‚Äôs like, I don‚Äôt really want to be recovered...but externally I kindof am...",False,False

I restricted more the first time round, but abused laxatives the second, which caused the most damage. I‚Äôm mostly recovered now (4 years in February) but I still have some behaviors that mimic past ones. On the bright side, I‚Äôve lost  some weight slowly and am almost at the LW of my first round, in a much more healthy ways. I definitely agree with your sentiment: I haven‚Äôt been able to restrict like I used to, because while the thoughts are still there, the all-consuming drive to really commit isn‚Äôt. It was very exhausting. I don‚Äôt feel like putting myself into that exhausting mental space anymore and have found other ‚Äúoutlets‚Äù for my crazy.",False,False

I ""recovered"" and instead developed BED. (fun üôÉ) Now I struggle with that and now I'm terrible at it. I used to be able to fast for up to three days no problem but now even a day is an issue.

I'll be willing to go three days without eating but it's so hard to actually do it.,False,False

When I relapsed the first time, I went right back into my old ways. it hadn't been a recovery period long enough for me to develop healthy, anti ED habits. But when I relapsed last year after a year of a recovery period, though, the relapse was short lived and I believe that's because I had time to develop healthy habits.",False,False
