He's a skinny guy who works hard manual labor so he's always hungry. I've told him I don't purge anymore and I don't so he was honestly happy I was eating and didn't make a single comment about us both just pigging out and still fell asleep holding me. I equate being thin with being loved more and he knows I still struggle a lot but him knowing keeps me from spiraling and hurting myself more because I can be open and honest and he doesn't enable but also doesn't force. And doesn't make any triggering comments. Telling him was the best thing I did for myself.,False,False

She was standing there talking to me while I was eating and was like DAMN GIRL you inhaled that thing ! And I wanted to cry,False,False

I told my wife after about a year of marriage. I told the kids when they were old enough to understand. It makes a big difference when I can announce I'm back on my bullshit and then not have to stress about offhanded comments and hiding odd habits. The relife that comes when I go to the kitchen that's filled with safe foods because they understand what's going on is indescribable.,False,False

The last time I ate, she called me a fat pig, but I don‚Äôt disagree, cause I had eaten two chicken breast strips, two French bread pizza things, and a few cookie squares all in a day the previous night. Then that day she said something to me, I was about to eat another two chicken strips and a pile of fries. If she hadn‚Äôt watched me put my food in the toaster oven, I would‚Äôve reconsidered eating after that. Also, I‚Äôve gotten so many comments like that my entire life, so I‚Äôm just used to it. ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è",False,False
