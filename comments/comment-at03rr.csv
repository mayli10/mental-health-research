One of my biggest triggers happened today, and I ate a few teaspoons of garbanzo beans and 2/3 of a banana because of it, so it looks like my total Cals for today will be 1100 instead of 900, which is kind of a bummer, but at least it isn't a binge.  I think..now that I'm kind of completely away from how I looked at 150 ish/155 lbs, I'm gonna use that picture for reverse thinspo now. I never want to get that big ever again.

Two or three weeks ago, I crashed. I made it through January just barely keeping my sanity intake, dragging myself to the gym and at least going through the motions of walking on the treadmill when I was too cold and tired to run. I struggled through increasingly frequent ""binge"" episodes, lots of bloating and GI distress, and overwhelming fatigue. I somehow put on one or two pounds after Christmas, despite having escaped the imagined dangers of the holidays. Mentally and physically, I found myself completely burned out.   A convergence of factors, including extreme weather, brought my running routine to a halt. I was still extremely hungry, depressed, and fatigued. So I also stopped weighing myself. I failed to fully log my food for a few days, for the first time in almost a year. I ate a vast quantity of food, honestly, including some carb-heavy binges (rice cakes, popcorn, fruit, etc.).  This week, I am back on track. I started running again, very slowly. I'm eating moderately and my hunger has dampened down a lot. I felt stable enough to weigh myself again this morning...  I have gained 3.5 lbs since February 5th, which works out to:  ...5 lbs since January 29th,    ...6.6 lbs since January 19th   ...7.7 lbs since December 10th  YIKES.  And yet, I have to remind myself that I am still below a certain BMI point. I am not even close to a healthy weight. That fact shouldn't be of any consolation, I know, but if it keeps me from spiraling into a total meltdown right now, I'll take it.  The fact that I'm not completely suicidal over this, that's a victory.",False,False
