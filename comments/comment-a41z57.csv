And from my experience, that's coke talk. Coke + eating relatively healthy (when you can even force yourself to eat) will get you her body. But take it from me...you'll lose hair, bone density, and eventually your life so it's just not worth it.",False,False

The gigi weight loss was crazy and she looked tired but i loved her body... I follow Bella on Instagram and all the pizza and junk food she post I just can‚Äôt believe...

I have had people comment ‚Äú I want to be thin‚Äù or ‚Äú I need to lose weight‚Äù in reaction to my disgusting self and I just say ‚Äú not like this, I look gross‚Äù or I will claim illness of some sort.  I want people to feel healthy and happy, when they truly are! I suffer from this, but would never wish this to anyone. I see so many people as beautiful, just not myself.",False,False

I'm kind of at a loss regarding her Disneyland outfit - those 'oversize' denim shorts she wore are like...idk, fetishising her skinny, prepubescent body? They're kind of weird and not in a good 'fashion' sense weird. I get that's she's glam all the time and it was a laid back look, but they rubbed me the wrong way. Maybe because it's something my 10 year old self back in the early 90s would wear to cover my chubby legs. It's like the same article of clothing spanning a couple decades in the same ED context. So weird.",False,False

I find it hard to find up to date pics of celebs but I do check out her Instagram once in a while and tbh she's always been major goals for me.

It's messed up, but my favorite body type is the ultra thin athletic type she and the other VS models have but for her it....just looks like pain. Like she suffered to get there.
