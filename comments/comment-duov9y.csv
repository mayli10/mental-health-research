My issues with depression and suicidality were mostly supported, but the first friend I ever told about my eating then talked about her cousin instead, and said that I wasn't such a severe case beacuse we were the same height and, despite me being underweight already, weighing like 15-20 pounds more than her cousin.  I've never received sympathy. My thinness either goes unnoticed (because people have a warped sense of what UW really is), insulted (a lot) or just generally frowned upon. If they know one skinnier person, I'm no longer skinny at all.  If you don't fit the stereotype of ""anorexic pixie dream girl"" or the perfectionist type, you will get shit on just as much, if not more. People don't give me personal agency over my body if it's skinny. I receive far more bad comments now than when I was at a healthy BMI, and no positive ones as always.  Also, I think people do give a shit about OW people with eating disorders. The issue I have and that I'm assuming a lot of people have is that in my opinion, you need to acknowledge your issues to be treated appropriately for them. You can't expect people to treat you as a disordered person, who is not in control and in the grip of a serious disorder, if you refuse to acknowledge that you are disordered.  Aside from this exact community, I have never once met an overweight person who admitted that they were struggling. And I'm sorry, I get that people can't open up to everyone and that it's hard to be vulnerable, but if someone defends their bad choices or explains them down to something ""normal"" or ""natural"" I will not give them that benefit of the doubt. Everyone has a responsibility to not encourage bad habits, you know? Whereas when talking to UW people, mostly girls, they say how this or this has affected them, why they chose to diet, how this might be unhealthy, how they struggled here and there, etc.  I honestly don't like the term ""fatphobia"" because I've only seen it used badly. This all sounds pretty bad probably, but it's the gist of my experience. I see you, and I see all overweight people, and I think they're just as beautiful and human and should be respected as such. I constantly see people who might be slightly overweight, but who I think look waaaay better than me and probably put in way more effort into their looks. But if 10 fat ladies come up to me and tell me that I'm a fatphobic fuckhead for starving myself, and they're morbidly obese and super happy and healthy, and that I just don't know what it's like to \~\~love myself\~\~ I'll be pissed.

It's this fucked up notion of perverse admiration, we internally recognise it as the epitome of discipline and dedication. Depression is lazy. Binge eating is lazy. Bulimia is lazy. Of course we think anorexia it's tragic and horrible, but we tend to lend a far more sympathetic ear to it.   That, and because most people are fat-phobic as fuck. No one gives a shit about overweight people with eating disorders. They're instead seen as indolent, that binge eating and/or purging is an easy way out. I say this because I've had a friend tell me this to my face. She told me that it's far more comfortable being bulimic than actually committing yourself to eating healthily and exercising.
