I'm poor as fuck so it's a shitton cheaper than butter. I like it for oatmeal stuff and it makes way better crusts than butter anyway. Sooo flaky and crisp. Yall get off your judgmental ed high horses. Except the Baker girl, I like you. We're all gonna die anyway why we still pretending like we give a fuck if anything is healthy? Furthermore why is health held as virtuous standard? That literally makes 0 sense at all.",False,False

I'm sure they serve the same purpose in pancakes, not sure how they affect banana bread though.",False,False

People still want to make foods ‘just the way grandma did’ or whatever so it’s still used in some households. Although modern recipes would want to use something more flavorful like grass fed butter or coconut oil back in the day it served its purpose and gained commercial popularity because of its versatility. Keeping and using scraps (animal fat) was vital if you wanted to be able to make your next meal/dessert and save money. Why throw lard away when you could use it to make a perfectly wonderful pie crust?    ED answer: Lard is fucking gross. I’ll just smell a banana while I look at a picture of bread. Its a perfectly good sub for banana bread thank you very much (logged at 25 cals just in case)",False,False

In such a diet conscious and health conscious world, I am always surprised by people who do this kind of thing. Like how can you NOT know it's bad for you? Or how can you do it so openly and not worry about the majority of people judging you? I have a relative like this who was recently diagnosed with diabetes. She says she will 'wait for the dr to tell me if I can't eat something' and then just continue to eat badly. I said 'you could just google it'..'no the dr told me the internet could set me on the wrong path'....'yeah but there are diabetes charities and acrredited sites'...'no I'm waiting to see the dr'. And then continues to eat absolute shit.",False,False
