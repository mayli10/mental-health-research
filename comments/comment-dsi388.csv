I'm sooooo curious if it's statistically significant.ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜­,False,True

It was a back-of-a-napkin kinda calculations, so it's totally possible I fucked it up. I also solved it in terms of m being the mass of the person and then I think I did a ratio or something? Idk. I promise I'll lyk if I remember tomorrow!",False,True

According to the law of universal gravitation, the moon exerts a force of 0.002989N on a 100kg mass on the earth's surface. This is in comparison to the (approximately) 981N exerted on the mass by the earth... so when the moon is overhead, our hypothetical dude will weigh 99.99969kg.  When the moon is on the other side, our poor ED dude would weigh 100.0002kg.  Of course, this is actually an overestimate given that this assumes everything to be stationary.  What am I missing here?",False,False

Too bad this is only about earth-weight (Kg x *g*). The actual body mass (Kg) will remain the same. :(  As an exercise after you ace your Biochem exam, maybe try finding the change in BMI due to the height increase caused by the reduced effective gravity [[ref](https://www.nasa.gov/audience/forstudents/5-8/features/F_How_Youve_Grown_5-8.html)].  :P",False,False
