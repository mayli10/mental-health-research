Finally this year I've been seeing a therapist who specialises in EDs and trauma. It's been really hard.,False,False

Started going a month or so ago for my pretty severe depression and anxiety. Was not planning on discussing my ED issues, especially at the beginning. However, literally she asked me directly during the first session assessment whether I’ve ever had eating issues/restricted/bp etc. I couldn’t lie being asked directly so I said yes, but in the past. However, my depression made me not eat and lose weight, losing weight caused me to relapse into my ED behaviors, and the cycle continues lol. So now while we haven’t talked about my ED directly she has asked me at a later session how I’m doing with eating. To which I said not great, but also that I’m not relapsed (...I know, lies). Since it’s only been 4 sessions, I don’t know how it’s going to play out, but so far she hasn’t been too intrusive about it and let’s me talk about what I want, ie how my life has fallen apart completely. She hasn’t said anything about a higher level of care even though I am underweight. But I am minimizing my eating issues and def don’t want to discuss it cause it’s one of my coping mechanisms. Also, when I looked for a therapist I looked for one that also had ED treatment experience just in case. Maybe that’s why she picked up on it with me. I dunno. Yea not sure if this was helpful to you at all lol. ",False,False

I only go now because of a new diagnosis of epilepsy. We’ve spoken about my history of anorexia but I slip past it nowadays. I feel like I’ve spoken as much as I possibly can to a therapist about this silly eating shit. ,False,False

At first I never spoke about my eating at all, just other stuff that bothered me. My therapist could tell I was hiding stuff and said that this won’t work unless I’m willing to put in my all/be completely honest with her.   Turns out she was right, because after I was hospitalized again a few years later because of my ED I spoke to my (newly appointed) therapist about everything and it helped so much more ",False,False

I honestly have a habit of trivializing any issues I have, but I'm conscious of the fact that there are things I do that are typically deemed as ""bad"" or even ""dangerous."" It just doesn't seem like it could really be that bad if no one in my life notices. So I'm scared once I open up they'll try to push a ""higher level of care,"" which is something I don't want or have time for. ",False,True

Then when I was in college I went into therapy for depression and didn’t discuss my ED. THEN lol I went back again after college for panic attacks but did bring up my ED.   You don’t have to disclose anything you don’t want to but even if you do- you don’t have to be actively working on it with them, but it could hold some value in how their treatment plan for you works, regardless of what you go in for originally. If you want to put it on your paperwork that you do have an ED, just note next to it “not ready to discuss” and they will respect that 99.9% of the time. ",False,False
