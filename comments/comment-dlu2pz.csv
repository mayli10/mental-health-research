I still stand by my original point that calories are still important to track for ultimate weight loss success and that keto gets sensationalized inappropriately as something you can ignore calories with.

From your second link  &gt;When glucose availability drops further, the endogenous production of glucose is not able to keep up with the needs of the body and ketogenesis begins in order to provide an alternate source of energy in the form of ketone bodies.  Ketogenesis begins and this allows the creation of ketone bodies. The ketosis comes first, the ketones are a byproduct, just like I said. Also  &gt;As long as the body is deprived of carbohydrates, metabolism remains in the ketotic state.  Meaning as long as you remain under 30g net carbs or less, you are in ketosis. Again, I already said this.  Your third article literally states  &gt;Ketone bodies are not normal intermediates in the degradation of fatty acids, but are formed by special reactions to serve, together with free fatty acids, as a readily oxidizable fuel of oxidation in various tissues when the supply of glucose is restricted.  Ketones are *reactions* to the restriction of glucose due to a ketogenic diet.  I have to go to bed so if you want to continue this... banter, you'll have to wait until tomorrow.",False,False

Yes, your body being forced into ketosis causes your liver to process fats before sugars and carbs- but it starts with *dietary fats*. And isn’t a key component of keto to have not only high protein, but high dietary fats? Then yes, it moves on to body fat. But it doesn’t literally *only eat up body fat* until your body is “done”. Ketosis is an on-off-on state as it’s dependent on what level of ketones are in your blood- which, on another topic, your liver cannot process and a build up *will damage your liver*- so sure, it’ll burn that fat for 10 minutes, but then it’s right back to your food calories. And if you’ve got too much dietary fat in your diet, it’ll ignore your body fat completely.   In the end, calories are *still* important.

Calories aren't all calories and ketosis is a metabolic state, it's not a diet. Being in ketosis decreases mitochondrial efficiency.

I read celebrity diet plans religiously and they all put them on about 1600 calorie diets a day plus exercise just to maintain. Hell Jessica Alba and Britney Spears are both on 1200 calorie diets to maintain which is just crazy to me. 2000 calories is a lot of food quantity wise and part of me feels like Asian culture would kind of be turned off by eating that much food every day.
