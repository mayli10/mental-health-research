The first time I ‘recovered’ I just switched back to BED and it was so painful and triggering that I haven’t attempted recovery since (7 years ago),False,False

Or even just to be in the middle of the normal range. I’d have to lose nearly a quarter of my current weight to get down to 19 BMI! Doesn’t seem possible.   The water reminders are a great idea. I really should do that. I tried fiber supplements but I’m not sure if it really helped. Seemed like it just made me bloated half the time so I couldn’t really tell what was going on with my actual body fat.   And yes, you’re absolutely right that we shouldn’t feel like we are punishing ourselves when all we’re doing is trying to be healthy!",False,True

I've calculated that my metabolism is about 400 calories slower than it should be. I have to restrict more than others to lose weight.,False,False

Right now I’m trying to take the best practices from when I was a heavy restricter (I went from an overweight BMI to underweight BMI between 2011-2013 by switching from BPing to restricting/exercise purging, largely in part to ADHD drugs suppressing my appetite but also other factors, I have since ballooned back up to a high-normal BMI) and incorporate that into my behaviours around food now to stop overeating. I went off my ADHD drugs shortly after going into recovery and for a while I thought I had a grip on things but my appetite is just out of control now. I’m doing things like setting reminders to drink water, drinking unsweetened herbal teas between meals, taking fibre supplements, switching out pasta and rice for shredded vegetables etc all things I used to do when restricting that aren’t inherently negative (and in fact can be very healthy). I also need to switch out of the mind set that I’m “punishing” or “disciplining” myself through restriction. What I’m actually doing is working towards a weight that won’t wreck my joints, will allow me to move and thrive and will keep me around long enough to play with my grandkids.",False,False

I just want to be healthy and feel good!   I too was strongly encouraged to overeat as a child. It’s really hard to fix that. I think I’m getting there, but even now that I understand how these things work I still see the numbers and wonder how the hell is this even possible? I mean I know how it’s possible lol, but how is it possible without ED behaviors?   When I did “just eat whatever you want” I know where that got me and it wasn’t safe or healthy either, just on the other end of the spectrum.",False,True

Like I am 110% recovered in the sense that  -	I no longer literally attribute my value as a person to a number on the scale  -	I love myself and want to thrive/be healthy -	I don’t feel “guilt”** around food ** although I feel disappointment/frustration with my voracious appetite that exceeds my energy to exercise   The thing is, and I really feel like there’s no space for those of us like this to talk about it, just because I’ve recovered doesn’t mean I want to be fat, or that I think being fat is ok. Normal, non-disordered people don’t want to be fat. Being fat sucks. It’s uncomfortable and triggering.  The reality is that I was severely overfed and made fat as a child and I will struggle harder to keep my weight low than anyone who’s naturally slim. I need rigidity, structure and to portion control everything I eat. I need numbers or I will end up obese like every other woman in my family. I deeply resent all these skinny “HAES” dieticians/activists who are “recovered anorexics” pontificating to those of us with BED/bulimia/EDNOS “just eat whatever you want!!” If I did that I would end up immobilized with obesity, thank you.",False,False
