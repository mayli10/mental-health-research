Years ago it was gossip that I was pregnant when I had just gained a lot of weight and wore baggier clothes. I remember another time that I had felt proud of myself for losing some weight and a neighbor randomly asked if I was pregnant and I was *SO* insulted. People really just need to hold their tongues.,False,False
