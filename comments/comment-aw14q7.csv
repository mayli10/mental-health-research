When u first start out they give u a really low dosage and up it from there so give it time.   as for appetite suppressants: soo much caffeine, certain foods like eggs or an apple seem to curb appetite, and then also after work i take 10 mg melatonin or a sleeping pill so i donâ€™t binge as soon as i get home",False,False
