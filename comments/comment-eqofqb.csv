That being said, I haven't disclosed my habits to my therapist so 🤷🏻‍♀️ total hypocrite over here! It's the opposite for me though, she's so petite I feel like she'd just look at me and laugh - I'm basically a giant next to her 🤦🏻‍♀️ the problem with EDs is that they thrive on secrecy, they're like a playground bully. They isolate you and get their kicks from keeping you isolated and miserable. By sharing with your therapist, you'll have an ally to be able to fight back when you're ready.",False,False

She can’t effectively help you if she doesn’t know what it is that you need help with. It’s a cliche but it’s true— secrets keep you sick.",False,False

Btw I’m sorry your school psych was awful about it and you got a new one you like! But think about it like this, there are lots of doctors and nurse who smoke. If you had an illness related from being exposed to secondhand smoke, they wouldn’t take it personally if you sought out help for that!   My therapist wasn’t fat but she was bigger than I am, so i was hesitant to tell her some ED things too. But Therapists are trained to help you work through your own thoughts and know that you aren’t making comments about them or project things onto themselves. There’s lots of things I wasn’t fullly honest about and it was hard to admit that, but she understood it was because I was scared (and helped me work though why I was scared of judgement) and was kind and empathetic about that. A good therapist will understand. You can always bring it up like “hey I’ve been a bit nervous about this but I want to share with you some issues I’ve been having with food.” Also if you explain your hesitance bc you were told “you don’t look like yo have one” (which is such BS bc EDs don’t have a look) they will be even more understanding!  I really encourage you to open up to her about this! And I would bring up the hearing/seeing things too. If it helps, write out a note or outline of what you want to talk about and bring it with you. You can share as much or as little as you are comfortable with Therapists aren’t there to judge or berate you, but to help. Trust me I know it’s so hard to open up but it seems like you’ve found one you like and that is such a valuable resource. You deserve having someone that you can work and feel comfortable with ❤️",False,False
