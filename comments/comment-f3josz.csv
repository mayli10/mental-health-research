Maybe just make sure your taking care of your teeth a bit more?",False,False

But they're so hard to clean in the first place. I always rinsed with water and waited to brush my teeth and floss. However everytime i went to the dentist, he would mention getting a cleaning or budding cavities. Also when i ran my tongue against my back teeth, they were rough, meaning the enamel was stripping away.   Vomit doesn't affect the metal at all..I'm not sure if food gets stuck in it more than usual.  It does discolor the rubber bands a bit. But i had no problem with having braces on. Keep in mind purging wasn't a daily thing for me since i switch between fasting. (mouth hurting makes it easier to not eat) .",False,False

It's scary af but you wont just be able to stop on your own.   In the meantime if you slip up rinse with therabreath and also gargle after you purge and dont brush your teeth for 30 minutes afterwards. Get an electric toothbrush and brush at the gum line. Buy platypus flossers on amazon and floss daily (youtube how to use them). Ask your dentist or orthodontist for an rx strength toothpaste. Use proxy brushes to help brush under the wire. Get cleanings at least every 6 months.   Try to mediate the other acid attacks on your teeth. Soda and juice only with meals. Dont sip them throughout the day. Every time you are exposed to acids from eating normal foods it takes 20 mins for the saliva to neutralize the acid in your mouth naturally.
