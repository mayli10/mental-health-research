I was fucking 127 now Iâ€™m 135. I feel disgusting and worthless I can barely see my ribs through my back anymore ðŸ˜¢. I was loving looking at them every night.    Itâ€™s SO hard to remind myself of this when I actually step on the scale but truthfully your weight by the number is useless. Itâ€™s a combination of water,bones,fat,muscle, but ALSO your weight is determined by WHAT you ate the previous day. You could have eaten something containing a lot of sodium and caused water retention. The time you ate before you weighed yourself. I had a complete breakdown because I gained weight the next morning and was crying only to remember I chugged a bunch of la croix before going to bed the night before.......and after typing all this Iâ€™m probably going to weigh myself and all this will go out the window and Iâ€™ll continue my cycle of self hatred and restrictions.   So I guess all I can really say is, youâ€™re not alone and I understand how you feel and Iâ€™m sorry you feel this way. Sending you internet hugs ðŸ¤—",False,False

Weight fluctuation is a bitch, but please please please know that you CANNOT gain 3lbs of fat/muscle/whatever in just 2 days.   It's just water, it sucks but it's not fat.",False,False
