It would be better to reach out to one of her close friends or family members and ask them to check in.   You don’t even need to disclose that she has an eating disorder, you can keep it very generic—just say you saw her around town, she looks unwell, you’re worried about her physical and mental state, and you would appreciate it if they checked in on her.  Edit: One thing I should add—if she was the one who broke up with you, make sure you’re not looking at this as an opportunity to get back together. Breaking up is hard, but it’s important to respect other people’s autonomy.",False,False
