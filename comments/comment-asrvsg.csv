I read your post, and my first reaction was to offer help, sympathy, and so on. I read through again, in order to properly offer advice, and something struck me. It seems like you're asking for help, but you come up with many excuses. Too many excuses.   You're looking in all the wrong places for help. Your doctor can't watch you all the time, your psychiatrist can't be there every time you have a stray thought. In-patient can only last so long, try to get you marginally functional. There is only one person who can look out for your health, and that is you.   Your psychiatrist is right, in that something needs to change, or you will die. Have you given up your fight? Do you have no reason to live? Are you going to wait until your family sees you in a hospital bed, strings of IV bags and a feeding tube in your nose?     OR      Are you going to face your battles ahead? Change your attitude, face what you have become? You have spent years cultivating these habits, it'll take years to change. Nothing happens overnight, and setbacks happen. Do you want to fight, survive and live a life, or do you want to sit back, and let everyone else slave over your wasting body?   Judgement over, you'll hear me or not. Here is what I recommend: You're lacking nutrition, and you have to start somewhere. Fuck solid food, we don't need that to survive any more. I'm working on a large list of vitamins and minerals, in order to start correcting years of malnutrition. Look at what might be best for you, and start fixing it, that's a win. THIS IS ONLY THE START.   Work from there, start drinkimg some nutrition. Boost, Ensure, any of the breakfast shakes or meal replacement shakes will do. Take an hour to sip on one, that's a win. Buy some applesauce or youghurt packets, sip on those. That's a win. Use a blender, make a high protein shake and take all day to chug it down. That's a win. THIS IS NOT THE END.   While you are doing this, everything seems impossible. You feel alone, paralyzed, and scared. Take a look at your support system. Family, friends, co-workers, who can support you in recovery? Ask for their help, if you haven't already. They don't want to see you in hosptial any more then you want to be there. Let them know how serious this is getting, and ask them to help you with changing your eating habits. STILL NOT THE END.   This all stems from you, making a choice. Do you take the red pill, and fight for your life, or do you take the blue pill, and let it all melt away? Only you can force yourself to change, so find a reason to change, and fight for it. This is up to you. Your decision. Your life. Change starts small, but it adds up like compound interest. Make yourself rich in health, mind and body, not just in your wallet.",False,False

I actually ended up talking to my PHP nurse after I wrote the original post and first comment, and she suggested going to a different hospital that has an inpatient ED program but I’ll have to go through emerg. Hopefully I can get a spot there, though I’d rather not be inpatient since I was inpatient for a month in Jan.   I’m in Canada btw ",False,True

I go to overeaters anonymous (its inclusive of all eds despite the name). Its free and it's really helped me stop purging (and um an atheist).
