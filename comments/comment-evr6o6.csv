You cannot go ""anabolic"" in a deficit, which is required to build any muscle at all, getting bulky in the way you picture would take tens of thousands of calories in surplus over a long period of time with HEAVY weights.   Plus, I've been lifting heavy weights in recovery (aka HELLA surplus) and I'm still not bulky. Just what you might call 'toned'.",False,False
