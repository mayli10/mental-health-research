That's very solid advice for next time    The doctor didn't try to weigh me, just asked for my weight (and said 110 pounds cuz I was wearing baggy clothes anyway) and that was it :) :)  ",False,True

They cannot force you to do anything you don't want to do / consent to. Here's how this will probably go: nurse will ask you to step on the scale you say no thanks nurse will say you can be weighed backward you can still say no thanks, and you're happy to discuss it with your doctor then, if you doctor brings it up (mine didn't, but I'm at a normal weight) you can explain why you don't want to be weighed  Sometimes they push a little more. I've encountered Nurse: we need to know weight for certain medications. Me: I'm not on any medications that are weight-dependent   I am a very assertive, very dont-give-a-f***-about-what-you-think sort of person; I don't mind confrontation. I find that to be fairly abnormal with other ED sufferers, who are often (not always but often) people-pleasers. If you really don't want to get weighed, the challenge for you will be the standing up for yourself part.  Let us know how it goes.",False,False

I weigh in but always ask to not be told what the number is. Realistically, with a BMI that low, a visual assessment will probably suggest you’re underweight even if they don’t know the exact number. But if they bring it up, you might just tell them what you told us about preferring to seek treatment at school. Good luck and stay safe &lt;3",False,False
