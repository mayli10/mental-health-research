I try to stick to maitance after a binge. It sucks and I'm in the process of that tonight. I ate over 3000 yesterday, and I'm actually at maitance for the day. The worst part is the urge to say ""fuck it"" and binge again because I feel guilty and like ate way too much today, but I'm going to solider on because I don't want to start all over tomorrow.   The first steps after a binge are hard, by try to stabalize rather than compensate by fasting. ",False,False
