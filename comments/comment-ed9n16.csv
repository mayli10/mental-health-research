Some people (boys especially) don't understand the seriousness of an ED until someone has literal bones sticking out of them. Similarly, a lot of people WITH EDs don't realize they've gone too far until it's too late. He might just think he's being supportive and not realize in his tiny boy brain the harm he's doing",False,False

When I first told him I thought I had a problem he said I just wanted attention (and to be fair, attention is a twisted reward for being ill). But now, watching him cry over me and stress and tentatively ask if I‚Äôll eat with him, hearing him say he regrets not understanding sooner, etc...it just makes me sad. It makes me wish I never burdened him with my sickness.",False,False

My bf stays neutral. If I say something happy (I lost 1lb!) he gets happy. If I'm sad he reacts with comfort. He never shares his opinion, but sometimes makes compromises I can feel comfortable with to get me to eat.  He bought me a pink food scale for Christmas, because if I don't know the weight of my food I will often just not eat.",False,False

My boyfriend is the one that helped get me to go to therapy and he's always trying to make sure I eat. Like when I say I don't want a food, he says ""because you don't want it or because you're worried about calories?"" and even though sometimes I hate it because I don't want to be forced to eat it is helpful and good for me.
