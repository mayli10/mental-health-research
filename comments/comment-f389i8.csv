The Sun will set on this and the sun will rise for a new day.   Validation came today, to you because you found your strength to share your story with such honesty and strength of character.   Its ok to be struggling now. “to err is to be human.” You don’t need another person to tell you “I have or don’t have an ED.” When you speak you speak your truth for you. This is your treatment and your recovery lived at your tempo and growth.  I can share a similar story with some of what you have written above. I am Sean Male 35. I have struggled with my ED and bipolar depression since I was 12-14 years of age. In my 20’s due to anorexia my life became unmanageable &amp; I was forced to seek help against my wishes.   My arc started in binge eating at 14, transitioned to anorexia in my twenties and bulimia in my 30’s.   The medical treatment around my ED started and ended around hospitals and professionals telling me “I wasn’t exhibiting clear symptoms.” Looking back, it makes me think how little the medical system is geared to ED’s and more towards mental health.   Where you are now is incredibly challenging. What happened to you is not unusual and only you, know you. You can only talk to how you feel. It’s incredibly stressful for people in our position to gain weight. That is a fact that cannot be disputed. Always speak if you’re comfortable and feel safe speaking and know always your voice is valid and deserves to be heard.   Your not fat and your validation comes from your strength.  Your are strong, you are strength.",False,False
