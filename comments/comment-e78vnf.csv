When I lived in dorms last years, and my roommates hadn't seen me for a couple of days because I was busy, they would ""check to see if the instant coffee in my cupboard had moved, because there was never anything in my fridge"".

Joke about how much money you waste getting take out or fast food. Obviously don’t over do it, but if you’re sly you know when to drop the occasional “yeah I waste so much money on fast food but it’s soooo good” “I wish I was motivated enough to cook, but I just hate grocery shopping” My roommate doesn’t have an ED but straight up nothing in the fridge is hers and maybe she has some random cans of soup or pasta in the pantry. She actually is just lazy and buys all her food from restaurants or chains",False,False
