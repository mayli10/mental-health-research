It becomes easy to brush off ED behaviour, because it's this other ""person"" making you do it/doing it to you, and not something you're responsible for. It's like the whole ""Ana/Mia"" thing - it helps to distance oneself from their own decisions I guess? I dunno. I never liked that much tbh. If I'm fucking myself up, I wanna take the damn credit for it, not some disembodied ""other""üôÑ  Also side note (and this probably is just me): treating an ED as not just a separate entity from myself, but as an abuser, is putting a fuckload of guilt on me for not leaving, shame for staying, anger at myself, selfhatred, etc. I've been in abusive relationships and the whole idea of that stresses me out so much. It would be massively counterproductive to me personally, but if it works for that author great I guess. Everyone's different.",False,False

So before I went to treatment I saw the Ed as just me, but in treatment they really encouraged me to see it as something separate from me. It took awhile, and honestly I didn‚Äôt even fully see it until I was almost done with treatment, but now it seems very natural. I had a therapist there describe recovery in a really helpful way. She said it‚Äôs like your brain is a car, and the ED is in the front seat controlling the car while telling you that you can‚Äôt (you‚Äôre not strong enough, thin enough, it‚Äôs not worth it to try, it‚Äôs too hard, etc). Recovery is letting your healthy self take control of the wheel. It‚Äôs hard; you‚Äôre learning to drive while someone in the car is shouting at you that it would be easier if they did it, they‚Äôre better at it, you‚Äôll never do it anyway. But the thing is, in order to recover, you have to keep trying. Your ED and your healthy self are enemies, but once you learn to drive you realize you can do it and you always could. Ugh I didn‚Äôt say that as well as she did but I hope the message gets across. It‚Äôs really helpful to me to see it that way because I really feel like my healthy self is my true self, and the eating disorder likes to fight back.

It's on a shelf behind me. I bought it about 7 years ago when I first attempted recovery. For me, personifying my ED was helpful because it became an issue during a point in my life where I was both too young to be self aware in those ways, and did not have steady supervision/care so it was hard to notice behavior patterns. It helped me identify the voices in my head as the disorder, because again, they had been there for my entire life (or so it seems).   It does seem strange, but I found that method helpful. There are many more ideas and methods in that book, and exposure therapy is something I learned about because of certain passages.   &amp;#x200B;  I never gave a name to my voice/monster/disease (I'm not a big fan of calling myself by my own name...idk) but I do have a visual for it...and it manifests along side my gender dysphoria, and is associated with my desire to be male.
