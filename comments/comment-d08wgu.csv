My friends did express concern when I stopped eating lunch but they chalked it up to the fact that our school had terrible food and very few meat-free options.  The problem with being thin is no one cares until you're looking dangerously underweight, I'm finding out.",False,False

Overeating? Must be the hormones! A growing boy needs his food! Undereating? Ridiculous! Why aren't you more hungry? Must just be a mood! Anyways, football....   This resonates with me deeply.   Would you say help was more available and readily offered when you were female then?",False,True

I can provide an opinion as someone who's ""climbed the fence"", if you will (female-to-male transgender).  I've had my eating disorder since I was 15 and been out as trans since 20 and on hormones since age 21, so I've had my ED as both a woman and a guy, if you want to look at it that way.  Women's EDs do get more attention. I could probably also attribute my experience to being in high school and therefore under entirely more scrutiny, but people are far more concerned overall with how women look, what women eat, and what they weigh...and they seem to think that only women can have EDs.  As a guy, a lot of ED symptoms get brushed off. Overeating? Must be the hormones! A growing boy needs his food! Undereating? Ridiculous! Why aren't you more hungry? Must just be a mood! Anyways, football....  You get the point. Anyways, as a guy, and also as an adult, no one's going to think to question anything except people veeeery close to me. And I mean, I say this, but my fianc√© hasn't asked me anything outright yet. And should I seek help from a doctor, it's going to be much harder as a guy (and probably much harder for me personally, as doctors are likely to pass it off as gender dysphoria and not body dysmorphia on top of the dysphoria).  If you have any questions, ask away!",False,False
