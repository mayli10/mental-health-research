He likes soft bellies. And bloating. There’s whole subreddits dedicated to it, which he does not run lol, so it’s a thing. It’s triggering to me so I don’t recommend it but it’s called Stuffers",False,True

I don’t think he would ever ask me to gain weight— he might ask me to drink a lot of water before bed sometime though. I hate being bloated on my period, and it’s when I feel the least sexy. It feels like he’s most attracted to me then or after I’ve binged and hate myself. I don’t binge a lot these days... we also don’t seem to have sex very much these days. I would never binge *for* him or purposely gain weight. I just want to be healthy. I wish he was attracted to me when I feel healthiest. I am starting to think we’re sexually incompatible.",False,True

I'd talk to your boyfriend about his kink. Is he okay just keeping it as an online kink? If he wants to bring it into the bedroom, talk about boundaries. How would you feel if he wants you to eat massive amounts of food? How would you feel if he wants you to put on weight?   You say that it's triggering for your ED. Your mental health should always come first in relationships (or at least, be a mutual priority). Let him know your feelings and thoughts.",False,False
