He constantly gave me shit for eating ""to much broccoli"" while he was downing 3000+ calories of Mc.ds. I thought it was pretty obvious that only eating 350-500 calories a day, weighing myself 50+ times a day ext. was pretty obvious that this isn't a normal diet.

One time, I got 2 cups of strawberries, no big deal right? Nope. She said that it was ""Too many strawberries"", like wow... I was breaking my fast and it's fucking strawberries like who cares if it's ""too many"".    I have another friend who may or may not also have an eating disorder, and when I told her about all of that, she told me to stop talking to that girl.",False,False
