[I'm a Child Anorexic](http://digital.films.com/play/L5FEX8)  [http://digital.films.com/play/L5FEX8](http://digital.films.com/play/L5FEX8)  Therapists in America and Europe have noticed a disturbing trend: anorexia now appears in elementary-school-age children. This film documents the highs and lows of a London clinic's 12-week program, during which malnourished patients must confront and conquer their fears of eating. Girls as young as eight enter the clinic dangerously emaciated and depressed-and although most battle their way back to good health and reunions with loved ones, do their attitudes toward food really change? Once home, will they revert to old ways? The documentary reveals frighteningly distorted beliefs that run rampant among the young patients-one girl even insists that water contains calories-and it offers surprising revelations about the role of idealized body images in the media. A BBCW Production. (57 minutes)  [Battling Eating Disorders](http://digital.films.com/play/SCBNGX)   [http://digital.films.com/play/SCBNGX](http://digital.films.com/play/SCBNGX)  Anorexia and other eating disorders exert a frightening degree of control over millions of teenagers, especially young women. Manifested in so-called ""Pro-Ana"" websites, which actively promote anorexia, bulimia, and binge eating, the mental and physical grip of these sicknesses can prove impossible to break. This program represents a powerful weapon in the battle against eating disorders, pinpointing their origins in body image and self-esteem issues, illustrating their grim consequences in crystal-clear terms, and offering students, parents, teachers, and counselors a rich source of information and support. Hosted by The Sopranos' Jamie-Lynn Sigler, herself a survivor of teenage anorexia, the video explains how to recognize eating disorders, how friends and loved ones should communicate their fears and concerns, and how those who suffer from these often fatal illnesses can find professional help. Special emphasis is placed on identifying anorexia, bulimia, and binge eating as actual diseases, not as misguided lifestyle choices-a realization necessary for effective treatment.  [Body Image for Boys](http://digital.films.com/play/QC6DSZ)  [http://digital.films.com/play/QC6DSZ](http://digital.films.com/play/QC6DSZ)  As the idealized male physique continues to be hyped in movies, on TV, in magazines, and on billboards, a rapidly growing number of men are becoming obsessed with appearance. Each year alone, they spend billions on gym memberships and home exercise equipment-and women are no longer alone in battling anorexia and body dysmorphic disorder. This topical program explores some of the issues facing young men today as they struggle to define themselves amidst the flood of media-generated images of male physical perfection. Experts including Divya Kakaiya, the visionary founder and clinical director of the Healthy Within treatment center; Leigh Cohn, co-author of the seminal Making Weight: Men's Conflicts with Food, Weight, Shape, and Appearance; and UCLA Healthcare sports medicine physician Gary Green as well as a number of young patients grapple with problems such as steroid abuse, eating disorders, exercise addiction, and phony food supplements. A viewable/printable instructor's guide is available online. A Cambridge Educational Production. (18 minutes)  [Eating Disorders](http://digital.films.com/play/3CZQX2)  Anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa-two conditions rooted in the desire to be slim-are the focus of this program. While the first deprives the body of food, the other causes its victims to compulsively purge food through vomiting. Two women who suffer with these conditions tell poignant stories of how these compulsive behaviors have nearly destroyed their lives and the lives of their respective families. An expert explains the specialized approach used in treating both disorders.

Based on the story told by her mother and on her own diaries, it traces Catherine's downward spiral from the age of 15, when a lively and attractive teen became obsessed by her weight, went on binges, became addicted to laxatives, and, despite desperate efforts from many sides, died weighing an incredible 40 pounds. This is strong subject matter; we recommend that you preview this program before showing it to younger audiences. (80 minutes)",False,False

At 457 pounds, Wally knows. And Tammy, at 67 pounds, has experienced both anorexia and bulimia-at the same time. This haunting program introduces eight ordinary people who tell, in a chillingly matter-of-fact way, about their life-scarring-and even severely life-threatening-experiences with body weight and self-image. Bouts with eating disorders are described in detail, as well as deep feelings of hurt, anger, alienation, and utter hopelessness. Fear of Fat provides penetrating insights into society's unhealthy focus on thinness and the toll in mental and physical suffering that such cultural fixation exacts. (60 minutes)  [Picture Perfect: Chasing an Impossible Goal](http://digital.films.com/play/WXTMXZ)  [http://digital.films.com/play/WXTMXZ](http://digital.films.com/play/WXTMXZ)  Alicia, a 16-year-old, has battled anorexia since she was nine. Due to body dysmorphic disorder, Tim believes that his flat stomach is huge. A high school swimmer, Haley initially wanted breast augmentation to correct a size imbalance but then opted for enlargement. This program follows several case studies in order to highlight what can happen when the quest for physical perfection goes too far. Patients, families, doctors, and psychologists confront the dangers and difficulties of an obsession. Produced by CBS NEWS. (45 minutes)  [Silent Hunger, The: Anorexia and Bulimia](http://digital.films.com/play/8UAPQL)  [http://digital.films.com/play/8UAPQL](http://digital.films.com/play/8UAPQL)  This program answers two important questions: what are eating disorders, and what causes them? The program specifically examines anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, and binge eating syndrome. Seven females who have all suffered from eating disorders, the father of a woman who died as a result of her disorder, and health professionals offer their insights and knowledge. These interviews are highlighted by dramatic sequences designed to encourage a greater understanding of the issues and emotions associated with eating disorders. (46 minutes)  [Stockholm Solution, The: New Therapies for Eating Disorders](http://digital.films.com/play/Q2UFWK)  [http://digital.films.com/play/Q2UFWK](http://digital.films.com/play/Q2UFWK)  With a 75 percent success rate in treating anorexia and bulimia, Stockholm's Karolinska Institute is in the vanguard of eating disorder therapy. This program follows patients through the Karolinska regimen as they relearn healthy eating behavior, gradually recognizing natural feelings of satiety with the help of a computerized biofeedback system. Closely observing the Institute's counseling sessions, the video shows how the Karolinska approach counters traditional clinical methods, which typically involve medication, family dynamics, and a high rate of recidivism. The Stockholm Solution portrays a medical revolution-and what is for many young women a new lease on life. (37 minutes)  [Wasting Away: Anorexia Nervosa](http://digital.films.com/play/UMNEFA)  [http://digital.films.com/play/UMNEFA](http://digital.films.com/play/UMNEFA)  This emotionally charged program profiles four young women attempting to recover from anorexia nervosa. Ranging in age from 14 to 25, they struggle to gain weight while dealing with associated conditions such as osteoporosis and depression, family dysfunctionality, and a mind-set that equates starvation with self-control. Filmed at the adolescent eating disorder unit of Westmead Hospital in Sydney and a private outpatient clinic, the program captures the complexities of a devastating psychological disorder that drives women to continuously lose weight-even if it kills them. (47 minutes)  [When Food Is the Enemy: Eating Disorders](http://digital.films.com/play/DTK34P)  [http://digital.films.com/play/DTK34P](http://digital.films.com/play/DTK34P)  Ranging from the starvation diet of the anorexic to certain forms of obesity, eating disorders are a diverse group of health problems. This program examines the emotional issues that lie behind most eating disorders, the serious and sometimes life-threatening consequences of eating disorders, and methods of treatment. Experts and patients alike offer their insights. A Meridian Production. (25 minutes)  [Eating Disorders: New Approaches to Treatment](http://digital.films.com/play/RPHKQ4)  [http://digital.films.com/play/RPHKQ4](http://digital.films.com/play/RPHKQ4)  Eating disorders are not just about food, but about the struggle with loss of emotional control. This program from The Doctor Is In examines the use of antidepressants and cognitive behavioral therapy to combat these dangerous illnesses. Russell Marx, M.D., of the eating disorders program at the Princeton Medical Center, and Marcia Herrin, Ed.D., M.P.H., R.D., of the Dartmouth College Health Service, explain what is being done to prevent and treat one of the most lethal categories of mental illness.
