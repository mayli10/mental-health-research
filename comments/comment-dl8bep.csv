I think it’s when I combine fasting + lax (pls don’t ask what would prompt me to do that- I have no idea).   I’m so sorry it’s happening to you :( I would recommend eating a small meal to settle your stomach. I know that’s not always easy to do. I’m so sorry you’re dealing with that and I hope you can feel better soon. &lt;3,False,False
