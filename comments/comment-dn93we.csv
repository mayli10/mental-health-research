I'm going through replapse too right now and it feels like it would be so easy to fall back in to old, comfortable but bad habits. But that's the exact reason I am talking about it this time to people. I've told my doctor and my best friend and they can't do anything for me right now but knowing that they know is helpful.   I just posted this in reply to someone else but I think it really fits well here too:  Try to reach out for help.  It's there and I promise it's not as terrifying as it feels like it will be. It always feels like you're sitting at the top of a massive cliff and asking for recovery is like throwing yourself off and asking to be caught... but it's much slower and gentler than that. It's more like being at the top of a grassy hill and rolling down while some people roll with you and other people cheer you on.",False,False

But the fact that you've chosen recovery and you're looking for support at a time like this is incredible.   Just try to remind yourself that recovery is not a straight path. There will be ups and downs, there will be progress made and progress lost. That's totally normal, and doesn't mean you've failed by any means. It's hard work to get better, but you absolutely can do this! Best of luck!",False,False
