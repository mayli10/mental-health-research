I started restricting in 8th grade and lost 20lbs. I got so much praise. But I cant diet for long. I'm a food addict. The bulimia came when I was almost 200lbs and needed to lose but couldnt control the binging. I became depressed after breaking up with someone who i really liked who didnt consider our relationship even dating.   Men dont like fat women. I'm in my 30s and I am chronically single. I've never had a boyfriend. I'm a loser. I just want to be thin and relive that time in my life when people were nice to me and guys were interested. ,False,False

Her mom, my grandma (5’-3”, 120lb soaking wet at her heaviest), never had an issue with her weight or self esteem as she was constantly sought after in our miserable corner of the earth. She grew up during a period of starvation, rations, and gulags, so the concept of “fat” was a bit of a non issue. The combination of those two situations resulted in grandma being unintentionally abusive about our appearances over the course of mine and my mom’s lives. When I was 5 years old, I remember my grandma telling me I was getting too fat for my dress. I’ve looked at photos from that time and I was a beanpole, but I remember being so ashamed that when I stood straight with good posture like grandma demanded, my stomach curved outward. My grandma helped raise me in America until I was about 7 or 8, and then went back to the motherland. She would call us to catch up occasionally. Her first words to me every single time were “have you lost that weight yet?” This continued on until I was 24– every visit to the motherland would be spent listening to her tell me not to bother getting dolled up because it was for nothing, telling me I need to have self control while pouring me my third helping of bourscht, and so on. It finally stopped when she came to visit me in America and I offered her a pair of slacks I don’t wear. I was a year into bulimia, throwing up 3-4x a day. She asked me if I got too fat for them. “Quite the opposite,” I told her, “they’re too big. Try them on.”   They barely zipped. I love you, grandma, but fuck you for preying on my insecurities. That golden day is etched into my brain for eternity out of spite.",False,False

Then I was just “ok” with my weight for a while. Then this winter came and I just felt... fat again? So my ED kicked in extra hard the past three-four months and now I’m down another 6 pounds.
