The main issue is only one of the medicines so they may be able to help. I have to take 4 little pills of it every night which always get stuck in my throat when I take it with water. I usually end up throwing up because of it (I've never been ""into"" that, and it just brings the other pills back up so it's a bad time all round).   Do dissolvable meds have calories in them? I know it wouldn't be anywhere near as many as food/drink that I am currently using, but am curious nonetheless.",False,True

I used to work at a pharmacy and there was a 15 yr old girl who had a hard time swallowing vitamin d pills so the pharmacy was able to help order a liquid drinkable version for her.  Just ask what they have for liquid or dissolvable alternatives to the meds you take.",False,False
