Life triggers ED, ED affects life and so on üôÅ  I have the same problem with doctors appointments. I found interesting that sometimes some amazing therapy sessions still end up with binging for me. I get that my ED is feeling threatened and is trying to survive but it's still disappointing...  Thank you! It's all good at work for now but there's going to be some stressful months ahead and I know my ED will come back stronger than ever. Like you I feel almost normal right now since things are going pretty well but unfortunately it never lasts.",False,True

So for right now my rule is to keep restricting to a minimum when I am on a tough clinical rotation for school. It‚Äôs so hard though because I feel so fat I can barely stand it and it makes me want to cry and no one in my life understands that.",False,False

During periods of stress and change, I just know I'm going to binge and restrict more. If I have doctors appointments coming up and/or my most recent blood pressure reading was bad (this is my biggest trigger and the reason why I no longer own a home b.p. monitor), I don't even bother to try to stop myself because it's the only way I know how to ward off the panic.  But when I'm not freaking out, my health anxiety is lower and it's easier to forget about food and eat more normally. Same goes for work, when things are calm and I'm engaged it's almost like a pleasant distraction. But other than maybe some small effects of stomach aches and poor sleep, it doesn't go the other way - my work attendance/performance stays about the same even when I'm having a bad ED time. Granted, I'm more or less in recovery at this point, so that's to be expected.",False,False
