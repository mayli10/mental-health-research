I have a surgery that I don't absolutely need but that would improve my quality of life significantly, and while I'm a normal bmi and eligible for the surgery, my results will be much better if I lose more weight, so I want that.  I want to get fit, and the less I weigh 1. the better I run, which is my main focus, 2. the less terrible/self-conscious I feel in a gym, and 3. the more any muscle gains show, which helps with 2 and also with motivation.  I have plenty of good reasons to want to lose weight. The problems arise for my methods of getting there, and my reactions to failure, and my relationship with myself and food, and the fact that even my muscle thinspo is underweight.",False,False
