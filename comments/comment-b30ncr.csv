I live in an area with a huge homeless population and it makes me feel so good to give those folks my leftovers after eating out. Yeah, the thinking behind it is hella disordered - I won't eat most of what I ordered even if I'm hungry bc I'm restricting/don't wanna look like a fat pig in front of others/am afraid of triggering a binge cycle, then remember that I always binge on leftovers right after I get home anyway bc I'm a piece of shit, then feel like I have to get rid of them to avoid being a piece of shit. But as you say, it's nice to be able to turn my pain into happiness for someone else. It's the little things.",False,False
