And take electrolytes. I had to get off that sub though because it was too triggering and making me fucking insane. I feel like you need excess fat to fast because when you deprive your body of food it eats fat stores. And oh no, what if you don't have a lot of that? You'll feel crappy. Don't worry about matching them. And probably avoid that sub. Those people are toxic to people like us.",False,False

Extended fasting while underweight or malnourished would definitely affect a normal/underweight person differently. :( Also FWIW I only started binging when I started trying to do extended fasts, so it's not really the best tool for some people",False,False

How my fasting goes:  * Day 1: Start losing energy, standing up is getting harder, huge urge to sleep the day away. * Day 2: Oops seeing spots in my vision. Every thing hurts, muscles ache, my back is fucked, slightest movement exhausts me.  Must be low on sodium amirite?? * Day 3:  Oh yeah haha the first 2 days are the hardest, I'm good now! In reality I'm just accustomed to being sore all over and having no energy to live.  I've adjusted how I stand up so I'll catch myself if I faint!  * Day 4: Feel like a failure for breaking my fast bc I was pretty sure that's what dying feels like, but the internet keeps telling me fasting is ~so easy~ and they feel even MORE energetic even!!  Didn't experience that?  Must've broken the fast too soon/ try buying our special fasting supplements. Fuck off.",False,False

Ur not able to fast like that because you donâ€™t have a plethora of excess body fat. Iâ€™ve been a very close to anorexic, exercise aholic teen who would nearly die from going 24 hours without food.   To someone who actually gained excess body fat and had high cholesterol and triglycerides as a 22 yo and I could easily go 24 without food. A lot of people who have been underweight or very low body fat their whole life are never gonna understand what itâ€™s like to be overweight but itâ€™s completely different.

These people doing ""extended fasts"" when I get nauseous and shaky and pass out levels of dying internally after no time at all? It's so hard to rationalize and it feels... So unfair?
