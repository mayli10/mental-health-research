I had a waffle with syrup and Nutella, a pancake, some yogurt, a steamed bun and literally four mini pastries. I feel so disgusting and ashamed of myself, but I literally have no control when it comes to buffets.",False,False

I’m trying to eat more normally for my boyfriend who worries a lot when I’m not eating properly and I’ve been passing out a lot over the last few days which has scared him, so I’ve decided to try and eat intuitively for a bit.  Today I had 2 slices of buttered toast (like 200kcal probably) in the early morning a little after I woke up so I wouldn’t collapse and then later on (like 9AM) I had a tin of spaghetti (320kcal) with a slice of buttered rye toast (like 100kcal) since I was dizzy and my stomach hurt, and I also had a satsuma little after that bringing my total to 650kcal.  But yeah, I have exactly the same thoughts.",False,False
