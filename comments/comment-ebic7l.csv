I LOVED swimming recreationally every summer and would swim every change that I got. Now I can't go because I'll feel sooo shitty in my own body and I will hate it.   * I stopped visiting friends/family friends because I didn't want them to see how much weight I've gained since they last saw me. This was probably one of the worst parts of my ED.   * Actual intuitive eating. Before my ED, my body and mind just knew when to stop eating without feeling the need to eat as much as I could and taking my time to eat (I eat fast now whereas I used to eat very slow) and never having cravings. Not thinking about food until meal time.   * My energy levels. I rarely get fatigued or exhausted anymore, but now I only feel okay. My energy levels are fine, but they were so much better before my ED. I don't have as much stamina as I used to, even when I eat enough or more and eat very healthy.   I'm recovered now in the sense that I am now content with my weight and would be okay with staying this way for the rest of my life and not willing to eat less than I need in order to lose weight. But these are still things that I still have to work on.",False,False
