I logged back out of my Ed account to try and stop triggering myself. I actually quite enjoy the work and the clients most of the time. The problem was my now ex was being distant and I just wasn't emotionally capable of managing everything. Since the break up and feeling slightly better it was easier again. I just have to be super aware of my mental state because if I go in vulnerable it's awful.,False,True
