Tell them you don’t feel well/don’t have an appetite anymore cuz of the pain  Old trick sometimes works depending on the plate and how observant your family is, but cut up the food, mix it around, take a few bites in between, be talking a lot or drawing attention to other people, always have food on your fork/spoon, make it look like you’re engaged with the plate without ever actually eating   Another thing that can work is order a dish like a salad (always hard to tell how much you ate), comment on how big the salad is when the server brings it out “wow this is huge! I’m so pumped for this”, then after the meal if anyone comments on how much food is left on the plate you can be like “hey I put a dent in it! The serving sizes are massive here”  Last trick - order a meat. Ideally steak but chicken and fish will work. Take a bite or 2 of the meat and just kinda stop eating it. When someone inevitably comments (typically happens towards the end of the meal when everyone is done focusing on their own food) say you didn’t like how the meat was done. Play the passive role and say “well I didn’t want to be obnoxious or rude and send the food back, our waiter was so nice anyways!!!”. Take the heat for wasting parents money but at least ur ED brain isn’t gonna drive you crazy lol",False,False
