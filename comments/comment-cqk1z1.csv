Like what subterranean sewer did this turd person crawl out of that he thought for even one second that anybody needed to know his opinion on your body????? Like was he raised by a baboon??? Did he skip the entire part of his childhood where he was supposed to learn manners???? Who inflated his ego to the astronomical size necessary to think that this dumbass sentiment needed to ever be expressed aloud???,False,False
