It was really tough, but what got me out of it was cooking. You don't even have to eat, but the first thing I made was a cake for my mom, one that she loved eating when we went out once. I got so excited to see her excited, and so I kept going. I kept cooking and baking for this reason, and I got really excited about it! I made everyone in my family a cake for their birthdays, I made dinner three times a week, and you sort of feel obligated to eat because you worked on it. You might even find some foods you enjoy eating in the process. I developed a larger and larger interest, and the calories I counted started to blur. At this point, the calories stared blurring as I realized that if I'm still under eating, I'll continue to lose weight and I'll get weaker. Also I became too lazy to do calories anyway. It's been two years and I feel a lot happier, I was so stressed everyday that I was anorexic and food was all I thought about every day. Every day I over ate even one calorie I felt like bursting into tears. Now, I've blossomed and while it took me a while to put the weight back on, I look a lot better now. It helped me focus on socializing and stuff and now I found lots of people I love and can think about instead of food. My body is thanking me for going from pam sauteed mushrooms for dinner to a bowl of homemade ramen. Please give it a go. It saved me.",False,False

I see your *amazing* amazing, inspiring, and validating posts all of the time on FDS. Please, do not kill yourself. It is not the solution. It sounds from previous posts that you have worked very hard to emancipate yourself from a lot of pressures and sexist expectations. We need more women like you in the world to inspire all of us other women who are still struggling with sexism, hatred against women, and douche bags.   I’m not sure of your exact circumstances of course, but would moving, getting a new job, an apartment for your self help at all? For example if you live at home, family can be extremely triggering. Or you may  be a minor and still in school. If so, I’d highly recommend weekly therapy until you’re able to escape your family. Your living situation and who you live with is *huge*. I find it can either really help me, or really hurt me. Either or, seeking therapy would be my #1 priority if I was feeling like you were (and I have before many times). A good therapist can be incredibly supportive and help you get treatment if needed while / if you’re feeling suicidal.  Edit: I see you’re in college, that can be a really tough time. Does your campus offer free counseling?",False,False

When I can bring myself to eat, my body does pretty much everything it can to tell me I’m being a dumb bitch. I don’t even remember what it’s like to not be thinking about food 100% of the time, for so many years now.  It’s so exhausting, all of it is. The having no friends, the energy it takes to live minute to minute, the fainting. All of it is so fucking hard. I know it all fucking sucks. You’re not alone here, I promise you that. My messages are open if you want to talk. But either way, you’re not alone here. And even though it really doesn’t seem possible, and I’m saying this for my own benefit too, recovery is possible. Maybe not right now, but it is possible. And you’ll probably cry at food and drink to sleep, but it doesn’t have to be that way forever. You can get there, we both can. This shit is hard, and people who don’t have EDs can barely even begin to fathom what this disease really is and what it’s like. But you’re not alone, and this doesn’t have to be the end. I’m sorry you’re struggling so much right now. If there is any way I can help at all, send me a message. You can get better, even if it takes a lot of work and a lot of time, you can.",False,False

Please seek help whether is professional  spiritual or self help (like meditation and reflection)  Please you are not your disease you are stronger than you think you are and I believe in you I know you can do it   Try to think back to what started this why you started to restrict and what triggered you to do so  You can work from there to see if theres other reasons for its presence :)   Stay strong and if you need a friend dm me :)  #You are beautiful you are loved and you are strong you got this,False,False
