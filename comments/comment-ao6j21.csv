I'm not sure if you have recovery in mind, but 2500-3000 is definitely not unreasonable, and it's *definitely* not food for three people. It might not even be enough for one person, especially if you're recovering from restriction. You also said you genuinely felt hungry at the time and only after felt bad about it - sounds like intuitive eating to me, and the guilt is your ed talking. You also mentioned fasting though, so I'm not sure where you're at, but just know you're doing great, okay?",False,False
