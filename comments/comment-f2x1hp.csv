The tuna kit has around 20g of protein depending on the brand and the egg has around 6g. Also, if you like oatmeal, add 2 egg whites (7g protein) while it cooks and maybe some powdered peanut butter and top it with a bit of plain Greek yogurt (I also sometimes chop up a chocolate protein bar and sprinkle it on top in lieu of chocolate chips). If you like potato chips I suggest looking into chicharrones (pork rinds), they have a satisfying crunch and have a decent amount of protein for the calories. Jack Link's has a snack bag of jerky that's only 100 cal and the teriyaki flavour is good combined with a konjac noodle dish. And lastly even though they aren't super low cal, I eat a lot of protein bars for dessert because they are more filling and still have less calories than a regular chocolate bar (my go-to is Pure Protein, especially the Peanut Caramel or Salted Caramel, which taste really close to Snickers and Mars bars IMO. ~19-21g protein).",False,False

I like Whey protein isolate - lots of different options in brands and gotta check the label but they average around 100 calories with 20grams of protein per serve (depends on ingredients). I usually have a really big scoop for around 200 calories and 40grams protein, which is a big portion of my daily needs. Mixed just with water.",False,False

There are different amino acids that make up protein, beans are good to get them but having some from different sources is the way to go. Protein powders are good cause they'll have the balance of them all so you can make them into shakes or mix it into your oatmeal or a lil into soup (if it's unflavoured).",False,False
