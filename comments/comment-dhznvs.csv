You are probably in your early to mid 20s when your adrenals are going nuts anyway.  All of this will settle down in a few years.  But at the heart of the panic attacks is a death anxiety that a lot of people have but aren't philosophically equipped to deal with.  I recommend some healthy protein smoothies and long walks in nature.  Take a multivitamin also if you're not already on one.  And stick with it for at least a few weeks.,False,False

I've recently been learning that it can manifest in a lot of ways I had no idea about.",False,False
