It’s so sweet of you to care about that.  I don’t really do that with people IRL often (probably because I live away from all of my real friends), but I did catch myself loudly guesstimating my besties McDonald’s meal when I visited her.   However I am obsessed with online calorie counting. Per example you tubers, if they don’t put calories in what I eat in a day I will literally put it al in Cronometer. I remember watching this vegan girl’s daily eating and it ended up being around 2700 calories. I panicked like it was me lol.  Don’t feel guilty, it’s just your brain in it’s disordered habits :)",False,False
