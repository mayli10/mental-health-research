I gave her the option to walk away after I told her, explaining that I would have some issues around food/ be somewhat socially awkward/ have problems picking up on cues with intimacy.  She was very understanding and decided to stay.   It’s the first time it hasn’t been a dealbreaker, although it might have to do with the fact that being a guy who struggles with BED/bulimia isn’t really ever thought about, even regarding ED’s.",False,False

I wanted to tell him the first time we were together, but I just couldn’t bring myself to ever get the words out even though keeping it from him was making me feel guilty? Like I was keeping this huge secret from him (which I guess was kind of true.)  When we first met I was in an “okay” place with my ED, I was more or less just maintaining even though that wasn’t my goal. But then I went into a restriction phase and started losing again and for me personally, when I’m restricting hard I’m just not myself at all. Like I’m distant and depressed more and I think I wanted to tell him because I didn’t want him to feel like me being like that had anything to do with him. But I just always said “I’m just depressed and going through a hard time right now.” But another part of me felt like as my SO, he deserved to know about my ED. And that I should tell him sooner than later.   We broke up for a couple of months, started talking again, and idk one night when we were talking about our previous relationship and our feelings about each other I was like “hey, remember how I always wanted to tell you something, but was too scared to? Umm well I have an eating disorder.” (I mean it was more drawn out than that but that was the gist) And he just said that he was glad that I told him, and that I shouldn’t feel that way about my self (bad self image and such) and he just hugged me. He couldn’t have been more supportive honestly. And we’ve been together for a little bit now, and he’s never forced food on me or has said anything about my eating, portions, etc. He’ll say that I should eat something if he knows I haven’t had anything all day, but he’s never been like “no you NEED to eat something” or if I eat something small he’s just glad I had something rather than nothing. And at this point I’m pretty open and honest about it all and I feel ~fairly~ comfortable with saying things like “yeah eating has been kind of hard lately” just to idk let him know and be aware and he has really been nothing but supportive from the start.",False,False

He wanted to know why I was worried about the app not loading and why I was worried about calories since I had been losing weight.  I told him about the restricting and calorie intake and that my therapist and my doctor knew already.  He was a little upset that I didn't tell him first but was understanding for now. Its going to be a long road because half of me wants to stop this crazy ride and the other half get excited every time my weight drops on the scale.,False,False

Sometimes it’s best to get ahead of things and tell them you’ve been working out and counting macros (sounds better than calories) OR you could say you’re doing intermittent fasting. Either way, read up on both, first.   Personally, I told my SO early on that I have weird feelings about food (EDNOS) which is true. Certain situations/environments/foods given me anxiety and I can’t eat, etc. he was understanding and never questions me. We also go to the gym together regularly, but we aren’t together enough of the day for him to see me eating.",False,False

On the one hand I kind of really want to tell him because I know I can get bad sometimes and do need to be told it’s okay to eat that piece of toast or that avocado. I guess I’m just mostly scared that he’s going to try to get me to eat everyday. It’s just getting hard to hide throwing everything up that we eat together.  I told my last boyfriend, only because I noticed he seemed to have one too. He did, and we ended up competing on who could lose the most weight.",False,False
