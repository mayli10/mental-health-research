I like my body so much I‚Äôm terrified of gaining any weight and losing my body.   TW: Weight   I‚Äôm 1 lb over an ‚Äúuw‚Äù BMI for context.  Still actively restrict to be lighter, then ultimately binge purge Bc hungry/guilty tho",False,False

But losing weight makes me feel in control, as cliche as it is. I still want to lose weight despite being UW, and my main reason why is 'because I can'.",False,False

I feel like I'm faking it because I don't have this crippling self hatred everyone else with an ED seems to have, but I still break down if I feel like I ate too much or if I gain weight. My ED isn't even about body image anymore, it's just a byproduct of my laziness around food and habits that are too ingrained to change.",False,False

Good to know I'm not alone :) Idk if you can post numbers here so I'll leave them out just in case. But I lost a significant amount of weight at the beginning of the year through extreme restriction (and stimulants like cocaine and adderall) because I felt so fat after leaving my ex. I had put on 40 lbs during our relationship. Felt awful. Then when all that weight melted off I started healing emotionally and connected the two in my head. Like ""oh restricting is what got you to this good place in life"" üôÉ",False,True

Maybe half the time but my ed is definitely not about weight loss. I wouldn‚Äôt be devastated if I never lost anymore weight (I‚Äôd like to but eh). My ed is more about the crippling fear of getting fat again. I binge, so I restrict and over exercise to compensate. I don‚Äôt those things to lose.   I‚Äôve been maintaining my weight for the last 3 months through binging and restricting and exercise purging. It‚Äôs just a waste of time when I could be maintaining and NOT torturing myself lol",False,False
