I also failed recovery and relapsed six months ago and i recently found out why so much of my restriction did not pay off. Turns out i had a thyroid condition the whole time and so many of my problems could be solved if i would finally be put on meds. My life is pretty much the same tho, i wake up, eat breakfast and spend the rest of the day walking in order to burn the calories. Midway i usually ask myself where tf i am going with all this.",False,False

Thankfully it’s winter where I live, but even wearing leggings triggers me - so I know exactly what you mean.  What made me this of this mostly was the bike I purchased - it makes a similar sound to the hamster wheel and then it hit me I’m basically a human pet of my ED lol.",False,True
