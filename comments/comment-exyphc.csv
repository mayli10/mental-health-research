Replenishing your electrolytes won't fix the exhaustion of starvation (that's caused by the calorie deficit) but it does help you feel a whole lot less shitty",False,False

Are you drinking enough fluids, like water? I tend to get tired when I'm dehydrated.  Coffee is good too, as long as you don't go too crazy on it.

With one friend or two I can get laughing and talking and I honestly feel a bit rejuvenated.  It's really nice.  Also feel tired when I'm cold so it might help to put on an extra layer of clothing.   Hope these help a bit!",False,False
