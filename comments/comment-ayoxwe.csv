If that makes sense. My ass bones show before my ribs. ,False,True

I've never worn anything bigger than a 32 band in bras, even when I was borderline obese. Lower weight means ordering online because nobody stocks 28 bands or below. And yet my upper stomach fat still bulges out because my bras have to really dig into it to be supportive.   On the other side, my pelvic bone is just massive. It's not fair.",False,False

My ribs always show because they go out so wide, so no matter how much weight I lose I always look bigger because of how much space they take up. So I'm always a wide, space-taking up creature that will never be able to feel small. I've even googled procedures to remove ribs so I could appear smaller. I've had someone tell me ""Man, your so small when your turned sideways but your like a wall facing forwards!"" That really stuck with me.  Sorry to ramble. But I guess the point I'm making is that the grass is definitely not greener on the other side lol. ",False,False
