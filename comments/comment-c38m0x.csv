Binging is the fastest way to interminable guilt. Idk if this thought is helpful to you at all, but thought I'd share in case it is.",False,False

I think it's important to acknowledge the binge as disordered. You felt out of control. But, do yourself a big favor and take that control back by choosing to eat how you would normally eat. You may feel like you're restricting because your body may send out extra hunger does due to the binge (as in it now thinks, momentarily, that this is the amount you eat). But in a few days you'll feel normal again and you may even find yourself needing a BIT less if you are around your intuitive eating ""set point"".   Anyways, I say this because if you restrict your calories at all during this time, you are so much more likely to binge. It sounds like you are holding onto a lot of your disordered behaviors so maybe that's why you are binging 6 months in- you havent ""fully committed""   Anyways, I know the temptation you're feeling. I'm in recovery, last night I had a ""binge"". I cant count calories but I know I was close to my TDEE for the day but i ate frosting with a spoon anyways. My first instinct was to wake up early and go for a walk to burn it off. Second instinct was to skip breakfast and enjoy the hunger i felt waking up. As badly as i wanted to do those (i cried while eating breakfast lol) i didnt. But, i can feel the rest of today will be a huge struggle. So, if you want some support with not restricting today and tomorrow and the next day, feel free to DM me as we are dealing with similar urges and maybe an outside prospective can help the other.  I hope none of what I said comes off as condescending, definitely not my intent, but i felt like a lot of it needed to be aid because our disordered brains can block out the logic of daily life   Anyways good luck &lt;3",False,False

It will only upset you and it won’t be a real number anyway; you will have food and water weight that could add up to ten pounds, but it won’t be fat or body weight.   Also if this is your first binge you probably aren’t prepared for the discomfort. Things to expect include painful bloating, dehydration, cramps, constipation, headache, heartburn, and nausea. While unpleasant, this is all normal and will pass after a day or two.",False,False
