This culture that only values and appreciates women at a low body fat % needs to recover.   This is so true and powerful. I went on kind of a tangent here but it really made me think about how so many people here don't have disordered eating because of how they personally feel about how they look, but about how they feel they're perceived.  My desire to be thin is similar to gender dysphoria, in some ways. My dysphoria probably wouldn't present in the same ways if society's attitude towards gender changed, and that's the same sentiment I've heard from a lot of other trans people. Like, a lot of trans dudes have expressed that they probably wouldn't feel the need to get top surgery if society were more accepting of men with breasts, especially since plenty of cis men have ""boobs"" - but it's not, and so having breasts causes them a lot of shame/dysphoria, and they get them removed. But it's not because boobs are inherently dysphoric for them, it's because it's a social marker. And a lot of trans women say that they don't WANT to perform hyper-femininity all the time, they would love to be able to go out more wearing no makeup and comfy clothes, but that will result in them getting misgendered and worse and so they feel pressured/dysphoric if they don't, even though makeup and clothes have nothing to do with gender identity - it's about gender perception. If people's expectation of a rigid gender binary was improved, then a lot of gender dysphoria would change if not go away completely.  The same issues affect cis people, of course. Cis men often feel shame if they have ""boobs"" because ""men don't have boobs""... even though they're men... who have boobs... so their manhood should be an immutable fact. A lot of cis women feel pressured to go out in public wearing makeup and ""feminine"" clothes even if they'd rather not because they know they get treated as ""less than"" if they don't.  Body image stuff is the same for me. I don't really... hate my body. I never have. In fact sometimes I've looked at my thighs and my tummy and stuff and thought, this is cute, this is soft, I like this. I would be attracted to this on someone else.  But I've been told to hate it so I do. I've had people shout at me from passing cars for eating an ice cream, or for sitting on a bench, or for simply standing and walking and getting exercise. I'm not allowed to exist as a fat person and now that I've started losing weight I can't go back to that any more, even though I don't personally... *care*. I don't think I look ""better"" skinnier, in fact in some ways it makes my dysphoria worse because my body shape is more defined now, but I do recognise when I look at my reflection that this body is more ""acceptable"". My internal voice is not so much ""you're so ugly, starve yourself,"" it's ""you're so weak-willed, how could you fail so badly at eating normally to get to this point, you're not normal, work harder"". It's not about how I look, it's about how I act and my lack of self control.  It's a weird feeling to look at your reflection and feel uncomfortable (because of gender), bad (because still 'not skinny enough'), yet safe (because 'acceptably chubby' now) all at the same time.",False,False
