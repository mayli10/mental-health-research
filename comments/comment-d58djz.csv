When you eat enough to maintain or gain your weight, your body will have extra energy from digesting food that it releases as heat from the digestive process. When you do not eat anywhere near enough to maintain, your body is not digesting long enough/with enough energy to give off heat and your body tries to absorb heart from your surroundings (making you feel cold) to keep your temperature up   Or at least that's what I seem to recall in my currently very addled state",False,False
