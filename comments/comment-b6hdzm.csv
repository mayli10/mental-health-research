If you get veggies as sides ask that they don't have oil or butter on them and eat them first so you can eat just a little chicken and claim you're full. You can always get a box and shove it to ro back of the refrigerator and forget its there. ,False,False

Whatever dish you order realistically won't be over 1300 cals which is fine if you don't eat the rest of the day.  You will feel a little bloated and you'll gain water weight but it's literally impossible for you to even gain a lb of real weight if you do the above.  Even if you ate 3000 cals it doesn't matter because you can snap right back to restricting. I personally think it's healthy to learn to indulge (under 3000 cals only) for special occasions if they are infrequent.  Have fun!,False,False

You know that realistically you won’t gain any weight (besides water/food weight), and even if you did, it’s possible to lose again. I’ve gotta go out for a family meal on Friday. But we’ll be okay :)",False,False
