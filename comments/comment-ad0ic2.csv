If so, remember that relapse is common and pretty much expected as part of the journey! Recovery isn't linear. Honestly, if you aren't at a dangerous weight, I'd recommend focusing on your relationship with your body first. If you are still terrified of food and gaining by the time you are weight restored, it wont do much to help. But if you are really at peace with your body and food, it will be so much better.  I really hope you can start to feel better soon. We're all here for you.",False,False
