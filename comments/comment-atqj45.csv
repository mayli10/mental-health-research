I get a feeling of pressure in my chest that happens when I'm stressed. Turns out there's no physiological reason for it, it's just my brain being a dick.

Are you able to seek medical attention? EDs can really fuck with your heart. I know when I was at my worst, I could've gone into cardiac arrest at any moment. It's worth getting checked out.",False,False
