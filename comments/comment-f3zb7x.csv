I'm sure it is very difficult for you but living like this forever will probably be even more difficult. From what I've heard, recovery is definitely worth every ounce of effort you put in. I haven't started recovery yet (I'm still on the waitlist) so I don't have any advice from personal experience but some of my friends have said that trying to distract yourself when eating helps like talking to friends or whatever. I can't tell you when/if it will get easier but just remember every victory counts, it's about baby steps. This wasn't meant to be easy and you will likely slip up many times but this is ultimately for your own good. Wishing you the best!!!! c:",False,False
