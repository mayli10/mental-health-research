I was 105 at my lowest weight and considering what I looked like then I assume that if I were to go down to 90 my legs might actually be the same size, but I would also be like skeletal because I would have no boobs at all and at that point my body fat percentage would be so low that it would start to look like my skin was being stretched over my bones. I figure that she's probably like 5'0"" - 5'2"" based on her weight and how she looks at her weight.",False,False

One time I saw a post from somebody in another subreddit where she posted a pic of herself with her height, weight, and measurements and even though she was the same height and weight as me she looked completely different. Not only that but a lot of photos on social media, especially places like Instagram and Tumblr, are photoshopped.",False,False
