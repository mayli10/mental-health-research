If it reads the correct weight, then it's accurate.   Where the scale is placed (incline, if it's on tile or carpet) can also effect a scale's accuracy.   If I had to give an answer without knowing all of the above stuff, I'd say to go with the more modern scale because it's more likely to still be accurately calibrated. ",False,False
