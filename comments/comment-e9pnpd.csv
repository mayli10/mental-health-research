I’m trying to incorporate a variety of foods, though, if I need to, I’ll take vitamins. It greatly hinders my binges since “binge material” foods in my house aren’t vegan.",False,True

I got told I'd lose weight, that I'd gain and I'd get really untoned. This is the most stable my weight has ever been and because of that my fat is finally redistributing back to something normal. Don't let them discourage you if it's what you really want, just make sure youve done some basic research into the micronutrients that is harder to get and you'll do great 😊",False,False
