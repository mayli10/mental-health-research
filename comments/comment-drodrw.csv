I skipped class this morning and went grocery shopping in an attempt to get my shit together, came back without my shit together, smoked the day away and ended up binging anyway.   I couldn’t even go over my practice files for choir because I was so agitated doing it. Why am I like this?? Last week I ran like 17 miles or something and I ate a very appropriate amount of calories for my TDEE every day and then I slipped up and it feels like I’ve reset to zero??? Recovery is garbage sometimes.",False,False
