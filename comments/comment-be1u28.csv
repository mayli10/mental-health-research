It comes in pre-made bottles and a powder you mix yourself. When I did the powder, I would usually mix it with tea. The hot water helped it mix a bit better and the tea gave it flavor. Blackberry was my favorite, which I’d have in the morning since it’s caffeinated, and then I’d usually do a flavored roobios for before bed. The best part was I could make it “light” and it was still very filling.   At some point, I had to switch to the pre-made stuff, which I still preferred to actually eating. I would work on a bottle for 2-3 days, although I would have different flavors open. It was usually chai for morning and chocolate for bedtime.  The chocolate really helped with craving something sweet even though it’s really not very sweet. When it’s all you’re eating, your tolerance for actual sweet stuff goes *way* down.   Literally the only reason I stopped is because I can’t afford it anymore, which sucks so much since I’ve been having trouble with pretty much everything relating to eating ever since I stopped. I’m really hoping I can start up again soon, but it’s not looking like that’ll happen.",False,False

I get mine from Winco ([link!](https://www.wincofoods.com/shop#/product/167838)) and it's pretty affordable, a little over $5/lb (where a lot of prepackaged and flavored ones are around $8-$9/lb) and one pound lasts a long time, for me. I also like that it's unflavored / unsweetened so I can just add a lil vanilla extract and some splenda to meet my protein needs with as few calories as possible while not being unpalatable.",False,False

I’ll feel full for about an hour and then feel hungrier than I did before and they make my energy levels super low. Good for days when I just can’t force myself to eat any actual food but not a good long-term/primary option, IMO.",False,False

They're pretty filling and not bad nutritionally. I'm trying to find a vegan alternative to the whey but most are super expensive and full of sodium, which I absolutely can't stomach. I can't believe how much sodium is in pea protein. But I digress.  Anyways ready-made meal replacement shakes are too expensive imo so I like buying the ingredients and shaking it up in a reusable water bottle myself. Unlike huel, it's not a ""complete"" food (tbh I doubt it's healthy to live off of heul exclusively, even if it claims to have all your micronutrients your body has a hard time digesting certain kinds of processed calcium/etc.). So I only do that for one meal a day max (usually lunch). But it does make things easier.",False,False
