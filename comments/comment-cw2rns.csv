So try and put as much energy into managing your life for you and you’re recovery. Accept losing some battles in the short term and look to your long term health and happiness.   Be kind to yourself, don’t use terms like I feel like trash. Be honest with yourself and your therapist. Maybe explain to your parents this is a going to take some time and work and can’t be solved overnight.   Most over all keep talking and keep posting. Your day will come.",False,False

I’ve been meeting a therapist for some other issues but I haven’t touched up too much on my eating disorders. I’ll make sure to address it clearly next time I visit.  I did have a sit-down a few months ago with them, but with a lot of stress at home it’s sometimes difficult to open up. It’s something we’ve been working on, and hopefully one day I’ll be comfortable talking to them more openly.",False,True

I think it’s time you seek professional medical help. If you haven’t already. The fact your parents know means you won’t be able to continue the way you have been living.   Sometimes you have to accept, I have a problem and this problem has taken over my life. Speak with a third party, teacher or Councillor with or without your parents.   I am 35 and had to come to the realization that the scale of my problems was crushing me and look for help. After seeking help. I understood I had to be honest and accept setbacks.  Posting here helps and talking at group helps but you might need to sit down with everyone and look at the complexity of the situation. Everyone needs to be honest. You and your parents.   Seeking help worked for me and being honest helped me to grow.   I am not a medical professional but I have been in your position.  Just keep talking, keep posting and keep looking for help, Hope my sharing helped.",False,False
