That back-and-forth ""don't want anything but i'm hungry, please work with me on this"" mindset is one i'm always stuck in. I don't make it easier for him.",False,False

I do want to say though that she had less problems with finishing and eating everything than I did, even when she got an increase. I just had a higher meal plan than her to weight restore, but she was probably the one who was best at eating there",False,True

When I haven't had food all day I am a _bitch._ Like, managing to shove it down because I'm an adult, but ohhhhhmygod I want to smack myself when I get bitchy/hangry.   (TW food/calorie mention)  Yesterday I'd only had like 270 calories all day (ended an intermittent fast with oatmeal mixed with vanilla protein powder) and I didn't even enjoy them, so I was kinda big mad about it. My partner and I went to Walmart, after 5pm, and we end up in the food section. He picks out a package of Oreo thins and goes ""what do you want?"" and I'm like ""I'm good, thanks"" and he's like ""no, what do you WANT"" (he doesn't know I have an eating disorder)  So I'm just staring at this wall of cookies and crackers that I used to be able to inhale without thinking, and shoving down this sudden rage-filled urge to be like ""didn't you hear me the first time? I don't fucking want ANYTHING. I want to starve to death. I can't just eat Oreos like it's nothing. I couldn't even eat the dinner you made yesterday because you dumped SO much oil into it, and all I want to do is go to Freddy's (fast food place) and maybe treat myself to dinner tonight because I've had so few calories but you HAD to go out and get McDonald's for lunch on your own and eat THREE McChickens and now you're STILL complaining you're full so I obviously can't ask you to go to dinner with me, but I don't want to go to dinner alone, so now I'm just so HUNGRY and ANGRY and I have NO idea what to do about dinner now.""  but instead I said ""No, I'm good, thanks. Is there anything else on the list?"" and distracted him.  So I mean, idk. If you're so deep into your obsession with (and in my case, subsequent aversion of) food, and you see someone else who, in your perspective, seems to have NO trouble eating and isn't visibly thrown into a near-panic attack over the idea of not measuring olive oil, you're going to be irrationally upset. And sometimes, if you're lacking in self-discipline, that can lead to being unnecessarily cruel to other people about their eating habits.  I don't know if it helps you at all, but I was just thinking about my internal tantrum yesterday.",False,False
