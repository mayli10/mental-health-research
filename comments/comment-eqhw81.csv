Growing up playing sports I was told that it takes a week of not exercising to lose muscle mass (and muscle by itself helps to burn calories). Athletes are also frequently told to take 1-2 rest days per week anyways, so taking time off is perfect. When I go on short trips and my calorie intake rises I also like to think of it as a few days to jump-start my metabolism, since in the long run it ends up balancing out by what I eat/burn the rest of the week. If it helps ease your mind you can always do some stretching before bed which will burn some calories and helps me relax before sleeping. I hope you have a peaceful and relaxing trip!!",False,False
