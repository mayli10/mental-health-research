My BMI only got as low as about 17, but I was experiencing this from about 20 BMI downwards.  I just assume as you hit on - it's because of all the muscle loss that came with starving. I was obese when my ED developed so I guess I had a lot of muscle wastage even by BMI 20...  Weight restoration (24/25 as I told you on my last longass comment to you!) has not helped my weak bladder issues much. A little maybe... but no not much. I'm thinking it might take my body a little more time to rebuild things like muscles after initial weight restoration? Apparently your body stores fat first as a survival thing, and then when it has held onto that a little bit, it'll start repairing your muscles. I dunno.  If you drink a lot of caffiene, that's not gonna help. I'm guilty of that, still. Oops I guess.",False,False

I found drinking MORE water helps. Not sure how much that you drink but I slowed down a lot with liquids Bc I was tired of having to pee all the time. I found extra water really helped my body function and I go a lot less. I used to wake up maybe 10 times a night and now it’s only 2 or 3 :) hope that helps! ,False,False

I would wake up and within a minute it would just release before I was even conscious of what was happening. You are not alone this definitely happens to people. Take care ,False,False

Rarely discussed but it’s totally a thing, try not to judge yourself or freak out too much. It should be mostly reversible if you decide to seek recovery. ",False,False

But it could also be caused by weakened pelvic floor muscles. Incontinence can be a problem for people with an extremely low BMI especially when combined with heterogeneous factors. I hate to be that person... but in most case studies bladder control was regained when the patient reached a stable weight. However speaking as someone with AN we all know that’s tough, so I’d recommend doing some Kegel exercises and using panty liners. ",False,False

It didn’t start happening until my BMI reached 13 though, even if i’m underweight but not too far it doesn’t happen but the lower my BMI the worse it gets. ",False,False

I've definitely never had a BMI as low as yours, but at my current weight, ~19 BMI, I do find myself needing to go more often, even if I dont drink anything.  Honestly, it could be a problem with your kidneys. You should definitely get it checked out. I hope you do. Good luck",False,False
