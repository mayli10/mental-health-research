I just started writing, and the characters developed on their own, and one ended up being disordered.

The character in my story is fairly successful, he's a college professor and seems pretty normal until you dig into his odd behaviors that kind of slide into the background. Every time I see someone in media with an ED it feels like that's all they are.   Same with being LBGT, like that's all people like us are. I want to write something where you see the rest of the person, not just this one tiny facet.",False,True

Another portrayal of EDs in media that I found to be REALLY  well done and realistic was Natasha Lyonne's character in Russian Doll which is on Netflix. The show is great but I noticed her drinking a sugar free red bull which is one of my favourite things in the world and then decided to watch what she consumed through the rest of the series and how it ties in with what's going on in her life (don't want to spoil what happens for you, it's a kind of supernatural show with timelines and repeating the same day and dying at some point then being brought back to the same start of the day and she's trying to figure out how to stop the cycle basically). I felt super seen by how she interacted with food during the story but the rest of the story is super interesting and fast paced and I feel like people who aren't looking wouldn't really notice how obvious her ED is to people like us who know what to look for you know?",False,False

It is about a girl with anorexia. It also talks about  self harm. I can relate to both. It was a good quick read. It’s a YA book.,False,False

I haven’t read it in years but I remember thinking at the time that Brie was a lot like me; all she ate was a couple Kinder Bueno bars a day and she was described as being impossibly skinny with all her bones poking out. Again, I could be wrong because it’s been such a long time, but afaik she’s never explicitly referred to as having an ED.",False,False

For most people with EDs it's not like, a fulltime job. A lot of the docs and movies show people who dont seem to have a job and who never eat, etc. Most of us, though, have to go to work or school or both every day and have to handle the ED alongside everything else.   It's like, yes I have an ED, no I am not an ED. There is a difference. Life may be pale with an ED, but you still live a life. Not every moment of every day is a tragic movie about young Anna McRestrict who hasn't eaten in 3 years and has the most dramatic life  Sorry, i get passionate about this sort of thing. It's like with LGBT (I'm bi), I'd rather watch a movie with a person who just happens to be gay than watch a movie about a gay person, although the latter is still important representation.   Just give me casual representation!",False,False

A lot of their behavior made sense with that context, and I went back to edit in the ED more conclusively, and remove anything that seemed like a serious trigger risk.   At first I got some complaints from non-ED people for ""pointlessly"" including an ED. But in the end, it was my highest rated fic, and I think the ED was part of the positive response. I do think a lot of ED folks enjoy seeing ""incidental"" EDs in fiction. I know I do. I find actual ED-centric narratives triggering beyond belief, and think it's important to see these disorders in fiction without letting them consume all the available oxygen in the room, y'know?  So yeah, keep going!",False,False
