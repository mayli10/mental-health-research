Most of it could be bloating, or holding onto excess salt and sugars. When I binge I feel my hands &amp; limbs get puffier but with hydration it starts to go down. I’d honestly give your body a few more days. Just get back on a regular, healthy routine and you should be just fine! &lt;3",False,False

You probably know by now that it’ll lead straight to another binge down the road. Instead, be patient with yourself. Stay super hydrated and your body should naturally flush some things out. Maybe go for a lil walk, nothing excessive though. You have to be patient with yourself. These things happen, I’ve been there many times. Actually am in the same boat at the moment. But you’ve got to give your body a break. Snack on some detoxifying fruit! You will level out if you get back on a steady meal routine.",False,False
