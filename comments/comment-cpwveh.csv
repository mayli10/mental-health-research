And pressuring you to change your body is a very bad sign in a relationship. I would talk to him about it first, but breaking up wouldn‚Äôt be unreasonable.",False,False

I get really anxious, and my stress response unfortunately is anger, so I get snappy and mean and it just bleeds into every area of our life. So when I had a panic attack one morning about how disgusted I was with myself, he calmed me down and told me that he was in this with me and we‚Äôre gonna go hard, maximum asceticism, for a few weeks until I felt better and he was gonna have my back the whole time so I didn‚Äôt feel like I was struggling alone with it.   So it‚Äôs been three weeks and I‚Äôm more than halfway there and he‚Äôs totally lived up to his promise even though he‚Äôs been crazy busy with work and he‚Äôs married to a fucking nutcase lol.   The result is that I‚Äôm soooo much happier. My mood is way up, I get excited about things, I enjoy day to day life more, and I get less upset when things go wrong. So it‚Äôs better for both of us when I‚Äôm within my preferred range than when I‚Äôm within his.   I‚Äôm sorry to hear you‚Äôve been struggling with binging, I can go into more detail about my experience if you want or if you think it would help. If it gives you any hope, regaining my control of food totally improved my day to day relationship with my boy.",False,False

He wanted me to get some health tests done and I did, everything came back fine despite my subterranean bmi, and he felt a bit better. I also plan some binge days in advance to get it out of my system and as long as I don‚Äôt flake on them and he knows I‚Äôm getting fed occasionally he‚Äôs okay.   I would say it has affected our relationship, but not really on a day to day basis. There was a while when my bmi was half a point lower than it is now when he was very upset, but after I gained weight from a month-long binge episode and had trouble losing it, he saw how much that destroyed me mentally and emotionally and realised I‚Äôm happier when I have that control. I recently lost a bunch of that weight and I asked him if he was worried about me again and he said ‚Äúno, but only because I‚Äôve decided to get on board‚Äù.",False,False

Ask him *not* to tell you that you are too skinny, and tell him that it makes you feel uncomfortable when he comments on changes in your weight.  I'm going to go ahead and assume that he cares about your feelings, so that may be all that's needed if he just doesn't realize that his comments affect you this much.",False,False
