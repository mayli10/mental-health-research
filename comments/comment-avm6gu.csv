Like lean ground beef in the sauce, or chicken, or even sausage. You'll stay fuller longer if there's protein and if you do some weight lifting you'll get toned more easily if you consistently have protein.   Good luck!!!",False,False

It contains 108% DV of fiber, though tbh I have my carbs goal a little higher than average to help with my migraines so that might affect the numbers. It's an almost all liquid diet, but with the amount of stuff that goes into the smoothies I would be making (if I could find all of the ingredients I need...) as well as the other stuff in the plan I can't imagine I would ever be hungry. It might get a little expensive though. I'm planning to get a full time job soon and my expenses tend to be quite low, so I figured I could probably afford it. I did the math based on what I would make even if they paid me minimum wage and still had savings, so since they're definitely not going to pay somebody minimum wage for the work they're hiring for I figured I could splurge.
