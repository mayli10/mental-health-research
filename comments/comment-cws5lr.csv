I can't get a legal script because I had opioid use issues in the past (although I do have an  ADHD diagnosis from a psychiatrist) but studies have been done on low dose naltrexone (drug used for opioid dependence) and weight loss, with good results. So my ED brain is telling me to get a naltrexone script for opioid cravings (that I no longer have, because I have been sober since August 2015!) and use that for weight loss since adderall is not an option.",False,False

I got straight high 80's and 90's on every assignment I handed in (that I worked on while wired on adderall) but it never crossed my mind to take it for weight loss, as I feel that cannabis works better for me personally, since adderall is far too expensive and illegal for me to buy. I only use adderall as a study aid.",False,False
