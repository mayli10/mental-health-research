Not only did it skyrocket my anxiety about my TDEE (I’m convinced it’s like 800 now)  but it also made going to the doctors much scarier bc when I weighed in at my first appointment (just moved, new doctor) I was at the top of my weight range. Now when I go back like 5 weeks later for follow up I will be near the bottom of my weight range, basically losing like 10% of my body weight in a month with hypothyroidism. I know he’ll ask questions bc I’m already nearly uw and idk what I’ll say. He also prescribed me stimulants so I’m scared he’ll take them away bc he’ll think they’re causing my weight to drop. It’s def not as bad as crohns but it’s been super stressful, sorry to vent",False,False

ED started for other reasons in middle school, but I relapsed last year after several years in recovery almost entirely due to developing IBS (not correctly diagnosed until this past June) during my fall semester of an incredibly busy senior year of college. I lost a bit of weight without meaning to, and then realized that restricting made my nausea and other symptoms more tolerable. At some point it stopped being about managing the symptoms and became about losing more weight.",False,False
