Some days zero, other times more like 4 or even 5, but holy shit, if they knew how distracted I am I would probably get fired. Either I'm too hungry to focus, feeling too much anxiety, too tired or sometimes just unable to stop browsing ED stuff.",False,False

We had stupid assignments we just had to turn in electronically, and I wouldn’t do it. No reason why. I knew it was due, and I did the work. But I would never submit it. We do stupid stuff.

I struggled a lot in college and still am. I had to retake a class, and it really sucked, but I am currently doing a lot better in it. College is really hard in general. It’s hard to deal with emotionally, but you have to just forgive yourself for messing up and keep going. You got this!",False,False
