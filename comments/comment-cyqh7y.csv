I mean, there's a reason we call beauty ""attractive,"" right? Humans, on both a conscious and subconscious level, like to be near beauty. It makes us happy.

I'm a good, acceptable, attractive ape!"").   Then there's the whole projection thing. People tend to be kinder to those who don't remind us of our own fears/problems. Like, fatphobia isn't just a conditioned disgust response, it's also an expression of personal fear...people are scared to be fat. Whereas most people *want* to be trim, and are drawn to those who fulfill our aspirations.   So on the one hand, I can't blame others, especially if they seem to be thoughtful people who try not to judge the world by shallow criteria.
