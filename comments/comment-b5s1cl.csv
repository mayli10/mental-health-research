I mean, she broached the topic. She continued inviting conversations about it. She indulged her (morbid) curiosity. And then...got mad at you? Something doesn’t make sense there.   Unless, that is, she had/has some issues of her own, doesn’t have the tools to adequately manage her emotional responses, and soothes those emotions by foisting responsibility for them on others.   Maybe she thought talking would “cure” or “help” you and got irrationally upset with you that it didn’t. Maybe she has her own issues around self-esteem and felt triggered but was unable to own that and found it easier to blame you than to actively work on her own problems. Maybe she bases her identity on her own dysfunction and got resentful that she wasn’t the only one with problems.  Whatever it was, you can bet there’s an underlying current of emotional codependency at work. It’s as if her problems are your problems to solve, and your problems are your problems to solve, and anything that makes her feelings not the sole focus of both hers and your world is interpreted as some kind of personal attack or failure on your part to be a “friend”. Not healthy. Not acceptable. Not the behavior of someone emotionally equipped to manage the intricacies of a long term interpersonal relationship.  You have every right to be hurt and upset. You didn’t open up to be mean. You opened up because you thought you could trust her to be the kind of friend you were to her.   It sucks, but like Maya Angelou said, “When someone shows you who they are, believe them the first time.”",False,False

I hope she learns humility at some point. :/ Guh she's the one being manipulative. And she says you're dramatic?! WOW. She's belittling too.   Has she been your best friend for a long time?

Yeah, stopping ed behaviours quickly because they're gross definitely seems like a normal person's response. I'm starting to think the only option is to end this friendship, because I can't see myself getting over her comments easily. I don't think I'm going to tell anyone, because I just don't need that kind of drama in my life. People just don't understand it, and I don't want anyone else blaming me for it.",False,True

Except unbeknownst to me my “best friend” of several years had started taking my struggles as some sort of twisted diet advice, then blamed me for “giving” her an eating disorder and putting the obsession with thinness into her head. She never really had an ED in my opinion, because attempting to purge for a couple weeks, then immediately stopping because of how “gross and unnecessary it is” and failing to understand how anyone couple possibly have a hard time stopping, is what I’d actually consider a normal persons response. So is viewing the compulsive battle to be thin as just a stupid shallow obsession. Anyway, our friendship ended over how hurt I was by the way she made me feel similarly to the way your friend is making you feel.  Also, my advice would be NOT to tell your other friends. If not just because you don’t want to tell anyone about your ED, also be extremely wary that people are very sympathetic to the “her eating disorder was so triggering to me”, and in my experience few people will take the side of the ED sufferer :( ",False,False

She will never apologize for anything or admit she was wrong.
