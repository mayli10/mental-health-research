However the advantage of boiling is that you can add way more liquids without it getting watery. The chia and oats will soak up way more almond milk when hot, making it super creamy. And then you can even add a bit of water as well and it should soak in. This is only a priority if you‚Äôre like me and trying to get as much volume as possible to fee more full. An option would be to make them on the stove the night before, then keep them in the fridge overnight so you can have the best of both worlds (cold AND lots of volume) in the morning. Oh, plus banana tastes way sweeter when hot, that‚Äôs the main reason this recipe doesn‚Äôt need sugar at all!",False,False

The fillet was meijer brand (90 cals per fillet). I used a cooking spray to make sure the whole pan had non stick on it, then 90 cals of olive oil, but I think I could have done 60 or even 40 and it would have been fine, the fillet is small enough to not need oil in the whole pan. I seasoned it with cajun spice, thyme leaves, garlic salt, and paprika.   I had a spinach, blackberry, and peach salad as a side, with a homemade raspberry vinaigrette. 1 cup of raspberries, ~1 tbsp each balsamic and red wine vinaigrette, a squirt of some local honey (stevia would probably work as well, I just wanted some thickening)  pinch of salt and pepper, and 1/4 cup water. If you want it thicker you could either omit the water or add chia seeds. If you add chia it has to soak for at least 2 hours. Blend them together. The way I made it was like 60 cals max and it made ~4 ounces. I used a little less than half for a salad of ~2 cups spinach, a whole peach diced, and 5 blackberries.   However if you make the tilapia i recommend adding some type of potato on the side... especially if you've got the Insatiable Hunger. I'm still hungry after my meal",False,False
