Them hiding that contribute to the ""naturally skinny"" nonsense that makes even more people disordered. Plus with mukbang originating and being very popular in Korea, and we know how their diet culture is, I would be shocked if those streamers aren't deep in a disorder. The amount of pain and exhaustion that comes with that is unfathomable to me.  Regarding it being BED for a lot of people, I think that's definitely the case especially with people in north america who took up the mukbang trend. Monetizing something you already do is easy money.   I do remember one korean dude who was a big mukbang person and he was insanely ripped. Apparently he was just super athletic and ate a ton anyway.",False,False
