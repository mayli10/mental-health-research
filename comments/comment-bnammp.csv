Also tho she has done some things that make me super angry like how she handled kittens in the past (pissed me off way more than lying to viewers) but she seems to love her animals now and treat them well so I guess I might be too easy trusting but I feel that her character has developed and she just plain doesn‚Äôt deserve to die and the negativity just will make her worse,False,False

First, I do hope she kept that psychatrist appointment. And I have bipolar so I see a bit of me in her. I just want to hug her ya know. Just let her know its ok to take medicine and you dont owe your viewers a weigh-in if it causes you distress. Like damn idc if she loses weight or maintains I'm still going to watch and support her",False,False
