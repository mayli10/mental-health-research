I was also hoping they'd make me shit but they didn't :| the price of grapes is the only thing keeping me from eating grapes all day everyday  ANYWAY I digress. I like to keep yummy drinks on hand, like seltzer or diet soda. And snacks that are low calorie and/or take a while to eat. Stuff like popcorn, baby carrots, seaweed snacks, pretzels, pop chips etc. Idk if you smoke, but cigarettes hit different while high imo. I try to get really sucked into something not food related, like a computer game or cleaning",False,False
