Plus, he's not a petty person. If he thought I was calling him fat, he would 100% say, ""so you're calling me fat"" he wouldnt try to hurt my feelings just if I accidentally hurt his",False,True

It still blows my mind that adult human beings (even the super short ones) can weigh 100lbs and not be sick. If someone had me guess their weight, even if they were super small I probably wouldn't guess anywhere under 120, just because in my mind, that's still insanely small.   All that to say, I highly doubt he meant you looked bigger than you are. If your dietitian says you're underweight, then I'd put money on your friend just not being good at estimating what people weigh. Whatever he said probably sounded really low to him.",False,False
