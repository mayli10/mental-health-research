I've dealt with a lot of people like that girl who suddenly has an eating disorder.  I've had chronic migraines for a while and in 11th grade a ""friend"" claimed she has had chronic migraines and that she was experiencing other neurological symptoms and that she was getting an MRI to see if she had a brain tumor. No brain tumor. Suddenly, all her ""neurological symptoms"" were gone. But I still have migraines ugh  Anyways, I love your ""in conclusion, gay""  Please do your best to get some sleep, we are here for you",False,False

I get its not as easy as that but i guess just try not to over-stress yourself and deal with things one at a time xx,False,False
