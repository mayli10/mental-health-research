The US can label things &lt;3 calories as 0 calories so I just go with that and round up. Tea, Diet Pepsi, gum, mints, etc. it’s all 5 calories to me.",False,False

If I don’t, I get paranoid later on and worry that I may have forgotten to log something with an actual amount of calories, so to feel a little safer I just log everything I put in my mouth",False,False

Maybe it's because I just like knowing that I have consumed things, regardless of their lack in caloric value? Maybe it's a way to comfort myself for having *something* in my stomach, even if it's not nutritious or even beneficial.  Like at work I run off of zero calorie energy drinks along with my ""safe snacks"" that I bring with me. After my shift I log everything and feel satisfied from knowing that I can be productive on very little fuel. Like ""wow, I'm pretty efficient hehehe"" in an admittedly messed up way.",False,False
