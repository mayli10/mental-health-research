I’ve had 850 the last two days to try to get some more protein, but I’m not “happy” about that (I did feel much better physically though).   I hate hate hate eating until I have to, it makes the day feel like a failure.",False,False

Never over 800 though, at least not intentionally. I have occasional bad days where I eat 900-1200 and then I hate myself.  So it’s a bit of a mixed bag lmao. I’m all over the place  At the moment I’m trying to eat one 200-300 meal a day at about 3.30pm, then going to bed early to avoid more. If I’m planning a 400-700 day I’d typically have a morning and evening meal.",False,False
