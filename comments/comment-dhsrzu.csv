At work it’s all people around my age and we stay in cubicles and I don’t even really talk or go into anyone’s pod. Plus that time I got the flu was a one off thing. Before I had insurance and we wouldn’t get the flu shot and I never got sick. I just honestly need something to kill my appetite for a few weeks,False,True

Like I get where you’re coming from, but it’s really irresponsible and selfish to put other people at risk.
