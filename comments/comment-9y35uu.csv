As time goes on and I spend more time online, my 6-year-old BED morphs into more EDNOS with restriction and purging thrown in there (hence my weight loss), but I've been going through a two-week binge cycle in which I've eaten at least 5,000 Calories a day everyday, and I definitely feel like more of a fraud in terms of having ""a real ED"".  My only solution for myself is to conform, but I know that's terrible advice. I'm sorry, OP. :(  EDIT: And I still don't feel like I belong sometimes because I'm not near underweight.  2nd EDIT: But I did feel like r/proED was as accommodating as they could be. No one has ever discredited my ED, and especially not there.  3rd EDIT: I've also done things like have a 10-day fast, run a 2500 Cal deficit for 10 days, and have an orthorexic summer where I was 100% paleo. And I definitely have BED. It's really the same motivations behind all the behaviors. ",False,False

But some things are similar to the more common EDs, like having safe and unsafe foods, issues with eating in public, agonizing grocery store visits, needing to know what's in my food, and so on. I used to be quite underweight when I could eat like five things, and now I need to keep a very tight leash on my calorie intake because most of my safe foods are energy-dense. I gorge myself on plain pasta or chocolate if I don't actively restrict. I have nutritional deficiencies, my hair is falling out and I get dizzy spells. I obsess about the food I'm going to eat and I need to throw up if I was forced to eat an unsafe food.   Anyways. My point is, we all struggle in different ways, but there are some things we have in common, regardless of the underlying cause.

You definitely belong here. :) BED is as real an eating disorder as AN or BN. You should make memes if you want to see that content, because a lot of us do struggle with bingeing. And even if you think an experience is only specific to you, if it's about your eating  disorder, it belongs here. Plus, without the weight flairs, it's hard to know he is at a higher weight.
