I was watching this with my BF a few nights ago and made the comment that she looks like a wet puppy (especially when she has so much product in her hair, I know, it' the 80s). She' rail thin and visibly skeletal. I know people were thinner back then, and accentuating the natural waist was a style, but wow. In a scene where she has a gun stashed in the back of her pants, the gun is nearly 80% of her body width....  That being said, I know my BF likes thinner girls (I was actively disordered when we met) and I've also just recently started losing weight again. He's supportive about everything...but I can't help but imagine how excited he'd be if I looked like that o\_\_\_\_\_o  I think people are attracted to the person, most of all, so it could be her spunk or her puppy dog eyes that they like. I can usually find -something- attractive about someone even if they're not my ""ideal"".",False,False

What is important to remember that it‚Äôs a type ‚Äî and she has been compared to at least two of the actresses from the 80s that she physically resembles.  Imagine how screwed up it would be to build a career because you‚Äôre this type of actress. It‚Äôs important to be happy with yourself and manipulate your thoughts to another stream of consciousness ‚Äî which is, you‚Äôre real. And she‚Äôs being fitted into a role.",False,False
