Remember that a lot of people at the gym used to be overweight or obese, and almost everyone is there because of weight (gaining OR losing).  Everyone goes to the gym to get better. You deserve the space as much as anyone! Going to the gym in the first place is so brave :)  Good luck!!!",False,False

They only stare when you're on the equipment they want or unless they're an asshole.  If it's the latter, it's really hard but try to ignore them.  You're there for you, not them, and you're out making positive changes to your body.",False,False
