My parents often shooed me away and didn’t want to hear about any of my feelings. So as an adult, I often don’t even know what I am feeling. Nice to know this is a thing and isn’t just me.",False,False

I get really excited when I discover I'm not alone in an experience. I think for me it was something I essentially trained myself to do as a protective measure - to just shut down listening to my emotions. I was genuinely convinced there were many emotions I just didn't experience. (Turns out I absolutely did and they were coming out sideways in super destructive ways...I just didn't see that was happening.)  When I started investing myself in getting help for my other mental health issues several years ago, I was so frustrated to discover that I could not name what I was feeling. My vocabulary is excellent and I *know* all the words, but I couldn't connect them up with what was happening inside. It's been a super slow process, practicing this new kind of listening. Using 'feeling wheels' to select emotions has been helpful. Art therapy has also been extremely helpful because it gave me a new non-verbal way to process and express emotions that had been shut away for so long.",False,False

I literally have a tab for the wikipedia page on alexithymia open right now. Also one for interoception, which you'd probably be interested in reading about as well, if you didn't already go down that rabbit hole.  This stuff makes me so discouraged. EDs ruin *eVeRyThInGGGGGHGG*. I need a full reboot.",False,False

It's like I just click off and I can't tell what I feel. The more I should feel, the less I do. Or maybe it's just that that's when I notice the discrepancy the most. I'm not sure because feeling is complicated.",False,False
