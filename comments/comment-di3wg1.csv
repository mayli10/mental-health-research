I'm a uni student and exam weeks are always hard for me too. Try to snack more during the day if you're not ready for big(ger) meals yet - I really like snacking on fruit (apples, grapes and strawberries are great!), carrots with hummus, small crackers, hard boiled eggs and protein bars. I always make sure I eat right before an exam so I can focus properly and I don't feel light headed. Also make sure you stay hydrated and drink enough water throughout the day. Good luck on your exams, sending you all my good vibes!! &lt;33",False,False

Please take care of yourself üíô I had a group presentation yesterday and forced myself to eat a little more the night before to keep my energy up. I'd rather deal with the self-hate that came afterwards than failing an exam.  Please consider upping your calories intake even just little bit for the time being, if you feel comfortable of course. EDs have this bad tendency to take over all aspects of our lives but I think ""boundaries"" have to be made sometimes. I know I eventually had to (I failed countless of exams from this sh*t).",False,False
