But you can't fix a person like that. I relate :( I want to be able to talk about it without necessarily looking for answers or magical curing advice.",False,True

I do think that men in general like to “fix” things. In one way it’s kind of sweet because I know he loves me. But he’s unintentionally making me isolate myself because I don’t want my problems to upset him.   Idk what the answer is. I feel pretty lonely because of it. I just want people around me who I don’t have to act strong or put-together for :(,False,False

I think he's just being shortsighted and not realizing he's putting his own emotions ahead of you. Just let him know that you feel like he's ignoring how you feel.",False,False

He probably just seriously doesn’t know what to say, especially since its *really* easy to say the wrong thing when it comes to EDs. If I were you I’d tell him how you feel, and then give him specific things he can do next time, like just give you a hug, or make you a cup of tea. He probably just needs some direction.",False,False
