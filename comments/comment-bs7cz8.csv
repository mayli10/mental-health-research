I would also like to point out that certain perceptions can't be ""harsh but true"" because they're opinions and not facts. For example if you saw yourself and thought your body was ""hideous"" and ""ugly""‚Äîthat's not a fact because that's objective. It couldn't just be ""harsh but true"" that someone is ""hideous and ugly"" the same way it could be ""harsh but true"" that someone is ""very overweight"".  However, there's also some cases where it *does* become more of a ""are these thoughts actually grounded in reality or not"" thing. For example you might think you look different in certain photos based on how you're feeling. Like you took a photo and one time when you look at it, you think you look fine. And then later on you're like ""wow, I look so fat"". Sort of like what you said about how your perception of yourself is always in flux.",False,False
