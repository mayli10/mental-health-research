Itâ€™s barely above my BMR of 1200. I was maintaining my gw poorly at 1500 with a fuck ton of exercise in the fall until I hurt my leg, but I was eating barely anything, skipping lots of meals, and never drinking alcohol.   Going back to that now so I can do it all over again and not binge it all back this timeðŸ™„",False,False

When I eat intuitively, I rarely bump over 1000. When you're not thinking about food loads, eating kinda normalises. ",False,False

Itâ€™s so annoying. The only way is to eat less on weekdays it seems. Or not feel compelled to eat when other people are which I never can seem to do (although I have gotten better) ,False,False

That's the idea I guess. But that BMR changing pill would be a golden idea amen,False,False
