He was obviously looking for an outlet of his own because no WAY is that acceptable to say to strangers like what the.....  I'm so sorry he made you feel bad, insensitive stuff like this has the potential to completely ruin everything... But please don't let it! I promise you that having that salad and diet Pepsi isn't going to hamper any weight loss, and it'll help fight off the migraine.  If you're into self soothing I also recommend running a warm bath and having a long soak with any stuff like bath bombs or nice scents? Especially on your period because I feel stiff and swollen and heat helps soooo much  Feel better soon and just remember that you won't feel this way forever, and that asshole is a JERK who doesn't know anything about you and was probably trying to offload his shitty day on you.",False,False

Allow yourself to feel. Remind yourself that you've got it this far in life and are still pushing. Remind yourself that you are strong. Because guess what you are whether you believe it or not. And even though everyone is strangers here more people have your back than you think,False,False
