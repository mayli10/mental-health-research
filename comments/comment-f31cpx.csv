I tried a type of diet pill once and the side effects from that were awful. I ended up getting a really bad kidney infection because of it. I still have some lasting problems after it (never had anything of the sort before) and I only took it for a few weeks and it was a few months ago that I stopped. Please do your best to not mess with diet pills.,False,True
