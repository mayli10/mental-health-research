Even overestimating serving size on Carb Manager I have noticed that my flavorful stir fry is always surprisingly low cal, even when I add a lot of sauces and oil.  I'll be sitting with 1/3 of the total food I made and getting supee full on like 400 cal. Forcing yourself to measure all the ingredients kinda slows the binge beast, too, since you aren't chowing down as soon as the urge strikes.  Creating a lot of flavor with herbs and spices makes it feel more like binge food, too.",False,False

Binge as much as you want: but it has to be something you cooked from scratch! 2. Binge away! But only on low carb foods! 3. Go outside and touch a tree, then you can go in and eat &lt;something&gt;. When that's done, touch a tree farther away. repeat.  stupid things, maybe, but the idea for me is to slap myself out of the binge tunnel vision.",False,False

I got down to 135 at Christmas after dropping a bunch of baby weight (I’m 5’10). I set a new goal and then the holidays got me eating “normally”. Then eating normally turned to binging. I checked my weight a few weeks ago after a major binge and I was 159. I promised I wouldn’t let myself get over 160 but then I binged everyday until three days ago. I am so afraid to weigh myself. I look horrible. Fuck fuck fuck is right.   I have 6 weeks to lose as much as I can before I move back to where all my family and friends live. The last time they saw me was Christmas when they were all making comments about how good I look. I can’t go back looking like this. Uuuuggggghhhhhh",False,False
