That's a step closer to healthy really. Just straight up understanding the differences helps.   I read a quote once that said ""sometimes you may have to fight a battle more than once to win it.""...and that scared me at the time because I was doing really well and thought..aw fuck am I gonna fail again?  And I did...but that's ok. Because I have done better each time. And I believe I am gonna get it right eventually.   And you've gotten better this time! So let's both take our supplements and feel better together! ‚ù§   Seriously- shout out to me if u need a hand remembering or just gettin thru.",False,True

To be completely honest I'm in a bit of a relapse right now after doing really fucking well in recovery and I'm just like holy shit... im not even close to as bad as I was before and I feel horrible. But when I was in it before I didnt even realize how badly it affected me. üôÑ   With iron though, it takes about 3 months to return to normal. Last time I went into treatment my iron level was at 6 and I felt significantly better after a month and it was back to normal after about 2 1/2 months.   But seriously thanm hou for this. I'm going to start taking them again tonight. ‚ù§",False,False

My doctor said I will likely need to take these for SIX MONTHS before my levels are back to normal. We just gotta push on!  I hope you can get back on them and feel better soon! üíñ,False,True
