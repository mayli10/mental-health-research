Finally there were people who understood my craziness.All my life I’d felt alone in my thoughts and behaviours and eating disorder online communities have helped me to feel less isolated.

I haven't purged for a month and I unfortunately did again today.  Still felt like total shit afterwards.  My body was shaking and ached as if I did some weightlifting.

Constantly felt the impact on my body and I was functioning in my lifestyle.... which was shoplifting binge food and drinking 40 oz beers without batting a single eyelash.   Yeah maybe when I was 12 and just starting to purge I didn’t realize how much it would mess with my life but that’s still even a long shot.

They're cringey and seem more directed at experimenters and people worried about their occasional binging or unhealthy habits not really for people who exist on the medium-low end of the ED spectrum. I was watching Ed Dr phil segments on YouTube and he says it's a ""disorder of choice"". I think people are under this impression it's a teenage phase that people get over when their weight is restored. Misconceptions run wild with most psychiatric disorders, though. I'd rather be in a community that understood me and I related with, though. Also, you're dead fucking on about the friends and family part. I've straight up been told not to burden anyone with something too difficult for shrinks to even figure out. 99.9% of us would be completely alone without each other. ",False,False
