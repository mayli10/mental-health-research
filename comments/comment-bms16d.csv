I'll remove this post because you've already received some good points in the comments here- objectively you're BMI is underweight.   You see yourself as ""normal"" most likely because it's your dysmorphia warping your view. ED's, by nature, will have you chasing lower and lower numbers because you'll see yourself as ""not thin enough"" no matter the weight on the scale. Remember this is a mental issue we're facing with.",True,False
