Your employer should not feel entitled to your medical history at all. That’s so inappropriate of him to ask you, especially considering it’s in front of the whole family, and especially the kids you were nannying all day. I’m sorry that you had to go through that, but I hope it’s better now.",False,False

I was fasting, and pretty deep in my bullshit, but this was about school stress and boys and anxiety. I knew I was acting like a shit friend to my two BFFs so at the end of the week I went to the park with one of them and explained that I was sorry and I was just going through a tough time. She was great about it and talked to me about some stuff and as we were parting ways to go home she said, “it’s actually kind of a relief, [other friend] and I noticed you’ve barely eaten at lunch in weeks, we thought you were anorexic.”  I was like... fuck. That was kinda my chance to finally confide in someone about that and I totally botched it.",False,False

This scared me so I started taking it to go so I wouldn’t have to eat it (which was so annoying! like I would literally eat their breakfast before out of respect!). A few weeks after I started doing this he loudly asked in front of the family if I was anorexic, then started ranting about how I’m too thin, and then MADE ME GO UPSTAIRS AND WEIGH MYSELF. That was humiliating. I was at a low normal weight so he couldn’t say anything (and tbh I knew that and he’s a doctor so that’s why I complied, I might have tried refusing if I had been underweight). Yep. I was about to go to treatment at that time so at one point I just pulled the mom aside and told her and she was extremely apologetic and he stopped making comments then.",False,False
