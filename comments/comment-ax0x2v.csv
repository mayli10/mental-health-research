I open my window with a latte, hit the gym, have a banana smoothie with a collagen protein powder (it's 94g per 100g protein) and then eat either stir fried veg with nuts or meat and a sauce or cook an actual curry. It's maybe a bit repetitive, but I let myself eat a little more and push my intake to 1500 on rest days.  I also throw in some low intensity cardio on rest days.",False,False

I was having these issues too, and I realized that restriction is just something I’m drawn to...but I can still be healthyish while doing it. I high restrict at 800-1000 calories a day, and I do OMAD with 20 hour fasts. I have a rule that I HAVE to eat every day, and I HAVE to get at least 80g of protein. Feels a lot better than the restriction I used to do and I don’t feel fat, depressed and overfed. ",False,False
