I also read the part of your post you quoted a few times, about not judging people negatively, and I appreciated you saying that, but didn't feel it was strong/clear enough for someone in a bad place.   I agree with the rest of your post, and appreciate it. After I wrote my comment, I was thinking about your post in the shower and thinking about adding another comment.   Because my comment wasn't for you, or about your reasonable complaints. I wrote it for anyone who is in the position I described I was in in my late teens, because I could just feel how much your post would have tore me up, bad. Not because you're wrong, at all, or I disagreed with your posting it. Especially with your 2 points in this comment.   But people be fucked up, and it's gonna take a lot more than a Reddit post to untangle that. In the meantime, all I would have heard is -- Ugh I don't even want to say so as not to feed into exactly what you're criticizing.   Sorry if this doesn't make much sense. I also really appreciate your perspective and how carefully you worded it.",False,False

It was/is a word not taken lightly for a reason. People can stay silent about it being thrown around now, but i hope these same people won‚Äôt be upset if a point is reached where it‚Äôs no longer taken seriously across the board    &gt;I get what you're saying, but remember that ***everyone***   Ehh. At least one of the things I put down wasn‚Äôt picked up. It‚Äôs not a big deal if you did or didn‚Äôt but that was a awkward give away.    &gt; doing something so fucked up for attention needs attention    Going to spotlight a sentence that was intentionally included from the beginning in order to make sure it wasn‚Äôt misunderstood how I feel about people acting out/harming/etc for attention in general   &gt;I feel very invalidated when one of you blatantly admits to wanting attention from your ED **and I don‚Äôt judge you negatively at all** for it ‚Äî- but then **you** immediately **ruin it by saying some** horrifying thing like  I wanted to make sure not push a harmful narrative like that people who harm &amp; feel in need of attention should be ignored.   What I pointed out is people who want to be understood &amp; want a safe area online to talk about their ED related vulnerabilities should:    1.)show others the same attentiveness/respect that they want by practicing tact and making sure they don‚Äôt generalize or unfairly project.           We shouldn‚Äôt be contributing to our own undoing when we consider how often people appropriately vent about the detrimental problem that they‚Äôre are hindered/harmed by others having preconceived notions about people with EDs     &amp;  2)still need to hold themselves accountable separate of their ED.     Recognizing a problem or a flaw (**example/such as:** *unfair expectation one has of others &amp; feeling resentment when those expectations cant be accomplished*) doesn‚Äôt solve anything if someone doesn‚Äôt aim to improve, won‚Äôt engage in dialectal thinking, and dismisses the entirety of the problem‚Äôs existence on something that is not individual to them. (And as a result goes on to generalize everyone else with the same condition which I went over in the above point)  &gt; ***everyone*** doing something so fucked up for attention needs attention    I‚Äôm kinda somewhat happy you/anyone does think this way though. I‚Äôd rather people be in the position to be able to because I infer got most people to be able to hold this opinion (*assuming absence of contradictory view points*) they haven‚Äôt done much more than rub elbows with a malintent person who completely lacks regard for others. (It‚Äôs a manipulation tactic in their relationships)   ***  But that‚Äôs it. The first sentence and that part are all I have to clarify up.

Granted, I‚Äôve become jaded as hell in my years doing this same dance, so my patience with things like this is much lower than it used to be.   I am similar to you in that I‚Äôve never felt invalid nor a fake- though I‚Äôve always known it wasn‚Äôt a healthy way at all to go about things, but *effective* in more ways than one. I‚Äôve known it was anorexia from the start, pretty much. It clicked and I clicked. I‚Äôve never questioned it.   But perhaps that‚Äôs something some of us are unique in, maybe we‚Äôre naturally predisposed to be solid in ourselves when it comes to these things. To know what we‚Äôve got going on inside and be almost confident about it. There is an insecurity that comes along with many disorders, and this one probably holds some of the most. Especially since in my years floating around various ED communities- there *is* an unsaid hierarchy at play and ‚Äúwannarexics‚Äù and the like *are* mocked and essentially demonized.   Either way, it takes *introspection* to discover that. *You* decide for *yourself* whether or not you‚Äôre ‚Äúvalid‚Äù or if you even have a disorder in the first place (obviously an official diagnoses is the *real* way to know). So posting about it does come across highly attention-seeking. Especially the more detailed it gets, the more pitiful it reads, the more it just dramatizes the experience. As if you‚Äôre trying to ‚Äúearn‚Äù your status as Disordered and talk your way into it. When it‚Äôs something you either have or don‚Äôt have. You don‚Äôt need to both ‚Äúfit in‚Äù with the ED crowd and have an ED. You can have an ED just fine and not be the same as everyone else. It‚Äôs how stuff works.   Honestly I find the most exhausting ones the ones essentially asking for a diagnosis. They post ‚Äúdo I have an ED?‚Äù And literally detail out the exact things that qualify as disordered eating. Down to a T. I‚Äôd rather you just do the validity rant. Lol. You can literally google what defines an eating disorder or not. Hell, there‚Äôs online quizzes out there. *Figure it out*. Again- this is something that is completely on *you*. I can‚Äôt tell you anything about yourself and neither can anyone else.   I am pretty indifferent to edgelord stuff, though. EDs go hand-in-hand with self-destruction and you‚Äôre going to find dramatic stuff along with it. I just ignore it. It‚Äôs going to exist for pretty much ever. Especially with teenagers. It‚Äôs almost natural at that point.   It kind of sucks because I do find it interesting to read how other people‚Äôs EDs manifest and began. But not when it‚Äôs made out to be a shit ton more dramatic than it is/was to get internet points and an ego fed.   ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è doesn‚Äôt help EDs do weird shit to your self-esteem. Some people get twisted mindsets. I just either ignore it and move on or leave blunt comments. Lol.",False,False

There was a time in my later teens where I did want to be  ""sick"" and upset I wasn't getting worse physical symptoms. It wasn't a pro-ana thing or glamourizing the illness. It's because I was in so much mental pain, I *wanted* it to manifested so someone would see it on me. Especially after years of an ED, it felt like a) no one would believe me how bad it was b) if it wasn't showing up on my body, no one could possibly know or believe how awful I felt emotionally.   I didn't start that way, and I sure haven't ended that way. I've got 2 decades of ED under my belt, and now I really do whatever I can (within the bounds of my ED's willingness to play ball, sometimes it gets fucking ridiculous) to minimize health impacts, mostly successfully. I know I'm lucky, and I'm constantly grateful for my health (while continuing to actively risk it).   I get what you're saying, but remember that everyone doing something so fucked up for attention *needs attention*.   Maybe some of them are pro-ana, but a lot of them are probably just in an extreme amount of pain and don't feel they have any other way of expressing it. And when people still can't see/hear what they're expressing, it really fucking hurts worse.",False,False

About how it‚Äôs healthy to say ‚ÄúMy experience was X‚Äù Or even ‚ÄúMy experience was a bit different.

It was someone expressing an experience that happened to be different from mine and which maybe exacerbated a hurt or a fear I‚Äôm carrying.
