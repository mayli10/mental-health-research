If college is a goal then perhaps there's some motivation to recover. I don't know if your family knows about your ED or if you have insurance or anything but since you seem to want to recover and you're likely coming up on summer vacation, maybe going into treatment is an option for you?",False,False

Coming from my late twenties I would give anything to be able to go back in time and get help at your age.  There is so much more to life than this. I admire your courage posting this and I believe that you can recover and live the life you want. You can do this. ❤️",False,False

I had BED when I was your age and it turned into anorexia in my late teens. I put myself through a lot of bs because of it. The sooner you do it the better, and the likelihood of you dying is lessened. I’m really happy that you’re so far ahead",False,False
