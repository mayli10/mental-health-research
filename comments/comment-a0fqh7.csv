It's easy to get complacent, but thinking back through and writing it all out like that it hits me just how many years I've spent battling all this. Even when it's not so bad it's still an awful lot of time and energy better spent elsewhere. We can both get through this once and for all, I know it! Best to you as well.",False,False

Thank you so much. It’ll be easier for me to deal with the more knowledge that I have.   I’m so sorry that you have had to live through this. You deserve a better life. 💛,False,False

I was diagnosed anorexia atheletica for about 4 years, which I guess lapsed into exercise purging bulimia for a couple years, to just plain binge eating disorder for maybe 2-3 where I think I just binged almost every single day. Then for a couple years I dropped underweight again with restricting and exercise but still had planned binges, to now I guess I’m about half and half, been binge eating 1-2 times a week but not usually too badly... In summary the binge eating is the real killer and has been way harder for me to overcome than the restriction or overexercise. Sorry, no one is asking for my entire ED history lol, but I wanted to answer your question!",False,False

I was really “good” at restricting too, until the switch flipped, and I just never have gone back there, and I know I’ve heard many many others say the same thing.  If it’s any help, you might gain weight, needed and healthy or maybe more, but I think it’s really unlikely you’ll end up heavily obese. I’ve dealt with serious binge eating, but I care too much about my health and my body that I’ve always kept active, and the one time I really started feeling unhealthy right after gaining after being severely underweight, I was mindful enough to make changes. And remember it’s consistent binge eating or unhealthy overeating that will make you gain too much, not healthy, normal eating, so that’s why it’s extra important to work towards that instead of bouncing between restricting and binge eating... in my experience.  I’m sorry you’re hurting and struggling. I recognize the sentiment. I for one am here to talk if you need and I’m sure many others as well. &lt;3",False,False
