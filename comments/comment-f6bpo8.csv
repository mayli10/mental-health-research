Idk. Maybe you can try and talk to her about it if you're ready for some help or support?   I don't think mine says anything because I'm not underweight so I couldn't possibly have a disorder. Parents are oblivious sometimes.   Also, just cause she doesn't say anything it doesn't make it less valid. Please be safe ❤️",False,False

It wasn’t anything crazy but she’s told me since I was young that she “hates crazy people” since she struggled with her moms alcoholism",False,False

My kids and I live with my parents after I left a long term relationship, and my mom knows I’ve always had issues. She’s always had a healthy relationship with food but has gained a few pounds over the last few years (still a normal weight). She’s also eating way less than she should so she doesn’t say anything to me about how I eat, though I appear “normal” for my kids and just eat at dinner time so they don’t suspect anything.   I am in my 30s now and have reached the point where I really don’t give a shit what anyone says. I’m not looking to be skeletal. Just at the lowest end of “healthy” for my height, maybe a little under, idk. When most people in my family or other people I eat around are obese, I don’t care to listen to what they have to say because they treat their bodies even worse.   “I don’t want that gluten free almond milk organic crap!” Yeah? How’s that working out for you? Lol.",False,False
