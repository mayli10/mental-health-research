My mom was always super negative about herself and would always call herself names and talk bad about her body. She would always read weight loss magazines, buy weight loss supplements, and try almost everything that was advertised on TV to help people drop pounds fast. I think she struggled with the same thoughts I do and unknowingly passed it on to me through biology or pure exposure to those ideas.  I had also hit my growth spurt way earlier than all my friends and this made me put on a little bit of weight at around age 7. I was bullied super horribly and had only a few friends, and I always thought that if I could be skinnier than everyone, then I would be liked and the bullying would stop. I can remember at either 7 or 8 years old throwing out my lunches and weighing myself 4 or 5 times a day to make sure my weight wouldn't go above 85 lb. I also remember around that same time we had to do a class presentation on obesity/health -- When I walked to the front of class to present i heard one of my bullies whisper to me ""of course you would know about this.. because you're obese lol"" (looking back I really wasn't. I was a typical 3rd grader) and this only solidified the feeling in my head that I needed to be thinner in order to be liked.  The thoughts kind of laid low in my mind until about 16 when I was diagnosed with depression, anxiety, and OCD and I found out about *that one community* on tumblr. I started on the whole counting calories/body check/obsession thing in an attempt to cope and ""redeem myself"" from the sad things my brain was feeling at the time.

It started after I was 8 and had a horrible head injury, therefore no longer allowing me to participate in contact sports and having to drop the two sports I was in. I became a little couch potato (until I found golf and swimming) and it didn't help that my parents also started to use food as a way to cope, so I learned that behavior pretty quickly. Initially, I didn't think much about my weight until I started noticing the differences between my body and the other girls in my class. I wasn't fat, but I also wasn't tiny. I also started wondering why I didn't have my mom's body (she was always tiny and athletic) and started berating myself. My parents, despite their own eating habits, were always very encouraging though, so that helped a bit. When I thought my body was too muscular or too broad for my age, they always turned it into a positive, saying things like, ""Your body will help you swim faster and be stronger. Your body allows you to do things that you otherwise wouldn't be able to do if you were smaller. You're capable of hitting the golf ball further because of your body."" So I'm glad that they always tried to reinforce positive thinking in that way and never once shamed me for my size or body type.   But I still struggled with my body views and I also started using food as a coping mechanism in response to bullying and problems occurring at home. I remember gaining weight and feeling so shitty about myself, yet not being able to take control of the amount of food I was eating. So I've always had a horrible relationship with food.   What's kind of ironic when I think about it now is that my supposed ""body type"" was never the issue, just how much I was putting into my body. I always thought I was broad and stocky, but in reality, after losing a lot of weight a year ago, I have a very similar frame to my mom (small-framed) and can get to be very tiny. It's just that my perception was always skewed because I've always been somewhat overweight for most of my teenage and young adult life, up until a year ago.",False,False
