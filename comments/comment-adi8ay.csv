Exercise is just a type of physical activity performed at a higher intensity to promote an increase in physical fitness. All physical activity, however, burns calories. Pedaling a bike at 10 MPH for 4 miles is more efficient than 20 MPH, because your heartrate is lower, and you are using more aerobic and less anaerobic respiration, however, it still inherently requires an energy input for you to move your body 4 miles on a bike. So depending on how fast you're going and how light/intense the effort is, I'd log it appropriately.",False,False

Just keep the heart rate monitor clear of sweat and tbh I think its accurate from what I've heard,False,False

I've been wearing an HR version for 3 years so I hope it's pretty accurate (or at least calibrated to me) by now...,False,True
