One thing that triggers me similarly to you, is listening to G-Dragon and watching his music videos (but also very specific ones, not all of them do this)   Also winter? But only in a specific city that's in the middle of the desert? Like, if I go there and it's chilly with that winter smell in the air I'm just triggered.    And also a very specific bus route I take for work at times that's 4 h long.  Makes absolutely no sense.",False,False
