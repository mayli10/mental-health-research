Especially if you restrict heavily for a long period of time. Your body basically rebels and makes you eat and eat a lot. It’s no biggie. I mean. It’s a biggie because binging. But no biggie as far as diagnosis. Unless it turns to exclusively binging or if you start purging. Then it just changes to a different subtype.,False,False

I used to exclusively binge and binge and binge and now I'm exclusively restricting and I know it's bc I'm in a different place in my life (still unhealthy of course lol) so you're not alone,False,False
