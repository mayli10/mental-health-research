I don't know if im ""recovered"" and its hard to even know if i ever even had body dysmorphia. but i honestly like my body. Some things that made me realize that i have like   &amp;#x200B;  1. I thought my ribcage was big as fuck. Turns out i was sucking in every time and my ribcage is actually lowkey smallish? when looking at urself straight on dont suck in plz 2. Taking videos for me helped. When i took pictures i looked way wider than i was. Videos of u moving helps a lot for me that was what triggered the main change 3. Reaize that all this shit is edited. If you look at someones ig and think theyre so much better looking than you realize 1. body dysmorpgia 2. they probably edit the shit out. ALSO ANGLES OMG. I can look soooooooo hideous if i take the worst picture but i can also make myself look like an influencer and im not either 4. for me looking at pictures of people my height and weight does NOT help but your mileage may very. If you have extreme body dysmorphia it may help but for some it makes it worse. 5. this sounds cliche but for me looking at how sickening some extremely EXTREMELy thin people look helped me realize that i dont want to have a 10bmi and it doesnt mean youre better  &amp;#x200B;  I'm not recovered from the ED just bc of the fear of gaining, but when i am ready this is hugely helpful",False,False
