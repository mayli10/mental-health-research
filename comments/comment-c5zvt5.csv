You can add some fruit or protein powder to it if you like it sweet. If you like savory, add some cucumbers and make a dip for veggies.   Otherwise, I also really like deli meat. Applegate's oven roasted or smoked chicken or turkey are 150 calories for the entire package (6 slices for turkey; 9 for chicken) and range from 30 - 35 grams of protein.",False,False

(You can find them in the meatless section in grocery stores) whole package is only like 10 calories, no carbs, no fat.  I’ve been playing with my seasonings when I make it. I used g.

Maybe, like, turkey or chicken deli slices? As for avocado, it might have been tiding you over well because it has a little good fat in it, so maybe some nuts or cottage cheese or olives? I love olives.",False,False

Get a block of firm tofu cut it into thirds. Roughly the same calories (slightly less) as two eggs.   As for the avocado - I don’t know. It’s so unique.. Greek yogurt maybe just for the nutrients?,False,False
