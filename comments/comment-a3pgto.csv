I've only noticed after I had a panic attack. Now I get lightheaded when talking to people, and I'm wondering if it's causing shallow breathing. Pretty interesting to see so many people do what I do.   &amp;#x200B;  I also take my finger and pull any skin/fat from under my chin back when I look in a mirror. It's how I want to look. I'm just really vain I guess :/",False,False

I have an 8 year old daughter and I literally go out of my way to make sure I never trigger any body issues. For god sakes I make sure to say sheâ€™s getting tall and not big.

It really freaked me out (no ED at the time I was definitely like 7 or 8 at the most). I was a pretty thin kid but I was like wow I never want that to happen to me! So I made an effort to hold in my stomach whenever possible thinking that one day Iâ€™d get used to it and I did over the years I guess.   Iâ€™m not complain tho i think itâ€™s good for my posture ,False,False

Just like some other comments I realized that in elementary if I suck in I look skinny. I was never a fat kid (was actually underweight) but I was terrified of getting bigger. My stomach is sucked in all the time. In class. At dinner. Watching tv. Working out. Studying. I'm sitting in the library by myself rn and after I read your post I realized I was sucking in too. lol  Sometimes if I try to not my stomach actually hurts. It feels bloated and stretched out. I suck in 24/7 unless I'm sleeping or standing and I forget. ,False,False
