It’s really no problem, I always liked critiquing work and helping people with art. Mostly because it’s the only thing I’ve ever felt confident about my entire life. I also used to teach my classmates in high school. Let me know if you need anything looked over as well.",False,False

Just kidding. You can do this. PM if you need any help with art. I got a 5 star portfolio in high school and a scholarship to a bunch of top art schools in the country. Never went but- I know what they look for and can look over your portfolio if it helps any.,False,False

Or email your teacher if that's any easier. The designated eating times of going to school really suck. I've been in similar situations to this before so I really feel for you.,False,False
