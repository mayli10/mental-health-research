Also: Lily Collins and Fiona Apple publically admitted to have suffered from an eating disorder, same with the Olsen Twins It suprises me that nobody mentioned Brie Larson. She used to make music as a teen and if u want to trigger urself then go ahead and check out her one of her music videos.",False,False
