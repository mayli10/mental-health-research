We went on a meal outing to have morning tea out at a cafe. All sitting around the table and the waiter comes over. One of the skinniest patients was wearing very ~minimal clothing, very obviously protruding bones, and the waiter writes down her order and says “you’re so lucky, you’re so skinny that you can afford to eat like this”.   Oof. In so many ways. A lot of processing was done when we got back to the hospital.",False,False

I couldn't finish my meal because of this, so I had to go the the ""quiet room"" until I finished my meal. I wasn't eating, bit I threw up in the room from the migraine... I swear I wasn't purging. But of course they thought I was taking, so it took hours to convince them to give me medicine for the migraine and let me go to bed. They must have thought I was gonna be a handful, but I really was motivated to recover! I just got a migraine from the stress! Not a ""fun"" story... But totally true!",False,False
