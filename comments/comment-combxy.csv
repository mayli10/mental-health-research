I wanna try some shakes as meal replacements since I get no protein in my diet. I’m also trying this new shampoo/conditioner called nioxin. I can report back in like a month or so and let you know if it does anything. I take biotin as well.,False,False

Breakfast is a carrot cake smoothie so you just mix all of those ingredients together. Lunch is a scrambled egg with cheese and some sweet potato home fries. Dinner is spaghetti with tofu. I kept the ingredients organized by meal, so it's easy to read. That's why some items show up more than once. I was lazy and put cooked spinach in the smoothie since I had already used that ingredient twice, but you do not want to cook the spinach for that. It would be weird to cook anything you put in a smoothie. I did put 1/4 teaspoon of potassium citrate powder for both the smoothie and meal replacement shake on accident, but I actually only ever put 1/8 in them because it has a strong taste. I would recommend just doing 1/8th in those and then a full teaspoon in the pasta sauce. The way I make the pasta it's always 4 servings, so each serving would have 1/4. It equals half a teaspoon per day either way. You could probably just ignore the potassium powder though because you're so small and the recommended amount is based on somebody who consumes way more than you would need. The ice cream bar is mostly just thrown in there because I was worried about losing too much weight from this meal plan, so you can ignore that too if it's too much for you. It does give a little potassium and sodium though which are both below the recommended amount, so maybe you might want some ice cream.",False,False

I think you need to be a healthy weight for it to stop though. I've been pretty sick, but I found that getting back up to a healthy weight did allow a lot of my hair to start growing back. I know that getting back to a healthy weight can be difficult, but I can send you a meal plan I made to help in the meantime until you're ready to become healthy again.",False,False

You can slow it down by making sure the calories you do take in are really nutrient-dense and healthy. Lots of protein, healthy fats, and nutrient-rich fruits and vegetables. There are some supplements that supposedly help with hair growth, most are totally bogus but the only ones that I think are worth looking into would be biotin, vitamin E, and omega-3. Do your own research of course and take at your own risk, I’m not a doctor just a hangry moron, but they seem to be relatively safe for most people.  I’ve also recently been looking into the Curly Girl Method even though my hair isn’t curly (just kind of wiggly), and it’s helped a whole lot. I still lose more hair than what’s normal IMO but it’s less than before and the hair I do have is much stronger and healthier so it looks thicker. You can use a lot of the basics of CGM even if you don’t have curly hair, most of it is just tips to maximize the health of your hair which will work for most people regardless of texture.",False,False
