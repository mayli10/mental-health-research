One shot of espresso and apple cider vinegar water (not together) in the morning for aforementioned poo and energy. No eating until 5 pm, if I do eat before 5 then the day is written off as a binge day and I‚Äôm SOL lmao. I allow myself two wine spritzers and lightly salted popcorn every two days as a ‚Äútreat‚Äù for existing, and then only on Saturdays am I allowed a full calorie redbull of my choosing because the calories for that miraculously don‚Äôt count on Saturday.",False,False

If i gained I‚Äôll get kind of depressed and if I lost I‚Äôll get manic. If I maintained it‚Äôs a toss up haha.Either way I body check for a long time and usually take pictures. If I‚Äôm going to school I‚Äôll make a huge bottle of coffee and if I‚Äôm going to work I‚Äôll drink like 6-8 big cups of tea. I decide if I‚Äôm going to eat something or fast around 6-8 pm everyday.",False,False
