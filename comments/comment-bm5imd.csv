It's really challenging to tell anyone or explain why I want to be anorexic again. It felt like my life was worth living when I was skinny. That's the only goal I've wanted, and I just want to relapse and achieve it. I want that bliss back. Sure, I was weak. Sure, I was fatigued. But it felt so good.",False,False

My life was just binge eating and playing games until 250lbs of self hatred. The same self hatred that made me lose 110lbs. I just want to go back to 500 net calories a day. I don't fucking care that I was a mess physically. I just want to be sane again. Thanks xx. Hope you're all good too (:,False,False

Being in recovery is like trying to go back to the life I had before my ED and that person doesn‚Äôt exist anymore because my ED will forever be a part of me. I‚Äôll never be as skinny as I once was because now I‚Äôm too aware and my habits are fucked up. I need to either start restricting but consistently eating or to recover and then ‚Äúhealthily‚Äù lose weight. I hate this. I just wanna go back to being in a terrible place and going 2 days without eating like it was nothing and focusing only on food and eating and sleeping instead of all the other bullshit in my life.

I felt in control of my life during that time. I was succeeding at both personal goals and educational/work goals. Now with Bulimia I'm failing at everything. But nobody else gets it or understands my reasoning. It's like, I was 'happy', even if that definition of happiness was deluded or incorrect. People ask me 'were you truly happy at the time'. The answer is yes, it was a simple life. The only thing that made me happy was seeing my weight go down on the scale. Even with the bradycardia, the black and blue toes, the permanent fatigue, and permanent coldness. That benchmark still stands today, but now I have an entirely different beast to deal with.",False,False

There‚Äôs something so comforting about being in the depths of an ED. Nothing else matters. You have a goal. Something to focus on and infuse your life with that takes up all of you so you don‚Äôt have to think about anything else. Agh. It‚Äôs a perfect nightmare,False,True

Nobody gets why I say I don't want to recover. I don't want to get better. I want to relapse to anorexia. I want to lose weight again. I want to be back to the only thing that bought me happiness. I don't want to be healthy.,False,False
