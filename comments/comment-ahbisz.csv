I never ""loved"" my body but I tolerated it well and I think I had a more accurate self-perception. I would get moments of body image insecurity but they would pass and didn't dominate my every waking thought. Sometimes I would think about restricting but it was much easier to choose to eat when I was hungry because I didn't want to be distracted all day. Didn't have any health issues, certainly not the chronic constipation and indigestion I feel now. My depression was pretty bad during this time but to be fair I was doing everything wrong; irregular sleep hours, binge drinking/partying on the weekend, VP of my sorority, all while maintaining a high GPA in nursing school.",False,False

But tldr I basically had the trajectory that Tabitha Farrar describes: years of restricting and ""recovery"" while still being well below my natural set pount weight, then like two years of feasting, then sort of calmed down and eat normally now, weight was stable until I started having babies which obviously has changed my body size ",False,False

She's done a few videos about how she eats now, after fully self-recovering from severe anorexia, and several of her posts are about what her life is like now. Tons and tons of amazing advice there, too!",False,False

It seems like many people leave this sub for their mental health when they decide to recover. xx,False,False
