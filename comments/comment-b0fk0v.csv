A bit confused as to how others got the opposite effect. In order to get it back to desensitized Iâ€™m just putting my fingers down my throat and making the effort to keep myself from throwing up rather than making myself throw up. But I naturally lack a reactive gag reflex so maybe thatâ€™s why?",False,True

This has never happened to me. The more I purge the more sensitive my reflex is and I can get close to puking right after I eat. Unfortunately this means that going down on my partner activates my gag reflex. Iâ€™ve literally puked on his dick. ,False,False
