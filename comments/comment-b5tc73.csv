When I'm coming up I'm very energetic, euphoric, confident, find everything really funny.  When I'm coming down I'm totally spaced out and numb.  When it's over I'm extremely low.  The whole thing feels like a haze.  I forget shit I just did, I write weird shit down and find it later and it feels like it was written by somebody else.  A whole mess. ",False,False

I get very agitated and antsy when I'm on the cusp of a binge. Everything in my body is telling me to get the food fast, that I need it quickly. I cant stop thinking about it. It's a big feeling of relief when I'm finally eating, the anxious discomfort dies down. I imagine that drug addicts might experience something similar. ",False,False
