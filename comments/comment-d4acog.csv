I also love frozen bags of broccoli since its a lot of volume. Annie chungs vegetable potstickers are good but the serving size is pretty small and might be obvious- i usually have 2 servings and pair with cauliflower rice or w/ miso soup,False,False

You can add cauli rice too to make fried rice if you like that. Kimchi is good too. You need more soy sauce if you do fried rice.  * I found these mexican flavored black bean pouches (~300) cals and I add some extra veg * big ass salad of spinach and romaine with cucumber and tomato with balsamic to hold you over till dinner * Vegan grilled cheese with low cal bread (cheese is 60 cal per slice and carb smart 647 is 90 for two pieces). I found 300 cal organic tomato soup too you could do a half portion.  * miso soup with veggies in it, tofu *Bread with jam and I found vegan cream cheese that’s 60 cals per tablespoon *I know people don’t usually do fruit as safe food but I do like a cup of grapes and half an apple for dessert right before bed *My favorite take out is cucumber carrot sushi roll with seaweed salad. I don’t have the exact number since everywhere is different but for sure under 300.",False,False

Mix in a lil Tikka Masala sauce (not low cal, but everything else is and the flavour is so strong I won’t need a lot of it).

I've weirdly found that lasagna noodles have a lot less calories than I anticipated, so I like to make various vegan lasagnas (substitute ricotta with tofu), because tomato sauce and tomato paste (don't even consider the jars of Prego and shit omg the sugar, make your own sauce) have very few calories. And you can add peppers and spinach and all that good stuff!",False,False
