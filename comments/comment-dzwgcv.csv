I'm a dude too and I get those feelings of gender related invalidation.

Your struggle and your disorder arent negated due to your gender. You're struggling to see that you're valid and that's okay, everyone's journey has different challenges, but you really should be proud that you have the self awareness and emotional capability to at least reach out , if only in the form of a reddit post.",False,False
