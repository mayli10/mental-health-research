Is your preferred weight close to or at underweight?  If your ""set point"" they've come is at the middle or higher end of healthy, maybe discuss with them losing weight HEALTHILY and getting to a weight more comfy for you. Just stress that even before the disordered eating, you maintained a weight somewhat below the one you're at, and you feel more confident and mentally better at that weight. The big part is that it has to be done healthily.  Hope my comment doesnt sound patronizing, and good luck",False,False

I was referring to this:  &gt;	set point theory is often repackaged and abused by FA/HAES people to justify carrying excessive body fat  I was referencing the recent revision of the stance on the so-called “Obesity paradox” and how that relates to the HAES talking point of being “Fat But Fit”. The lack of personal responsibility or control advocated by HAES activists under the umbrella of the “Set Point” flies in the face of everything I’ve read and experienced (although I understand personal anecdotes are not data) regarding weight change.   I’m out and about but I’m really happy that you went into so much detail because now I have more things to look into! Thanks for taking the time! ,False,False

This is a result of delayed restoration of normal hormonal function. More reading can be found here:  &amp;#x200B;  [https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0261561497800465](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0261561497800465) (very good study)  [https://slatestarcodex.com/2017/04/26/anorexia-and-metabolic-set-point/](https://slatestarcodex.com/2017/04/26/anorexia-and-metabolic-set-point/) (article)  &amp;#x200B;  Dealing with weight gain during recovery, especially the fact that I had put on noticeable fat in my abdominal area, was really hard for me. Especially because a lot of the root of my AN was body dysmorphia and fearing fat to begin with. But I had to basically push through and realize that I had to start accepting myself for who I was, and that there was more to life than worrying about carrying an extra 10 pounds of fat on my body. Believe me, carrying a little extra fat will not prevent you from being metabolically healthy, or attractive. It won't stop you from living a purpose-driven life, having quality relationships, etc.  &amp;#x200B;  All that said, in time, I did find that without any conscious dieting, I did lose fat over time. I had to keep eating in order for this to happen, though. Really when I look back on my history, it's when I was most restrictive that my body always tended to put on fat the easiest and keep it on. When I started really increasing my calories more recently, like late December through today (today is roughly 8 months into recovery for reference), that's actually when I noticed the most body fat loss. This is all part of regaining a healthy metabolism and the restoration of lean body mass and a bunch of sciencey stuff. It's nice to feel more normal again, but internally I still have to remind myself that life is about more than being lean. If I had to give some advice to ""early recovery VTMongoose"" who was suffering from worrying about the body fat overshoot, worrying about calories, still restricting on and off, it would be that, the sooner you just buy some baggier clothes, listen to your body, eat when you're hungry, and learn to start living your life outside of food and exercise, the better off you will be.",False,False

Don't get me wrong, set point theory is often repackaged and abused by FA/HAES people to justify carrying excessive body fat, which is a result of a disordered relationship with food. However, this does not negate the science of body weight homeostasis.  &amp;#x200B;  Leptin signaling from adipose and its downstream effects have allowed human beings to maintain fat homeostasis easily without calorie counting for millenia. Sure, there are things that influence your body fat set point outside of genetics. Your diet, your gut health, your leptin sensitivity (also influenced by diet), exercise compensators vs non-exercise compensators, etc, but at the end of the day when you starve yourself, leptin goes down, ghrelin goes up, driving orexigenic behavior. And when you eat loads of food coming out of a starvation state (because this system is disrupted by that starvation state), sure, it takes a while for you to normalize hormonally (during which you get body fat overshoot), but once you're weight restored, the reason the excess fat comes off seemingly ""on its own"" is because of this system, which will then switch into an anorectic state. The fat storage level you end up settling at is individual to every single person. Some people are able to walk around a few clicks above ""stage lean"" all the time and not lose their sanity because of not just their lifestyle, but genetics. This genetic component that leads to people storing varying levels of body fat even when diet and lifestyle are equated is probably the most powerful player in body fat set point and something we inherently have no control over.",False,False

But I have an idea that may be helpful to you:  Reframe their concept of a set point as a metric of compliance with recovery. If you are maintaining the weight they have established as your “set point”, it means that you are not engaging in any compensatory behaviors to undermine recovery. You aren’t purging or restricting. That’s a good way for them to gauge your participation in your recovery even if the science behind “set point” is bunk.",False,False

One issue I had with online shopping was just that I had no idea what size I was... so I did end up ordering some clothes a size up online, and they were still way too small for me lol... it’s just the most frustrating thing in the world and kind of makes me wish I never even went into treatment in the first place.

I def know just how challenging it is to have that “none of my clothes fit” feeling.    What I have done (and worked for me) was to go online and buy clothes. I bought clothes intentionally a size or two larger than I “wanted to be/was” and buying online made it easier bc seriously F* trying clothes on rn.    I am right here with you. It is a struggle, but I know from reading tons and tons of other people’s experiences that my weight will find a healthy appropriate place if I am following a solid plan of treatment and I can be kind to myself right now by buying larger stretchy clothes that I don’t have to deal with in a fitting room.    I hope this helps. At the very least, pls know you’re not alone.  ",False,False
