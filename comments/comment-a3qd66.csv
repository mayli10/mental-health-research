I think it‚Äôs water weight, and from what I understand, the less you drink, the more your body will RETAIN what water is already in it to compensate for your lack of drinking it.   It‚Äôs winter here and I work outside with horses so I‚Äôm freezing all day, hardly ever break a sweat, so I‚Äôm never thirsty, and so I don‚Äôt drink any water hardly. I think what we‚Äôre meant to do is actually drink the amount of water we‚Äôre supposed to daily, and then our bodies won‚Äôt retain it for compensation, because there will be nothing to compensate for since we‚Äôre hydrating sufficiently...maybe? Plus more water means you piss more which means you flush excess water out more often, if I don‚Äôt drink water I piss only TWICE A DAY lol! I think I‚Äôm just retaining water rn, there‚Äôs no other reason why I should be losing weight this fucking slowly üò†üôÑ",False,False

Honestly I‚Äôm losing at a pretty decent rate overall and I know that.

I‚Äôm sure when I‚Äôm at a lower weight this won‚Äôt have as much of an emotional impact (it already has less of an impact now than it did when I was 10lbs heavier) but for now I‚Äôm so laser focused on progress that it SUCKS when it goes the other direction just a little.
