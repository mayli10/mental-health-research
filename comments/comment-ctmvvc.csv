I feel bigger than I am, even though I’m normal weight right now. I sometimes see pics/videos of me and don’t believe that I’m really as skinny as I am in them... it’s just not how I feel. It’s weird... I dunno if it’s because I have been overweight/bigger before, so I still have that mindset, maybe.",False,False

My partner lost ten pounds and it made a *huge* visible difference, versus when I lost my first *f o r t y* literally no one could tell, even when I straight up asked ""hey do I look thinner I lost forty pounds""  Basically, normies have no fuckin clue how to tell whether someone's lost a lot of weight or a little, so if they're telling you that you've ""lost weight"" it's probably because their mental picture of you is skewed.",False,False
