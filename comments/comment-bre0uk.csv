When you decide to binge, when you're rummaging for and preparing the food, when you have it set in front of you and you take the first few bites. It's like a high, you're getting everything you wanted, you're winning. Then the regret sits in but you can't stop. It doesn't even occur to you that you *could* stop. You eat until you're done and full and guilty. Then you look for more, but there's no excitement this time. It's just something you have to do.",False,False

The Danger Zone for me is when I've just finished eating something that was really delicious and satisfying, so I'm no longer hungry, BUT I'm also not full. I'm perfectly satisfied. I should be content - but I'm not. The second I finish whatever food I have I start mentally (or physically) cruising for what else I can eat. My mind races about everything I have in my cupboards or when the store closes so I could buy more ingredients or what's the closest restaurant I could order something from and how fast.  If I'm still hungry when I finish what I'm eating this doesn't happen. If I'm stuffed when I finish eating, it's less likely to happen, or I'm less likely to follow through on it when I do because I feel so full. But it's like eating in that perfect middle zone that should make a normal person with a normal brain happy just reminds me of how excellent eating is and how I can totally still do more, more, more.",False,False

I am so mad at myself. I was thinking that maybe I should have really high restriction and have a '''''''cheat''''''' meal which once a week (but no overboard maybe like 1000 binge and hit the gym idk) but at the same time.. I am like '' bitch you had plenty of cheat meals'' and tbh that kinda outlook like ''well, it is not saving/fixing it'' has ruined so many things for me.",False,False

I really, really NEED to get rid off the mindset:  ''I fucked up already, so might as well binge now... I mean TOMORROW I will fast, exercise and do everything and I will be fine.''  And the thing is that it wasn't a real fuck up, I would eat something that was under my daily intake (I set for myself): 600kcal, but I would eat it on one sitting and then: BAM my brain is like: ''binge, binge, binge, binge, then purge'' I don't know what makes me think that making my calorie intake bigger isn't a fuck up on itself.. The worst part is: I know I will regret it, I am aware of it, but my brain is: come on just eat today last binge ;p",False,False
