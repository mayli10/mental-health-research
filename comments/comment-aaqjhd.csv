Also sucks to be fat while pasty white because it just looks even worse  Yeah doesn’t help when everyone is telling u to gain weight/u want ur period back but I legit just learned that it’s not even bad to lose it if u don’t want to get pregnant so I gained more than I even started at for no reason. ,False,False

I hate using public restrooms so I avoid eating and only drink what's necessary. Everybody knows this and they never ask if I want something to eat/drink. And when I travel it's usually 20+ hours at a time, so I end up doing a 30+ hour fast .",False,False

I didn’t even think it was possible to gain that much but here I am, looking and feeling so disgusting.

I still feel really icky at this weight, even though I'm only a pound heavier maximum. I feel like I need a three day fast to feel clean again, but that has to wait until my exams are finished early january. Late January is going to be a bad time for any adipose trying to hide in me.",False,False

I hadn't binged in months, since september, and was nearing my lowest weight again. The cancelled flight and sleeping overnight in an airport freaked me out and I went into a shop, bought loads of tofu sausages and fruit and binged on them, it was like 4k calories though. I was also huddled behind a pillar in the airport so I felt like I looked as much a freak as I felt.   Airports are dangerous, all the potential for distaster and food everywhere is triggering.",False,False
