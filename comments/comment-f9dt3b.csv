I didnâ€™t really care about what I looked like. I had sad days where I wanted to be skinny. But now I feel like i constantly monitor myself and Iâ€™m much more self conscious. Also much more judgemental of others too which is toxic in itself.,False,False

Anorexia is so much deadlier and has some denial involved in it, whereas people who are overweight know and understand this and donâ€™t try to act like theyâ€™re not ðŸ™„  Itâ€™s just fatphobia and it makes me so angry!! Itâ€™s why I despise fatlogic esp when I see recovered anorexics on there. Like we are no better than people who turn to food for comfort, we have the same problem but on the flip side and much much worse.   And not all anorexia is associated with vanity or wanting to be thin. Itâ€™s about control for me and being able to manipulate this one part of me since I canâ€™t change my face or something about my life.",False,False

I mean they honestly really do mean well and I love them dearly but they themselves have such disordered eating that they can't really see what's happening. My grandparents both clearly have eating disorders and their daughters as well, so you can see it run through the family. I don't think EDs were really a diagnosed thing when they were growing up so they think it's all normal.",False,True

All EDâ€™s are valid and deserve treatment when youâ€™re ready.,False,False
