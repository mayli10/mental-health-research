I want intimacy very badly, even if it's just to sleep with someone or walk near someone. But I dealt with someone stalking me, and he had his way with me, and that made me extremely anti-social. I can't ever imagine having sex with someone until I get married. Whenever a guy tells me this, they're like ""how are you supposed to know if you actually love them if you don't know how they are in bed?"". I get discouraged from dating because of this and it's been a really hard hit to me when trying to make genuine connections with others.",False,False

I think I look ok in clothes but I feel like I'm lying,  like I look good in clothes but fucking disgusting naked so I'm being deceitful.  I almost feel like with my bf I'm tricking him unintentionally,  if that makes sense.  I'm so attracted to him but need to be drunk to have sex without feeling completely uncomfortable. It's the only way I can enjoy it without being disgusted by myself. I hope that made sense. ",False,False
