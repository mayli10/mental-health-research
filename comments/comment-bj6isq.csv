It's like a constant argument in my head that's always running in overtime. When thinking about it for the first time, the best way I could put it into words was as a primary line of thought, that always brings topics to the table, and then a secondary line of thought that supplies the counter argument, which, when I stop and just think (rarely, because like OP I have ADHD) my mind takes me down very philosophical routes. Tbh even now I'm struggling to get it all out as words and it feels like something's missing but this is a start. Point is, do you have similar experiences?",False,False

But language is a strong influencer of thoughts so knowing more languages expands world views and can give you access to different thought patterns, which can be healthy (in English we say ‚ÄúI miss you‚Äù but in French we use the passive ‚Äúyou are missing from me‚Äù. In English we say ‚ÄúI am sad/tired/hungry..‚Äù but in Spanish it‚Äôs ‚ÄúI have sadness/fatigue/hunger‚Äù which acknowledges that they are temporary feelings, not integral parts of identity.)
