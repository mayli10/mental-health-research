I bounce back and forth between Mia behaviors and ana behaviors and there's no fucking inbetween... and so the whole eat until you're full thing is utter bullshit... because I dont know what it feels like? And by the time I'm like 'oh shit. Maybe im full??' I go into overdrive and use Mia behaviors... to make me not feel like a fucking balloon... but then, is that full, since I'm not going to pop anymore? Or when I'm low restricting, sometimes eating 1 bite of a granola bar makes me 'full'... idk, anyone else feel the same?",False,False

And frankly, I don't even know what my hunger signals are. I was amazed when I learned there's a whole spectrum of hunger ranging from starving to ""so full you feel sick"" with 8 levels in between. I always viewed it as being hungry, full or neither and thought the ""right"" way to eat meant just eating until I was no longer hungry anymore which is really hard to gauge and also unsatisfying. Being pleasantly full (level 6 on the spectrum) is a more overall fulfilling place to be for most people. There's also this whole idea that falling to a 1 or 2 on the hunger scale (starving/extremely hungry) tends to make us overcompensate because we think we need more food to get us to a comfortably full level when that isn't the case. Plus, if we're not mentally present during a meal i.e. watching tv or scrolling socials, we're not as satisfied and will likely eat more later, even if we're not hungry, just to try and feel more fulfilled. I could go on. There are just so SO many factors involved in eating, why we crave certain things, why we binge, all of it.   I will say biggest pitfall of intuitive eating is it doesn't address the \*why.\* Why you have the disordered thoughts in the first place. Whatever predisposed you to an ED (trauma, poor self-image/worth, perfectionism, etc.) doesn't go away on its own and isn't necessarily something that IE tries to correct. That said, IE should be viewed as a tool that can help with recovery, and not a ""cure.""",False,False

But wow it's so hard to ""listen to your body"" when you have an ED.  When I'm eating there are 2 voices in my head. One voice tells me to stop because I'm ""full"" and don't ""need anymore"" even when I barely eat anything and definitely below my TDEE. The other voice tells me to eat, I'm hungry I want food even if I'm stuffed, even the times I ate until my stomach hurt I still have some urge to just eat more. How to find the true ""intuition"" between those 2 extremes...  (Similar thing happens with the ""wait after eating"" technique. When I stop eating I'm still starving. If I wait about an hour I'm no longer hungry, but then over time I lose weight and after a few days I start to get intense cravings so clearly I'm not eating enough...)",False,False

I still have issues overeating constantly, but I‚Äôm not triggered by my fear foods (most of the time) anymore. It used to be all or nothing, now it‚Äôs just sometimes that I go overboard.   I can literally have half a cookie and then be done, half a bowl of pasta, one slice of pizza, because I stopped categorizing foods as good or bad. I learned that I just like really, really fatty foods, but I don‚Äôt like eating tons at once.   I know when I‚Äôm full. I get this obvious ‚Äúclick‚Äù in my brain. But I‚Äôm still not good as listening to it, because TOO MANY TIMES that click goes and yet my brain is still like ‚Äúooooooh just keep going ham on that tasty snack.‚Äù That is the key to intuitive eating.

For most of our 200 000 years, we have lived a subsistence lifestyle, feast or famine. Our brain is programmed to recognise and crave sugar fat and salt because these were calorie rich and could be stored to keep us alive during the lean times.  Our bodies should intuitively crave this, and overeat it when it is available, because that is what  kept us alive for most of our history.    That we now have too much food, and food available 24/7, is only a problem we have had in the past 100 years. Evolution takes time, of course we haven't adapted to be able to eat moderately yet.

Your brain and your body are connected, but with some people, they are at odds. Your body knows when it‚Äôs hungry or full. Your brain, though, can panic and override these natural built in sensors. Learning how to eat intuitively is learning how to listen to your body again, which is NOT immediately understood or accessible to everyone. People who say thinking about chocolate mean you need it is horsebull. It does mean that something in chocolate will give you something your brain is missing, but that could mean dopamine, seratonin, or vitamins. Being able to fully trust your body again is hard as fucking fuck after years of restricting or binging, and sometimes it is impossible to suddenly do it correctly. You might try to eat a full meal, feel that satisfaction ‚Äúclick‚Äù and still ignore it because how the fuk am I done after 8/17ths of a hamburger and it‚Äôs not possible that I suddenly think I don‚Äôt like pickles?  Intuitive eating techie slot works for everyone, but learning how to do it can be fucking hard, and I don‚Äôt think the most popular book is getting it right for everyone, yet people listen to it like gospel.  It makes me mad. Sometimes we need strict parameters to get us back into a frame of reality which then allows us to trust our intuition. If I didn‚Äôt know what a 300-500 calorie meal looked like, then I would never understand why I sometimes actually get full so quickly when I‚Äôm actually intuitively eating, and I also might not recognize when I‚Äôm on stress mode eating because I just ate 2500 calories in an hour and my stomach hurts",False,False

I think that most fitness influencers are completely misinformed and offer oversimplifications of what intuitive eating means.   I‚Äôm still exploring what it really means with my dietician, but from my understanding, it‚Äôs about and checking in with yourself at different points of your meal. Asking yourself why you‚Äôre eating something and knowing both hunger and satisfaction play a huge role in your eating patterns. If you eat a meal that fills you up but isn‚Äôt satisfying, you‚Äôre probably going to react adversely later in the day, specifically for me that means bingeing. Same goes for restricting certain food groups. So it‚Äôs about being okay with letting yourself eat that ‚Äúextra‚Äù cookie and knowing that serving sizes on packages are completely arbitrary. There‚Äôs probably other aspects that I‚Äôm missing but my point is it‚Äôs so much more than eating when you‚Äôre hungry and stopping when you‚Äôre full or giving in to every craving. It‚Äôs something that takes a lot of practice and something I happen to be absolute shit at even after months of practice. Lol",False,False
