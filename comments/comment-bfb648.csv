It bothers me so much, cause your kid will eat whatever is front of him if you don’t expose them to shit and if they’re hungry enough. Also, cook! No other country glorifies processed garbage as much as we do. Europeans don’t eat like this, they eat real, even high fat, high calorie food, and they do not have an obesity issue like the US (except I think England), cause of portions and of appreciating natural foods.

This is markedly different from binge eating where massive amounts of food are consumed at once, in a much more “out of control” way,” usually with some awareness and *always* with a great deal of distress, guilt and shame. Even with plain old overeating that is more disordered (or that occurs in the context of more disordered behaviors), the whole internal process is going to be very different imho.

Nevermind that the dressing and croutons are taking away from its benefits as a healthy choice.   &amp;#x200B;  I think that as a society we have walked away from what a regular healthy diet even looks like in the home and out of the home due to the perceived value of what we can get for out moneys worth. I think that was a huge factor in the change of portion sizes, and the masses just followed the trend of what to expect for what a regular meal looks like to the point now a burrito at chipotle, arguably containing an entire days worth of calories or more with chips and a drink is the standard expectation for what lunch looks like.   &amp;#x200B;  Its no wonder as a society we are seeing pant sizes increase and vanity sizing being the norm.
