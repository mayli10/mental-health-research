Skate a line or two then stand around for ten minutes. If I skate transition my lungs are shot so quickly and I feel like I’m about to pass out.   It’s definitely harder to breathe cold dry air. There are powdered electrolyte mixes you could add to water if you’re not taking other supplements for those.    I’ll toss a banana in my backpack and find they don’t upset my stomach too much before a sesh. ,False,False
