I ate (&amp;drank.. which led to more eating) whatever. Today has been a shit show of misery though   I’ve cried &amp; bitched about my weight &amp; body so much to my fiancé. I’m at least glad we enjoyed last night. I didn’t count calories for the first time in like a year.. I even deleted MFP for the night which was nice,False,True

I can say that worrying about my weight/how my body looks the week I got engaged took a bit of sparkle out of a beautiful time and I regret that I let myself do that.   &amp;#x200B;  You will get through this, and find your happy place with everything....but please try to enjoy tonight. Tonight is one dinner, and it won't permanently move the scale either way. It will, however, be a night you look back on as a couple for a long time and hopefully cherish. Again, I am so sorry you are feeling this way. Congratulations on your engagement and I really hope you are able to enjoy tonight!",False,False
