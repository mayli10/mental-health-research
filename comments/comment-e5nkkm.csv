I know, everything you're saying makes complete sense. I just can't break her like that. More than I already have. She feels like she is the cause of my ED and if I don't allow her to take control of my recovery and feel like she is helping, she will forever feel like a failure of a mother. I'm an only child. Plus. Recovery is hard. To be honest, without her keeping watch I probably would b/p a lot more than I do these days. Or restrict heavily. It sucks, but it makes me eat and keep it down. So should I still prioritise my boundaries because I'm unhappy that I have no freedom? Or suck it up because it actually is contributing positively to my recovery and to my mums mental health?",False,True

This is gonna sound alien and if you feel like a horrible person it’s completely normal - it is your mothers responsibility to manage her anxiety in ways that do not affect you negatively. It is not your responsibility to fix your mother, worry about her, or accept her violating your boundaries to the detriment of your mental health.   This def doesn’t mean abandoning her or anything. You can explain that she needs to stop certain behaviours, and direct her to people and resources who can equip her with tools and support. But you don’t have to blindly put up with this because she’s your mum.",False,False

I feel like I just have to suck it up and deal with it, for her peace of mind. Its my fault anyway. But bc of it my depression is getting worse. If i tell her to back off she's going to ruin herself with worry. I can't do that to her, either.",False,True

It took several different approaches from her - oscillating between overbearing and hands off- and several chats from me where I explained “the way you are treating me is not helping. You are violating my boundaries.” I know it’s a scary conversation to have, but your mum probably just has zero clue how to actually support you.",False,False
