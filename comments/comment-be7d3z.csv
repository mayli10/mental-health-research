I was a bit porkier than the other girls so I decided to secretly cut down my portions, like you. I ate half of what I used to eat and then binge during the night and with my family. My parents took no note of it thinking that I was just going to grow out of it.  &amp;#x200B;  By 11, I had learned about calories and started counting everything I ate. I still binged during the night- therefore able to keep a stable weight. My mom kept pinning me against my sister who was thinner than me. I was a dancer back then and because of my phisique, I felt embarrassed to dance with the thinner girls who always danced better than I did.   &amp;#x200B;  By 12, I knew I had an eating disorder. No one else knew it but deep inside, I knew. I to, went on those BS Ana blogs and started cutting to them extreme. I lost my friends but I honestly didn't care. I wouldn't eat unless forced to. For some reason through all this audacity, through my silent pleads, my mother thought it was a stage.   &amp;#x200B;  Here I am, in my teens diagnosed 4 years ago but I feel like it was too late. I've been to a few doctors and a clinic for Anorexia but honestly, this mentality that I need to be thinner- to count everything- is so deeply ingrained within my being. I wish I wasn't like this. I wish I stopped. It's not a phase, it never was just a 'phase'.",False,False

I had D-cup boobs in 5th grade and was being hit hard by puberty much earlier than my classmates, and everyone treated me like a fat monster.   Mom told me about how she had had an eating disorder when she was a teenager as a cautionary tale, but all it did was validate the ideas that I'd been thinking: doing eating or throwing up what I ate would make me lose weight. My mom and I would do diets together, and she didn't know that I'd binge and purge in secret.   Both my mother and my grandmother have eating disorders, so if there's a genetic component I probably inherited it. Disordered relationships with food are all I ever knew growing up, and the rise of proana circles definitely didn't help.",False,False

I hate younger me for glorifying it and actively seeking out information to just sink deeper into this disorder. Its sad when you look back and realized that dieting was a childhood activity.,False,False
