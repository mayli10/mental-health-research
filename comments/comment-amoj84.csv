Am I doing it in secret? That’s a big sign. Am I using the food as a drug, consuming as much as possible and riding the high?  I just ask myself, “is this closer to a regular meal or injecting heroin?” And that’s how I tell if I binged. ",False,False

I categorize a binge as a period of time where I eat an unplanned amount of food while feeling out of control, or at least where I feel out of control after the fact.  Sometimes it’s only 500 calories, other times it’s in the thousands.  ",False,False

To date my biggest help has been eating enough (ugh fuck that amirite) and the book Brain over Binge, but I’ve not been able to beat the habit long term, just some weeks at a time...which is probably because I restrict too much.  In case you’re not familiar with the book, I’d really recommend getting it, even better the workbook (!) or looking for the PDF online, there’s also a free podcast. Personally I got the free trial audiobook of the first book she wrote on audible  and then bought the workbook. The basis of the book is kind of „you have control over you’re hands so you don’t have to stuff your face“, which, honestly, sounds really dumb and like missing the point completely, but the author explains it really well and even though I haven’t had „the ultimate success“ of never binging again yet, I have had longer periods of time without binging and I gives me the hope to one day be binge free, without always having to restrain myself or have all my emotions in control.

I feel so much guilt and shame after the fact, like I should just put my pants on the right way and walk away from the box of chocolate and second pint of ice cream, but in the moment there is no rational thought.  There is only disgust and misery as I look at that trigger food and know I am going to eat it.  I am going to eat all of it.  And then probably purge and repeat and hate myself.  It’s humbling and I don’t know how to interrupt that cycle but have mused around the idea of implementing a self check where I either write in a dedicated journal what my food intention is for the sake of making myself actively accountable or finding someone I can reach out to when that urge hits to interrupt.",False,False

Though I’ll rarely count a number &lt;1000 as a binge, not every time I eat more than I should is a binge to me because overeating is also a thing. If I feel out of control and a strong urge to eat beyond reason, then it’s a binge imo. But that also means if I eat like thousands and thousands of calories then it’s more or less automatically a binge, no one should eat multiples of their TDEE in one sitting lmao. 2500 isn’t necessarily a binge, but that’s for you to decide.  Also I really laughed at your title because I thought it was a shitpost like „is 2.5 calories a binge??!?“ in case you don’t know, kcal is still a normal calorie, we just usually shorten it in speech :)",False,False
