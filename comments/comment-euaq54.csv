I imagine that’s the case then yeah, I’ll maybe have to adjust my posture too since I’m sitting at a chair a lot for work. I am “trying” to gain weight but, yknow. Thanks friend!",False,True

No matter how low your body fat is you still have multiple layers of cells protecting your outer skin layer from your bones. Having said that... it might be that your protruding spine is causing your outer skin layer to jut out and rub against your clothes/be more exposed and thus more irritated. When I was very thin I used to get bruises along my spine because of not having a fat layer to protect from the pressure. Make sure you stay hydrated. Sleep on your front or side or side if you can. We both know the real solution is to eat a balanced diet and gain weight. But we also both know it’s not that simple.,False,False
