I rarely eat out of hunger anymore nowadays but rather I’m almost always in it just for the taste, since I do really love food and cooking. So when a good tasting meal I've been planning for days comes to an end I get so weirdly sad about it freak out about savoring the last bite to the maximum. If my last bite is perfect I can usually end the whole eating experience on a positive note, but if it's disappointing I get so salty about it and wish I could re-do the whole meal. I always feel like such a weirdo picking through my food to find the perfect bite/piece to save for last lol",False,True

When I get to the end of a meal and know that after I consume those last calories anything else I eat would be cheating I hate to end it,False,False

I always leave something on the plate even though I weigh it out and count the calories for all of it. It just makes me feel like I have self control to leave something.,False,False

People think im quirky and i just eat the best parts i like or maybe that I eat intuitively but truthfully my mind hates eating all of something. Because then i know i really ate the whole thing. Although if i portion something out and I know all the calories in it i dont really have this problem.,False,False
