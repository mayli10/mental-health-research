I definitely think my friend is awesome-- I just wish I didn't binge and purge yesterday. If I hadn't, I would have been fine today.  Unfortunately in terms of whether or not my classmates noticed me sucking in/my stomach in general-- I go to an acting school, and we were doing the repetition exercise. Meaning, my partner and I stand across from each other and announce to the class facts about what the other person is doing/feeling. I don't think anyone thinks it's anything more than me just crossing my arms over my stomach, but it was definitely noticed AND announced to the class that I was doing it :(",False,True

It sounds very stressful and I can totally relate to being unable to perform at school/work due to being super uncomfortable with what I'm wearing. I'm betting that no one in your class noticed you sucking in or even thought to look at your stomach. As for your friend, it sounds like her heart is in the right place, but it totally sucks to have your eating habits made a topic of discussion. You're not worthless, you deserve to do whatever you please, fuck what other people think is right for you. Just stay safe and take care. &lt;3",False,False
