Da hell am I supposed to do with this lame super power. I also don't have the ability to barf like at all no matter what. I didn't even vomit when I ODed on caffeine. When I get sick and it feels like I might throw up I will try my hardest to but nothing comes up. Gonna suck the day I get poisoned from something and I can't use barfing to try and expel the poison.,False,False
