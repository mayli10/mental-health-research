I like to google recipes and then only use the spices. I usually make 1 liter at a time, put it in a thermos and sip on it every time I get a craving. The whole liter usually is around 50 calories depending on the type of broth/bouillon I use and how diluted I make it.  Faux chili con carne: Beef broth, cumin, marjoram, cayenna, smoked paprika.  Faux curry: Chicken/veggie broth, curry powder, cayenna, fresh grated ginger and garlic. Maybe a splash of low-fat coconut milk if I'm feeling raunchy.  Faux mushroom soup: Mushroom broth, nutmeg, four peppercorn blend.  Faux veggie soup: Veggie broth, vegetable seasoning.  Faux chicken soup: Chicken broth, chicken seasoning, celery salt, paprika.  Faux noodles: Chicken/veggie broth, soy sauce/fish sauce/oyster sauce, cayenna.  etc.",False,False

I would drink it as a way to control cravings/prevent midday snacking when I was training myself to do OMAD. The first few weeks were rough in the afternoon (my OMAD was dinner). The warmth and savory flavor and a little bit of salt did wonders and wasn’t enough to technically break a fast from a glucose/insulin standpoint. ,False,False
