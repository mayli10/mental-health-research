EDs are so isolating and oftentimes can make you feel like you‚Äôre strange and different from everyone else, so having a place to talk about what I‚Äôm experiencing with other people who ‚Äúget it‚Äù is amazing. I understand why it wouldn‚Äôt be for everyone, but I don‚Äôt feel particularly competitive with/triggered by other people in this sub so for me it‚Äôs purely helpful.",False,False

Nobody in my real life other than my therapist knows about my eating disorder and I even downplay it to her because I‚Äôm embarrassed so this helps me feel like I‚Äôm less alone and gives me things I can relate to.,False,False

I havent left to focus on recovery because it would be like forgetting a large part of who I was for the past 2 years. I dont think there was a day i didnt check this subreddit since I first found it.,False,False

I think this sub is comforting, and has been super supportive. I love the meme page we have most of all. It helped me to feel not alone, which is great because ed is such a secretive thing. The unhelpful thing, though, is, since we all have an ed here, ed gets normalized because we're all talking about it and its a part of all of our lives on this sub. It makes it easy to forget that in the real world, ed is not super common and talked about out loud. Also I noticed that I was on this sub a lot more when i was really struggling as opposed to now, when I am 6 months into recovery (still struggling sometimes) but idk if that means that this sub was helpful or influential. I think mostly helpful for me.",False,False

Sometimes I just need to talk a lot about this stuff in a private place. I'd have the same feelings/reactions even if I weren't here, and a lot of the supportive/insightful comments stick with me.
