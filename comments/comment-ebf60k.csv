All of it just hurts my brain and I try really hard to be “normal,” just for the holiday.   Otherwise I do feel guilty not eating the food my family members have prepared, especially my grandma’s bread that she makes.  Something that helps me with binge eating at these things, where food seems infinite, is saving food for other family who really wants it.  Or leftovers for who really wants it.  It’s easy to tune into my compassion, so this mental talk helps me, and I don’t often really want food.   It’s ironic how difficult it is to try and be normal.  Takes so much brain power.  Good luck to you.",False,False
