If your body is healthy at a BMI of 16-17, itâ€™s much more conceivable that youâ€™d be alive at an even lower bmi, compared to someone whoâ€™s already unhealthy at BMI 17",False,False

I specialled people with eating disorders when they canme into a medical unit for refeeding. One lady was around 43 years old, and had suffered from a NSTEMI and had significant heart damage. She had a history of anorexia for 3 years after a traumatic incident. She was incredibly sick.  I think of her often and hope she survived.  But really you can be a ""normal"" weight  and still need an ICU. Sometimes the bloods and neuro signs are so fucked up and for others they aren't.  It's so weird like that.",False,False

Some of the absolutely emaciated, extremely low patients who *looked* like they were about to die were seemingly functional and I was so shocked? I felt rude to be shocked but also like it was justified. Some of them were not though. They were just their EDs and it was heartbreaking.",False,False

I certainly can't tell a 16 from a 17 in person, and would have no idea about what a 12 even looks like, and I'm not googling to find out.",False,False

Or theyâ€™re bodies can just naturally survive better/longer in those extreme underweight conditions? Idk tbh. But I wonder about it all the time.,False,False

I saw someone here say BMI of 11 and I seriously looked it up to see if thatâ€™s even a liveable BMI. I canâ€™t imagine how my body would react to that.,False,False
