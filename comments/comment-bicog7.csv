Please please try and get some help. This disorder is not worth your life. The number on the scale will never be low enough, so if you keep going it will not end well. And each low number will not bring you true happiness. There is so much more to life than the reflection in the mirror. There is so much more to live for. I know it seems life will begin when you're attractive/thin/pretty/good enough, but it won't. Life is now, this is it, please don't waste your life trying to get to the point where you think you'll finally be enough.  Because you are enough now. You are worth it. You are worth living, and you are worth loving. There are people who want you and need you in their lives, they don't see your flaws, they see you for you. The number of the scale is not going to fix flaws or make life better.   I know it feels shit and I know it feels endless and hopeless but you are not alone in this. And you can get through it. You are enough and you are so much more than what you see in the mirror or the number on the scale, and you can find true happiness beyond that. I really hope you find it. ðŸ’• Stay safe and stay strong",False,False
