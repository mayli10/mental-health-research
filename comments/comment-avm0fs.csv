It’s such a double standard. You can say “you’re too thin” but you sure as hell couldn’t say “you’re too fat.” Whenever people tell me I need to gain weight, I just nervously laugh but in my head I’m saying “yeah well you need to lose weight.” It really shouldn’t be ok to comment on anyone’s weight.
