Paining is amazing, hey you know what here’s an idea I did recently..I went for a walk and found some nice pebbles and painted them with Silly stuff like smiley faces and teddy bears and then went for another walk and hid them about the place, someone would find them and have a nicer day because of it..hopefully. Got me out on two walks and I felt like I had done something worthwhile (in a tiny way) so i didn’t feel quite as much like the peice of shit my brain likes to tell me I am.   I hope you end up having an okay day..its alright to feel like shit what we are dealing with is *really really hard* as much as we can joke and like the parts that feel okay there’s alot to having an ED that’s lonely and hurts, give yourself a hug babe, you deserve it for being so tough to put up with all this xx",False,False

You’re right though, I guess it makes me feel better when I punish myself which is such a strange sentence to type out haha.   I’m gonna paint and listen to music and hope to god I don’t end up self-harming over this :/  best of luck to you bb &lt;3",False,True

Yeah, sometimes you don’t, sometimes you have fantastic robot like self control too I’ll bet! And it take so much effort to wield that self control you eventually crack and do stuff like each a pack of biscuits   We just gotta accept it is what it is instead of beating ourselves up after the fact, we have disorders, this doesn’t mean we have to pile on top of that difficulty and beat ourselves up if we step outside of our self made lines and rules   I hope that comes across okay, I’m totally not trying to be mean to you but if you think of it In a purely logical way rather than emotional then yep it kinda is what it is and beating yourself up over it will just make you feel more shitty  You need hugs and love instead! Fuck it, what’s done is done, go get a mani or a massage or go rock climbing or whatever your jam is   Don’t let one moment today spoil allll the other moments please .. trust me we have pretty much all been there, done that a thousand times and sat surrounded by crumbs and shame   You are not alone",False,False
