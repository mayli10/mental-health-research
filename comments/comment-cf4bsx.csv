But I don't know if it's a hot summer where you are, if so I would double that. Also if you are working out hard your body does retain water a lot from that. I can have days where I fast and run ten miles and will gain half a pound even though I know I have lost obviously, because your muscles need to repair and your body holds onto water for that. You'll probably get a big whoosh any day now though because you are obviously losing, would be impossible not to.",False,False

Are you drinking a lot of water? I usually drink a gallon a day and if I ever feel off have a teaspoon of salt.,False,False

Try drinking some broth or coconut water maybe?,False,False
