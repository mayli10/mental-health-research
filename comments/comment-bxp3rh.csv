I can’t binge on something that is apart of my ‘health plan,’ because if I do, it’s officially off limits. I had this problem with peanut butter and banana for awhile, but only if there was bread in the house. On their own I’m fine, because I consider both healthy.",False,False

I've binged on steamed broccoli till I was in extreme pain a few times. Raw veggie binges suck. I would still binge when I was more orthorexia, but I would binge on all clean/healthy foods. Literally no food is safe. Bingeing on things like plain lentils is actually very enjoyable. And of course I have chicken, rice, corn, steak, etc. binges. Ohhh, and fruitttt. I was vegan for a year (high carb for a time) and I'd binge on soooo much fruit. I love bananas. I hate that I binge on them. Mangoes are amazing too. I love bingeing on frozen mango. Also, protein bars are literally a preferred binge food for me. Like, they're often as good of a binge food as things like donuts are for me.  The only food that is sad from bingeing is food that I literally cannot tolerate. For instance, I hate nachos. The thought of the cheese makes me sick. I won't binge on them either, thank god.  But no, if I can eat it, I can binge on it.",False,False

I actually managed to emotionally eat a whole raw red onion once. My mouth was on fire and my eyes were pouring and I felt like I was dying but o kept going bc you know, brain is fucked. But I told myself, never again, never will I eat raw onion like that ever again lol.  Probably not the answer you were looking for but hahahah.",False,False

Not only do I find it mildly revolting, but I always make way too much and force myself to finish it.   That's the only thing I keep in the house too - when faced with the choice of eating it or restricting, the latter wins most of the time.",False,False

But yeah I mean I love soup, and I love cucumbers with hot sauce or light ranch dressing, and I love salad.... but I can't binge on any of those things. I can only binge on pizza or French fries or chips and dip or cookies or brownies.",False,True

I have had a huge bag of almonds in my cupboard for over a year. I'll eat almonds if they're salted or in a trail mix, but not on their own. I've never touched them during a binge, not even when I was desperately hungry/going through extreme hunger. But if I had a bag of cashews or peanuts? Would def have binge potential.  I've binged on carrots before :/ That one was weird.",False,False

Soup too, I guess, but that’s just because I don’t like it very much most of the time lol",False,False
