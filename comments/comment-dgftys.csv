So it‚Äôs really important to see who sponsored the study you‚Äôre reading and what their financial interests are, because even when it‚Äôs science from a university it may not be unbiased.   Then the other part is understanding what the study is actually asking.  Is intuitive eating ‚Äúbetter‚Äù than fasting?  It depends on what you mean. Calorie restriction and/or fasting can be beneficial to the immune system of healthy weight individuals who fast for a week once every three months. Intuitive eating (I‚Äôm guessing) improves the mental health of people who struggle with restrictive eating disorders, but likely doesn‚Äôt impact the immune system at all, and may have detrimental effects for people who struggle with chronic overeating. So you need to understand 1) what the study is asking and 2) if/how it applies to you.   THEN you have to look at the research methods. Are there reasons this study could be compromised?  Nutritional studies tend to be more unreliable than other scientific studies because they frequently rely on self-reporting of intake and people are notorious liars. So that makes things complicated.  And after all of that you should still look at meta-analyses or studies to see which methods regularly come out in the scientific data as being most effective most frequently for the particular question you‚Äôre asking.     That‚Äôs not even a complete answer of why nutritional science is complicated for the average person to understand, but it gives a general picture. And then the average person isn‚Äôt usually reading the actual studies at all- typically they‚Äôre reading a buzzfeed article based on a New York Times article based on the abstract of an academic journal article summarising the journal article that can only be published if it has positive results (i.e. the hypothesis was proven), based on whatever happened in the actual study, and the research scientists involved are incentivised to publish as much as possible, so that also complicates how data is created and what types of data are being researched.   I used to work in a lab that focused on the health benefits of fasting, so as you may have gathered this is a topic I‚Äôm personally very frustrated about.",False,False

One may be the right diet for most or at least for some but how do I know apart from trial and error with the risk to further ruin my health? Also I was never sure whether a specific diet is not for me or I did something wrong. Questions over questions... üò¶  I went vegan for a few months and surely did not do it right. I ate way less fresh food and calories than I should have. I actually felt good though until I craved dairy and it is hard to be vegan if your family knows about your ED... Intuitively, I would say a plant based diet is the right one for me since I never really liked meat or fish, did not crave it either. Maybe my body wants to tell me something?",False,False
