I never quite got to enjoy my other outfits because I hated my body and spent most of my time indoors wallowing and wailing on the settee like a modern-day Miss Havisham/a malnourished, apple-devouring goblin, and I sincerely hope that whoever finds them at my local charity shop will derive much more pleasure from them than I ever did.  I've also been watching a lot of Tabitha Farrar videos and have been trying ti spend more time on the hobbies I'd been neglecting when I was too busy counting calories &amp; pacing up and down the bread aisle. Another thing that has helped me stay on course has been reaching out to friends and family: while I'm not exactly recovered, I try to be frank about my feelings and crack a lot of (dark and morbid) ED jokes to externalise some of my craziest ED thoughts and see them for what they are. When there is no one to reach out to, I write in my journal &amp; do my best to shut up my ED, whom I've been referring to as great-aunt Barbara, by telling the batshit crazy crone to eat a peanut butter sandwich and chill the fuck out.  DBT, CBT, and self-compassion exercises have also proven to be somewhat helpful!",False,False
