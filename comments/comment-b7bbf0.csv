But just a warning the only downside is an ~earthy~ taste which is extremely tolerable but a little strange at first, and if you don’t drink it fast enough it does turn into sort of a gel which is also tolerable but a little weird to get used to. But I use it as just preventative measure and to keep regular even when I’m eating nothing but bread and cheese :) ",False,False

Amazon can get it to you by tomorrow, I personally like the Organic India brand. It has actually helped so much with my IBS, no matter what end of the spectrum I’m on that week. It’s sooooo much more gentle than laxatives and doesn’t dehydrate you! I take it everyday sometimes twice its even good for ur heart kinda miraculous tbh",False,False

Sounds like you've done basically everything besides lax. I know that miralax is super gentle and in your case, it's not a lax abuse because you havent had a BM in days. Just be sure to take a regular dose and follow all the instructions for how long to space out doses if the first doesnt work   Good luck!",False,False
