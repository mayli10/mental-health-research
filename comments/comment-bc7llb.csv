For some reason the thought of it only being the heart rate made me feel like I was falling through a hole in the universe or something and this has righted me.,False,False

You burn more calories while doing cardio because you are doing a ton of mechanical work/expending lots of energy. Your heart rate rises as a *result* of this work because your cells need more oxygen to do whatever the fuck it is they do.,False,False
