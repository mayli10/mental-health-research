I had a heart attack when I was 17 (BMI 19 or so). I was also in the ER for several days because of low blood sugar (BMI 24). I had bad orthostatic hypotension for a while, and had me in ED inpatient (BMI 17). Besides that, I have constant heart palpitations, horrible teeth, and gastroparesis.",False,False

My enamel is semi fucked from purging (went from never having had a cavity to having 1-2 almost every time I go to the dentist, plus chipped a tooth) but apparently it‚Äôs not as bad as they‚Äôd expect from someone with a long term ED. Although the last time I went the dentist commented that my enamel is quite worn, even though I mostly stopped purging 7 years ago.  I thought my heart was fucked at one point but apparently that was just anxiety.  I have some digestive issues but not entirely sure if those are ED related or just part of getting older.  I honestly haven‚Äôt had a whole lot of physical consequences from my ED even though I‚Äôve been at it for 14+ years (and emaciated for many of those years). Makes me feel simultaneously smug (all those doctors were wrong, I was right, and I/my body can withstand so much more than other people) and also like a complete failure and fraud (if I was *really* anorexic I should be dead by now so obviously I‚Äôm really just a fat fraud).",False,False

I had a series of comprehensive tests done just under a year ago at the insistence of my doctor. Results came back with just a couple of vitamin deficiencies, for which I am now taking supplements.   I stopped getting my period when I started birth control, so I don‚Äôt know if I would still have it otherwise.   There is a pretty significant chance I‚Äôve developed a heart condition since those tests.",False,False

Even if I'm in a binge phase I have very slow and uncomfortable digestion. I have terrible circulation, my feet and shins go purple/blue. I can't crouch without seeing stars and feeling faint. For the first couple years of ED I was relatively okay but after that it's been terrible when I get anywhere near underweight I can't walk up stairs without feeling like I'm going to faint. Every time I restrict I get palpitations constantly and I become a horrible person. I have issues with lax. The foods I eat tend to be of high nutritional value and I do maintain my weight more or less, I take vitamins and probiotic supplements but the strain I put on my body through this ED still takes a toll. If I get into a bad binge phase, even tho I don't purge, my mouth will get vomit in it if I bend over. The health professionals aren't lying to you, restricting what your body naturally needs will catch up with you eventually. Your ED will persuade you that nothing is wrong with your physical health even if there is. I fully believed I was fine awhen I was first experiencing these symptoms. I'm not tryna be a dick but this is my experience and EDs are something that will never lead to a positive outcome.",False,False
