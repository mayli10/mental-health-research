I probably back in the overweight category. Oh well. I had 5 months of really good restriction last year starting around this time so I’ll just start now and do even better.   WARNING: SELF HARM   Oh also I’ve relapsed into self harm tonight. The last time was thanksgiving but the time before that was 6+ months. And the time before that was also months. This may have been my worst session ever. It definitely is in terms of number or cuts made but maybe not in other terms idk.  ,False,True
