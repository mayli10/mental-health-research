I had about 7 lbs to lose to fit into it. I gained like 10 instead. Had to beg a seamstress to let out half an inch. Couldn’t eat the whole day. If anyone is reading this- you might hate the size but god damn if it’s a special event just buy the dress that fits. Better to wear a bigger size that fits than look tragic in a smaller size.,False,False
