I just feel like I will go on a crazy binge and end up gaining more weight if I don't allow myself to eat at least of a little bit of the stuff I'm craving.

I don’t care at all about the nutrition of my food. Well, that’s not true. I care a little, and I try and pay attention if I’m lacking anywhere. But like... I am so much more preoccupied with coming under a (pretty arbitrary and probably not even accurate) calorie count than I am about going over my daily allowance of fat or sugar or whatever.   I eat a lot of veggies so I probably do okay, but it’s because they tend to be low calorie and high volume. I probably get less protein because it’s calorie dense and I’d usually rather eat something else, tho I do acknowledge protein keeps me full longer.   I think where this is at its peak for me is when I choose sugar free sweeteners consistently over real sugar, LOL. I know some of those aren’t good for me but hell... it was 9.9 calories",False,False
