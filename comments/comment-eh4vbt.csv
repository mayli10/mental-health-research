My brain just starts craving food and I give in.   I was never someone who exercised to burn specific calories, just restricted, but the last 3 days I have. Every little helps when you overeat lol.   I’m so paranoid about weight gain as well. I’m sorry you’re dealing with this too. It sucks!",False,True

Except I haven’t been counting calories. Everyday I have an updated plan for what I eat. Always ranges from 0-600. I screw it up everyday and end up eating a bunch of food. Not enough to be considered a binge. But I get scared that I’m going to. At least I exercised yesterday. Everyday, it starts “well because of yesterday I can’t eat today.” I’ve gained weight and I can’t get the weight off because I keep eating. I’m not obese or overweight but I still hate myself and want to loose weight.",False,False
