I don't have to binge if I have an urge, so I firmly tell myself ""no, think about it. Do you want to binge and not make any progress? Of course not"" and then I brush my teeth or chew gum and do something with my hands",False,False

Usually works better mid binge, and especially if I say I'll eat more than I would in a normal calorie counting day.",False,False

So I'm not deciding in the moment what to eat. Also I saw an Instagram post the other day that said. ""Losing weight is hard and being fat is hard, choose your hard."" Unknown not every one who binges is fat but thinking about that has helped me.",False,False

The only thing a binge will actually *solve* is get rid of the urge you had to binge. That’s it. Like you said, everything else stays the same or even gets worse because, surprise! You’re probably angry at yourself about bingeing on top of everything else.",False,False

It's not inevitable that I'll eat the food. I don't HAVE to, nothing is forcing me. It's entirely my choice. And if I know I'm gonna have the same problems after the binge that I had before the binge, only exacerbated by the guilt, I generally avoid binge eating.",False,False
