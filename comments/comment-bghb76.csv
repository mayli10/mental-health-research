It’s awkward and uncomfortable. I imagine it’s offensive and hurtful for those who don’t have one or maybe even are self conscious of being too skinny.

Somewhere between normal eating and dieting exists dieting, crash dieting, etc. they are disordered behaviors but not inherently an eating disorder. Most people throughout their life, especially if they have a health crisis or attempt to find that healthy medium with eating, end up under-eating for a bit. It’s a journey to find a dietary pattern that works for you.   Diets are becoming more and more common, as are as campaigns trying to profit off of insecurity and being body conscious- id argue that having self esteem and body image issues are the norm now in society.   When these things become pathologies is when they begin to risk somebody’s health/wellbeing, impact their ability to function, or impact their ability to have normal stable reactions. So as online users we cannot alone determine if somebody underweight and dieting has an eating disorder, no more than we can determine if somebody who we see have a drink in a bar is a alcoholic.   Yes - sometimes it’s most likely beyond a reasonable doubt somebody with an eating disorder in denial - I’ve thought that about many girls I’ve seen post online. But does that they (1) surely have an ED or (2) that it’s my place to say something? No. Because it’s none of my business unless they want to talk about it, and it’s very easy to simply take a diet too far.   I’ve commented before about this, as every time a celebrity talks about having body image issues and dieting people here assume that it’s an ED. Could it be? Yes. Is there a high probability l that it’s an ED? Yes. Should we assume it’s one because of that information alone? No.   There definitely is an element of projection, but I also think that being forced to be hyper aware of food, we also become hyper aware of others intakes, the things society suggests, and the ways in which dieting occurs. I think being sensitive is a more accurate description but merely my experience. :)",False,False

A lot of people who practice disordered eating start off as healthy dieters but fuck up their relationship with food, and start relying on the praise they got from weight loss, not realizing how far they slip until it's too late. And this isn't me projecting- the NEDA reports that about a quarter of all ""normal dieters"" develop an eating disorder. And in a culture that praises unhealthy thinness and there's whole diet sub-cultures of putting food into ""bad"" categories, you'd be surprised at the amount of  disordered eating habits that start becoming normalized- and even praised.

The line isn't for us to draw.  I see it as the same difference between partying occasionally and binge drinking and alcoholism. One is socially acceptable and normal, one is concerning and may point to issues, and one is a diagnosed psychological condition. The lines are blurry and it's ridiculous that we keep pointing fingers and saying ""THEY have the same problem as me, in my opinion. judge THEM and not ME because at least I admit it"".",False,True

Fasting also isn't usually a disorder thing.   But aside from that, where do you draw the line when an underweight person is trying to lose weight, or someone thinks they're fat and ugly (or that others are, even) until their bmi is 18.5?why are they allowed to feel these things and not be labeled disordered, yet those of us here are diagnosed and urged to stop and gain weight? Where do you draw the line? Why can't I have a bmi of 18.5 and eat completely clean and just be considered strong and beautiful rather than sick?",False,False
