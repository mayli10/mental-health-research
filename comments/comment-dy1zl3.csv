It takes so much effort to get help that isn’t even relevant half the time. I seriously hope that your doctor can find you something that will work for you.  I ask my GP to refer me to a psychologist 6 months ago, and she still hasn’t found anyone who will take me. Meanwhile my psychiatrist is more than happy to pump me full of drugs and send me on my way without so much as asking how my days been lmao. Sorry for the rant I’m just so fed up with everything. We deserve better.",False,False

I've attempted recovery so often, my mom still thinks I'm doing great but I don't live at home. I can't tell her about my fast or one time purge last week, it will break her and she will force things upon me that will only make me worse.  I went to see a doctor a few months ago and she signes me up for a treatment plan, but i couldn't get treatment for another couple of months, so i canceled. Treatment would only be 6-8 months, and i KNOW i need more than that. I need to see her again for other options.",False,True

Recovery is an incredibly complicated and personal process, and you don’t have to do anything drastic if you’re not comfortable with it at the moment, but even just vaguely mentioning to somebody that you want to try andwork through some issues, means that youve got an advocate in your corner, even if they don’t 100% know whats going on, they can keep an eye out for you while you figure out what you need to do. Hopefully this makes sense, I’m pretty sleepy right now haha",False,False
