I've been on the same pill for nearly two years and didn't have any withdrawal bleeding until recently, so I didn't care.  But it's been getting heavier and heavier (and so have I...which is why I'm convinced it's related to my weight), and this month I actually had some breakthrough bleeding too.  So I think I will talk to my gynecologist and see if she has any suggestions.  Thanks for the motivation :)",False,False

It's the active pills that do the job of protecting bone density/other consequences of low hormone levels indicated by amenorrhea - the bleeding itself is only a sign of health in natural cycles.
