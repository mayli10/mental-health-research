It was so sore that it hurt to talk, swallow, or purge. Everytime, I purged, it would prolong my sore throat and make the pain even worse the next day. At one point, I would be in tears from the pain. I was frustrated in moments I couldn‚Äôt throw up but there was nothing I could do about it. After a few weeks still with a painful sore throat, my desire to binge and purge was weaning. I didn‚Äôt think about food too much because well I physically wasn‚Äôt able to eat much nor throw up. By Christmas time, I made a New Years Resolution to stop purging completely (at least for a year.) the first three days of 2020, I had urges but they weren‚Äôt as strong. My throat got better, and I felt better (mentally) as well. On the fourth day on, I ate until I didn‚Äôt feel like eating (my binging had shrunk and I had no urge to purge.)    I really don‚Äôt have any advice as none ever worked for me. But that‚Äôs what happened to me.",False,True
