That seems fairly common sense. I'm sorry that happened to you, and I hope it doesn't deter you from continuing your journey. If you're able to, I hope you can find a nutritionist who has lots of experience in treating those recovering from EDs who would know not to trigger you.  If it helps, once when I was much younger I went to a therapist for my body image issues. As I was sobbing about how I hated my body, especially my midsection/belly, she proceeded to tell me: 1) that i looked fine and I had nothing to worry about, but 2) if i was that concerned I could just do some ab exercises to slim me down! And she proceeded to demonstrate such an exercise.  Obviously she was a shit therapist. But I left the encounter crying even harder, triggered, with my mom saying, ""if you're going to leave therapy like this, then what's the point?"", which left me with a negative aspect towards therapy for years to come. My point is, a bad medical professional can do so much damage, but you just have to say ""fuck them"" and try to keep moving on however you can.",False,False
