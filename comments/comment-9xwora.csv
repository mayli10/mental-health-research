I have a vegan friend who is beautiful and I envy her. Her hand and wrist bones stick out and her face is so clear and her pants always fall a little because she’s so insanely skinny. It’s awful to say but when I hang out with her I eat 75% less than usual because she’s literal goals.   I’ve gained lbs even though I’ve been eating healthier. And not purging. I’ve gotta try drinking a monster and skipping meals few x a week. I’m desperate. Alexa.....,False,False
