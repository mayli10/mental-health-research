It's either I spend a ton on binge food at convenience stores or fast food, or I buy a ton of low cal/healthy/low carb shit. Either way I eat them all within a week so I just gain/lose the same few pounds every week. Wtf am I even doing with my life???",False,False

I want it, I feel like I need it and whatever crap I'm dealing with will somehow feel better once I have it. But then its mindless eating it, and just feel bad after. Then in percieved moments of 'clarity' I'm trying to make up for the shit with hyper nutrition super food, vitamins, nourishment .. but then I start thinking about calories, restrict to select foods, rinse, repeat.",False,False

It ties into my OCD, so if I spend ""too much"" I'll have intense guilt and anxiety over it for days. I used to buy a ton of specialty low-cal foods and shit, but now I can hardly bring myself to pay for a cup of black coffee.  It makes being forced to do treatment that much works. This is thousands of dollars wasted on a lost cause. I wish everyone would just accept that I can't recover and stop wasting so much time and money on me.",False,False

I can't tell him the truth (I just say I'm lazy), but I like that it's easier for me to calculate my calories with these single portion foods. One of my close friends who I food shop with relatively often doesn't understand why, even though I'm a poor student, I always buy big brands and not the supermarket own brand. I buy Heinz spaghetti hoops, Weight Watchers baked beans, Halo Top ice cream etc. I say it tastes better, but in reality these are the versions with the lowest calories.   I also hoard food when I'm restricting. When I crave crisps or chocolate or biscuits I worry and obsess over them (will they be in the shops when I next get a binge day? will I be able to make it to the shops on my next binge day?) until I buy them, and stash them away in my wardrobe. I have the hugest amount of junk food in my wardrobe and it brings me so much comfort. And then on days I actually binge (approximately once a month), money is absolutely no object. If I wanna eat it, I'm buying it. I end up spending so much money I really don't have in restaurants on those days. I never get to do the normal social eating when I'm restricting, so when I binge I base all my socialising around eating out, in some desperate attempt to seem outwardly normal (I'm sure that I do not). Normally I end up so full from eating out that I can't stand even the sight or thought of all the junk food I've accumulated in my wardrobe and just give that stuff away to family and friends.   Starving myself is so hecking expensive.",False,False

A typical binge for me clocks in at â‚¬15 minimum, and I purge nearly every day. I try to eat as nutritious as I can outside of binges, buy organic etc. and it's also freaking expensive.   For February, I came up with a ""low cost binge plan"" and a cheaper general meal plan. The money aspect is really the only thing I do not like about my ED. ",False,False
