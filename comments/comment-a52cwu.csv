When I was a young teenager and still disassociating really hard and not seeking recovery he was patient and really helped me work through whatever it was I was feeling, and now that I’m weight restored my sessions mainly consist on laying on his couch and bitching about calories and he’s always been supportive of my thoughts and ideas without really affirming them. I know that my experiences aren’t typical but if you can find someone who specializes in EDs it’s completely worth it, no matter where you are in terms of your recovery or lack thereof.",False,False

I went thru like 4 different consultations and then a fucking session with this dead fish male therapist. And then I met this lady over the phone and my God I liked her immediately ( but that's how I am I either like you or don't). Had my initial first session with her and came out thinking OH MAN I REALLY LIKE HER I THINK SHE GETS IT maybe she can help me stop!   So yeah. Do it! ,False,False

I was basically only eating three chocolate chip cookies with a glass of sweet tea and working out 2+ hours every day and when I brought it up my T basically said “Uh, well, I can’t help you with that but I can refer you to someone if you want to talk about food” and we never talked about it again. This person specializes in ED and related issues, body image, and self esteem issues. Her website looks fine but I hate phone calls so I’m stressing about the consultation ",False,True

I know this isn’t rly helpful. Just make sure who you talk to is specialized in ED &amp; ED related issues or they’ll probably just blow you off",False,False
