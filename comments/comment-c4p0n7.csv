They don't stop you from absorbing the calories in the food, it doesn't stop the food being digested, and it doesn't burn ay calories or fat.     All laxatives do is clear out the passages in your bowels by filling them with water and causing everything to move along faster and pass quicker, so yes, you'll lose some water weight through the water being drawn into your bowels, and also the weight of the stool in your bowels, but it does nothing to stop calorie absorbtion or burn off calories or fat.",False,False
