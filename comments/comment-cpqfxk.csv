When I was severely underweight, I could definitely see myself as wider (mainly because I'm short), but not with an increase in the amount of body fat. I would just think my legs looked like tree stumps with a huge gap, and somehow people with wider hips and no gap had smaller thighs. But I literally can't imagine seeing actual rolls in place of smooth/flat areas. At around BMI 22 I start getting a small pooch, and at 22.5 the sides of my waist right above the hips look softer, especially in pants, so I think I can imagine it looking a LOT mushier if I had BDD but again, can't imagine roll lines of someone obese. I too wonder if one can see rolls that aren't there",False,False

Take some yarn, string, whatever, and measure out how big you think x body part is based on visuals only, so no measurements (for me, I did my waist). Then compare the perceived to the actual by putting it around that body part.  It's not perfect, but it definitely showed me how bad my dysmorphia was.
