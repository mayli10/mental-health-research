I started with Keto and omad and did multi day fasting but I find omad works for me to be the most functional for the least amount of food. When I was fat (434 lbs) (I'm 6,5 189 lbs now) I really enjoyed video games, it was all I did besides eat. I was suicidal because of how limited my life was since all I did was games and people stressed me out but I wanted friends. I decided to lose the weight in an attempt to be more normal. All I found was my never-ending drive to be small and I never found my normal. That and I can no longer focus long enough to play games anymore so that's cool.  Now I'm afraid to gain not only because of the weight gain but also to get back to my old thinking / depression. Restricting makes me kinda numb to the world. Like my only concern is work and eating only enough to be awesome at my job.  I guess I never did get to my happy normal and just traded one shitty way of life for another.   It would be nice to find myself to happy one day though but I don't see that happening without therapy and I'm not going to do that so here I sit.   TLDR/ true I wasn't happy before but there has to be a happy middle ground or something.",False,False

I have so much more self-worth and confidence when I am below a 25 bmi regardless of how much or how little I eat. Were you really happy when you were fat? I suppose many people are fat and happy. I just don't see how so many people are ok with being obese. But I digress. Have you tried intermittent fasting? One aspect I love is that because I only eat once per day (some days not all) I can usually eat whatever I want!,False,False

Like before I was fat but I had head space for other things in life. Now I just work and pass the time just existing and fighting my thoughts to go eat. I'll have to fight the pull to just eat literally till the day I die to keep this up. It's just depressing thinking that my options are be fat and possibly happy or be skinny and a shell of my old self.,False,False

Yes it totally sucks that food is constantly on my mind, and that I'll never be able to eat like a 'normal' person. But when I stop focusing on food and try to act 'normal' I always gain weight. I've realized I'll never be 'normal' and that I'd rather obsess about food than be fat.",False,False
