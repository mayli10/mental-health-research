I had to quit a wage job to focus on school for a bit, should've done that sooner, there is no way even if I got 110s on exams to pass some of my courses .  Couldn't wake up for classes most days this semester, couldn't focus on work nor school. Pretty unhappy about this semester honestly maybe if I get to my goal weight and I can do maintenance throughout the spring semester I'll be a lot better.",False,False

I actually took 9 weeks ish of leave but I’m seriously thinking of taking it...  My company was pretty supportive and I’m grateful but I don’t think I could do it again as easily because we have a bunch of big launches lined up so it’s also personally harder for me to leave work,False,False

For fun I like to knit and just be outdoors since I live in the beautiful state of CO. When I'm restricting I just feel like a heap of flesh.
