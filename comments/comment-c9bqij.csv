It was a mix of no food, and lack of sleep. Sleep deprivation fucks your brain up so bad in a very short amount of time, and not eating makes it even harder to sleep. I was really jumpy and afraid all the time. I saw things move in my peripheral vision, like chairs and black fingers. And after eating better for a while in attempted recovery I stopped feeling that way. I've never had issues with paranoia or delusions or hallucinations before, and never since. It was terrifying, and I'm afraid that I'll experience that again. I think mine was mostly caused by lack of sleep from restricting, and already existing PTSD. I would suggest getting some kind of sleeping medication every now and then from a doctor. Just when it gets really bad, to help your mind recover a bit and slow the descent into madness. I found that the biggest symptom/side effect of anorexia was the fear. A weird, consuming lack of safety. Please be safe and don't let it get too bad before doing something about it. Even if it's just taking some Valium to sleep or some extra multivitamins, or some passionfruit juice bed (it makes you sleepy) plus nutrients. I know how hard it is to do those things though.",False,False

Like it makes me woozy and then I get even less aware of reality and even more paranoid :( Iâ€™ve taken ambien before when not restricting and I feel like the effects would be even worse haha. do u experience anything similar w your sleeping pills?,False,True

Itâ€™s the bodies way of trying to get you up and eat food. It makes you alert and stuff going as when we used to live in the wild itâ€™s mother natureâ€™s way of getting you to go forage and look for food.   Forgot the chemical that is released but it makes you alert and sort of gives you energy to get food,False,False
