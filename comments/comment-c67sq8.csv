Maybe that has changed though, so I‚Äôm not sure! And obviously if looking at recovery instas would be triggering then disregard this comment haha.  Good luck with recovery!",False,False

But after so many years and it just keeps coming back, I feel it will be much more effective to heal from the inside out. I guess that‚Äôs why it‚Äôs been slower, it‚Äôs much easier to simply gain a bunch of weight and avoid confronting the origin of the problem. But I truly believe if I focus primarily on addressing my issues the weight restore will naturally follow üôèüèΩüßòüèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è and this time I‚Äôll actually be comfortable in it too.  Finding out what the cause was (or was likely to be) is a good place to start I think, and I believe we can do it ‚ù§Ô∏è",False,False

I‚Äôve had more success than ever before in terms of emotional recovery, improving outlook/attitude, challenging thought processes and behaviors etc, but compared to previous ‚Äúrecoveries‚Äù the weight restoration is slooooow and arduous... I think it‚Äôs because previous times was only healing the surface and not from within. Guess it takes a lot longer to heal the soul. Love and support helps. Lots of determination and perseverance.
