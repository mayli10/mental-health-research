If it doesn't feel right I would stop it honestly. It's not gonna lead you on a good path in the long run anyway.",False,False

If you used a lower dose (like 3% nicotine pods if you use a juul) of nicotine in your vape and you should be fine.   I do not recommend using tobacco/vapes to help curb your appetite. I started smoking because of that, and here I am 15 years later addicted to nicotine. It's an expensive and unhealthy habit that I wish I had never started. I'm recovered from my ED, but haven't been able to kick to habit of smoking. I've been able to switch from cigs to vaping, which better for me/my lungs, but is still not healthy, nor cheap.",False,False
