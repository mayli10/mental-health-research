Blech. So I have to go with naturally caffeine free.  I love the dandelion coffee tho. It comes in a powder kinda like instant coffee and you can use more or less depending on whether you want a ""tea"" beverage all the way to an espresso strength.  Caffeine messes with sleep so much but I just love the ritual of making my coffee or tea. ",False,False
