I liked more foods than you so I tried to eat new foods in different ways of preparation and with existing foods that I do like (every bite of mushroom with rice). It's a long process so it takes some commitment and a lot of experimentation. And there are some foods that you won't like, and that's okay, but try them a few ways first before you decide for good",False,False

Do you cook for yourself? The best way to start eating more veggies is to ""hide"" them in other foods. Maybe you can make your own nachos and put in some sauteed onion or bell pepper. You could turn your oatmeal into a savory oatmeal and include some veggies and nuts. Starting out from your current liked foods will make it easier. You can add some yoghurt to your fruit salads or make a smoothie with fruit and carrots.  Expanding your palate is a long process, and you will often try something that you really, really don't like. But you should keep trying! Even if you only find 5 new things that you like, that's double of what you eat now.",False,False
