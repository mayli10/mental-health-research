Hopefully things will get less complicated as things go on. I'm rooting for you two! I'm wishing you a long and happy relationship!! I've never had a boyfriend so I have no idea what it's like cuddling with someone you have feelings for :(.  Tbh in terms of EDs I haven't been diagnosed, it's been 5 years since I've had a diagnosis and my symptoms have changed since then. I'm still on the waiting list to see a damn psychiatrist. My GP thinks I'm showing signs of binge eating disorder but he can't diagnose me so I'm still waiting you know? Oh yeah I totally know what you mean! I don't know why I feel so powerful making my body suffer by eating loads then not eating anything at all for an extended period of time. I feel like I can finally take revenge on something if that makes sense?",False,True

We were supposed to break up this summer (new LD after living together for 2.5 years, plus kids/no kids incompatibility) but we just... didnâ€™t. Even if my friends were super huggers, Iâ€™ll never replace snuggling him, and that hurts more than anything!! Itâ€™s fine of course :)))  It really, really does. Idk your diagnosis, but my psych once told me people with bulimia (like me) tend to be impulsive (like me) and then controlling to make up for it. Plus, restricting is hard! Even if you get comfy with it, most people donâ€™t fast for hours/days or live on calorie deficits, because it sucks and isnâ€™t what our bodies want to do, despite what the fasting sub tells us. Doing so feels like Iâ€™m powerful, like I can do something right, yk?",False,False

We can be friends! &lt;3  I really hope you get to see your bf more often, hugs are so underrated! I miss warm embraces and not just those quick, taps it does nothing for me. I want to be held. Yeah that's exactly what I'm going through as well!! I don't exactly have friends here but I have aquaintences that I hardly see/know and I can't call them up and ask to be held.  I'm so glad someone out there understands me. Taking back control after a binge feels really good. It feels like the only thing I can control. I can't force quick friendships and I can't teleport to my friends but I can control what eat (sometimes).",False,True

I felt every word in my chest and I am so horribly sad for you. I want to be your friend!  I said a similar thing to my long-distance BF last time we parted. I am also super touchy, and I was sad that no one was going to hug me until we saw each other again (unless I see family, but no one lives here). I have friends at my school/in my city, but I'm not close enough with anyone to hug them more than as a greeting or a goodbye.  So... I focus on what I can, which is the numbing out binging provides and the elation that restriction brings.",False,False
