I decided to not fast and try to take care of my body since i put it through hell with all this b/p stuff. Im doing it a ton which I think makes it hurt more when the longest I can go is a week but I'm going to really try and keep a healthy mindset and be nice to myself when i over eat and try not to let it turn into a binge.  tysm &lt;3,False,True

I work out more. I listen to music more. I read more. I watch more movies. I drink more (maybe don't pick up that habit though ðŸ˜… If you're gonna trade one addiction for another make it a neutral-healthy one).   i never had any luck quitting cold turkey. i've been steadily cutting back by setting maximum weekly b/p limits that grow progressively smaller.  if you can cut it out entirely from the get-go, great! but if not, maybe this could work for you too.   it's also important to remember that you deserve to stop. you're a human friggin being. how cool is that? you have a body and it's alive and it does some pretty cool shit. it needs to be healthy to keep doing that cool shit though.   keep your reasons for recovering, whatever they may be, at the front of your mind. every time i have a binge-purge urge, i remind myself that's it's ultimately interfering with my long term goals and while it will make me feel better for a hot minute i'm going to feel sick and guilty when i'm done. don't take that too far though, because it's equally important to forgive yourself when you do slip up- don't beat yourself up. it's admirable to even be tying.   also, it might sound kind of silly, but speaking kindly to yourself could make all the difference. so many times throughout the day i tell myself ""you're doing great, honey"" and that self-assurance really makes me feel stronger. i find it helpful to speak to myself in second-person when doing it because i've always had an easier time being kind to others than myself. i set little reminders on my phone that say things like ""kick some ass"" and ""be good to yourself."" seeing them every time i pick up my phone helps keep me in the right mindset.   best of luck to you &lt;3 recovery is badass.
