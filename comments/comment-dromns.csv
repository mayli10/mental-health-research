Seriously like the same numbers and height and everything. My bf said I look “too thin” But I seriously think I look like a blob. He even took a couple pictures of me and I thought “okay, maybe seeing some candid photos will make me realize how skinny I am” but no, I look seriously chubby in all of them! To think that 108 had been my original GW is fucking crazy now. I don’t know if I’ll ever be happy or if I ever think I’ll look skinny.",False,False
