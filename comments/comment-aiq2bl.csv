I have been doing it for almost a year now, and no matter how hard I try I can not stop. I constantly feel like my heart is going to explode. Once I started having terrible chest pains in class and started getting dizzy. When class was over I stood up and passed out in front of everyone. It  felt like I was about to have a heart attack. It was such a  terrible experience  I swore I would never EC stack again.. I managed to stop for about three weeks.  Overall, since I started taking bronkaid, my ED thoughts have only  intensified. I feel more out of control than ever. The sad thing is I am heavier than I was before.  I second the fact that it makes you feel so awful you end up eating just to get rid of the terrible side effects.  I know it seams like a magic solution but right now,  more than anything, I wish I could go back  in time. ",False,False

But remember that the people who did experience the really horrible effects of EC stacking are no longer around to try and talk you out of it. Those of us that are here telling you about how terrible it made us feel and how little it actually helped are the lucky ones.",False,False

Sure, it made a difference in how much energy I had for about two weeks, but then I go used to it and I was back to my normal exhausted self. Definitely not worth the risk for the return (or lack thereof).",False,False

EC stacks are NOT  a feel good drug. I’ve been taking pretty small doses and all I feel is anxious and sick and headachey all the time. And I can’t fucking sleep but it’s not even like I can stay up and be productive, I can’t focus on them. I can already tell my heart is NOT enjoying this too. Honestly I only take them bc I’m too weak to starve on my own but the effect is more mental than physical.",False,False

Feels kinda awful to be on, and tolerance builds up fast.  It's expensive, too, and I don't really need them to avoid eating. So, I stopped buying them as I didn't feel they were worth it.

EC staking can cause heart palpitations, shakiness, dizziness, nausea, scattered thoughts, and a whole slew of long-term effects including addiction. Plus, it can make you feel so sick that you get tempted to eat just to balance it out. Just drink an energy drink. It's way safer and way more effective in my experience. ",False,False
