They never mentioned my weight as an issue and I didn't bring it up (because I was/am a stupid teenager). So yeah, best advice is to *ask* them, second best advice is to maintain so you're at least as strong as you can be for surgery.",False,False

They’ll be able to evaluate the anesthesia risks in the context of your individual health. I hope the procedure goes well!    Anecdotally, I think I was near UW line when I had mine extracted. The anesthesia (don’t recall which drugs) left me very confused and with double vision for a few hours, but I had a family member minding me and it turned out fine.",False,False
