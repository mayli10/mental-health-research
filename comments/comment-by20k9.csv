Yes we can talk for days on how certain subs are lowkey disordered or have a large number of members who are disordered (whether they know or not- they may even be members of r/EDA!), but let's just focus on helping each other in our own sub.",True,False

Aside from the occasional wtf meal (looking at you bowl of chickpeas) there isn't much disordered behavior and members actively encourage getting enough food, protein, etc. It just seems like a way to be able to indulge and still maintain/lose weight.",False,True

And one of the first things I saw there was a post about a 30 day fast and nobody seemed to think that was weird. 30 days!!!! A month!!!!! Whomst the FUCK would do this? Also I can't help but think you would lose a LOT of muscle as well as fat if you're eating literally 0 grams protein for a whole fucking month. That is so fucking unhealthy I just can't asfjeiidjdjskei. And there were literally like 2 posts that didn't raise HELLA red flags. In conclusion: what the fuck. Thank you for coming to my TED Talk  It's so fucked up imagine being like ""uwu I can eat in 2 weeks halfway done!11!!!1!!!"" I can't even. I was never, at my worst, even close to being that restrictive.",False,True
