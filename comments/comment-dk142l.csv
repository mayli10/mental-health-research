Like it gives me enough of a taste of my ED and let’s me engage in it and keep it active enough without having to resort to the actual harmful ED behaviors.,False,False

I just finished “Autobiography of Red” by Anne Carson (a short novel in verse about a Greek myth, set in modern South America) and there are similar themes there with the main character having red wings and thinking of himself maybe as a monster, maybe not. Also not ED related but damn a good book. (Great to read during a heartbreak too, if you need to cry).",False,False

Lol. Such a delicate system we are. I still have fears relating foods and situatons but its more about that i know in certain situations i will feel vulnerable and be more likely to relapse. And i admit that i will probably have certain bad days that a person without an ed would never have. Learning to walk again while everyone else seems to have done so long time ago can be intimidating. But afterall we are aware of every possible outcome relating to food and disordered eating so we are the ones that can *actually* heal. Whereas an ordinary person with dieting tendencies can feel awkward and uncomfortable around food all their lives. People are bizarre and absurd. I will come to accept that fact and move on. One day. I will accept that i have a body. And that im visible in that sense,False,False

Even something so fucked up and self-destructive can be strangely alluring and stabilising in a way so it becomes really difficult to separate the real 'you' from 'it'.  And the longer you have it I guess, the worse that gets.   To recover really is a brave step because you have to take away that stabilisation and even though you know it's better for you in the long run because you can finally be free to walk again, it's a really hard and scary thing to do so it's tempting to cling onto that tripod even when it keeps you stuck. It shouldn't make sense but it somehow really does.  Well done on your recovery by the way. I'm technically in recovery too but yet here I am lol.",False,True

The most simple example is the fact that i still follow this subreddit. Its not that i have these behaviors anymore, i even dont think much about food too. But its just .. a part, a satellite of mine ? Im afraid to let go fully as if never happened cause it did. It did happen and im not so sure if i learned my lesson enough to have amnesia about this disorder.",False,False
