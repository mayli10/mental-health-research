Honestly I’m so grateful for how much my appetite decreased so I’m  little biased. There was cramping when they put it in and for about a week after. It sucked but it was something super manageable. The cramping was bad for a week and then was spotty here and there for a few months. My only complaint is that I can’t handle certain positions that allow my partner to go deeper, because he bumps into my cervix and it mushes everything. It doesn’t necessarily hurt but it’s super uncomfortable and I need him to stop.   The hormones are light and my period is pretty much non existent now. I had the option of doing the one that starts with a K, but it was a lower hormone and I was worried I would still get my period. Since I’ve lost weight I’m a happier sexual partner, so I guess that balances out the discomfort with certain positions.   I’ve been on a number of pills, the patch, and had the arm implant twice. So far the iud is my favorite even with its flaws. ",False,False

I got my Nexplanon taken out back in August after I gained 20+ lbs purely from the increase in appetite. Eventually I want another form of BC since my insurance doesn’t cover oral BC (odd I know...)",False,False

For a really long time I was insatiably hungry all the time and I gained a lot of weight, but now my hunger levels are like a normal person. I feel like I have my life back. ",False,False

Estrogen is an appetite suppressant. Most BCP use little estrogen and more progesterone. Some are even progesterone only. ,False,False
