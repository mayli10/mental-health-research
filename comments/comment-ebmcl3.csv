Yes, I received more compliments and positive attention, but I think that was also partly due to the fact that I just have more (false) confidence at a low weight. I have seen thin people treated horribly, denied jobs and also discriminated against by healthcare professionals (being told to eat a meal is not healthcare.)",False,False
fb62vib,t3_ebmcl3,t3_ebmcl3,throwaway4206911711,1,2019-12-16 17:47:00,/r/EDAnonymous/comments/ebmcl3/thin_privilege/fb62vib/,Yea I wrote a paper on this once actually. Fatphobia is definitely real people who are overweight actually do face a lot of discrimination  because of their size.  health care professionals tend to treat fat patients poorly. Also let's not forget about the fact that being fat has a certain connotation to it in society. We tend to subconsciously assume fat people are lazier or grosser. So that's why I think thin privilege is real. Sure you can always loose weight so it's not like being discriminated against for somthing you cant change like race but it's still discrimination.,False,False

I don’t buy that it falls into the category of privilege that race and sex do.  There is “thin ignorance” like those skinny HAES dieticians who pontificate to fat people that we shouldn’t want to lose weight, however.",False,False

When I was obese I had doctors dismiss my extremely painful periods and tell me that if I lost weight they’d get easier  flash forward two years and 90lbs and down my periods were MORE painful. But, I was a “normal weight” so my (new) doctor actually took me seriously and sent me in for ultrasounds where they found multiple ovarian cysts that were causing the pain, as well as scarring from old cysts that had ruptured in the past. that’s what was causing my problem and it went ignored because my doctor dismissed my extreme pain due to my weight.   I got lucky in that it was nothing serious but some obese people don’t get so lucky.",False,False

I certainly understand that emotion, but it doesn’t quite pan out for me at the ‘call to action’ level.   - There are people in the world who won a genetic lottery and conform more closely to social conventions of attractiveness. Is it nose-privilege? Iris-privilege? Intellect privilege? Personality privilege? - There are people who work very hard at fitness and nutrition to maintain a particular physical state. Is it ‘privilege’ when I work 60 hrs a week for a good salary or good grades? - There are people who look a particular way because they are caught in the mental, emotional, and physical agony of an eating disorder. Is that privilege? We can never judge inner experiences by outer appearances.   As someone told me last week...”get off the cross, we need the wood.” It stung, but they weren’t wrong.",False,False
