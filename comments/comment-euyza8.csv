Your body doesn't respond well to starvation and theres a reason many people gain back weight after being on a restrictive diet.   Sincerely, a dumbass who went from overweight to underweight way too quick and has been dealing with extreme hunger for 3 months.",False,False

However, I have done a lot of research into this topic over the last month and have drawn 2 conclusions.   1.) 'Starvation mode' is mostly a myth unless you are underweight. It takes time for your body to start burning muscle instead of fat and that's what causes metabolic problems. During the Minnesota Starvation Experiment, the men ate 1800 calories a day and walked a lot, and their BMRs only decreased to around 1,600 even while underweight.   2.) There was a study of overweight women who ate 800 calories a day. Half of them did resistance training and half didnt. The BMRs of the half who exercised didnt go down. Sooo... exercising lightly helps.  I'm not all that smart, and I cant understand most of the studies done on the Minnesota Starvation Experiment, so take what I say with a grain of salt please",False,False
