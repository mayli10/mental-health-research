My partner has scoliosis so tbh he probably is shorter a lot of the time and especially depending on pain and such.   I honestly think it's part of my body dysmorphia, for some reason I see myself as a really tall and wide girl. That does make sense though, I think I'm going to measure myself a few times and see if there are any variations during the week, it's quite interesting actually. ",False,True

I've had doctors who've taken my measurements every 4 weeks to calculate my bmi  (when I was very ill) and the number could change literally depending on my back that day, wether it was hurting so I was more slouched, or stronger to could straighten it out. It fustrated me as it meant I could never menasure my bmi accurately. So if my back is like that it's reasonable to assume everyone has a slight varying height, just maybe not to the same extent as mine. ",False,False
