I find the not owning a scale made my realise that I genuinely have body dysmorphia, after eating I see myself more huge than before, it's instantaneous !",False,True

I think we’re always going to be fixated on monitoring our weight one way or another. When I didn’t own a scale, I didn’t worry less. I just measured in different ways. I went by my skinny jeans, and how my legs felt in them each day dictated how I felt in general.   But it can get better. You can trick yourself into feeling better even if you’re not ready to let go of measuring – you adjust the scale. I switched from skinny jeans to ankle grazing cigarette trousers six months ago. I still wear a UK 8/US 4, so the numbers part of my ED brain is satisfied, but the trouser cut is more accommodating so I always feel good in them too.",False,False
