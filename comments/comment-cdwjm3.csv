In my state that‚Äôs called ‚Äúforcible touching‚Äù and him trying to make you touch him might be sexual abuse in the second or third degree depending on what happened and where he made you touch.   So like it‚Äôs not just you having an internal sense that ‚Äúthis is wrong‚Äù it‚Äôs the force of law saying that what he did is absolutely wrong.   If you need to talk but don‚Äôt want to tell friends or family just yet, please look up RAINN and their hotline.   This was not your fault and you deserve support!!",False,False

Does your door have a lock? If so, keep it shut and make a point of never being together in a room with him unless another person you trust present. Do you have any friends in the area? It might be a good idea to crash somewhere else until you can move back in to your place. I can not overemphasize how inappropriate his actions were. I'm sorry that happened to you -you did nothing to bring it about and he is 100% at fault. Stay safe, friend.",False,False

Your uncle was being a creepy, slimy pervert because that's what he is as an individual, not because you gave him a ""reason.""   I feel a lot of people who behave like that will try to pull any excuse when confronted, being married, religious, whatever - none of those excuses matter because they're straight bullshit and don't line up with that person's very clearly wrong actions.   I do understand not wanting to bring more family into it immediately because that can, honestly, make it harder while you're dependent on staying there a little longer, but just try to be as safe as you can and maybe jerryrig a lock on your door if you can. And please, please do try to tell a friend, even if you don't include all the details - just in case, it's good to have someone near you aware of the situation.",False,False

I go back July 31st. I honestly worry that maybe my outfit was too inappropriate (tube top and high waisted shorts) and it made it worse? I was raised Mormon and I‚Äôm still trying to beat that women shaming mentality out of my head.  Like my uncles been married to my aunt since I was about 7. My god that makes it even worse.

Could you tell someone about it? Perhaps a trusted family member? Or even report him?   If it helps at all, I guess here's just a reminder that other people ‚Äî *especially* predators like your uncle ‚Äî shouldn't have any say in your weight and physical appearance. Your body, however it looks like, exists to support you through your daily activities, your aspirations, your work and your interests. And you deserve to give it all the care you can.   Sending love. Hope things get better :(",False,False
