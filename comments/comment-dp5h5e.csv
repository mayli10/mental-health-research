It's hard for me to use this to calm myself down when I look fat+ugly, because I know it's just in my head in the moment but that doesn't make it any less real. I can usually think myself out of a really bad head-space, but when I see myself that way it's like there's nothing I can do. Super annoying I just wish I could calm myself down about that.",False,False

Near my lowest weight I had this moment of clarity looking in the mirror and I was scared of myself.   And embarrassed that that’s how other people saw me, because my friends had recently confronted me.  I ate an entire large pizza that day.  Then just went back to my bullshit lol.",False,False

It'll happen and I'm not feeling particularly good or bad about my body but I see my reflection and it's so crazy that I actually think I look skinny for a moment,False,False
