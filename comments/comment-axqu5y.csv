I’ve been on 4 different BC and some made my appetite hugely increase while some did nothing. I’m currently trialing Yazmin and it’s the first pill that’s made my appetite to decrease hugely. Honestly the only time I want to eat now is when I feel sick or light headed from not eating and know that I have to eat, food has just kinda lost is sparkle to me now. Also has cleared up my acne so it’s pretty much my holy grail.",False,False

Most people on the mini pill gain an average of 5lbs over the first 10 years of use. It's not significant but it's annoying that doctors say bc pills don't cause weight gain at all. In college we're learning about these effects so I feel doctors should at least give a small disclaimer. ,False,False

I haven’t gained any weight, though. Technically the oil doesn’t make you gain weight, but it can increase your appetite and that’s what usually makes people gain weight. ",False,False
