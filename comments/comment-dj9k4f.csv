Bought like 5 pairs of AE jeans in size 4 a few months ago, (and y‚Äôall know AE jeans are NOT cheap) lost a bunch of weight, and now they are super loose on me. I didn‚Äôt even get a chance to wear most of them, they look brand new. Recently bought jeans in a size 0, and even they are starting to feel loose, even after a wash. Sigh.",False,False

In a few years, I gained weight, and it wouldn't button up anymore. I kept it as a ""goals"" cardigan. I still have it, and it fits again. When I wore it, I felt like the compliments I got from that clothing store worker became true again. I'm sorry for using you as weight loss motivation, nice worker.",False,False

I have a ton of stuff I shoved to the back of the closet because visually I‚Äôm sure there is NO WAY they will fit and... they do? And some are too big? Total mindfuck.,False,False

They were my favorite and I felt so pretty in them. Then I gained A LOT of weight due to a new medication and couldn't wear them at all. I pulled them out of the closet a while back and could finally wear them again. Put them on again this week and they are loose AF.,False,False

I‚Äôd only wear them if all my other pants were dirty and even when I lost a few pounds and they fit better I was still scared to even try them on. I finally tried them on recently and they‚Äôre big! Now I get excited every time they‚Äôre clean and reach for them since my others are even bigger.  Edit: I bet you look so cute in your skirt!! I love their clothes but could never afford them üò≠,False,False

Previous to this summer, my weight fluctuated, but never lower than a certain threshold. This summer my weight plummeted (I was super depressed and could barely function) and all of a sudden I was wearing clothes that hadn't fit me for 11 years that I'd kept around just in case. Then had to get rid of them because they were too big. I'm now an obsessive secondhand shopper because I've had to purchase an entirely new wardrobe, which has honestly been SO fun. I always HATED shopping at my higher weight.   &amp;#x200B;  Also, your wording implies ""ex"". I'm not sure what your financial situation was back then, but what a shamey comment on so many levels. I'd have been upset tbh.",False,False
