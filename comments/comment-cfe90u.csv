That's not considered a weight gain diet at all.  That's about what I've ben started on when I've first been admitted to hospital and then it was increased to 3000+ over time.   &gt;   &gt;My bad if you mean you have this on top of a full meal plan.,False,False

I'm guessing refeeding is a risk currently and that's the reason your intake is so low- it will be increased as your body begins to tolerate food more. You can expect real food to be introduced too.,False,False
