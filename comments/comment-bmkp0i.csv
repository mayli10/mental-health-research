I learned this lesson the hard way.    The period when I abused laxatives was, quite literally, the shittiest time of my life. I actually GAINED weight because I ended up eating more than I would have under normal circumstances (well, the word ""normal"" doesn't really apply to my eating habits, but you know what I mean).    Laxatives will fuck up your natural feeling of fullness and satiety. For me, that made it more difficult to stop eating.    They do not even aid weightless, so they are absolutely not worth the terrible side effects they can cause like electrolyte imbalance.    I am so glad that my psychiatrist weaned me off bysacodyl before it had a chance to cause long term damage to my digestive system. I will NEVER touch that shit again.",False,False

This usually happens in the presence of an infection or disease that affects the proper functioning of your GI tract. Since laxatives themselves don't create a situation where your intestinal walls are destroyed to the point of malabsorption, they don't really do much except propel waste out faster.  Personal anecdote: I was diagnosed with an IBD and literally felt like I was on laxatives 24/7 (even though it's not really a comparable situation, biologically...on the surface, that's what it was like). I got really used to being ""empty"" and I can absolutely understand chasing after than sensation, even if using laxatives to achieve it is a terrible and self-defeating way to get there.",False,False
