My mom buys into the ""fasting has benefits"" thing and I my husband accepted my explanation of why it's good. As long as I ""eat enough"" during my one meal to equal a day's worth of calories. Fucking as if. I made sure it was all healthy food so that I could barely get past 800c due to the extreme volume of food. It was like allowing myself to binge and starving at the same time. Recently started doing it again . . . oops.",False,False

I lost doing it but as I could only do it by eating in the evening (to avoid binging) I had major brain fog during the day.
