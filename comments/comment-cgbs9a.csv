So, as far as I knew, there were no pictures. But apparently my little brother took a picture of me with a disposable camera that I recently came across at my moms house. I was skeletal, my cheeks were sunken and my legs were nothing but skin and bone. I didn’t look good. I was most disturbed by the fact that at the time I was completely convinced that I was ‘fat’ and everyone who saw me must have thought I was fat too. I wouldn’t eat in public and I was so deeply ashamed of my appearance. Nobody in my family ever said a thing about me being thin, and when other people said something I thought they were being patronizing. But the worst part is that I feel proud of that picture, and in the back of my head I can’t help but think it’ll be different this time. I’ll know I’m thin this time and I’ll feel good. It’s different now. I’m fucked in the head",False,False
