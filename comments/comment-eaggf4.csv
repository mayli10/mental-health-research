I hope my derm will keep me on it for as long as possible. It makes you nauseous and pee like crazy(...uhh, tmi) but can also cause fainting. Not good at all. Iâ€™d like to do laser removal for excess hair at some point but itâ€™s not always successful with dark hair :c It sucks itâ€™s a stigma here in North America, but I think thatâ€™s slowly changing.",False,False

Unrelatedly, my dermatologist put me on spironolactone for hormonal acne, which she said is also used to treat alopecia. It seems to have helped me and itâ€™s starting to grow back. I would have an honest talk with your doc and see if it might help you, they will know if itâ€™s a good idea to start or not, all things considering.",False,False
