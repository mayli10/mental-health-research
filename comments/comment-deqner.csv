I've started bringing potatoes more into my diet again after a long time of quitting when sweet potatoes used to be a dinner time staple because I felt that they were too high calorie for nutrient content, honestly I felt bad for having a small russet since it didn't really have that much of the big macros I value for the count but I bet the micros are good too and I just have to re-tool things to do them.   One day I was struggling I ended up putting a tablespoon of chocolate chips in a little baked russet with a little bit of ketchup and sour cream because food is cheaper than therapy and someone baked a 2 layer box chocolate cake.",False,False

Fall time in general makes me feel nostalgic for the “honeymoon” phase of my ed. Last year when I was at my peak, I basically survived off of one pack of Uncle Ben’s ready rice a day and a crap ton of zero cal Lipton green tea.

There’s so much you can get from a healthy life, it’s always worth working towards even if you have slip ups along the way.  Mental illness is a devastating thing to deal with in a relationship. It’s hard for him to watch this happen to someone he loves, but that doesn’t excuse the behaviour you mentioned. When you get a chance, try talking having another conversation. He could be reacting for a lot of different reasons, it’s worth asking and keeping up communication. You deserve to be in a supportive relationship! (Sorry if I’m overstepping with advice here, ultimately I don’t know you or your partner.)   It’s all so overwhelming but a person is never too broken to fix!

I’m actually supposed to be in recovery at the moment, but am now actually at my lowest ever weight! It’s such a motivator. I had a heart to heart with my husband over it and he did the whole “you’re going to die, please don’t die” thing with me, but then when I actually started to share the crazy that is in my brain - you know the constant pressured voice that says no, don’t eat, you don’t deserve to eat until you have exercised for x miles...vs the constant feeling of guilt from letting him down that part was met with silence and physical distance. When I just desperately needed a hug or something...  Then when I talked to him about it the next day, my worst fear was realised. He’s been keeping score of how much he supports me and how I don’t give anything back (and I do though, I cook him meals, I listen to him and comfort him when he has going through shit, I make sure he eats/stays hydrated when he works, I do laundry, I look after the groceries and bills) but because he’s had to be the one to be at my bedside in hospital that trumps everything else.   I thought I had found someone who loved me for me, not what I can do or contribute. Turns out I was right. I’m only worthy of “love” when I’m contributing.  I spent twenty minutes on the kitchen floor last night in the dark because I thought I was going to faint. He can see the kitchen from his chair, saw me go in there, saw the light off, and yet didn’t care to investigate after 20 freaking minutes.  I told him I was dizzy, and his response was to turn the volume up on the tv and return to texting on his phone.   And again this morning, I had a test I was freaking out about, he couldn’t even stop texting to talk to me about it.  I’m such a fool.  So another part of me has died, there’s not much left. Why bother recovering when I just want to die anyway. If I’m not worth anything to the person who is supposed to love me more than anything, what worth do I actually have.  So I’ll go through the motions, say the things he likes to hear, do the things that he wants me to do, all the while I’ll continue to work towards fading away until I can cease to exist because I’m too gutless to do it any other way.",False,False

After I recovered I kept up the chicken broth diet for a few more weeks and it was amazing.

I think I just realized that I stopped eating them because I ate them so much during a long restriction period. I used to do a sweet potato with a little bit of salt, lots of black pepper, and  a little bit of that herbed goat cheese crumbled on top.  The best meal.  If you cook a sweet potato in the oven wrapped in foil, it's so incredibly moist that you don't need to add any butter or oil, and the creaminess and slight tartness  of soft goat cheese pairs so well with an earthy sweet potato.

I used to wake up at 4 am everyday to force down vitamins and fiber so I could sleep off the nausea and wake up feeling full and able to empty my bowels. I also forced myself to eat slightly spoiled/sour broccoli since I had already measured it out while meal prepping the weekend before.   I guess I went too hard and now my appetite is out of control and I can't bring myself to eat broccoli even though it used to be one of my safe foods.
