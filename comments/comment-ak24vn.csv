I'm sure it's already pretty clear from the fact that I'm posting here right now that I'm at a bit of a crossroads right now. I know from my experience through years of recovery and several relapses that this is a transient ""high risk"" time where I have to be extra cautious and honest with myself about my thoughts and behaviors. I don't want to relapse. I want to be a surgeon, and I'll need to be able to stand still in uncomfortable positions for several hours at a time. I'll need to be at full strength and good health in order to make it through medical school at all, let alone a surgical residency. I want to be as intentional as possible with my choices, and I want to know I'm making the right ones.  It's such a thin line to walk, trying to get in shape and lose a *healthy* amount of weight for a normal, reasonable purpose, while also trying to push away those intrusive thoughts. I also get what you're saying about being aware of my intentions; it just sucks, because it almost feels like I can't fully participate in a normal component of what I'm going to call ""bridal culture"". That sounds fucked up when I type it out, that I'm getting FOMO about wedding diets, but... ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è  It's a good idea, picking a number that ""makes sense"" and feels comfortable to enter into the FitBit. I'll admit that it grates on my neuroticism a little bit, knowing it isn't ""real"", but I know I have to move past that somehow... any advice?",False,True

I've been in recovery for the last 6 months, eating normal portions, actually having regular hunger cues, and feeling strong + full of energy for once. The thoughts have been slowly creeping in ever since December though... knowing full well I've gained.. not enough to really show, but enough that my jeans are tighter and I felt more constricted in certain clothes. A couple weeks ago I was joking with my boyfriend over his unchanging weight and we ended up weighing ourselves. I had a full blown panic attack when I saw the number. It wasn't as bad as I thought, but enough to send me spiraling down into restriction. And now I'm back here.  So whatever you do, if you know yourself well - DO NOT weigh yourself. In terms of your fitbit, settle on a number that you feel is healthy and is around what you think you weigh. A number that you like (for me, I like even numbers). But don't concentrate on this number! Concentrate on how you *feel*, set intentions like ""I wish to feel lean, strong, and comfortable in my body"" and express gratitude ""I am grateful for my body's ability to run, get fit, move around, etc"" or ""I am grateful for this plate of nourishing whole foods that will heal me and provide me with energy"".   Restructuring my thoughts like this really help me shift my focus from numbers to consciousness (of my body and mental health). Try to make your intention not to *lose weight* for your wedding, but to *feel healthy/fit*. And whatever weight you do lose, you'll feel on your body rather than see on the scale.  I hope I'm making sense... sorry for the essay hahaha.. I just really wish I hadn't weighed myself that day, it fucked me up.. so now I feel obligated to keep you from fucking up too (saying this from a place of compassion)! It's really not worth the relapse.",False,False
