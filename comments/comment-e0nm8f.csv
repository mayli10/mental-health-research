I have a bit of a cushion  2. I'm in a restricting mindset  3. My stomach is a little shrunk so I can't eat as much  In terms of obscuring restriction so that I can continue to not eat very much without arousing suspicion or concern from family members:  1. I have found that people don't notice whether or not as eating as long as I'm drinking, so I just drink. And if I drink and don't really eat, my drunken behavior will make it seem like I've drunk even more than I have, so people think my total consumption was normal even though it was low and mostly alcohol  2. Just be very boisterous and involved in conversation. If I'm talking the whole time nobody notices I'm not eating, or waves it off as ""he's not eating because he's too busy talking""  3. Do a one-day mono diet. I can eat as much as I want but only of *one* dish. Looks like Im eating a lot, even makes people notice that I'm eating a lot because I'm eating more than my fair share of that particular item so they get mad at me and tell me to eat less, but I ultimately eat less than if I were eating a variety or even if I was eating the one dish by myself (because other people are going to get at least a little of it)  And then terms of eating at restaurants, the one thing that always works in my family and has never drawn suspicion is waiting for someone else to say what they intend to order, saying ""ooo I wanted that too, can we split it?"" and then not actually eating much or any of it. Similarly, try to steer your family towards restaurants where the food is communal rather than everyone having their own discrete dish/plate of food, so that they can't really keep track of how much you specifically have eaten.",False,False

At least that way, I know that I will not be eating more than my maintenance calories. For Thanksgiving, I'll run a 5K that morning, probably do some yoga before I go to my mother's, and maybe do more yoga that night if I haven't closed my move ring. Next day, I'll swim and lift.   And moderation. I like various foods. But except for my two favorites -- sweet potatoes and stuffing -- only \*one\* serving of each.",False,False

I‚Äôm already a vegetarian so that nixes like 80% of dishes for me already (my family puts bacon in fuckin everything üôÑ) and people tend to only make like... one vegetarian dish ‚Äúspecial‚Äù for me.   If I‚Äôm not eating a lot and people question it I‚Äôll just shrug it off, honestly. I don‚Äôt like the standard holiday food much as-is, so it‚Äôs like... I don‚Äôt want to eat it. Also when it‚Äôs ‚Äúserve yourself‚Äù it‚Äôs disgusting to me so I don‚Äôt want to eat 99% of it because of how gross people are, anyway. I‚Äôll give small reasons like that. If they press for more info, can say you got food poisoning from a buffet so now you feel you can‚Äôt trust that stuff, even if it‚Äôs family/friends.   If it‚Äôs the pass it around kind, I just keep passing. Lol.   Uhm! If I HAVE to take food, I‚Äôll put a layer of mashed potatoes down all over my plate, first. Not anything super thick, but just cover the plate so when I add other foods that I can tolerate, taking them in small bits is fine and I can hide the rest in potato when I am ‚Äúfull‚Äù.
