Fat is okay. Obesity is not. It's unfortunate that obese people have co-opted the fat positivity movement. It's just makes things harder for people who are heavier but still healthy because it deligtimizes them.,False,False

I’m still in denial...    W/e I got my fast food addiction under control. But I’m still a binge eater and compulsive over eater. I eat way too many calories still.,False,False

Not entirely, but close. There's so much negativity around anorexia and the problems it causes that this FA movement is encouraged so we don't push unrealistic stereotypes on ourselves. But, unfortunately, it's still an unhealthy way to live and no one sees it bc it's easier to be fat and eat what you want than to starve, diet, and exercise.   Once we get into a mindset it's almost impossible to see the truth outside the lies. I have family, both inlaws and blood, that have wacky ways of looking at the world and I'll use them as an example. In their eyes marijuana and all illegal forms of drugs are bad. If they hear of anyone drinking or using drugs recreationally they practically clutch their pearls and faint. Same exact people: use oxycontin for even the smallest of pains. Don't see anything wrong with it bc it's legal. Even though the outcome is the same. My sister has even admitted to chasing one prescription pain pill with another bc it gives her a small high, but FLIPS OUT if she even hears someone mention weed in passing.",False,False

And when your environment is surrounded with negativity and hatred and mockery, it's very, very easy to believe the comforting lie is comforting because it's the truth, and the truth only hurts because it's wrong. Then you get further and further into it, and everyone who tries to tells you the truth is a horrible person.",False,False
