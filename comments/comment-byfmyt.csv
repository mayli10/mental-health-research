But it's the fuel my disordered brain is throwing onto the fire.  And like, i dont want to be friends with her. When she ghosted me the second time i was just absolutely done. She got really fake too. But whatever. In my fantasy world she hates herself too",False,True

I relate to a lot of the sentiments you expressed. Today while journaling about how shitty I’ve been feeling because I swear nobody likes me in my dorm hall or classes, I realized how obsessed with anger I was.   I have been trying not to spiral back into a full-blown eating disorder yet I’m still trying to lose weight even though I’m already a size 2. I had to get honest with myself about these fantasies I had of posting my future body would make everyone else who didn’t like me jealous and somehow I’d finally attract people that cared about me. In doing so, I realized how fucking unhealthy this dream was because in reality nobody is thinking about me in the first place. Everyone is busy with their own self-absorbed issues. Secondly, I didn’t even really like these people who I wish found me like-able. It was just me feeling lonely and unloved wanting to be liked by everyone so badly. I don’t mean to project my experiences on to you by any means, but I hope you know you’re not alone in all of this and more importantly that there you are valued in the body you have right now. I’m trying to live my life, fucking with myself more than anybody else, in only positive ways. I used to fuck with myself mentally, always putting myself down. Thinking I did something wrong to ruin a friendship. But now that I realize I’m a great person and need to stop heavily relying on people for love and validation, I feel free. I’ve always been a loner and I wanna own that more.  That girl who was avoiding you isn’t someone worth staying friends with. You deserve better. There are people you haven’t met you who would fucking adore you so in the mean time be gentle with yourself and enjoy your own company. Wishing you peace xx",False,False
