I initially only notice people’s bodies if they particularly stand out for any reason. After that I tend to notice women’s bodies more than men’s (probably from being socialized to compare myself to other women) and can be judgey (which I hate) but also do find many bodies I think are beautiful and theyre not all necessarily the same type of body.,False,False
