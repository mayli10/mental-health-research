But if someone brought their own food to my house when I invited them for dinner I wouldn’t think it was weird  I didn’t want to hang out with friends the other day bc I didn’t want to eat their food and my fiancé told me I could bring my own food and assured me it wouldn’t be weird but I think I ended up just not going bc of it.   Maybe if you know what she’s cooking ahead of time, you can say you don’t like that/ it makes you not feel well or something so you just brought your own food. I did that when our friends were making hotdogs, although I really don’t like hotdogs, I was more just scared how many calories were in them so I just had my fiancé grill us burgers while they grilled the hotdogs so I knew how many calories my food had",False,False

Say you'd love to visit but you're having some food anxieties (If she knows about it) and would like to see her and not let issues with food creep into the visit.  In a less truthful way you could say you're experiencing GI issues and need to reduce potential allergen exposure so you're only eating foods you know dont cause a reaction till you suss it out.,False,False
