I don’t know your attitudes towards recovery, but it’s absolutely worth a shot!   typically you’ll go through an intake where they ask your medical history, your symptoms, etc—it’s important to be honest here. they want to help you avoid refeeding syndrome, which is what happens when your intake increases too quickly and your body can’t handle it. be 100% honest; it will help you in the long run.   next they’ll do bloodwork, an EKG, and a couple other medical tests to determine how compromised your physiology is. after that it’s a lot of waiting to hear back from you or your family’s health insurance, and eventually you’re finally admitted.   this gets super stressful and is also really boring at times. if someone else isn’t planning on being there with you, try to get someone supportive to come.   finally! you get admitted. it sounds like this is an ED-specific unit; that’s what I have the most experience with. typically they start you off at a fairly low meal plan and gradually increase it as you adjust. at one of my inpatients, you were required to finish all of your food. at another, you didn’t have to, and could take a boost or ensure nutritional supplement equivalent to what you didn’t finish instead. in my experience, it’s better to eat the food.   you’ll meet with a therapist or case worker and also a dietitian; some places let you pick your meals, others don’t. the one that let me pick used an exchange system instead of counting calories, which definitely helped make sure I was eating enough without actually COUNTING when I was discharged.   if you need to be weight restored, a portion of this will usually happen inpatient, before they transition you to a day program or an intensive outpatient program. if not, they’ll bring you up to a maintenance meal plan and help you get used to eating normally again.   there’s a lot of therapeutic groups too—usually ones on body image, developing coping skills, etc. absolutely utilize these!! I relapsed several times, and even if I thought it was dumb at the time/a waste of my time, I 100% still use some of the coping skills today.   TL; DR: get what you can from it. it’s scary and nerve-wracking at first, but it’s worthwhile knowledge in the long run. I wish you the best, OP, and feel free to ask whatever else you might want to know.",False,False
