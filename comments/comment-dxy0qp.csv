Okay I don’t just feel beautiful, I genuinely look better.  I’ve asked multiple people and they all agree with me. Crowd consensus says no recovery for me lmao :)))",False,False

I’m not trying to fool myself into thinking my body is beautiful and amazing, I just wanna exist and not have any value judgements on my body. It’s not beautiful or ugly, it’s just the thing that lets me experience this world. Takes a lot of patience and work but it’s okay now mostly. I still have days where I can’t look in the mirror but I just remind myself to think of what my body does instead of how it looks.",False,False
