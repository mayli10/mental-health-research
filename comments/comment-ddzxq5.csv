I don't like pumpkins or cloves and it tastes like pumpkin.  Like I found it too sweet as well (and I'm the kind of person who eats multiple family size blocks of chocolate in one sitting). But I don't like sugary drinks because they're sticky and I don't like sticky. And I don't like things that are hot and sweet.   I also can't stand coffee unless it's black with no milk no sugar.   Why the hell did I think I would like this thing?,False,True
