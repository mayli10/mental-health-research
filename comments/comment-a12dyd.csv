I canâ€™t remember) and the milk came up fucking curdled and disgusting and I basically wasnâ€™t even purging anymore just straight up vomiting at how gross it was  Easiest: ice cream, definitely.

I hate throwing up chicken even in the best of circumstances. I never chew my chicken all the way, and it comes up in these gross throat-clogging chunks that frequently get stuck in my nose. And then the buffalo sauce burns everything coming up.   Honorable mention: I purged fish precisely one time, and never again. The flavor is too bad.  Best: Baba ganoush with pita bread, and of course, ice cream. Gotta love something that tastes exactly the same both ways.  ",False,False
