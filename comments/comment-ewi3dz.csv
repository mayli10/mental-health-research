Try to think about the fact that you were sick and needed this treatment to survive, just like a person with asthma needs their inhalator. Obviously i don’t know how many calories were in this, but from what i have been told by nurses it is basically impossible to gain weight from an iv drip, at least if you only get it once like you did. When i was admitted i stayed for one day and one night, and was connected to an iv drip the entire time. I probably recieved like three bags of it, and when i asked the nurses they still said that the amount of glucose wasn’t nearly enough of the calories that i would have needed during that time period, and that i definitely didn’t gain any weight from it.   I hope you feel better soon. It must have been a stressful experience for you.",False,False

I think the lack of choice in those situations bothers my brain too. Maybe try to remember that in the scheme of things those life-saving calories are a wash from a weight standpoint? Glad you were able to get help and I hope it’s not an experience you’ll have to repeat!",False,False

I get that it's an emergency medication that I needed to not die but that doesn't mean that my eating disorder doesn't freak out at finding out about calories that I didn't know about until two days later.",False,True
