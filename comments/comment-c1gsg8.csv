But I've had it replaced, so I've had it done twice. The first time did hurt, only because the doctor didn't wait nearly long enough for the numbing shot to take full effect, but the second time was completely painless. Local anesthetics are like magic when they're given long enough to work. Lol.   But yeah, ask your doctor since you have issues with your immune responses. I haven't had those types of things happen to me, though I have a truckload of other weird health problems.",False,False

And i should have mentioned this before because it is important but my immune system is a little wonky. Like i couldn’t wear contacts without suffering so do you think that would have the same problems? (of course i know i should ask my doctor that but i just figured i’d mention it.),False,True

When they put it in, I’m not gonna lie, it’s not like it didn’t hurt. But it was more just, cramp style? It did feel like I had small rocks in my uterus for a few days. But I had had worse cramps. But over all, I haven’t bought tampons in 4 years. Sometimes I wipe and am like, oh blood. Weird. I highly recommend.",False,False
