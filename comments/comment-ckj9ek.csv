What do you measure? I measure the exact thickness of my inner thigh flabs, and the same stomach fat roll. I use (verniers)[https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71j0nZ0NfyL._SL1500_.jpg]. (with the ends wrapped in duct tape of course)  Gain/loss of muscle doesn't affect this measurement, so it's quite useful to extrapolate overall bodyfat.",False,False

I haven't let myself own a scale for years but it doesn't necessarily stop me from checking my weight. I'm frequently tempted to get a scale to stop the bodychecking, but I'm afraid it'll just make matters worse.   Ideally, I just need to get better at not bodychecking so much and letting my body just exist and like... do its thing.",False,False
