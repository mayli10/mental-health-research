I have moved about 5 times with my fiance and I can tell you we get into a fight almost every time we move. We have very different approaches to moving and getting it done, and the stress of that can cause fights. I don't know what your fight is about, but could it be elevated because you are both anxious and nervous about the move? Talk it out together, and I'm sure everything will be fine! I will say I have found I am more volatile and not as easy to resolve conflict with when I am heavily restricting. I hope it gets better!",False,False
