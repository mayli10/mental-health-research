Too many curves/bouncy bits are distracting and ""human hangers"" have beautiful but not overwhelming features. ",False,False

They clip the clothing so it's a perfect fit, use sample versions of the garment, and just straight up lie about what size is being used; they may even use a bigger size and then clip/tailor it perfectly on the day and then the actual off-the-rack garment will look world's different to the photo.",False,False

Even for girls just starting out they quickly get encouraged to either lose weight to get to a size 0-4 in order to get normal jobs or gain weight to get to a size 10-14 for plus size work. There is fairly little market for a the in betweens. I guess by the time you‚Äôve gotten enough work to model for urban outfitters you‚Äôve figured out how to maintain in one of the categories. It‚Äôs a bit weird and toxic tbh. I think it‚Äôs changing slowly but I noped out of the industry pretty quickly ,False,False

The description said the model was wearing a size 4. She and I were similar proportion and size, BUT that size 4 literally fell off of my body.
