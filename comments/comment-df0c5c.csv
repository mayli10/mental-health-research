You can eat a lot of them for very little so you don't have to worry much. I like to make stir fry. Whole lot of veggies, some tofu, some soy sauce and seasonings. A large portion is under 400 cal. I'll eat just a plate of veggies too which ends up being 60 cal or less. Salads.. calories will vary a lot depending on what you put in it. Could be anywhere from maybe 200-400+ .. I make sure I get in some protein with my salads so my salads are in the higher end in calories, but it's filling. I can't really tell you how to find balance. That's something you have to work on yourself. I can tell you to try not to stress so much. I don't believe anyone has ever gotten fat from eating vegetables. So enjoy them.",False,False

For example, I learned first how to cook scrambled eggs, then fried, poached, boiled, etc. I then learned how to incorporate them in meals (sandwich, over rice, salads, stirfry, etc.). Slowly I built up a list of meals/snacks i could easily prepare and that I looked forward to eating, and these then slowly replaced usual less healthy ones.   I grew up being a picky eater who avoided all the healthy foods, but i hated how i felt after eating. It took me a long time but im finally eating 'healthy' (albeit at a less healthy deficit most of the time...) because i found healthy foods i look forward to eating. I try to prioritize how i feel AFTER the meal rather than during.  Some of my favorite things to add to any meal as a side or additive- arugula, basil, tomatoes, eggs, boiled potatoes, strawberries, thyme, shrimp, soy sauce (not that healthy but better than high sugar sauces).   I hope i made any sense haha. Basically i found learning to cook simple dishes and appreciating simple flavors will make you look forward to healthy eating/make healthy eating more appetizing. And i think cooking is a beneficial obsession to have since it gives you a feeling of control, so trying to channel your energy here is maybe a good thing.",False,False
