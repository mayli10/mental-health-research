When I visit relatives who critique my weight, I prepare myself mentally. I realize nothing mean they say is worse than what I have thought about myself. I am my own biggest bully. I know they have a problem deep within that makes them want to critique me. I imagine the pain they must be going through that they say such toxic words. I let go of anger and hurt as much as possible, then distance myself emotionally. During the visit I stay respectful and cordial as if I am talking to a neighbor or professor. It is important to keep my composure, get through it, and promise myself a fun video or nap later. I still feel sadness and hurt, that doesnâ€™t go away, but I can rest easy knowing I kept it together. I hope this helps in some way. I have struggled with this for years and this is how I get through it.",False,False
