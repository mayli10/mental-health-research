You can get 2 hours in a rehearsal studio for £5-10. Teaching myself new juggling patterns is a good distraction from food as well. Failing that just sleeping but that’s not a very interesting use of time,False,False

I spend the mornings working out, then the rest of the day eating, feeling too full, going for a walk to get rid of my fullness, going to the grocery store, food prepping. It's so depressing. I try to break out of it by visiting friends or making plans (I have a lot of friends in nearby cities). When I'm away for the weekend, it's scary because sometimes I don't work out, but I try to just enjoy the weekend with friends. I usually lose weight too, because I'm not spending the entire weekend constantly eating.  When I'm in town by myself for the weekend, I try to read a lot, go to a cafe and do work, go for walks, draw, go shopping, get coffee or try new cafes, go to a museum or park, or get together with friends. I'd like to get into other hobbies like pottery or making music, or take a class, but I don't have the money to do these things right now.",False,False

I'm at uni at the moment and I live by the sea so there's loads of nice long walks and me and my flatmates usually go on walks a few times a week, even if it is just to chat, get out of the house and occasionally go for coffee.   Also walking burns more calories than wallowing in my own feelings so woo. Oh, and once the walk is done, I'm tired because I have no energy then can have a nap and can continue restricting.   A win win win situation if you ask me.",False,False
