Hanging out with people you don’t connect with, popular or not, isn’t worth your time. As you get older and more comfortable with who you are, you will realize that those people aren’t actually cooler than you and that doing your own thing is so much more enjoyable. There’s nothing wrong with being an introvert or not liking big social events. In high school you live in a bubble. As an adult you will find interesting people who love you and love hanging out with you, and you’ll be able to forget all about the people who made you feel unworthy",False,False

Honestly I’ve been in almost the exact same situation before and it really sucks. Like it really does, everytime I think back on it I just feel like crap. What you’re feeling is not juvenile at all. Just wanted u to know you’re not alone.",False,False

Maybe she's an extrovert and your an introvert? People are drawn to happy bubbly energy if that's your friend it could explain. Also so far as weed goes the most experienced user (read 75 yr old hippie) still coughs. It all depends but in my circle it's well known if you can take a RIP big enough to cough you're gonna get good and high.,False,False

We all compare ourselves to others and base our self worth on that. I actually just got back from a football game myself and I was comparing myself to other people there, mostly because the people I was with were HARDCORE swooning.  Anyways, back to your problem. I think what’s going on here is just that you were in a new environment with new people. They were likely doing the same thing as you here, sticking with who they know rather than be outgoing. It’s something we all do, you aren’t alone here. Don’t let it affect your self image, that’ll just make the problem worse. If you seemed to like the people your friend showed you to, talk to them more and build a friendship, if not, it’s a huge world we live in. Good luck to you! :)",False,False
