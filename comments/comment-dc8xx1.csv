For me personally eating 800-1000 calories a day will let me lose 0.5-1 lb a week which is pretty standard weightloss.,False,True

I technically fit the criteria for anorexia but like I'm not anorexic? But fitting AN criteria prevents you from being diagnosed with BN (the one thing that would be helpful). I'm so sorry if I sound rude here, it's just silly.",False,True

I don't think it's appropriate to label myself anorexic, y'know?  That’s totally not true. People have gotten to medically dangerous low weights and have been diagnosed with anorexia eating like 1200-1400 calories a day. 500-700 is extreme, medically speaking.   Not only that, but it’s dependent on the person. Some people basically stop functioning when they try to eat, for example, under 1000 calories, and so eating less than that would be very extreme for them. Or some people lift weights and are really active, and so eating 1500 calories a day would be their version of extreme.",False,False

And I don't want to purge less frequently for obvious reasons. But I'm not a legitimate anorexic/bulimic/ednoser. I only plan on losing weight so I don't think I'll ever get diagnosed with anything lol. The smaller you are the more likely people are to just label you anorexia.,False,True

I just have unhealthy dieting behaviours as well as bulimia-like behaviours.

However, eating under 1000 calories a few times a week is absolutely restricting. I know you said it wasn’t a problem, but for me, I know I frame my binge-purging behaviour as being super bad and undesirable, whereas any restricting behaviour I do I see as good (and therefore not a problem).",False,False
