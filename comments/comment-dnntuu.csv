I'm fairly new to actively posting on this sub but I've been a 'lurker' for a while. It's a bit of a mixture but if you ask for support, people give you support. If you just want to rant about a stupid part of your ED or something you don't like or don't understand then that's ok too and it's more than likely someone will have the same sort of thing in their head.   Well done on seeing a doctor. Food plans are the worst because you loose all control BUT that's a good thing because control IS the disorder. Try to trust the process.   Sorry, I've become super preachy here. I'm in relapse so I'm in a weird place right now but I did reach a good point in recovery for a long while and it is worth it! I promise.",False,False
