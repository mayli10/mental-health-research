I have counted calories of about half the foods my mom prepares (and I overestimate a little because for some reason she blurs to me about how much of things it is in it) and learned that in average her portion is around 700 kcal. some are 600 if it's light but also can be 800 if it's heavy. so I just estimate the rest I didn't count and portion it in a way I find appropriate. also it's so much because our cuisine generally is fatty as fuck   maybe you can try something similar :),False,False

I sort of keep a mental log of most ingredients, grams, and calories.   It’s time consuming as hell and I more than likely overcompensate.",False,False
