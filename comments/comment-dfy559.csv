That sucks. But we can come out of this. Yes about the last part you're right, that was my reaction bc I'm a sick perfectionist. Fun thing is that if I actually spoke like this to someone right now I would probably get punched in the face 'cause nowadays rationally speaking I am something. But shit being so insecure... üòÇ",False,False

Like I always hated myself but I actually used to have self confidence appearance wise and I liked my body and didn‚Äôt realize my face was ugly as shit throughout high school even though it always has been. But then again I woke up early as fuck to do my hair and makeup and wouldn‚Äôt be caught dead without that or a tan or my boobs like halfway out of my shirt so like I only dealt with an organic version of myself so often lol  Now as an adult I hyperfixate on every little flaw I never would‚Äôve formerly cared about, and I‚Äôm just embarrassed to be seen by anybody, but I can look at myself when I‚Äôm alone and be ok (sometimes...). If i make an effort in my appearance now I just look like a pig in makeup and feel worse so i don‚Äôt try. Yet other people have flaws I notice and I don‚Äôt think they‚Äôre subhuman weird aliens like I do with myself, I get envious of how they look cool and complete and beautiful in a way I just feel uniquely incapable of bc of how much I hate myself. I guess that‚Äôs what I mean by normal. I see beauty in so many ‚Äúaverage‚Äù people and i want people to see that in me but I don‚Äôt believe they do whether i try or not. It seems your response to realizing you were ‚Äúnot the beauty queen you thought‚Äù, if I‚Äôm reading it right (dont wanna put words in ur mouth), was to raise your standards and only settle for Perfect, and my response was to just give up and wallow lol. Both come from the same shitty place overall though:(",False,False

Here is ""best hottest sexiest most envied and desired"" or ""gross unwatchable unlovable unfuckable piece of fat"", no way in the middle and of course my ed mind speaks often the second one. I don't clearly recall when but at a certain time in my early teens I realised I was not the beauty queen I thought and bullies were right... and it shattered me so badly I probably decided unconsciously that I had to become it and I would settle for nothing less than perfect.
