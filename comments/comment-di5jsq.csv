I’ve been struggling on and off with bulimia for 8 years now, and around this time last year I fell into it harder than it’s ever been. That ‘one time’ , after months of keeping food down, turned into twice a week.. which turned into everyday, which turned into every meal and every bite that went down my throat had to come back up.  Eventually my body was so used to throwing up that even a slight push on my stomach would cause regurgitation. It’s hell, the anxiety of having food in my stomach was multiplied by the extreme bloating and discomfort of eating even something small like a salad !! Just having the idea that you can throw up whatever you eat is the most damaging IMO, I pray for anyone struggling with this, you deserve to treat yourself better and one last time is only temporary relief that’s more damaging to your body and mind in the long run",False,False

I really wish I'd stopped trying at some point during those 9 years but here we are.,False,False

I can purge by just squeezing certain stomach muscles. I haven’t gotten my stomach looked at but if I stop purging it takes a week to go back to its normal size and I have bad gas cramps without gas. Don’t. Start.,False,False

It’s very hard for me to make myself puke because my gag reflex is almost non existent. I’d been trying for years and one day something finally came up. So I spent the next couple of weeks, or maybe just a week and a half, trying to figure out how to make purging realistic for me and never did.    Months later and I still have a lot of pain in my stomach due to inflammation. Eating or drinking anything even kind of acidic puts fire into myself stomach. I also get RIDICULOUSLY bloated very easily now. I spent such a short time doing it and I’m still feeling the effects. I can’t imagine anything even remotely long term.",False,False

I thought I could because my gag reflex is very much there but apparently not? I think I'll just stick to restricting and c/s.,False,False
