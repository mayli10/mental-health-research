I’ve been on steroids for about a year straight due to a chronic illness; not sure if you know anything about steroids but among the many side effects, they make my face extremely fat, round, and puffy. Like there is a huge drastic extremely obvious change in my face shape if I change dosages. Anyways I’m currently dealing with that and even though my weight hasn’t changed, my face has, and sometimes I just break down when I look in the mirror.

Like I've been in MANY a room where you would be the most beautiful girl in there and we'd all be looking at you all jealous and shit.  I don't actually think you should pursue modelling because it's not great for people with EDs hahahaaAAAa but you could if you wanted to, because you are also fairly tall.
