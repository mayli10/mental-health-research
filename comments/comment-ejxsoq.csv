It’s soluble fiber, right? I think it’s commonly insoluble fiber that’s promoted as helping with constipation because it absorbs water and bulks up the #2, but perhaps any fiber helps get the job done. Of course, it is possible to go overboard with fiber and worsen the issue, especially if there isn’t enough accompanying hydration. But my very-not-a-doctor understanding is that fiber doesn’t carry the risks that stimulant laxative use/abuse does. Ultimately though, your doctor would be the person to check with if you have concerns.",False,False
