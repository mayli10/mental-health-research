I teeter at 900-1200. Mostly 1000. I know that’s not really maintenance for me but I haven’t gained. It’s weird to not see the number change on the scale but it’s reassuring to see it not go down. Some days I freak out but I’m slowly allowing myself to eat and cook for myself meals that I actually enjoy (but still counting and measuring). I really love to cook and experiment with different types of cuisine.   We all have our good and bad days. I’m proud and it’s def a step in the right direction!!,False,False
