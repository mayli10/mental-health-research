Reddit has made it clear and we will have to put up AND shut up if we want some semblance of a community.  So, yes, in that way, all of your recommendations are straight up correct.  What many of us are grieving though is freedom of expression and the genuine camaraderie that that freedom allowed us to share.  Your recommendations--while logical--don't soothe that grieving. They only serve to remind many of us of what's been lost.    So, while I am thankful you took the time to carefully articulate what we'll need to do to survive, I'm also hoping that you can understand why so many of us will miss what we've had and will always wish that our freedom of expression didn't need to be wiped out so that Reddit could appease its advertisers.",False,False

Some people (I include myself in this) never fully recover.  Some of us will be struggling with this for forever.  Some part of our disease involves looking for triggering material or being happy that we fasted or refusing treatment.    Do we not have a right as humans to talk about this?  How far underground do our thoughts have to go before the shame we have just for thinking them becomes too much of a weight to bear?  I get what the OP is asking for:  BEHAVIOR CHANGE.  I imagine the OP would counter argue, ""You don't have to stop thinking these thoughts but you have to stop acting on them.""  That's patronizing.  I'm an adult.  All other adults on this sub are allowed to choose NOT to change behavior.    With that said, ultimately, I would argue that proed DID help people to REDUCE HARM.   The OP has cherry picked posts that do show encouragement of behaviors that involve self harm, but that's a normal conversation within this population.   OP has chosen NOT to focus on the many, many, many posts of people who talk about how difficult parts of this disease can be (purging, laxatives, guilt, shame).  These honest posts about the harm and pain of EDs acted as a natural counter-balance to the ones seeking triggering material.  Recovery from any mental health issue is never a straight line.  Proed was for everyone, no matter where they were in that journey.  Now it will be for people who are in a very particular place in that journey.  It's a shame.  Ok, this has gone on too long.  TL;DR:  By putting in place these changes, you are asking to change the culture of a group that, on the whole, helped rather than harmed.  Humans (adults at least) have free will, including the right to self harm, but proed was mostly about trying to be gentle with ourselves while we figure it all out.",False,False

For example, “triggering material” could mean so many different things to different people. Some people get triggered by numbers. So saying things like “I gained 6 pounds” or “I’m 2 inches taller than I thought I was” could be seen as triggering. A discussion about ED in the media, like the movie To The Bone could be triggering. Talking about insecurities could be triggering. Obviously we don’t want to share self-harm tips, but avoiding topics that could potentially trigger others would defeat the purpose of talking about our EDs at all.  I also slightly disagree with the point you made about progress pics. Yes, the losing of weight is a side effect of an illness that none of us should celebrate. But posting progress pics has often helped me keep my head on straight with my body dysmorphia. I take hundreds of progress pics. I can’t share them with anyone I know. I personally see no difference, and I lose my mind and go to really dark places because of it. Posting them on ProED was a way that I could get feedback, so that I could see through others what I couldn’t see with my own eyes. I don’t think we should see a progress pic and comment “YAAAAAAAS QUEEN LOSE 10 MORE AND YOULL BE PERFECT” but it is helpful to hear from others in a constructive way.  We don’t want to validate the disorders themselves, but we as people with the disorders could sometimes use the validation.  But I completely agree about linking to other subs. Something I hated seeing on ProED and ProEDmemes was all the posts linking to Fasting and 1200isplenty talking about how their posts are disordered. While yes, they may be, we are not in any position to diagnose anyone. And being called out for behavior like that will not only upset people who really aren’t disordered, but will also put a lot of stress on people who maybe are disordered but haven’t come to terms with it. Just going through those subs, the people there always talked about their dislike for being associated with ProED.

It's definitely hard to toe the line between encouraging people to stay sick and encouraging them to get better. However, I think that if you have to fall somewhere it should be on the recovery side.  Just as an analogy, when you get your heart broken you do all kinds of self-destructive things because you're hurt. You might obsess over your ex's social media or stop eating or get a rebound or whatever else. And you *know* that's a bad idea, but you don't really care. As one of my friends put it, what you need eventually might not be what you need *right now*.  And I think it's helpful to have a place where you can express those feelings and admit to bad decisions. Where you know that people will support you and care about you and believe you'll be better when you're ready. Especially because it's an isolating experience, and you might be afraid of annoying or scaring your friends and family.   In that process, though, you've still got to be aware that what you're doing is *bad*. Even if you want to be open and honest about your issues, you shouldn't encourage other people to pursue them. And that means not sharing material for the *purpose* of triggering others or worsening your own illness.",False,True

Again, if you or anyone else doesn't want to recover, that's unfortunate and I hope one day you/they find whatever they need that makes them reconsider.
