Like sometimes my hands shake because I'm nervous, but it's not random. Sometimes I wake up in the middle of the night when my breath caught in my throat, but it's not what I'd call breathing problems. My heart might feel like it's coming out of my chest, but there's always a reason I feel that way.   It's definitely worth going to the doctor for if you're having breathing or heart concerns.

This may be anxiety-related (which is totally treatable!), but you never want to brush aside breathing and heart issues just in case).  In the meantime, make sure you're keeping up your electrolytes. (That might help with the twitching.) I really like Propel packets. They're pretty cheap at Walmart or Target for a ten-pack and you mix them in a bottle of water like Crystal Lite. The grape and strawberry-kiwi flavors are the best. (-:",False,False
