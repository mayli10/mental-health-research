I can't blame you for not wanting to try again.  When I was 16 I worked up the courage to talk to a medical professional about my night terrors and (very visible, evident) self-harming, and she just tried throwing some pills at me and told me she couldn't get a referral until she proved she tried. Also shamed me for self-injury. Took me years to feel the confidence to try again, I totally get it.  But! I now have proof that not all medical professionals are like that, and that it *is* possible to have a bad run of hired help thanks to bad luck.  I hope that you, too, decide that ""fuck it, this next one might not be so bad"" is a good attitude to have.  Maybe not tomorrow, or even as soon as is best, but I do hope that day comes for you soon.",False,False

But having negative past experiences has compounded the problem. Past experience has taught that if you ask for help, you won't be helped. You won't be listened to or taken seriously, and you'll walk away feeling worse than you did before, and humiliated. It doesn't matter if you're assertive for once in your life, it makes no difference at all. After every negative experience, I avoid doctors for years at a time. I'm up to 2 years so far. Before last time I saw a GP two years ago, it had been 3 years before I last saw one. It's not so much a fear of doctors, I just really don't like or trust them. Mental health or physical health or sexual health or dental health. They don't care, really. If they did, they'd have taken me seriously and helped me. Oh, well.",False,True

Either is understandable, really, but I do still think it would be worth getting in contact with a therapist at least.  It can be a pain in the ass to find professionals that you feel comfortable with, but their insight and advice is indispensable when navigating the murky waters of mental illness. I might be biased due to lucking out with some good ones where I'm at now, but I know other good ones are out there :)",False,False

It really sounds like you've got a lot going on with you, man.  Are you still seeing mental health professionals?  I feel like having an someone who is listening objectively can really help me when my own Issues (tm) are plaguing me can really help me feel more in control of my problems. Personally I have Bipolar I and cPTSD, so I'm no stranger to feeling like I'm not in control of myself, but I do usually feel a loooot better after therapy. Having advice from someone who has seen your issues in others can really be a game changer.  I feel like I'm far from qualified to try giving you any advice or analysis, but I really am glad that you can identify so much within yourself. Even if it feels like you'll never get that control, awareness of self is the first step to any sort of change or growth, so it's not entirely futile.  I do really wish there was anything I could say or do to truly help.  All us messed up kids have each other here, though, so I hope you continue reaching out, even if it's only to us strangers on the internet.  It's not impossible or entirely unlikely that you will feel better someday, and that you won't hate being alive so much.  I hope that day comes a lot sooner than later for you.  Hang in there, OP.",False,False

Yes. I wish I didn't have body hair. I remember my body before I got fat, when I was younger, and before I grew any body hair, and I miss it. A lot. If I could afford to get laser hair removal, I would. I was skinny and small and hairless.   I also wish I wasn't a sexual being. I was fairly sexual, at relatively a young age, and I was taken advantage of over the internet (and maybe in real life too, I'm not sure). Honestly, I just wish I could be asexual. I've even considered taking medication to that end, but I can't afford it. (I know asexual is an identity to some people, but when I use the word, I just mean a lack of libido and sexual desire. I'm sorry if this offends anyone.)   Similarly, I'd quite like to get a vasectomy. Although I'm gay, and I'll probably never be in a situation where I could anyone pregnant, it would greatly comfort me to know I could *not* have children. I don't want them anyway, but I don't even want the ability to have them. I want it all to end with me... if that makes sense?  I'm also autistic and I fear growing up. Even now, I'm completely dependent on my mother... but one day that'll have to change, and I don't want it to change. I don't think I could handle it. I don't think I can be a functional, independent person. I don't really want to, either.  Basically: I hate that I'm a sexual being. I hate that I have a developed, adult body, and I fear independence.  And yes, I'm very self-aware. Unfortunately, it doesn't really make a difference. If anything, it reaffirms that I am still in control, and I'm not some unaware delusional person, being controlled by their ED and other potential issues (I'm only Officially Diagnosedâ„¢ with Autism and ADHD).",False,True

Specifically wanting to weigh as much as a child?  I see a lot of people talking about their desire to be small and fragile, but are there any other qualities or stereotypes (can't think of a better word, it's late) relating to children that you wish you possessed?  Even if it doesn't seem to help *a lot*, I do think it's really important and very good to be able to identify those irrational thoughts and desires.  Even if you can't control the unhealthy thoughts, you're still aware of them, and I think a lot of people with any sort of mental illness struggle with that.",False,False
