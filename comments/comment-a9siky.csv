I was 145lbs back in October and I definitely hit the ravenous hunger stage where my body was just screaming for food. I've done about 3 weeks of eating 1400 and I've stayed a steady 110lbs. The fear was unreal, but I was blacking out and ended up in hospital because my heart was playing up. I've allowed my body to recover a little bit and catch up, and now I can shift my last 10lbs. Seriously, try going for 1200 just for 2 weeks and you'll see a big difference in your mood and how your body functions without seeing the weight gain. Just let it recover a bit. Be kind to yourself",False,False

Reading the thread, your starting weight in October and your current weight are my exact stats (including height) from my first major bout of anorexia.  I distinctly remember that kind of hunger.   You've lost a lot of weight in a very short amount of time - as I did. The hunger you feel (even on a relatively full stomach) is your body begging for energy and nutrients. That kind of hunger is a kind of desperate torture I wouldn't wish on anyone.   The only real way to stop the hunger is to give your body more of what it needs. I understand that eating 'normally' is probably not an option right now and that's okay. Doing some quick calculations with limited information, it looks like your total energy expenditure at this weight is about 1550 calories. That means that you can eat up to roughly 1550 calories a day without gaining weight (aside from normal fluctuations with digestion). You probably already know that, but it helped me to hear it from a neutral source. Maybe give yourself a rest period of maintenance calories so your body isn't actively starving. That should help with the insatiable hunger.",False,False

Same stats as OP nearly and I have BPD and my hunger switches from non existent to ravenous (as its been doing for like 3 months since getting down to my lowest weights making restricting so fucking hard). Hopefully if I now try to recognize it like I do my mood swings itll make it easier to not give in to binging. ",False,False
