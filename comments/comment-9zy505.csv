I wasn’t fully thinking when I wrote that out. I apologise my choice of words were awful. You can be at an underweight, normal, obese or normal weight and still feel gross at what you see in the mirror. ",False,True

That would be hypocritical and condescending of me; it's not at all what I meant. Also -- yeah, it matters a shit ton.   I meant that the number on the scale does not dictate your level of inner suffering and validity to feel and express it; that's what I saw in this sentence.  ",False,False

I was just referring to this on my own post from a few minutes ago, how it's so messed up that even we think we're getting better, or trying to do good for ourselves (attending a social event, going out on a date), we end up feeling triggered and want to literally shrink ourselves rather than rise and grow.   BTW, regarding this sentence -  &gt;So I’m in the overweight bmi but still look gross.  I know saying so to yourself is hard, but please keep in mind the fact this has nothing to do with your suffering. It's not about the weight and actual, physical looks. It never is.   &amp;#x200B;",False,False
