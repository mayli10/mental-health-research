I know if I actually *had* lost weight I would definitely take this the way it was meant but it's the fact I haven't (might have actually gained) and now I feel like I've misled him and he's gonna be disappointed when we meet up 😓",False,True

Also I just stop talking to everyone completely when I start gaining weight because I don’t want them to see me when I’m “fat”. It’s been 4 months hahahahaha. :/,False,False

In his mind, he wants to compliment you by affirming that you’re working hard to better yourself and that you’re making progress. If he was doing something like a gym regimen and you said something about it, he’d want to hear a compliment given in the same manner.   Granted, this is kind of a fine line between complimentary and douchey — depends on certain contexts, like if he knows you have an ED, if he’s made a lot of comments on your body to an excessive and/or negative degree, etc. — but in most situations, a guy who says something like this is complimenting you.",False,False

Especially women whom do not have an ED, love hearing confirmation if they've lost weight.  So I wouldn't worry too much about it. Otherwise, that guy would be a douchebag.",False,False
