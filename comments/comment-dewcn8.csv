Otherwise , although you may have physically recovered, youâ€™ll still have a negative relationship with food , which is what causes a relapse. Obviously you may gain weight with proper eating - but feeling healthy and having a healthy relationship with food should be your main goal",False,False

I've told a coworker that I would challenge myself to gain 5 lbs of body fat by Christmas. And I feel like complete crap. I've been gaining a little bit of weight and this is too much for me. I tried to make it a goal to gain weight, but everytime I eat and look at myself, I feel more worthless.  I think I'm going to stop with this challenge.",False,True
