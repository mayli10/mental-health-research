What I’m saying is maybe we aren’t the best judge of how we look (we can be our own worst critic with body dysmorphia and all) and that’s true for you too, so while you look at yourself as pretty average looking, people, in fact, look at you as “looking great” regardless of what you weigh. Maybe you are gifted in the bone structure department, and having a low weight isn’t necessary for you to look great. and they  want to tell you so. ",False,False

Obviously idk your mother but just an educated guess from my experience with this sort of thing- it's about control. She was able to control you and keep you down back then with all the diet talk but now the weight is gone she needs a knew way to feed that dynamic.   Also a lot of image obsessed, controlling mothers don't want their image marred by a 'fat daughter', but they also don't want them to be too attractive either.   Whatever the reason you handled it awesomely. ",False,False

Haha good for you girl!   I mean your mom's definitely rude AF. But I feel like you've really hit on some next-level shit with your response. ,False,False

I'm like dont lie to me!  But to your post, your mom probably felt like she was helping you when your were a kid, even if you weren't overweight. That's how my mom was. In 8th grade, I went from around 120lbs at 5 ft tall to 101lbs and I got so much praise but only 1 mention of me not eating enough. Moms seem terrified of having an overweight child out of love, bc they dont want the world to be cruel to them. And it's like getting down to an acceptable weight is ok no matter how you do it but once you are above or below that threshold, they lose their shit. Shes probably concerned but doesnt understand her role in you developing an ed. ",False,False
