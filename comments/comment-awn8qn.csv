My local school shop made the news a few years ago because it's introduced the largest size school uniforms in the country. Kids are getting bigger (and fatter), so it's no surprise that they reach adult sizing   I'm 5ft0 and a size UK 2/ 2.5 in shoes. I don't usually shop in kids as I find the materials to be a lot if synthetics and the details can be quite childish. I do buy kids shoes when I  can, but I have to get my shoes from specialist outlets.   I agree that sizing is just stupid these days. I have a sewing machine and tend to tailor most stuff myself . I have a short waist and 13 inch difference between my waist and hips. I used to live in lycra, but now I have to wear office wear it's a nightmare.  ",False,False

According to this, it would probably be the previous size (12-13 yrs) but that's the one I tried and it didn't fit while the black pants fit. It seems that children clothes are less stretchy than adult's.   I usually go by the height indicated, which for me is generally 148-164cm (although I'm 165cm). ",False,True
