That’s awful.  Your bf should tone up his attitude!!   No you are perfect as you are. If you are healthy and happy, you are perfect. A man worth his salt would be thrilled to be with you and be happy that you’re happy!   I hate that you think he believes you’re plain and worthless to society....if he TRULY loved you- this wouldn’t even be a thought in your mind. I at least think he’s not giving you the emotional support you need if this is how you feel.",False,False

It’s so fake and toxic. I’m glad you quit following triggering stuff. I refuse to use insta for that kind of thing. Plants and cats only!   Damn I don’t like that comment he says, at all. Sure there’s more attractive people out there but fuck man don’t say that shit to your bf/gf! Especially when it wasn’t about you in the first place. Sounds like he’s insanely shallow, and perhaps insecure. Idk OP- I don’t know your relationship at ALL. But I personally couldn’t be with someone who does these things. It would seriously trigger my eating disorder/body image issues. I hope he doesn’t trigger you in this way. Please don’t let him take your sparkle! Someone would love to have a pic of your ass in their wallet, I promise. And someone will love you for you, regardless of any body changes you may have.",False,False

I think it’s highly inconsiderate of him for to be doing it in the first place. Also eff his comment about your butt! There’s no way in hell any woman would find that funny.   As much as I hate to say it, he has a right to look but shouldn’t be doing it in front of you. I get super jealous about that kind of thing myself as I have body image issues so I feel this on a visceral level. It’s so hard trying to feel good about yourself already, ya know? And then watching your bf drool over women that are nothing like you would be fucking torture. He’s in the wrong for that for sure.   You’re amazing as you are, smaller butt and all! I hope your bf makes you feel special in other ways and beautiful besides this issue/incident. If not, maybe it’s time to think about things. You deserve to feel like your bf’s queen and nothing less!",False,False

In my eyes he's perfect, and I can tell him as such. Sure, he compliments me, but even with the compliments I also feel subpar knowing he can still understand to some extent that no matter how much he cares about me, i'm still plain and unattractive and worthless to society.",False,False

But why should I compete with someone who is photoshopped anyways? It’s stupid and I hate feeling like this. I love cosplay too but I had to unfollow a few people because looking at their bodies make me feel like shit.   But my bf says ""there will always be people more attractive than you, same for me” when I try to tell him I think he’s perfect. At least your bf says what he loves about your body. Don’t get me wrong, he tells me I’m pretty/cute/beautiful whatever but, I dunno. Knowing that he collects photos of pretty women and is looking at them all day every day makes me feel like I can’t compete. Bleh.",False,True

My SO really likes kpop and idol girls, cosplayers, etc. and like, I always feel like I should live up to that because he clearly just likes it better!! And even after him saying things like “oh i love your [insert body part here]” or “[insert person] will never look as good as you” i feel like he’s just... wrong or like he doesn’t know that e likes other things so much better",False,False

You gotta tell him that those comments hurt and that he needs to stop.  Anyways, if someone wants you to change for them are they really worth your time? A year is a while but nobody should every try to change the ones they love. Anyways he is probably the kind of guy that thinks fake boobs are real and that hentai bodies are a reality without plastic surgery. (From how you explain him that is) He doesn't seem to appreciate how much effort you've put into yourself.  (Congrats on the weight loss btw :) )",False,False

And he was like yeah I did until I purge my account so I  don't upset you. I was like oh, okay. . .    I don't wanna be like ""hurry up and unfollow everyone, I hate to sound controlling.

Btw congrats on losing 60 pounds. That's a lot of dedication. While my boyfriend doesn't save pictures like that, he is genetically very lean and I've always been thicc. He is body goals and that triggers me half the time I touch him or hug him. During summer I feel worse because he's wearing short sleeves and shorts so I can see his thin arms and legs and go, ""I need those!""  The way you described your SO, I'm sorry to hear the way he treats you. I don't have a lot of info on your relationship so I can't say with certainty, but it seems like a red flag when he pleasures himself with other girls. Following so many cam girls, models, etc. for their physical appearance is kinda shallow in my opinion.    At the end of the day, do what makes you feel better and you think is right for you.",False,False
