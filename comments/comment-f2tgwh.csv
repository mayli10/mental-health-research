But if itâ€™s any consolation, top 5 means nothing. Most people canâ€™t even remember top 5 in the miss America competitions. People just seem to be sharing it bc theyâ€™re like omg I know a famous person. Which wonâ€™t last for long. She has her 5 mins of fame and karma will eventually catch up with her.   She sounds really fucked up emotionally with the way she stalked your social media. No idea how she got into pageantry bc arenâ€™t they at least not supposed to be bullies?",False,False

To anyone who is going through this, please try to bear in mind that there are loads of downsides to being in that industry.

The girl who bullied and belittled me since we were in elementary school is a model, too.

It's gruelling work - you'll miss a lot of sleep and you'll spend the entire day going to casting after casting. Some guys are in the business to take advantage of girls and this is commonplace as well. Also doing photoshoots when you're cold, wet, tired and just want to go home. There's also the massive pressure to lose weight unhealthily and to maintain an extremely underweight BMI. It's super taxing on your mental health, and I doubt she's happy.",False,False
