I think you're onto something about the nutrition; if you're taking supplements and what you do eat is very nutritious, I bet it would help immensely. Also, if you're really active, that'll take it out of you, since that depletes stores even faster.",False,False

I was around BMI 20 when I first did it (though lost ""healthily"" from maybe 23 the few months prior), and at low 19s I still felt like I was in heaven (although for my height that was only like a 4-lb difference lol) until my food quality got worse and worse, and then around the underweight range I just felt exhausted more and more frequently while purposely walking. I guess it does help that you were smart enough to pay attention to nutrition because back then I thought calories were the *only* factor in keeping me functional",False,True

And that was without much fasting as when I first started (like I probably hadn't done 20+ hours for a year), so I'd imagine your experience was way worse, especially when it gets to the point of physically interfering with quality sleep (well, being way too alert to sleep is one thing, but having to suffer through longer hours of pain is another). That sounds so horrible ðŸ˜­  Did you ever get the random calf cramps and numb hands/legs? I think those are due to low potassium but I'm not sure.",False,True

I'd occasionally get a little woozy when standing up too fast after 48 hours, but it wasn't too bad and never interfered with my life. I did pay attention to my vitamins and minerals and did what I could to keep them good. However, I've fasted on and off since my early teens, so maybe I'm more accustomed to deprivation, lol.",False,False

I do think that it is due to malnutrition, like the stronger and longer it gets the harder it gets to fo anything honestly, including fasting.  By sick i meant besides being dizzy and getting headaches, the reason i had to break that 60hr one was a) joint pains b) insomnia it got to the point where i could cry from the pain in my legs it was so intense. My usual ED caused insomnia got way worse and i had these added joint pains at night.",False,False

I'm wondering if it's not only a low-ish body fat that makes fasting more difficult, but also malnutrition, if you did it a lot. And what did you mean by sick?

Fasting definitely ramps up my appetite and hunger hormones for when I start eating too - I can be full and still feel depleted, but I notice that even if I fast for the same amount of time, the urge to continue eating is not AS strong if I give myself time to eat ""later,"" not that I have to end the meal and then fast for another 23 hours. And I don't hold it off forever, but for maybe an hour or two before I eat something again. Did you ever experience something like that?",False,True

I'd eat 1000-1200 calories in a sitting and it'd make me even more hungry than if I'd eaten nothing and just kept fasting, or broke a fast with a small amount of food.

Longest fast i've done was 60 hours - a intended 72 but i had to stop because of how sick i felt. Have done occasional 48 hr water fasts too, and due to all this doing 24 was incredibly easy! sometimes i used to accidentally complete them, BUT now i don't know what changed but i can barely last ~20 hours. It drives me mad! 24 used to be nothing to me and now i can't even reach that bar. Concerning OMAAD,  i've never done a proper one, There is no way my brain will let me eat 1200 calories in one sitting lmao. The only OMAAD i've done was once, on i think ~500 cals.",False,False
