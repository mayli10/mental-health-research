I think my ED is 100% tied to the fact that I hold all my weight in my stomach and am constantly fixated on it, and lately I've been considering that the only way to stop my ED is to get liposuction, just as the treatment for gender dysphoria is hormones and surgery. I wonder if there's any research on BDD and dysphoria and treatment?",False,False

My friends brother is trans, and was explaining what his gender dysphoria felt like and it was like hearing someone describe exactly how I felt about my body and fade except I don‚Äôt feel as if my body is the wrong gender I just feel as if my body and face don‚Äôt FIT me. I‚Äôve felt this way since I was a teeny tiny little girl. I‚Äôve talked about it with my friends brother and other trans friends and they‚Äôve all told me that it sounds like I‚Äôm feeling, and have always felt, a very similar thing to what they felt before transitioning. I don‚Äôt believe I have body dysmorphia, I KNOW how I look and it just doesn‚Äôt fit, it doesn‚Äôt feel right, it never has.   I think these feelings are a big reason I developed BED (it‚Äôs hard to care about making your body grossly overweight when it doesn‚Äôt feel like the body you should have), and they most certainly contribute to my restrictive ED now.   A great deal of my stress regarding my appearance lifted when I began getting non-surgical cosmetic procedures (fillers) that make look more aligned with how I feel on the inside. In fact the day I got my first fillers I stopped low restricting and stopped purging and literally haven‚Äôt even felt a twinge of an urge to do so even ONE TIME since, and it‚Äôs been over 5 years. I don‚Äôt feel the need to increase the amount of fillers or go more extreme with them either.   I‚Äôve resolved that when I reach 120lbs and/or under 20% body fat, I‚Äôm going to have my inevitable loose skin removed, and also go about getting additional cosmetic procedures to address my other areas of dysphoria.   I really do wonder if some people diagnosed with BDD are actually dysphoric rather than dysmorphic.",False,False
