It changes just as much as yours. She probably does mirror checks for a food belly that's just as big as yours when you eat. Especially if you're teenagers, she probably hates her body quite a bit too.  If she doesnt have an ED, she stays the ""same weight"" by eating healthy in the moments you dont see her. It's also possible that she fasts between big meals, or has a myriad of unhealthy behaviors.  Dont judge someone based on what you see them eat only when you're with them, it's unrealistic and incomplete. &lt;3",False,False
