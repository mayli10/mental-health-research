I can't even remotely find a middle ground - either I stick to my low restrict daily calories and I'm tired and hungry when I'm with people, or I let myself eat with them and then switch into binge mode and want to be alone to eat. I feel you. I hope it gets easier x",False,True

Even when things were good I was tired and stressed by restricting, binging, whatever. He tried to be helpful and was very sweet about it but he didn't understand. I hope it gets easier! You deserve to eat and enjoy things with your boyfriend x",False,True

I tell myself that I am functioning because of the weird ED perfectionism but I'm exhausted at college and can't perform, I'm exhausted with friends, all I want to do is stay in bed with my laptop. Is that a life? Hang in there x",False,True

I haven't eaten with my friends in ages and even they told me they are sad that I don't join them for lunch. So today I had a pad thai with them and it was great catching up but my mind is just counting the calories. And my family is having dinner tonight and my brother's girlfriend even ordered in a ~special chicken~. One of my work friends have recently started to ask me out for lunch regularly and that means I don't get to skip lunch anymore. Man I really miss skipping lunch and csing alone in my room. ,False,False

It's honestly been the only bad thing about moving in with my boyfriend; I get maybe an hour or two of alone time a week if I get home before him. I feel obligated to eat with him and only with him. I can't binge because he might see; I struggle to fast or heavily restrict because he might notice.   Recently I've been doing OMAD so on days we work we have dinner together and I say I'm not very hungry. But on days we both are off I hate it, even though I love spending time with him. I wish my ED brain would let me enjoy going on dates out but it always involves eating and I obsess over what to have the whole day. Is this too small and suspicious? Will eating more cause me to not enjoy the date because I'll be having a silent panic attack or going to purge in the bathroom?   Sorry for the wall of text",False,False
