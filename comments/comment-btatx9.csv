I think starving myself to lose weight is sick. I might adopt and enjoy healthy eating habits and behaviors, (more water, healthier whole food, fasting, exercise) but in my mind they all have the added benefit to contributing to weight loss, and an unhealthy mindset.   I know a lot of people eating tons of sugar, fat and calories throughout the day. Mentally, they are doing miles better than me. However, if I had a healthier mindset and still had these behaviors, restricted calories, fasted sometimes and was underweight...I also probably wouldn't consider myself sick as long as my mind stayed right.",False,False

Others eating unhealthily with lot's of sugars and transfats does not mean having anorexia is ""the way humans are meant to live"".",False,False

I get what you’re trying to say though because I think sort of the some way and believe our diets were better as it was more varied with different foods and healthier foods as such as none of it was processed.   But our ancestors ate anything back then as paleo humans would eat mostly anything they saw and if they vomited after eating it then they knew not to eat it in future when foraging.",False,False
