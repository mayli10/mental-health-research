I would consider it a real possibility at 15, but that's mostly because at that point I can't see myself mentally functioning well enough to do my job and take care of myself (single person, living alone, lots of responsibility in my career).",False,False

That said, I donâ€™t think it depends only on BMI. At least thatâ€™s what I tell myself because I feel like a fraud for never having gone to IP even with a fairly low BMI. I think itâ€™s more dependent on your mental and physical stability, and also if youâ€™re open to actually considering IP.",False,False

Rather it was more often overall functioning and medical stability that determined both my treatment team's recommendation and whether insurance covered an IP stay. I've been IP at BMI 24-26 5 times on ED units with people both way thinner and way larger than me. Maybe if you have an anorexia diagnosis it's different, but I can't see BMI being the only thing that matters in determining the level of care needed. The decision to go inpatient was made when I could not be treated at a lower level of care and needed 24/7 supervision to avoid using ED behaviors.",False,False

I was at a normal BMI.  For eating disorders, I've done inpatient, intensive outpatient and residential and in each of those groups there was a very large range of BMIs.  I reason I went to treatment was I was absolutely terrified of gaining weight but couldn't stop binging (and sometimes purging) after my first restriction cycle.  During intake they seemed to care way more about your behaviors than your current weight.  Of course treatment and meal plans were personalized to fit the needs of each patient though.",False,False

I b/p, so never lost a ton of weight but ended up telling my parents I needed help around bmi 17. I've been in and out of inpatient for other mental stuff for 2ish years now, so my situation won't reflect the average experience.  Feel free to ask any questions. ðŸ’– I hope you end up getting the help you need.",False,False
