But it got better. It took a lot of self love and a lot of love from other people in my life (and tbh my mum telling me my hair was falling out) but I stopped the worst habits and eventually started eating intuitively to maintain.  Mind you, I relapsed a month or two ago but this time I'm actively avoiding a lot of the behaviours I indulged in last time so it's a ""healthier"" relapse.   So I can promise you, it takes a lot of courage and time but it will get better.

It was an involuntary hospitalization, and I don't think I would be here if it weren't for that. I know you're drained right now, but consider going to the ER, please. üíõ",False,False
