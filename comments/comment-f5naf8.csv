I don’t necessarily have anything to relate about the specifics of this post; I thought this was gonna mention something about you gaining weight from a relationship bc that’s what has happened to me. I am nearing a year with the love of my life and he’s great but I find myself eating— (more calories and more frequently)— being with him and that sucks so much. He has insta but honestly doesn’t follow anything to jack off to or nothing I have knowledge of him jacking off to. He follows maybe a handful of models or famous gals but none that are popular for me to come across; furthermore he doesn’t seem to feel the need to get himself off as much as I do he’s honestly perfect In that aspect but maybe I’m naive but I don’t truly believe it. He literally follows nearly 400 ppl and half are meme accounts and that’s srsly what we always DM each other on a daily basis so I don’t mind. It’s actually surprising yet worrisome bc I feel like “err why don’t or wouldn’t you follow these girls that’s weird” but I genuinely love and accept and respect it. Just be glad you didn’t gain any “relationship weight”. It’s hard to control this even if you have a strong weight loss/diet/restriction plan, it’s hard to maintain that when you spend all your time with your significant other; ugh. However I’m sorry you’re going through this and feel this way. I hope things change. Much love to you friend ♥️.",False,False

I was on the skinnier side as well but when I saw the girls he was into had the Kardashian body type I instantly obsessed about gaining a bigger butt.  I shoved food down my throat every day and lifted weights until I was on the brink of passing out to gain more (m)ass *haha* and when I finally did have a nicer butt I started starving myself all over again because I hated the extra weight. I still obsess about it, and constantly feel hypersensitive about my body shape and ass size getting smaller but I just cant get myself to continue eating.  *sigh*",False,True
