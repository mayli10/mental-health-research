Baby steps my friend.   What are the things that make you happy? Even for just a moment? Prioritize them. Make it a point to do one thing each day that makes you feel good (given that it’s not self-destructive). I feel like it can be really hard to jump straight into functionality when you’re feeling so down and lost for so long. Take the time to heal yourself a little, so that you’re ready to take another step toward being functional. And then soon bunny can run around for 3 hours 15 minutes! Then 3.5, then 4, and that’s such progress.  There’s a quote I found in the footnotes of a book the other day. I think it was meant to be a literal translation note, but it means so much more to me: “The term ‘subjects’ denotes those who know and act, in contrast to ‘objects’ which are known and acted upon.” I know I’ve definitely been in places where I felt like an object in my own life. Powerless and just existing out of obligation. It comes and goes — I might even feel that way tomorrow. Who’s to say. Being a subject can be burdensome and take so much work and investment. Life can really try its best to make an object out of you. But I promise you that you are a subject — strong, capable, persevering, and making your own way. ❤️",False,False
