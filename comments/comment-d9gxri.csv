You just have to accept that you are going to feel anxious while your body readjusts. It might feel unbearable and some really horrible feelings and thoughts might surface but just remind yourself that this is because you are coming off medication so quickly.  Is there anyone that you can tell that you have done this? Maybe a school nurse?,False,False

I think you should tell you doctor though so they can keep an eye on you",False,False
