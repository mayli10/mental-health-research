I love love love skinny guys/ottermode/chadbod, and eventually came to terms one reason I do is because they trigger me. Running my hands across a guy with such little body fat is so satisfying - but when they grab my hips or stomach it makes me mentally scream.

So I'm a gross blob in the middle....",False,False
