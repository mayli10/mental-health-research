I wouldn't be able to see myself dedicating enough time to anything but food. Or even worse, trying to dedicate my life to my ED while trying to enter a field and establish a career. So why not get the best of both worlds. Keeps my ED happy and allows me to contribute being productive.  Unfortunately, I occasionally find ED hacks due to my field (or, not necessarily usually hacks per se but more so knowing what exactly to do to minimize gastric emptying before I can purge my binge, what to do to fast for longer, where to exactly touch to stimulate the most innervated areas of the pharynx/palate for the gag reflex, etc.), but for the most part, it's better this way. I tend to have orthorexic patterns when restricting anyway, but knowing just how important say Calcium is for certain necessary reactions in the body just makes me appreciate food more and helps me at least get my orthorexic OMAD in rather than trying to subsist solely on b/p's 24/7 (of course, I can't control doing that sometimes, but I try my hardest not to and not to feel guilty about keeping some veggies and chicken down).",False,False
