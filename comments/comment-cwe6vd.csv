My friend is a few years older than me and has had a baby. She's thin and keeps going on about how she WOULD LOVE to gain 10kg. She's around 5'6 and weighs 58kg so I have no idea why she would want to be 68kg. Anyway it feels so bad when she's complaining how hard it is to gain weight when I blow up as soon as i even smell a slice of pizza,False,False
