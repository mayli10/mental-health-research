Honestly, I literally cannot taste the difference between diet and non-diet soda (my sense of smell is quite bad so taste is not great either), so why would I ever drink sugary soda??? If you had two pizzas of EXACTLY the same taste, ingredients and size, but one had a 1000 calories more, why would you ever pick the more calorific one? Even someone who's not disordered wouldn't do that.",False,False
