I get an ear full about wasting food and money and ruining everyone's night ðŸ¤¡",False,False

I donâ€™t know how long youâ€™ve been hanging out with this guy or how long you imagine him being in your life but sometimes I could like trick myself into eating around certain people by telling myself weird things like that they donâ€™t know anything about calories or I wonâ€™t know them in a year and then I was allowed to eat around them always and it was WEIRD. idk if anyone else has had that but it was a strange thing that worked for me on odd occasion. Sorry youâ€™re struggling:((((( it sucks so much.,False,False
