I could post stories about my partner that make him out to be a horrible person, but realize in posting here, it's in a very specific context ie, Eating Disorder, and that's not the best judge of someone's behaviour or who they are as a person.",False,False

Even the people who don’t have BPD need to remember that malnutrition creates more rigid, black &amp; white thinking and what makes sense to our ED brain wouldn’t make sense to a non-disordered brain.",False,False

I really wish I had recognized those red flags myself early on in my relationship, but I didn’t have the knowledge at that time. I think some people on here are just trying to save other girls from the heartache and damage they experienced.",False,False

It's hard to deal with that grey area and realize that not everyone is out to hurt you or others.  When I see it on this sub, I mostly see it as everyone trying to protect each other because we're fragile enough already, let's be real.  But it is something the mods should address and look into with how often it's happening.",False,False

You worded it better than I could.  So many people have that black or white thinking, and I’m not trying to excuse people who do display problematic or abusive behaviours, but the world isn’t divided into absolute angels and disgusting abusers, there is so much grey area.   I know that black or white thinking plays a part in quite a lot of disorders, I know I struggle with it, but sometimes people just don’t know when to draw that line n chill y’know?",False,True

Unsolicited advice, especially when that advice is ""dump him"", is really unhelpful. There's a reason why the majority of advice/support subs and fb groups have a thing against people telling others to just break up with their partner.   What does that achieve if you're getting a brief, one-sided glimpse of one problem in a likely multi-year relationship? One small incident doesn't need to be a catalyst for the end of a relationship. People are capable talking things out like adults.  And unless the OP is explicitly asking if they should dump their partner, y'all need to c h i l l.",False,False

I never comment or give advice because I don’t know the whole story and honestly am in no place to give advice lmao, but I also do a big old yikes whenever I read a story about someone’s partner here.",False,False
