You can post as much as you want about whatever you want.. your friends click on your feed instead of strolling through bullshit like fb or insta.. so when people respond to your posts they actively looked at your feed. You get close to a few people that you have a lot in common with and it is just soooo supportive! Ive been missing it so much since its been down.. I didnt realize how much I used it to talk about my failures and victories regarding my ED.,False,False

Itâ€™s easy to post things to and takes like 10 seconds and I good way to keep up with friends on here. Most of us got it as a back up plan in case this sub goes down. You need to add people as friends in order to see their posts. Itâ€™s chill  @anxiety_and_theatre,False,False
