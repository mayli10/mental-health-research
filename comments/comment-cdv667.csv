If your obs are unstable, you'll likely be sent to a medical ward to stabilise them and then possibly have a stay in mental health as well, with the goal being to have you eating a meal plan. If you've got private health it might be worth looking into whether any of the hospitals around you have a specialist ed program.  &amp;#x200B;  If you refuse treatment and the doctor thinks you are too compromised, they can put you on a treatment order. Your best bet is to comply as you'll have more control over what happens to you.",False,False

""stable"" meaning no tachycardia or bradycardia (a stable heart rate lying/standing), no dizziness or blackouts and a bmi over 15.  i've been twice and i had to go on a meal plan which gradually increased from around 1400 kcal to 2800kcal over a period of 3 weeks. yes, it does suck. and yes, you have to eat. otherwise, you get to try a nutritional drink (sustagen or something similar), and if you dont drink it, you get it via a nasal gastric tube. you're also probably not going to be allowed to walk or move out of bed, i had to sit in the shower and be wheeled via wheelchair to the bathroom. a nurse may or may not supervise you in there, for me, they did. (If anyone asks if youve ever thrown up before: say no)",False,False
