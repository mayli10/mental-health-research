I was in a much more recovered mindset when I first moved to college but was binging alllll the time at home, when I got to my dorm, having total control over what I bought (and also sharing a kitchen that almost always had people in it lol) PLUS the total change in circumstances meant my binging mostly disappeared. Maybe try to put together some new habits you'd like to put in place and build the food stuff around that instead of making it the focus?",False,False

My last year of high school I couldn‚Äôt really restrict at all because my mom was always on my case. I tried crash dieting a few times my first year but i always gave it up when I found I couldn‚Äôt concentrate on my cell &amp; molec textbook. Also I got super involved with different groups on campus so I was always surrounded by people and distracted. It‚Äôs super hard to engage in ED and still have a social life.   As an adult now living on my own my ED came raging back...after I legitimately thought I was ‚Äúcured‚Äù in college.,False,False

Personally, I was freaked out about the unknown calories in the dining hall food so I restricted to high heaven. On the other hand, b/p-ing is way harder, particularly if you have a roommate",False,False

You really have to have the drive to be better because no one is really there to hold you accountable other than yourself. sorry if I made this sound grim af  Good luck though friend, you've got this! Feel free to reach out if you have any other Qs about college living or something :) ",False,False

My dorm didn‚Äôt even have a mini fridge and my car was super far away so it was a big trip to have to go get food when I had the cafeteria right there.  And in the cafeteria around other people I felt more pressured to eat normal portion meals.  My ED developed during this time for unrelated reasons but honestly my ED got worse once I didn‚Äôt have that option.  So it just might have saved me a year of (worse) suffering when I lived there.,False,False
