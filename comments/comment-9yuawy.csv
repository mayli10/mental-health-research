I’ve ruined my teeth, stomach, digestive system... It’s a sinister addiction, I started purging blood two days ago and I kept going til everything was out. Then sobbed in the shower for 15 minutes because in the end, it’s self harm.  The first time is easy, then you’re purging blood. Please, please don’t fall down that rabbit hole 💜 ",False,False

I would just purge out enough to feel comfortable enough to sleep. That started transitioning into purging as much as I could every time I binged, which was basically every time I smoked. Then one day, I just... couldn't. I ate the same amount but when I came home and went to the bathroom to purge, nothing came out. I was in the bathroom for hours, sticking fingers and toothbrushes down my throat. I was gagging and spitting up tons of saliva and the water I drank to help it come up, but nothing. Came. Out. I thought it was a fluke but I haven't been able to purge since.   &amp;#x200B;  Obviously purging is really horrible and leads to horrible side effects, but consider another possibility: you start binging more and more, depending on purging as your escape. Your calorie count goes higher and higher week after week. And then one day, you just... can't. You think it's a one-off and the next time you binge, you try to purge but but still nothing comes up. The addiction of purging has led your binges to skyrocket but now you're left unable to get rid of any of it. You can't stop binging so you spend hours in the bathroom, crying and retching so hard you start getting shooting cramps in your stomach and sides. You see blood on your fingers because you keep scratching up your esophagus. You finally give up, not because you want to but because you know your family is waking up soon and you don't want them to catch you tear-stained over the toilet bowl. You wake up, dehydrated and disoriented, and you weigh yourself. Horrified, you start restricting to try to offset the binge. If you have BED/EDNOS, you end up binging anyway. If you don't have BED/EDNOS, the restricting leads you to developing it.   &amp;#x200B;  On one hand, I am immensely grateful that I didn't develop full-blown bulimia. On the other hand, my BED tendencies exponentially increased while my ""out"" was taken away from me. I don't know how to cope so I've been spiraling deeper and deeper into my ED, whatever the fuck it's morphing into. My experience with it is nowhere near as bad as most anons, but it is still ruining my life. There is truly no possible outcome of purging that isn't horrible. ",False,False

I remember the first time I purged I deadass burst out laughing it was so easy and I hadn't expected it to be like that.  It doesn't stay that way. You tear at your throat. You gag reflex becomes numb from regular abuse. I went from barely needing to tickle the back of my throat with one finger to having to put my entire fucking hand in and use toothbrushes and shit. There was a point when even that didn't work. My body just flat out refused for a while and I'd end up crying in the bathroom.  I remember when every time I purged it felt good. That rush. That feeling of power. I also remember when that was replaced by just feeling tired. Crying as I did it. Just feeling scared by what I'm doing. Realising how out of control I was. Even now I swing between deluding myself that it's no problem at all and being mortified.  &amp;#x200B;  It becomes a habit. An addiction. A crutch that's always there. You try to recover and all you can think about is purging 'just this once' you restrict and think about purging 'to feel better'. I often binge not because i want the food, but because I want to purge.",False,False

Like when you eat a little too much at a work brunch and decide you'll just have another plate and purge on your lunch break but end up getting held on a conference call for an hour and you're driving home behind school bus traffic sweaty and nauseous and anxious, seriously contemplating just vomiting on yourself and hosing your car out when you get home.  Or the first time you burst a blood vessel in your eye and have to come up with a reason for it, then it happens again the next month and your co-workers think you're genuinely dying.  Or the first time you get heart palpitations while purging and genuinely believe that you're going to die crouched over the toilet and your husband will come home and find your bloated body half-naked and your family will be too ashamed to talk about you ever again, and your cat will eventually push open the bathroom door like he always does and won't understand why you're not responding to him.  &amp;#x200B;  When your list of safe foods gets smaller and smaller based on what's easiest to purge.  When you realize you've maxed out your credit card and most of it was on fast food and junk food.  When you hide wrappers in the trunk of your car so your husband doesn't find them.  When your fingers start to crack from the cleaning spray that you use to clean the toilet when you're done.  When you can't get your mouth to feel clean no matter how many times you brush your teeth or chew gum.  When your breakfast becomes a trigger meal because fuck it, I'll purge it all and do better at lunch.  When b/p becomes one of the only things that you feel like you have any control over, and any stressful situation or argument or bad day in general leads to a three-hour long session of stuffing your face until the very idea of whatever you're eating makes you want to cry then desperately trying to purge it all out until your stomach muscles are sore, your throat is raw, you can't see through how much your eyes are watering, and you're literally choking on your own stomach bile and snot.  &amp;#x200B;  Purging is an addiction, and it starts off with an adrenaline rush, that feeling that you're able to cheat yourself, but it devolves quickly.  I've been purging for 15 years and have permanently damaged my esophagus- I started carrying a bottle of Tums around with me in college because my acid reflux was so bad, and I still have it 10 years later and take maximum strength antacids.  The endoscopy doctor told me that I can lessen it with diet but that it probably won't ever completely go away.  It's so bad when I don't have my pills that I can't wear a bra or any pants that go higher than my belly button because even the smallest bit of pressure causes pain.  And I still purge when I feel out of control because it's one of my only coping mechanisms.  Don't start, it's really really not worth it.",False,False

I love that empty feeling, and when I binge/purge, my brain still thinks I've ""eaten"", so I can go even longer without eating. It's ridiculously addictive and affected my physical health in negative ways. My gag reflex is so sensitive now, I can't deepthroat my bf and I can't drink alcohol besides beer because I vomit so easily. Not to mention it's also disgusting. I've watched myself purge in a mirror before and just....wow. I stopped for a week after that. You sometimes smell like puke too. When my ED flares up, I can't even keep nail polish on my right hand because the stomach acids erode it all.   It's not a habit I'd recommend to anyone. If you're disciplined enough, stick with restriction. I wish I could.",False,False

Even if you try to stop you'll start thinking, what if I can just get this up really quick? Then it's like you just forget all of the uncomfortable and tough purges, or the post purge exhaustion, and do it again. You fall into a cycle of desperation. Eat, feel desperate to get it out no matter what, purge. I started purging a couple of months ago, fast forward to now and I'm doing it 3x daily. It feels so hopeless how I'll binge and then it's back to face the toilet bowl again, with the amount of food that I need to eat to be satisfied constantly increasing. It feels physically uncomfortable and hurts somewhat when I try to induce vomiting now, and my cheeks always feel a bit swollen. I also feel like it's very difficult to function due to purging even though I'm at a normal weight and otherwise eat normally, and try to replace electrolytes... but I still can't get myself to stop.",False,False

I burped in the shower after a big meal and found out that I'm able to empty my stomach without having to use the gag reflex at all. I'm pretty sure it has something to do with me naturally having a loose stomach-esophagus port, as both of my parents have acid reflux. All I do is bend over and blast all the food out out manually.  Ever since then it's been on-off with purging, as of now I've been in a binge/purge cycle for a week after being clean for a month. I can literally excuse myself for a 2 minute bathroom break to completely silently throw up a +1000 calorie meal. Sometimes I can purge 4 times a day, but nobody has ever suspected anything. Everyone thinks that the rule of purging escalating doesn't apply to them, but it always does. The first time opens the Pandora's box.",False,False
