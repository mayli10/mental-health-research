I can’t wait for a journalist to finally get a handle on the story. How this woman Tanya Zuckerbrot promotes an eating disorder as much with her clients as with her staff. Everyone is either so scared of her to speak up or totally Suffering from Stockholm syndrome. She sells this diet and keeps people on step 1 which is not a calorie over 1000 calories, but makes it glamour by sharing an obnoxiously lavish lifestyle. It’s literally don’t eat so you can live rich like me. She makes people sick mentally and physically but someone everything gets erased from the internet. I bet this spot will as well. Some of her old clients are finally getting together with old employees all PTSD literally... still expecting to see this post removed somehow she pays people off to get the truth off the internet",False,False

I don’t know why those other two comments are so negative. I read the book because my sister gave it to me. I aimed for about 25-35g of fiber a day - no it did not make me poop like crazy. It regulated me and it was amazing. I fell off the wagon because of my graduation and the holidays but slowly getting back on :) what questions did you have about it?,False,False

On one hand, increasing your vegetable and thereby your fiber intake is very good for your health, energy, and longevity. Diets low in vegetables (and fiber) tend to be higher in cholesterol, refined sugar, and salt, which lead to numerous health problems in excess: I'm sure you know this, so I won't go on about it too much. Basically, the foundation of the diet is strong and is based in solid nutritional science.   That said, this program also has problems. For one thing, the total daily caloric allowance is 1100, which is far too low for most people. I mean, in this sub caloric restriction to this and even greater degree is super common, so you're probably hyper aware of that too.   My other issue with this and honestly most diet ""programs"" is that Tanya Zuckerbrot, the creator, has basically taken good nutritional advice (vegetables and fiber are good for you and essential for a healthy lifestyle) which is widely available for free and well-known of its own accord, and spinned it into a profitable product for an absurd price. On the website,  she's selling her book, which will presumably tell you what you already know about veggies and give you some meal plan of unknown strictness (I can't see it without buying it), and also some expensive ""F-Factor approved"" protein bars. Like???  You don't need that shit. It's a waste of your money to pay to be told something you already know. The only maybe valuable part of this program is the meal plan, which I get the appeal of because it lays out exactly what you'll be eating for several weeks. However, see point #1 about the calories: it's unsustainable. Doubly so if you end up not even liking the meals and choking them down until you can't take it anymore, cave, ""fall off"" the program or ""fail"" the diet and binge, and then you're back where you started, plus extra guilt and shame and minus the $24.99 you paid to get there. Not worth it.  TL;DR: waste of time and money. You already know veggies are good for you, try finding ones you like and incorporating them into your diet naturally.   (Sorry for the novel lmao)",False,False

Not great for anyone with gut issues, awesome if you want to blow out your asshole with burning shits fifteen times a day, promotes eating way too much phytic- and oxalic-acid-rich foods so you'll end up with zinc and calcium deficiencies if you do it for any significant length of time.  Hard pass.",False,False
