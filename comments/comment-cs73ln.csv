Believe me, it's much better to do this than to keep getting stuck in the binge-restrict cycle. You will end up gaining more weight that way. You have to have no calorie deficit for a while in order for your body to relax and not feel like you have to binge. I have no idea what your weight is and I hesitate to encourage anyone to lose weight ever, but think of it this way - would you rather take a break from losing weight for a few weeks and just maintain, and nourish yourself so your body and brain can relax and you won't feel the need to binge, or just keep going in this cycle for the next X # of years (because that is what will happen), and as a result likely gain a lot of weight because your body is freaking out? You can always go back to losing weight in a moderate way later when your body has stabilized, it will be easier and healthier. You say you want to restrict heavily because you'll be skinny that way but the tough truth is that heavy restriction is not the way to get thin long-term, because it will end in binging and rebound weight gain. You just have to resist that voice that's telling you the only way to get thin is to heavily restrict. Your body can't handle even a moderate deficit right now because it's sending the message that it needs a break.",False,False
