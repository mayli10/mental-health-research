We are not alone and many of us have had EDs since we were younger. Some of us developed them when we got older or after a divorce or after our kids moved out.,False,True

They probably have worse issues, they just put on a good front at work. Just try to do your best and maybe eat in your cubicle or with your office door closed if possible. Or go outside to eat if you can.",False,True

You aren’t a fraud...you are just not taking care of your health. There are doctors that smoke and eat or drink too much. They are simply human like every body else.  You deserve the same attention and care you give to your patients.,False,True

Would a doctor working feel like they're a fraud if they were battling cancer? No.,False,False

The alcoholism may be seen as deadlier than the AN ? They are both deadly illnesses to have, and they both require specialized help. I think alcohol would increase my bingeing, would make it harder to stick to whatever my food plan was.  Stay strong, you can overcome this.",False,True

I’m (almost) 37 and it’s really hard to function amongst other adults who look at me (and my eating habits) as completely off. I have had issues with food since age 11 though I was only diagnosed with an eating disorder when the restriction got me supremely underweight. All the years of binging and yo-yo dieting just felt normal since it’s what I grew up with. I wish there were other people in real life that are my age that I could talk to. I feel alone in my struggle.,False,False
