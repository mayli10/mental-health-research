I thought later that I think I mixed up the roads a bit when talking to the police (the accident happened when someone was trying to merge and there were a few different places people could merge from) but I hope he got the gist of what I was saying and that didn't invalidate what I said. Like I said, I've seen too many people get screwed over on things like this. Thank you for validating my anxiety, it seemed like I was more shaken up then he was and he was the one that got hit lol.",False,True

I'm glad the one I witnessed wasn't that bad, I'm sure if I saw blood or an ambulance I would have been in a lot worse condition, but thankfully I feel a bit better this morning. Thank you for your concern â™¡ I hope you're feeling better as well",False,True

Even though itâ€™s hard and is accompanied by some distress for us, you 100% did the right thing by eating something afterwards (esp with some sugar etc in). You were likely experiencing mild shock. I promise you were NOT being greedy or lazy, or anything even close to that. Take care of yourself as you recover from this &lt;3",False,False

I witnessed a car accident death earlier this year, and ended up just recently getting a PTSD diagnosis after months of emotional disturbance and flashbacks, and one panic attack.

Add in someone trying to intimidate you? My anxiety levels would be off the charts. I think it was really brave of you to stay and Iâ€™m sure those who werenâ€™t at fault were very thankful. I hope you feel better. Be kind to yourself. ðŸ’œ",False,False
