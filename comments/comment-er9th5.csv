My best friend since high school grew up in a somewhat similar situation - her parents were divorced, both self absorbed assholes. She got bullied a lot. And she cut herself a TON. We're adults now, her arms are totally covered in very visible scars. And she openly admits that she totally did it for attention. She was scared and spiralling and nobody seemed to see how bad she was doing and there was this thought that maybe, if she made the pain something that other people could see, maybe they'd notice. Maybe they'd start caring, and worrying about her, instead of rolling their eyes and waiting for her to shut up.  &amp;#x200B;  WHICH IS REALLY FUCKING BAD. If you need other people to pay attention to you so badly you are willing to seriously injure yourself to do it, you are not fucking okay. Things are going wrong. It is valid.   &amp;#x200B;  We all need to be cared for. And when nobody cares, and we ask, and people still don't care, bad shit is gonna go down.",False,False

Sometimes I wish I was sick just so I could be cared for. I feel like I've grown too fast and I'm too old to be looked after, especially being 31 and still living at home. Atleast if I was sick then it doesn't seem so bad still living there. It's a more valid excuse than ""she can't afford to buy a house"" or ""she broke up with her bf and moved home"".",False,False

One of the worst things about loneliness is that when left unsoothed, lonely people tend to increase the intensity of their attempts to connect with others.

To call somebody ""attention seeking"" is accurate - because we all seek out attention daily, whether or not we want to admit that.   People often labeled as ""attention seeking"" have simply never learned how to have those needs met in a healthy way, or how to seek them out functionally (something we should learn at home with our familial relationships), and I hate that our society demonizes the people who aren't fortunate enough to learn those things. If our parents were horrific at parenting, that's not our fault, and often times, we're just doing the best we can to get by. There is nothing less valid about somebody who developed struggles, due to growing up in a malfunctioning home, and is just trying to find that care/healthy attention to the best of their ability.  Especially since... well..... look at fucking social media? Lol. It's all ""LOOK AT ME"", in the same fashion, except it's socially acceptable.  \-Love somebody, who spent a lot of time in the same place &lt;3 hugs!",False,False

Whether its  pan handlers or raging teens acting out or someone with a mental illness or someone exaggerating physical problems. If you're crying out for attention, you obviously wouldn't be doing it if you weren't suffering in some way. And suffering deserves empathy and care and love.",False,False
