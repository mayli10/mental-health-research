All my weight and all the impact.   I tore my meniscus from over use.   I broke my foot because I went to take a shot and another player kicked my foot. So ya, most of my injuries are the result of other people.   I'm not sure. I do thrive on team sports, but I don't have the time for competitive sports anymore so I may switch to solo swimming or co ed volleyball. I just can't wait to start running again! After a full day's work my knee is still so swollen and I can barely bend it :(",False,False

I stop when I get injured. How did your injury happen?  What sport are you thinking of?",False,True

Serious injuries. I can barely walk after some of them, but force myself to work my physically demanding job. So, if I'm being honest, I don't. At least not for long enough period of time to actually recooperate.   I did, finally quit my sport a few weeks ago. Officially. I plan to take up a much lower impact sport soon that has little risk of injury.",False,False

How do you chill on the compulsive exercise? I've been at the gym for 3-5 hours a day doing the stationary bike and working out as many muscle groups as possible. I've been consumed x.x,False,True

Feeling sad? Run. Ate too much? Clean. Have a lot to think about? Meal prep. I like to channel my energy into toxic habits that at least produce results.   Over exercise is not healthy; My knee contusion, torn meniscus, broken foot (all in the last 12 months, BTW) can attest to that. But hey, at least I didn't get too fat during all of my recovery down time. (Fat, but not *too* fat.)   OCD is a real mental illness. There are times when I will scrub the same spot for 30 minutes. Or spend an entire hour walking around ""straightening"" things up. But hey, at least my house is spotless.   Meal prep sounds all well and fluffy, *but* when you become so obsessed with preparing things a certain way at a certain time and only from certain places it can take 10x longer than it should.",False,False
