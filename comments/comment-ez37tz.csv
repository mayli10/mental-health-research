She doesn't cook at night so it's very likely she's just having some 20cal white headed bastards and working, then going to bed. Meanwhile I'm having awful thoughts about my weight (I've gained all the weight I lost a year ago) and I struggle to not munch on everything.  What the fuck I sure don't want to eat my damned lunch anymore. Just a salad and a bit of chicken and rice but now it feels huge compared to what she's having.  Comparisons when you're the only one comparing and competing are mentally tiring.",False,False
