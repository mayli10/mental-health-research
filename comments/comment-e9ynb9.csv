I do also offer finding people mental healthcare by location, insurance/payment abilities, and what that person specifically needs help with, so I should do that with the low risk ones, and most of the handful of adults I still have too. Cutting stress would definitely help. Especially since thereâ€™s so much more on top of this  Thank you so much, seriously. I really needed this tonight ðŸ’•",False,True

Maybe they could need somebody, but if you keep focusing on so many people you won't be as well-equipped to help the people who need you more. If anyone is in a position where they do need help but have the option to get it from somebody else you should encourage them to seek help elsewhere.",False,False

I just want to be able to do that without cutting some people out, but that might be necessary, and some of them would be okay if it did get cut, and theyâ€™d know they could still always come to me whenever, it just wouldnâ€™t be structured like it is now. The main reason I donâ€™t get paid is that if I did, I would have to become a mandatory reporter, meaning that if someone told me they were going to hurt themselves, someone else, or someone is hurting them Iâ€™d be obligated to report it to various state and/or government people/places and parents. The reason I donâ€™t want to have that as a rule is that the state/government/parents arenâ€™t always the best person to deal with the situation, so by not being official I have more options for keeping them safe in the ways that actually will keep them safe instead of putting them in unnecessary danger from state/government/parents. But I do go to my circle of mandatory reporters whenever Iâ€™m even slightly concerned to help me figure out what to do and to possibly report for me if we end up getting to that point. But I definitely do need to find a way to lessen the load for myself, because this is wayyy too much. Luckily I did just finish putting together a safety/care package for one of them that was taking forever and I went to the post office and sent it today, so I just need to figure out like four more packages for other 24/7 kids.    And thatâ€™s just the beginning of everything else I have to do lol Thank you, also. It helps to be told that it is too much and that I need to take a break. It helps me actually realize and understand it, and hopefully itâ€™ll help me follow through with it.",False,True

And to do it for free is unbelievably generous of you. I think that you should take a break from this and try to have some of your less needy pupils moved to somebody else. If you are helping these people through an organization they should get more mentors to help out. Maybe even start paying you guys to draw attention and lessen your workload a bit.,False,False

I do it for free for a handful of reasons (that Iâ€™m willing to get into but itâ€™s not necessary to the issue/story) I currently have 52 people I am mentoring.
