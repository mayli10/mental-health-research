All I have to do today is eat these 50$ worth of food I bought yesterday when I wanted to 're-establish a healthy relationship with food' (uuuuuugh) because they don't fit the diet and then I can start!""           Me to me: ""But by eating those 5000 kcal now you prolong the necessary duration of your crash diet and waste a lot of money. You could eat it after the diet since most of it keeps or you could eat normally and sensibly for a couple more days and then start.""            #""LALALALALA I CAN'T HEAR YOU OVER THE SOUND OF MY BINGING""",False,False

Mostly it's safer stuff - 50 cal torillas, 20 cal crackers, 60-80 tuna packets, hot sauce, 25 cal fruit cups, soy sauce, seaweed, canned water chestnuts, and ocassionaly more unsafe foods like a box of cheerios, sweet &amp; spicy doritos, dried cranberries, and jelly beans. Most of the time it's fine, but it definitely can lead to me mindlessly eating.   If I have a day off, when I eat I try to eat what's in my room with the justification that there will be less food in my room to mindlessly/drunkenly/stoned eating.  This generally backfires, leading to spikes in hunger, eating more of the food that's in my room and then just replacing it anyway. I really just shouldn't keep food in my room but I seem incapable of that, so I just try to make sure most of it is low cal shit.",False,False
