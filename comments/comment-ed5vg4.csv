Seeing all of the people suffer from their EDs and just passing off warning signs as “hunger pangs” or other things is so worrying and I just wanna make an informative video on it that could be useful for someone someday. Ever since recently seeing an anorexia sufferer sign a DNR and lying on her deathbed because her heart was giving out on her, I just want all of us to be cautious and take better care of ourselves. We can have good lives. We can be moms or dads one day raising cuties that love us. We can contribute to society and enjoy life - life is way too short and way too precious to let your mind ruin it and steal it from you. I know we love to joke around here and forget our issues but please remember how valuable and sacred a life is. Take care of and be grateful for your life.  We’re only getting older, and one day soon we’re gonna wish we would’ve just lived life healthily and happily with all our loved ones and taken care of ourselves so we could have truly lived this short but beautiful and impactful life we were so grateful to have even been given. We should be treating our split second of time here on this earth like it’s the most precious thing ever because it is. It will all end one day and that day is coming fast. People wish they could have our lives. Please take care of yours.",False,True

I know it’s silly but I didn’t really understand exactly what heart failure/cardiac arrest was. Harm reduction is so important,False,False

It really helps a lot of people here, myself included.  Can I ask your opinion, since you seem very cluey on the subject? Can extended restriction (say eating under 800-1000 calories or whatever) lead to heart problems even in someone overweight? Or does it only start causing heart issues once the fat stores have been depleted, i.e. in someone of an average or underweight BMI?",False,False

Sometimes I get tempted to do long fasts bc I always see other people doing extended ones but I didn't know that since I'm already underweight it might just cause my heart to stop. Thanks!,False,False
