I don’t know what I’d do if that happened. If your folks seem to be mellowed out about the ED, I’d just have a Few fried Brussels (and try my hardest to carry on) then play the rest of the day off like normal. The LAST thing you’d want is for your folks to go into that “super aware lockdown mode” in which they oversee your every move. So I would try real hard and force myself to eat it if that’s the ONLY OPTION, then try to seem “cool” afterwards.  And it took me a long time to learn, but an occasional extra amount of food, won’t make ANY difference to your weight unless you decide to have extra every day. Your body will forget all about it and entirely disregard that extra amount, it won’t do anything rash, the body doesn’t work like that. (Losing weight and gaining are just as timely) 🤘💛 Well, I wish you the best, tonight I’m taking on a big feat of mine, BEER. Yes, I’ve got a “beer fear” and I struggled with alcoholism a few years back but I’m going to drink responsibly like normal. :) So, Prost! Cheers! enjoy some Brussels and I’ll enjoy 2 Buschs 💪💯",False,False
