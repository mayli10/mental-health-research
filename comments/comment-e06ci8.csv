I'd skip hang outs with friends, ruin family outings because I'd argue about food, and I almost failed school because I'd spend most of the night b/ping. I was too self conscious to have any motivation do anything. I had 0 passion and desire for anything. And even if I did have a desire to do something, I knew my ED would make sure to keep me busy enough to make fulfilling that impossible. It made me avoid telling my current bf that I liked him, because I felt like such a burden, and never wanted to put my struggles on another person. And honestly, one of the biggest reasons. I just missed enjoying food. I missed it so much. Food is a basic human right that my ED was taking for me. My ED categorized food into ""safe"" and ""fear"", ""carbs, fat, protein"" ""calories"", instead of all the different tastes there are to experience. Food is a beautiful thing, and once you start recovering, it gives you the ability to enjoy it fully again. The other day I was craving French toast and made it, and as I was eating it, I suddenly started crying because I realized how much I missed just *eating * good things, because I wanted to. Recover to enjoy food again.",False,False

Losing security; becoming too disabled to do my stupid job and not being able to pay the bills. Im not motivated by rewards, only punishments so it would have to be instigated by the consequences of recovery being the least scary option. I know I'd just get better enough to function and keep the ED though. I guess I'd like a roadmap to a positive, healthy future, too. Right now I just can't imagine recovery.",False,False

They're young still but I know they will pick up my habits. Im good at hiding them and making bulky plates for them to see me eating. I know they hear me after they go to bed. I preach so hard to them about health and keeping healthy habits but I know that as they get older its going to be more of a stressor for me to be healthier. I relapsed recently and my disordered brain says its better than seeing me fat and lazy. But I know deep down seeing me on the other side of the coin is just as bad.  The tough thing is that I don't want to recover. I want them to be healthy but I think that it would take them showing signs of disordered eating for me to stop.,False,False
