I feel overwhelmed and anxious with work. This, plus fatigue, led to bingeing yesterday. I feel like I relapsed in October and I want out. I did so well in September. My goal had been no-binge Nov and I was ok on Halloween only to screw it up yesterday. So, the things that were working in Sept were food-logging and journaling. I dislike both (well, journaling tends to feel good once I start writing and getting in the habit). So today I need to put myself first and give myself a break from work for at least a little bit.",False,False

I have asthma so I can't ride my bike to mellow myself out since the air quality is crap. I know this fire isn't so bad and everything will be back to normal in a few days but it feels like the last big one where a lot of people were evacuated so I'm anxious. So of course, instead of meditating and doing some indoor workouts, I'm drinking way too much caffeine and not eating breakfast",False,False

Not oh, you’ve lost weight, or oh, maybe you should eat more- but “you need to start eating”. As in “I know you’re back on your bullshit. You need to stop.”  He’s still one of the most important people to me. And I know if I do want him around, he’s not going to allow that if I’m destroying myself.   So... mixed feelings on everything. Because I realize I just... don’t want to give up being anorexic. I want to hold onto it as much as I want to hold onto him.   So. Fuck. I’ve been panic eating, hard. I don’t know what to do with myself. Lol.",False,False
