I'm a numbers kind of gal so when I got out on my own I decided okay, $30 a week is the max I'm going to spend on groceries. It's kind of a low limit, but I'm vegetarian and cheap af so it works for me. It's definitely helped me deal with financial worry/guilt because each week I get to around $25 and I think okay, I'm doing great I'm still under my limit. Whereas if I didn't have the 30 already socked away, designated for food and only food, I would feel weird about taking that $25 away from other things",False,False

It might help allay your financial guilt, since it's so calorie-dense for the price.  A pound of butter for $4 works out to just over a dollar per thousand calories.  It also reduces the amount of bulk you need to eat to reach your calorie target.  I have issues with feeling physically full, so this is a tactic I use to help manage that feeling.",False,False
