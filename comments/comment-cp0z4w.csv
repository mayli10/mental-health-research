I was able to sit down and relax though bc I was like freaking out and completely aware of it happening and just kept telling my bf something was wrong lmfao. I've never actually passed out so I wouldn't know but obviously from everyone's replies that's how it is. I wonder if we'll ever actually pass out (I hope not for your sake....but for me idk I'm kinda curious yanno - is that terrible? lol). did you get like really hot too?? I literally took my pants off in the shared space of the apt my bf shares w 2 dudes who have people over all the time and at any point could've come down lmao buuuut I was terrified I was aboutta die so,False,False

They are both essential electrolytes which help muscles to function. If you are low on them then your heart will struggle to keep ticking regardless of your weight. Luckily they are found in almost all foods, so we don't have to worry about supplementing them. (Unless you crazy and try not to eat for days #lolwut)  People can go weeks without food so long as they are drinking water and topping up sodium, magnesium and potassium.",False,False

I think my body has tried to a few times, because at times it's gotten so bad, my entire body starts shaking and it takes everything to stay upright. Like the other week it started and I leant against the wall, and when it finally stopped I was halfway down the wall. My only reaction was to burst into laughter. Definitely try to get up slower though.",False,False

Of course I always get worried about heart attacks after and eat some magnesium/potassium.",False,False
