The way ours worked was that we had mandatory meal blocks as freshmen that consisted of entree, drink, and side like fruit or chips. When bought alone, I think the total was a little over $10. People usually sold their blocks for $5-7. I didn't find out until 2 years in though lol, I just gave most of mine away to a senior year friend because we had two classes together and I didn't know any other upperclassmen other than RAs who refused to take any. Like I'd use up a block for the ""dinner"" period right before 8 and then buy hers with a ""late night"" block a few minutes later",False,False

My college meal plan when I lived on campus was crazy expensive, and it wasn’t refundable. I struggled so hard with it. If your cafeteria has a little grocery section, I recommend just buying a shit ton of that and just store the food in your pantry. I still have boxes of spaghetti from mine, and I bought a lot of Diet Coke. Or you can buy food for friends who aren’t on the meal plan. It’s a struggle for real.",False,False
