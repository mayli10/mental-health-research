I'm like super emotional which definitely contributed to my ED because my mood is like really dependent on people's perception of me. Like I get hurt super easily and I think people hate me so fast. Its an outlet for my pain and it makes me number. It's not  just people either. I saw two dead birds, cried, and buried them in the nearest area of dirt i found then had a full on BREAKDOWN because only one was buried under a tree (i also stole flowers from a dominos for their graves lmao i didnt even eat there) I'm so emotional and it means my self esteem is SHIT",False,False
