Pretty bad to me...the dentists say jargon amongst themselves and i twiddle my thumbs like a stupid kid. I havent been in like 15 years... But those awful wisdom teeth i begged my mom to take me get taken out are finally coming out..now that theyve erupted painfully for years.. (sigh) I'm tired.,False,False

My dentist gave me a night guard to help with that at night. You might not need one at 16 but it's worth bringing up if they see any wear from grinding/clenching because they were able to see the beginning stages of wear on my teeth at 24.,False,False
f05puh1,t3_d3qegy,t3_d3qegy,SubBiscuit,1,2019-09-13 18:10:30,/r/EDAnonymous/comments/d3qegy/so_how_are_your_teeth_and_when_did_you_last_see_a/f05puh1/,I went recently and go for my 6 month check ups/cleaning. Even with that I got a night guard and had to get 2 minor fillings.  A pinch of prevention is worth a pound of cure - literally anything you can do as soon as you can do it will save you money and pain.  I dont purge but restricting makes me clench my teeth and it's apparently showing wear at 24 so its never too early to get on that night guard life.,False,False

I recently got into drinking diet soda and it has apparently been fucking up ""the integrity of my teeth"" . Today is the first day I've gone without a drop of diet soda or la Croix in a very long time",False,False

For reference, ive been restricting for about two years, c/s:ing a lot the last 6 months, like sugary foods a lot but tend to brush my teeth 1-2 times/day",False,False

My teeth are fucked, but I have good insurance, so they look nice.  When I started going to this dentist, I hadn't been in years.  My last dentist was rough.  This place I go now specializes in people who are afraid of the dentist -- like, they'll drug you up if you're super anxious -- and I told them about my ED right from the get-go.  No weird looks, no judgment, no patronizing.  They're honestly great and I'm no longer afraid of the dentist because of them.",False,False
