An ED will always take a heavy toll on our bodies but I wonder if it would help a bit with this problem. They have recipes out there using a bit of baking soda, magnesium sulfate, and no-salt for potassium.",False,False

It got steadily worse until all of a sudden, I completely lost my vision. It lasted for about ten minutes. I was in a car but thank god I was the passenger. My dad was driving and rushed me home and made me an egg and toast. My vision returned after eating.   I just think about what would have happened if I was behind the wheel.",False,False

From there I'll get dizzier and dizzier as the edges of my vision get white. By this point I'll have to grab onto something to stay standing, and then my hearing and vision go completely.",False,False

Usually it's very mild and goes away after a couple minutes. The worst incident was at work where my vision went completely white and my hearing actually 100% vanished as well. Scared the hell out of me and nearly made my coworkers call an ambulance since I work in a factory and had to be half carried off the production floor. I hadn't eaten in roughly 60 hours, so now I always keep a high cal/high sugar protein bar on me cause I'm beginning to recognize the symptoms of this when it's about to happen.",False,False
