I've gotten so much smaller and all my clothes fit me so loose now. I'm so worried because I'll be seeing my parents in a few weeks for the first time since Christmas. I'm worried they'll notice and figure out what's going on. ,False,False

That sounds like my worst nightmare to actually indulge her diet plans. But it might be a good idea. At the same time- if I put her on the spot when I know she’s lost about as much weight in the last 3 years as I have in the last three months the focus will come right back at me.   I’m actually sort of laughing about answering her questions about “tips” with real information about how to lose weight.   She’s the type who bellyaches about how she can never ever ever have all her favorite foods again once she starts losing weight. So trying to imagine her doing the Whole30 is sorta hilarious.   My FIL has been on paleo+booze for several years now and is literally the most in shape middle aged man on the planet so I’m very interested to see his reaction to how all this is gonna go down. ,False,True

Deflect and say you’ve heard people have had success with Keto, have you tried Whole 30? CICO? etc. Maybe get her talking about her plan, if that’s not too triggering for you.  If it is, try being vague, oh I’ve just been busy/stressed, talking about weight isn’t healthy for me . . . ",False,False

Anytime  someone Ask you about something weight related, just say: i really dont want to talk about that,  i appreciate if you respect that.",False,False
