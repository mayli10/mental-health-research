I didn’t tell him I hate my belly now, we just discussed abs and I said I used to have them. He doesn’t know I’m not satisfied with my body now, so that’s why it frustrated me so much. But I agree boys r dumb lol",False,True

People who don't struggle with eating usually don't know what to say to us when we go say shit like this so they give us an answer like 'then eat healthy &amp; change or accept yourself as you are now."" They don't understand how mental and emotional it is for us, it's not just a logic even though we know so much more about food and nutrition than the average person. We get upset because not even WE know what we want to hear. We need to stop getting mad at everyone else just because they don't have a magic answer to soothe us or can't understand us. I hate to say it this way, but it is what it is.",False,False

I guess something like “I love you when your brain is healthy and your body is healthy no matter how you look” but boys are dumb and never know what to say,False,False

Eats whatever he wants whenever he feels like eating it, sometimes forgets to eat. Gains no weight ever. I on the other hand have been dealing with an ED for 10 years. When we first started dating I lost about 20 lbs. in 6 months. He said he didn't even notice I lost weight... and then when I gained it back and complained about how I wish I wasn't so fat he said ""why don't you just do what you did to lose the weight before?"" Maybe because running 5-10 miles a day and eating &gt;1200 calories is a lot less fun than sitting on the couch and binge eating every day lol (but also sobbing)",False,False
