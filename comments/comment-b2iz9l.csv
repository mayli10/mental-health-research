The taste between diet and regular is different.  If you have been trying regular your whole life and only dabbled in diet you likely think that regular tastes good and diet is shit.    When I got reached peak fat (about 240 lbs) I made the switch to diet thanks to Coke Zero (which I liked better than diet coke).   I am at a consistent 170 now and only have the goal to add muscle weight at this point.    Now I prefer diet.  Its what I normally drink so its what I like.   Drinking sugar sodas just tastes wrong now.  It tastes like a melted some candy and am just drinking it.  Not thirst quenching at all.  But it used to very much be thirst quenching.   Mostly I think its simply people haven't made the switch yet and are ignorant why they should make the switch. ,False,False

It was a “fact” that I had read somewhere before, but the relationship seems at least somewhat spurious and needs to be researched more before a conclusion can be made in either side.   Type 1 diabetics would not produce more insulin when drinking any type of soda, since their bodies produce little to none of it. If they were to drink regular soda, they would need to inject insulin as needed to process the sugar in their blood.   In the case of Type 2 diabetes, the body does not respond to nearly any amount of insulin correctly. This is because the body become insulin resistant, and is the cause for people needing to regulate their blood sugar when hypo- or hyperglycemic.   Assuming that the diabetic person is not trying to raise their blood sugar, then they can drink diet soda because the insulin response (or non response) would not be followed by a raised blood glucose level. Therefore the insulin would not be needed or really used by the body.   I do not know the effects of having excess insulin in the blood in those with diabetes, but as I understand it, insulin resistance develops as more and more insulin is released to deal with increased in blood sugar by the body. Therefore, diet sodas may or may not be detrimental for non-diabetics, depending on whether the proposed hypothesis of insulin being affected by artificial sweeteners is proven false or true.   I never said that diet soda increased blood sugar, I said it increased insulin. You seem to be using insulin and blood sugar interchangeably? I think I’ve misinterpreted something here though, so please let me know!",False,False

What?   You said diet soda released insulin.   &gt; diet soda drinking is associated with obesity and **tricks your body into releasing insulin** when it doesn't need to. And aspartame tastes like crap.    Then you said it is safe for diabetics because it doesn't effect insulin?  I'm really confused about your claims.   And your understanding of diabetes and the insulin response to glucose is dubious.  If someone is having high blood sugar readings (hyperglycemia) they should not drink regular soda, but diet would be fine.  In the event of hypoglycemia (low blood sugar reading) a diabetic may indeed need to drink a regular sugar soda to boost their levels.   Excessive insulin is usually not good, unless you are hypoglycemic. And even then it depends on how low.  I use to work in the medical feild and I had both type 1 and type 2 diabetic clients.
