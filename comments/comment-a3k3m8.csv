I’m also a smoker and a drinker so I just know that I’m digging myself into an early grave, I just don’t know if I care. Maybe I’ll have changed my mind when I’m older and start having more health issues (I have a heart problem but I’m ignoring it). I’m only 18 so yeah, maybe I’ll change my tune when I’m on my deathbed whether that be very far away or in the near future. ",False,False

If you aware of the related health complications from behaviors at least you are informed so when something does feel wrong you are more likely to do something about it. Knowing how you are messing your health up also can help more people think up/carry out harm reduction behaviors. Like...if I'm purging or restricting or fasting, I drink/make a conscious effort to take in electrolytes and push myself to actually take a multivitamin. It's not going to negate the purging or calorie restriction but it'll cushion the blow a bit so  I'm not massively dehydrated and getting messed up from low electrolytes.",False,False
