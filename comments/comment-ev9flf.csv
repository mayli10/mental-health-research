I‚Äôm sure there are an incredible number of redeeming qualities about you that transcend any issues someone might have with your physical appearance. That‚Äôs a fact. (And I doubt there‚Äôs truth to your claim of being too fat)   Try to be kind to yourself. The people who love you do so for many many reasons! That‚Äôs not a truth your illness can take away. üíú,False,False
