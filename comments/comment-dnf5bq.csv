He doesn’t force me to eat, exercise, not purge, etc. he just listens and comforts me until I calm down enough to think rationally. He also has eating problems so he knows how to deal with me when I get bad. I don’t want food? We don’t get food. I want to treat myself to a big ass meal? We go out and get what I’m craving. I just want salad? Cool, we’ll get salad, dressing on the side.   Just wanted to shed some light that, although it’s very difficult to date while struggling mentally, it’s not impossible. It helps immensely to have a support system especially since this disorder is so isolating",False,False

Once he wouldn’t let me eat chicken until I tried all of the first course dishes. They were not calorific I just didn’t want Cos i don’t like them but I ate them. But I was like da fuck is wrong with you  I don’t force you to eat . And he tries to force me to eat hummus and I genuinely don’t like hummus . And once at a resto he tried to  make me eat his fucking creamy dessert (I don’t like it even if I was normal ) and I said no and he Said to the waitress “get her an extra spoon “ and I that point I lost my shit “I don’t like cream stop making me eat stuff “ and then he went on a rant about how I have all these food rules for myself and I can’t be normal. Lol.,False,False

All I can think about is that I am a fat freak that doesn’t deserve love. The only thing I can eat on dates is sushi, and I don’t drink (afraid of the calories and losing control) soo I mean coffee/walk dates it is. But I almost always cancel or don’t follow through anyway",False,False

Or I do some sort of activity that doesn’t revolve around food.   If I end up having to have food, I go for restaurants that have safer foods for me. I’ve made excuses of not liking sugar or having a sensitive stomach, so needing to be more careful of where I eat.",False,False

When I do manage to meet up with someone I’m usually always a drink deep already and it helps me open up a bit more.  Also if anyone ever suggests dinner I always say I prefer to just meet at a bar for a first date and normally that’s fine with them.  Lol at eating in front of a stranger.  When I feel too overwhelmed I also take a week or so “off” from it.    I’m sorry you feel so overwhelmed by it, and I totally get it.  Putting yourself out there is tough and honestly dating sucks (personal opinion and universal truth)",False,False
