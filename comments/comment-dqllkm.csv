But when i reached it, i was too scared to resume eating at maintenance because i was skeptical my calculated sedentary TDEE was inaccurate (didn't want to be the dumb dieter, like when people think treadmill calories are accurate). I continued eating at a 100-500 calorie deficit for a while ""to be safe"" and lost a couple of more lbs before finally eating maintenance.   I feel massive, too, even though i can look at myself in the mirror and acknowledge I'm still relatively small. And even though i know for sure i have more energy, i feel gross and uncomfortable frequently. It's just a different headspace entirely and i keep bouncing back to wanting to be okay with the 5 lbs and feeling like I'll never adjust",False,False
