It sounds like a toxic and abusive situation, and you deserve better. There is no justification for her to scream at you for crying, or for her to throw things at you EVER.  I hope that you can find peace and a healthier living situation. You are valuable and worthy of so much better. Stay safe.",False,False

It's my first instinct to go an hide when I'm upset and/or crying because it was always downplayed and or seen as being manipulative. (Or at least it was and that's what I'm used to doing now) I'm also autistic and and can't tell what I'm feeling and don't know how to express it anyway so that gets jumbled up inside to the point something needs to come out. So yeah it sucks. I'd go check out /r/cptsd too. ,False,False

I didnt read that last paragraph. If she becomes abusive, you may need to leave or have family therapy. That's not okay in any situation, especially this one.  If you are 5150'd, they will give you a ton of resources if you ask. It may be worth seeing if you can make a hospital visit for a week for stability, medication options, and resources.

My mother was a narcissist so it was horrible and I dont know what you're relationship is like with her.  She isn't handling the situation well. But it seems that she loves you and is worried about losing you.  Being ""sectioned"" isnt that bad. So dont fret it.  Make sure you're seeing a therapist and for goodness sakes, CRY ALL THAT YOU NEED TO.  I've found that buddhist philosophy can help immensely with emotions and grounding. Perhaps you can explore it yourself.  Either way, you're strong and brave.  Good luck, and much love.",False,False
