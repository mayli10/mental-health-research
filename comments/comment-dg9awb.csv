I mean, you're not, but your first paragraph really reflects my ED and experience; I relapsed with my anorexia sometime around the beginning of the year (restriction/overexercising) and went from already thin to borderline underweight (my pre-relapse and peak relapse BMIs were probably very close to yours) but never anything severe. I also didn't land in all the cliches: I'm not good at fasting, wasn't usually eating less than 1200, and didn't have a lot of ""fear foods"".  However, once my restriction started really ramping up I was fully aware that I was relapsing, and I stayed aware of it for about two months before I came clean about my ED to my fianc√© and started recovering (about three weeks ago).  My recovery so far has also been pretty effortless (minus LOTS of TMI digestive system issues). It was almost like flipping a switch. I haven't been overexercising and I've been eating. I've been eating a _lot,_ and that's actually what's supposed to happen. It's called [""extreme hunger""](https://www.recoverywarriors.com/truth-about-extreme-hunger/) and is basically an entire phase where your body and brain both are Very Hungry. You keep calling it binging and worrying that you're binging- I can assure you that you're quite actually, literally just eating food. It's not binging. Even going way over your TDEE or any self-imposed limits right now is just your body desperately trying to get nutrients that it can direct around to different parts of your body (now that it actually has food to break down into proteins and replair damaged cells in your body).  As for the imposter syndrome you're going through, I feel you. I've been mad at myself for not getting to a true underweight BMI before seeking help, mad that I didn't get ""sick enough"" before I recovered. But those regrets, and my constant second-guessing myself that recovery is the right choice just _proves_ that I was and still am sick. That my eating disorder is a real mental health issue that I'm going to need time and effort to get past.  If you need someone to talk to, message me! Just know you're not alone and absolutely keep going to your therapist. Ask them if it's okay for you to send then emails between appointments!! They don't even have to reply, their inbox can just serve as a place you send stream-of-consciousness letters that they can also use for reference when helping you recover.",False,False
