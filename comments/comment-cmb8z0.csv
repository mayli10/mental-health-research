You don't know why they're thin or fat or lost weight or gained weight or any of that!  I had to specifically ask my mom to not comment on my weight loss, even when I was losing it in a healthy way, because her obsession with my weight is a big source of my issues. She'd angrily deny it, but I'm pretty sure even if I lost the weight by starving, etc. she'd just be happy I was thin.  I remember seeing some idiot on Hoarders who came back to see the house again months later. One of the people there had dropped about 60 pounds, and she cheerfully says, ""Where's the rest of you? You've lost so much weight! You look so good!""  He was like, ""I got colon cancer.""  And she just kept smiling like a moron. I'm sure she was embarrassed, and I'm glad she was. This is why you don't freaking comment on someone's weight. You don't know what they're going through or if the weight loss is healthy or intentional.",False,False

When I was out of inpatient for a few months, I was still quite underweight. I went to a family reunion, lots of delicious homemade food of course, and as I sat down with my plate my aunt offhandedly said, ""oh, she's eating again?""  I'm not sure who she was talking to, or if she meant for me to hear, but...it's been 4 years and it still stings a little.  I never liked her anyway, so.",False,False
