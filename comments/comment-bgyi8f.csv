In the short-term you’ll have effectively no agency; whatever the treating physicians deem necessary for your treatment they can do, including sedating you, placing an NG Tube or TPN line, and force feeding you. It’s no fun.",False,False

Abnormal electrolytes can put you at risk of heart problems resulting in death, and thus poses grave danger to your health that you are not able to respond to appropriately due to your mental health.  My unasked for advice: do anything you can to avoid being involuntarily admitted. It will make life much, much worse for you in both the short- and long-term. If your doctor wants to admit you for potassium and monitoring, go for potassium and monitoring. It will save you soooooo much trouble.",False,False

There is a bit of subjectivity or medical opinion involved yet typically those factors you mentioned above would be enough to sanction you if that course of action were to be pursued.",False,False
