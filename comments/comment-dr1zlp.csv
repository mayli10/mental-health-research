Now that I’m older I don’t care literally at all what other bodies look like and any time someone tells me they have an ED I’m not jealous *at all*, rather I’m sad because no one should have to deal with this hell. 15 years in has me jaded.   Also multiply that by 50 million+ based on how much younger someone is than me. I mean, if I could have gotten strong in recovery a decade ago, my life would look so different. I never want anyone to deal with a life like this.",False,False

Like every time I see one of those “I’m fat and I love my body!” posts I’m just like, “Oh sweetie, we all know you don’t.”   Anyway pretty sure that makes me a cognitive-distortion-filled asshole but it is the true response of my heart every time.",False,False

I think because I don't really feel...real... a lot of the time. Comments/attention helps to solidify my existence. Also, the attention from girls is different... It's not based on sexual attraction (usually), so it feels more...fuck, I'm struggling for the word here..for me, it's almost more validating to be noticed by them.",False,False
