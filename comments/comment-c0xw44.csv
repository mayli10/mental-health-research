On one hand, diagnosis can be validating and also opens up an array of different treatment options that might be difficult to access without a diagnosis. On the other, being diagnosed will also go down as a permanent record of mental illness, which could be problematic depending your goals. So there’s a lot that goes into it... but if you’re having any thoughts about this it’s always a good idea to try seeing someone, see how you feel and go from there. Wishing you the best!",False,False

I never call it ""disorder"" because I feel like I'm faking it that way. No one diagnosed me, who am I to decide whether I have an ED or not. It makes me come up with excuses such as ""I'm not skinny enough, I can't be anorexic"" or ""It's not like I throw up everytime I binge"". I want to get a diagnosis so I at least have somewhere to start but I'm scared to not be considered valid, I'm a mix of all EDs, I'm scared they can't even put a label on it.",False,False
