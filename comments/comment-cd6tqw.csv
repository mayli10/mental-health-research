But I agree, itâ€™s definitely about trying to take a step back and thinking of at least making healthier choices within the ED. I think I forget this when Iâ€™m having a â€˜hey, letâ€™s recoverâ€™ day and expect to go back to â€˜normalâ€™ eating straight away; whereas actually it needs to be about limiting the damage a little rather than a lot.   Hopefully we can both figure out what works for us :) and Iâ€™ll work on getting â€˜fuck â€˜emâ€™ much more ingrained in my brain!   Good luck!!",False,True

They were totally out of line in saying that and pinching you like that.   I've been struggling a lot with binging and having a weak will to restrict recently, too. I'm fighting to be as kind to myself as I can about it, because I know that even ""best case scenario"" by my ED's standards, bullying my body into a corner of starvation will only hurt me more in the long run. It's really hard though. Rational thoughts just never seem to stick as firmly as disordered ones seem to ):  Hope we both turn the right corner and use every ounce of strength we can find within ourselves to make the healthiest choices we can manage, for the benefit of our minds and bodies. And if anyone else jumps in to judge us and project their ideas about how we're doing or whether our struggle is enough - fuck 'em.",False,False
