The requirements for atypical anorexia are the same as anorexia nervosa, but minus the weight requirement.   You're right about it being easy to restrict during school tho, except for a lot of our student groups have free lunch at their meetings, RIP.  As for the 1000 cal thing, that's also my personal limit and what I tell myself too, but I also realize that I do have a problem. 1000 cal *might* be acceptable in some circumstances, and for shorter people, but probably not if you're 5'9"" and otherwise active and healthy.",False,False

(and light studying) :D   step 1 question: can’t diagnose it as anorexia if that BMI criteria isn’t met l. EDNOS perhaps? at risk? taking a psychiatry summer course right now, eating disorders is the very last section. oddly enough i can’t wait to get to it",False,True

Reread your post like it's a case study for step 1, because that's where I'm at rn.   From medbullets, anorexia nervosa is ""excessive dieting with or without purging behaviors due to distorted body image, characterized by intense fear of weight gain, frequent weight checks, and denial of emaciated state."" This is exactly what you've described in your post.  You fit all the requirements for an anorexia nervosa diagnosis in the dsmV except the bmi (but you're cutting it REAL close to 18.5).  Take care of yourself. Med school is hard enough.",False,False
