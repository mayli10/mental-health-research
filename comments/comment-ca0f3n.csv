Well I’ll start by saying it has never actually been outright acknowledged, even though it has been quite obvious for over a decade. My father has called it my “vegetarian thing” and my mother has not actually called it anything, just spewed a bunch of stupid hateful shit my way (“starving children in africa”, “you look like a cancer patient”, “are you trying to look sexy for boys”, “you’re not doing that purging shit are you”, “I’m tired of listening to your father bitch, I fucking told you to eat [whatever fatty unhealthy food that will make me magically not like this anymore] and you didn’t fucking listen”, put a newspaper article about a model who died from anorexia on my fridge, etc).  But anyway. My doctor expressed concern to my mother when I was a few months shy of 18 and told her to schedule appointments for me to see a dietician and psych. Which she did, but then she cancelled the appointments and instead bought a cheesecake and told me to eat it. Sooo...yeah. Then there’s all the other examples I wrote about above. She would take me to the local grocery store which had a scale at the entrance for some reason and weigh me there in public, then scold me. Also borrowed a scale from my neighbor one time to weigh me.  Once or twice they decided that she would stay at my house for a week or two and make me drink Ensure Plus every day. I dumped them out when she wasn’t looking. I still get a good laugh though out of the mental image of my morbidly obese mother buying cases of weight gain shakes.  My father once screamed at me that I would end up in the hospital with organ damage and he’d be stuck paying the bills and that’s not fair to him. Then he stormed out and didn’t speak to me for a week.  My weight/eating habits have not been discussed at all in a very long time. Mostly because I’m in a place where I am mentally able to eat “normally” around them (I used to be deathly afraid of a lot of foods and there were very few things I could eat, but I don’t really have rules anymore. And I’ve decided it’s worth potentially eating “too much” and having to make up for it later if it means I don’t have to deal with their bullshit.)",False,False

We’d get into these HUGE fights every time I’d ask for help because things were bad again, she wouldn’t believe me/she’d minimize how bad things were, I’d go to the doctor, and we’d forget about it until the next crises. It was a fucking nightmare tbh. We’re doing a lot better now FWIW now that I’ve moved away.",False,False

I told her that I just wanted to learn how to cook better since I was living off campus at that point and had to feed myself. I wasn't in town for very long, so that never actually lead to anything.  Around a year later I did manage to tell her, but at that point I had already improved a lot. I wasn't losing weight anymore and was getting close to being ready to gain weight. I told her that I wanted to tell her before, but that I was better now so it really didn't matter anymore. I don't remember her having a reaction to it. I said it so casually that she must have believed me.  I guess I forgot to tell my dad. He only found out earlier this summer when I had mentioned it in a conversation. I think we were talking about how I've been sick lately. I was already back up to a healthy weight by that point. I thought I would feel better at a healthy weight, but it seems that something else is wrong with me. Well, I do feel better, but not by much. He was of course a little shocked when I mentioned it because be had no idea. I really thought that I had told him though. Thinking back however, I have no memory of ever trying to tell him and I think that's something I would remember.  Neither of my parents have brought it up. I assume that my mom is worried about upsetting me or maybe assumes that if I want to talk about it I'll ne the one to bring it up. My dad hates confrontation. He's really bad with emotional stuff all together. If I had a diagnosis for a physical illness I'm sure that he would have no problem talking about it and making sure I'm okay, but because this is a psychological problem he doesn't mention it. I know he suffered from depression for a while, but the only thing he has ever mentioned is that clinical depression runs in the family and that he hated the withdrawal symptoms when it was time for him to stop taking anti-depressants. One time I tried talking to him about relationship trouble and he just changed the subject. I really didn't expect anything from him. I know he cares, he's just not good at this stuff.",False,False

But I won't lie to you about their reactions. Just remember people are misinformed and care a lot. As I said before, they realized their actions were wrong and apologized. And If I were to tell them about my mental state they would surely help. I don't blame them for their bad reactions, but again I want to prepare you just in case something similar happens in your case. Again, I advise you to reach out, you deserve the help. We all do",False,False

They scolded me, screamed at me, reminded me.of.how.many people are starving while I waste food, made me step on the scale, they cried. They sat me down and made me eat twice as much what I would eat normally (outside of my E.D), when they found out I (Tw tw tw tw tw) also self harmed, they called me crazy and referred to the therapist as a ""mad house"" or the equivalent in spanish which is ""loquero"" (comes from loco=crazy). They told me that If i didn't get better they'd have to punish me. They basically did everything wrong, have learned from their mistakes and apologized. I accepted their apologies. They reminded me that they're ready to listen and for me to tell them whenever depression is getting worse, but it's really hard to talk to them, still. I have the maybe dumb fear of them reacting the same way again. So whenever I have the urge to recover/go see a therapist again, I'm scared to tell. The rest of the time I want to hide my unhealthy coping mecanisms. Sorry for the rant lmao",False,False

Then I noticed they started giving me extra food at dinner and I retaliated by only eating 1/4 of it and saving the rest. They didn't bring it up again, and neither did I. I can't imagine ever telling them. It was probably my best kept secret.",False,False
