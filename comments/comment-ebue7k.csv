Since September 2018 I have dropped 10-11% body fat and about 30 lbs, through working out 6x a week (3 days yoga, 2 days elliptical, 1 day with a trainer) and restricting. So idk if I have ""built muscle"" but I have lost a lot of fat so my lean body mass is higher than it used to be, I certainly have more muscle mass than I used to. Idk if this is what you are asking though.",False,False

For women with PCOS in particular, the literature suggests increases in muscle strength, but I'm not sure how much of that is confounded by the fact that most women with PCOS tend to be heavier than the general population. PCOS also is associated with insulin resistance, and insulin is really essential for muscle hypertrophy, contrary to what fasting subs may tell you.   Additionally, if you have high androgen production, you may not have enough estrogen production to get a complete menstrual cycle because androgens block the upstream hormone (GnRH) that signals for estrogen production. This can affect bone density and muscle recovery.   I'm not a doctor, but generally (not always), hormonal imbalances aren't a good thing for the type of gains most people want.",False,False

I'm a PhD student at MIT studying neuromodulation and endocrine regulation of behavior and metabolic adaptations in fed, fasted, and starved states, so I can answer this really in depth, but I'm going to just give the practical answers in humans, and feel free to ask more in depth questions if you're curious.  The practical answer: it depends on how much you're restricting, how much you're working out, what types of work outs you're doing, how long you've been working out, what your starting stats are, and what your current body composition is like. But yes, it's possible (not super likely for someone who's been restricting for a long time) for a short amount of time for a limited amount of increased muscle hypertrophy (i.e. more water/definition in the muscle). But unless you're overweight/obese, it's not likely to be anything significant, and if you keep restricting, it's not likely to be stimulated long enough to actually increase skeletal muscle multinucleation that leads to long term muscle maintenance.",False,False

Started my third year in a row in the gym in october and only this year I started seeing visible separation between bicep/shoulder/tricep, also visible lower back muscles and visible quads/glutes.  And I do a lot of compound lifts with as heavy as 130lbs (Deadlift), 80lbs (Squat), 70lbs (Bench press).  I'm also eating in a huge deficit (due to cardio, moving around much) and I get progressively stronger.  So, keep on training and you'll see muscles slowly pop up :)",False,False

And if you're working out.  Doing low restricting and not working out and not lifting? Not gonna happen. Your body can't make muscle from nothing, especially if you aren't challenging it.  Doing high restriction, \*and\* lifting? Yup. That's newbie gains. Can last for almost two years, depending on how much you train.   The big thing is that you have to make sure you get enough protein. If you don't eat protein, and you're low restricting, that's a perfect recipe for skinny fat.",False,False

Maybe have a big ass protein shake right after you get out of the pool. Swimming will burn a lot more calories than lifting.   That's actually my preferred exercise and I think it's just as if not more tiring, but way more relaxing and fun!  Good luck getting me to lift for an hour but I could swim all day. It's really great for reduced mobility too. And you don't have to worry about muscle groups ðŸ˜‚",False,False

I eat around 1000 cals. I used to lift for an hour 4x a week(around 40lbs weights for lower body and like 10lbs for arms) and eat 800 cals a day, and I just got beginner gains but didn't actually see a huge difference. Plus I don't go to a gym and have weights at home and the max I have is 40lbs.  I also thought about swimming, maybe that could help me tone up since weight lifting is very tiring + my joints start to crack every five seconds.",False,True

I've asked this myself and noticed a lot of the time ""can you gain muscle on a deficit?"" is answered for young men, skinny men that are trying to bulk up. Those guys don't have a lot of energy stores. You need energy from *somewhere* to build muscle. So that's either going to be the fat on your body or the food that you eat.  So basically, if you have enough fat on your body, it will get burned and then converted in to muscle. You still need nutrients to keep the machine that is the human body working and metabolizing correctly. It seems like a lot of people will eat to around their sedentary/current TDEE, random example 1600, and then burn an extra say 400 with exercise. Technically that's restriction. But if there is excess fat to burn it fills in the gap. If you were already muscular/had low fat content, you would lose muscle.  I hope this was understandable and at least 50% accurate!  Remember that muscle is more dense than fat so visibly you may look small to others but weigh the same as you did with a higher fat ratio. Keep that in mind to avoid a head fuck. I would not pay so much attention to the scale and instead grab a tape measure if you're wanting to trade fat for muscle. You can get calipers but it's kinda hard to be accurate with them.",False,False

But I have no idea at what level of restriction building muscle becomes unlikely. I do try to prioritize getting decent protein, which Iâ€™m hoping helps.",False,False
