My ED first came when I was a sophomore in high school and it hit pretty hard as restrictive orthorexia. I ended up figuring out that I might be disordered and went to my parents about it and they did I didn't have an ED because I wasn't too skinny... I was already underweight. So because I felt that it wasn't a safe space to get therapy I chose nutrition as major going into college because I was really interested in overcoming my ED with knowledge and possibly helping other people with EDs after I got registered.  Jokes on me though because I didn't know I had orthorexia and more knowledge about food just made me spiral even more. As I learned more, I restricted more. And the worst part of it was that I knew what I was doing 100%, so it was just super confusing and conflicting.   I only have a couple credits left in my degree so I spent a lot of time there and after talking my peers it became really obvious that the vast majority were disordered and also totally in denial about it. It was really similar to social media influencers that are all #recovery but actually they are just raw vegans or some crap and have just found a different way to restrict while being ""healthy"".   Nothing against raw vegans but it was like most of these girls (we only had like 2 guys in our program) had no idea that they were in the depths of their disorder still so they would go around and try to convince people in their lives to eat like them. Idk I probably sound super bitchy but i think I just feel guilty because I did that exact thing to my mom. I was super restrictive and only ate a handful of safe foods (kale, egg whites, chickpeas lol) and didn't know yet that I wasn't actually being healthy, but that I had orthorexia. I ended up convincing her to eat the same way without knowing that she also had a history of disordered eating (go figure) and she still is really affected by that. So yeah.

Its not as easy as turning carbohydrates into body fat, but by easy we really mean biologically preferred. Triglycerides enter cells by being transported by micelles and apoprotein capped carriers. Cells often refuse entrance of these. Beyond that, the enzymes that make the body fat from triglycerides have higher activation costs than the competing enzymes that turn carbs into fat. Because lipids have more energy density the barrier can be overcome, but higher activation costs do lower how biologically preferred the reactions are.
