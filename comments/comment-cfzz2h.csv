This is wonderful to hear :) Re: your last point on 2000 calories I think is very important. I’ve had the same experience. I am sure that the TDEE counters work well for some but from my experience it is way under for me and probably others as well. I think there is a lot of misinformation out there and I’ve seen people claim that short/small people need insanely low amounts. I’m wondering if there are others out there who are feeling like there is something wrong with them if they can’t stick to a TDEE when it’s actually just not enough.,False,False

I have been through 6 therapists, but I started seeing my most recent one in January. I honestly wasn't really putting forth that much effort until three weeks ago. What is crazy is I found the same thing as you -- I can eat so much more than I thought I could. I was restricting and not losing weight and now I am eating SO much more and I have not gained a pound and I've even been down a little bit in the past few weeks. It also comforts me to hear that someone else had to eat a morning snack. I'm now eating 3 meals and 3 snacks and it's so hard to deal with the guilt. It feels like I'm eating 24/7! I try to reframe it as a positive, though, because most people would love to eat as much as I am.  I'm also allowing myself to try new things I denied myself for years. I had soft pretzel bites warmed in the oven as my morning snack today and it was so delicious! Thanks for making me feel not so alone. :) Recovery is tough, but it is ten times better than how miserable I was in my eating disorder.",False,False
