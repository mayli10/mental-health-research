When I lost weight and hit \~46-45 Kg (my lowest ever weight) I looked shrunken. Thats the word I would use. My face lost all coloraturas, and my forehead looked bigger than a whale. I look at a picture of myself from that time and I still feel the cold and the feeling of my skin stretching over my face.",False,False

I have eyebags now?? But everything else is all sunken in, I feel like I look old - I'm 24. I over compensate with makeup and go a little heavier on the blush and use dewier/satin makeup to I look a bit more flushed and ""plump"" I guess.   What I think it is, or part of it, is that now that insanely thick lips and plumper cheeks are ""in"", I see my own skinny face as ugly.",False,False
