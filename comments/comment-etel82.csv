It was probably closer to 600-700, but I didn’t know how much butter and oil they used so I logged about triple the calories from butter and oil lol",False,False

I mixed a can of tuna (150) with some pepper spread (~45?) and ate about half of it.  Now I'm totally convinced that the remaining HALF of my tuna in the fridge is at least 200 calories and needs to be logged as such. Nevermind that that's probably more than the initial amount of all the tuna to begin with. Stupid. Lol.,False,False
