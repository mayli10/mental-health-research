Every time I relapse I have the exact same DIY recovery plan which is as follows:   Get down to the right weight that slowly increase my caloric intake by 100 cal/week until I reach 100 below maintenance (gotta account for ""secret"" calories in literally anything).   Maintain and be healthy and somehow learn how to intuitively eat at 100 below maintenance but don't obsess.   If I ever gain weight, just starve myself again for a couple weeks and then go right back to be normal and totally fine.   What usually happens is that I reach said weight and either it's not low enough so I keep restricting or my body breaks and I consume either a) a loaf of bread or b) an entire jar of nut butter which makes me gain water/food/a bit of actual weight so I keep restricting.",False,False
