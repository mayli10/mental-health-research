I will warn you though, I have gained a LOT of weight.... HOWEVER: my measurements are smaller than my all-time low and I'm ok with that.   TW: numbers below  I was 165 at my HW, lost down to 133, hated my distribution, started lifting, went up to like 155 (was disgusted with myself but also looked way better than I did when I was 155 and losing) and now I'm at like 145?

(I got pics if you're curious but i don't think I should just post them!)",False,False
