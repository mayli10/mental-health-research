When I do extended fasts (but again, nowhere near as long!), I usually start the refeed with slightly more caloric liquids first, like some unsweetened almond milk in my coffee/tea or some broth. Then I try to follow up with something that feels simple to me, slowly, and with probiotics + enzymes if possible. Initial bathroom troubles might be inevitable to some degree regardless though, sorry to say, haha. ðŸ˜¬ Godspeed.  (How would you feel about tofu maybe? Or tempeh or something? Like maybe a little almond milk or broth or something firstâ€”and then slowly some tofu or tempeh, maybe some non-starchy veggies? Maybe some kimchi...? Idk, just thinking out loud! Whatever you do, go slow and pay attention to how youâ€™re feeling and all that. Iâ€™m sure youâ€™ll be fine. ðŸ’›)",False,False
