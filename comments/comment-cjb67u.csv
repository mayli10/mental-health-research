This kind of thing isn't infrequent in the bodybuilding/powerlifting/physique athlete community, where they'll get super lean then experience severe hunger all the time, but be really stubborn and try to fight their hunger signals. I would say it's not normal eating to be having cheat days and fighting constant hunger all the time, but this is a documented phenomenon, and it's not our place to say whether or not she actually has an ed.",False,False

While she might have some disordered habits and orthorexic tendencies, I don't think she actually has an eating disorder. Moreover, her binges -- to her -- don't seem to have been binges. She didn't (at least to us viewers) express guilt about them; instead, they were her way to deal with her terribly high appetite. While she has always been very controlling of her intake and diet and exercise, it never seemed to take the out-of-control aspect that EDs do. As in, when you can't stop restricting; feel the compulsion to purge after a binge; extreme guilt over eating; safe foods; etc.   She very well may have had an ED at some point, but I don't think she currently does.",False,False

'set point' posits that the brain and body are a coordinated system that produce your hunger cues and tell you more or less what to eat in order to maintain a comfortable and healthy weight for your body. when kayla overshot her weight in recovery, this was because the body 'wanted' to hold onto weight because it had been 'taught' by  years of dieting and enforced deficits to eat and save up in case of 'famine' returning, which ramps up hunger and encourages fat storage.  when she responded to this by continuing to eat rather than dieting/restricting, she gained a ton of weight. this lead to her hunger cues eventually evening out leading to 'natural' weight loss. Although this was caused by a caloric deficit in that it naturally lead to her eating the amount she needed to in order to maintain her current, lower body weight, it was driven by her authentically lessened hunger cues, which she was only able to have because she stopped restricting and attempting to consciously 'create' a caloric deficit.   I definitely believe this is real. like i think calculating and artificially imposing caloric deficits in order to lose weight, even if you're eating a minimum amount, is going to throw off the equilibrium of the brain/body system that regulates hunger and weight. i think of it as jiggling the knobs of a system we were not really meant to have conscious control of. it makes sense to me that your brain sends up alarm signals when your body is losing weight, even if your opinion is that weight loss is desired or positive.  I think kayla's message emphasizes the importance of returning to equilibrium between your hunger and your weight through 'teaching' your body that food is not scarce by responding to hunger and allowing yourself to eat, so that your brain can 'relax' and you can become a normal eater. this makes even more sense to me when I think about all the people out in the world without EDs who don't worry about food and stay basically the same weight more or less, barring normal shifts and changes like puberty, pregnancy, middle/old age, etc.   it's kind of a philosophy of, you can't go over or under the hunger, you need to go through it. i do believe this, it's just hard to buy into because there really are no guarantees about where your body will end up and it seems like it could be a super emotionally distressing process to go through. on the other hand, some might argue that overvaluation of weight and shape are reinforced by being food-deprived and living in a deficit mindset, and part of the journey to re-balancing yourself requires prioritizing other things and learning to not worry about food in terms of deficit and surplus. which imo is something that i would want to work towards in the end, it sounds like a more peaceful way to live haha",False,False

I understand that it’s hard and that she is doing her best, but she put her binges all over YouTube which usually get around 1M views and called them “cheat days.” She lies to her viewers about how much she would have been restricting on her non-cheat days (because obviously she was restricting, I think we all know that) and uses “science” to back up her very clear disordered eating.  I think that she owes all of her viewers and apology and explanation.  I do hope that she gets better though of course, I’m glad that she is on the road to recovery but I wish that she would get off of social media and do it under the guidance of people who are qualified.",False,False
