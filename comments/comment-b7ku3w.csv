Like having an eating disorder vs having disordered eating sometimes go hand in hand but they’re not the same.  So if someone said “I’m eating ice shaped like flowers” that’s not the same as “I’m purposely starving myself to be skinny and whatever™️”  Sometimes people don’t eat and that has NOTHING to do with us. ,False,False
