Im having a really hard time and feel so out of control. Being able to control my intake is literally the only thing which I have power over, and being successful at it makes me so much happier. For me it's not about being a certain size cos I hate my body, it's about maintaining control over 1 single thing and staying strong. Every now &amp; then I need to plan to see folk to keep up the pretence (mid morning/mid afternoon coffee dates.... Lunch time isn't convenient today) so it's a focus &amp; a goal. I know I need to do certain things to stay ""undiscovered"".",False,False

I have ADD which in turn gives me depression because I also have severe perfectionistic tendencies and am terrified of failure. My ED gives me motivation, a goal, control, and a predicted outcome should I follow my plans/math to a T.   Sad, but it makes me happier than if I didn’t have it. Sometimes I worry about when I hit my goal bc my perfectionism makes me not want to be severely underweight (shooting for that 18.5 BMI lol how arbitrary) but I’m afraid of not having weight loss goals anymore. I’m trying to integrate more exercise than just elliptical and walking so that maybe I can transition from weight loss goals to gym goals.",False,False
