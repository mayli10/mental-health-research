If someone's post History doesn't contain something NSFW, mental health , or just weird ; it's probably their side account/hobby account. I have a separate account I barely use so I can post in my local community subs. ",False,False

The media has made it so that girls with 17.5 BMIs are the norm, so guys think that's what a healthy weight looks like. Not complaining, the ignorance is just kind of annoying. I feel like I'm working so hard, the least other people (guys in my life especially) could do is call their preferences what they are, but no one's going to say ""I want an underweight girl"" lol",False,False
