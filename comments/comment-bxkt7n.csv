Lots of talking and helping, you keep your hands busy, and people won't really want food around the area anyway except for maybe some tea/coffee  Video games - this is something where I feel like people will be snacking but you won't stand out if you don't. Have a couch co-op party, or go to a gaming/Internet cafe, or even an irl physical arcade.  DnD is another one where I feel like it would be normal to set out snacks but you wouldn't stick out too much if you didn't eat. If you kept it to grazing (chips, candy, etc) and not something like pizza then you could eat less than others and no one would really notice.  Maybe a book club? Maybe I just want to be a grandma and knit and read books and drink tea with cashew milk all day",False,False

Painting classes are so much fun as a social activity and a good suggestion if people have money for it, because I don’t even think about food when I am doing one of those classes, it requires too much attention. Sadly even when I go to the movies or have a videogame night I can be completely immersed and still be thinking about popcorn/food :((",False,False

Shopping in general, I love craft stores, personally  Dog parks if you have a dog Pet stores Quiz nights at some bars. I never felt pressure to drink.
