Except instead of flirting with the band director, I spent most of my lunches with the white girl in the bathroom.   College was very different for me. I went to a new city, cleaned up my act and started eating more often. Got kicked out of college, came home, relapsed right back into a size 2. Cleaned up again and met my now husband.   After meeting him, I started eating off limit foods and gained a wonderful 60 love pounds over the first 6 years.  3 years ago, I was diagnosed recovered with ADHD, MDD and GAD. Got laid off work, lived with my bulimic SIL and started taking ADHD medicine and dropped 35#. Kept it off for a year. Went back to work and gained it all back.  Now I’m just an average overweight twenty-something, searching the pantry for self-control. ",False,False

I often struggle with identifying what’s really bothering me or why I’m frustrated and venting to someone else can help clarify my thoughts. Left to sort it out on my own, I specialize in the avoidance strategy. As if trying not to think about my problems makes them disappear. If you ever want to vent more, feel free to PM me. It sounds like we have some similar experiences.  I’m sorry you had to deal with that. I think it especially sucks to deal with issues like these growing up, because it makes it that much harder to realize things aren’t normal. I got glimpses of ‘normal’ through TV families and friends, but it never struck me how dysfunctional my family was until I moved away from home and, by then, it was really difficult to even attempt to change patterns of behavior I learned in response to growing up in a dysfunctional environment. I was also indoctrinated into a mindset to make everyone else happy pretty early. I apologized excessively, including for various things that were absolutely ridiculous like breathing too loud in an effort to minimize drama. My mother was/is controlling and, I guess, emotionally abusive. She’d make selfish decisions that hurt me and then rewrite history to make it sound like she was selfless. If I complained, she’d start telling me about all the abuse she dealt with growing up and make me feel ridiculous for daring to say anything. If I really upset her, she’d threaten to kill herself. She basically trained me to the point where she could put me down and then ask me to confirm she was a great mom, and I did it to keep the peace, until it felt normal. My father wasn’t without issues either, but he was definitely less controlling, and I often wonder how my life would have turned out if I’d lived with him. Or if I’d learned to stand up to my mother earlier. Maybe I also would have ended up with fewer mental disorders.   But, unfortunately, we can’t change the past and we can’t change others. So I’m working on what I can change, which is myself and how I respond to things. It is very slow going because there are a lot of issues to tackle. But all we can do is keep trying, right?  Wishing you all the best!",False,False

When I was 10 my parents split up and I was always closer to my dad so I wanted to go live with him once he had his new place set up. Except that I felt like if I left her too she wouldn't be able to handle it. By then I was already well indoctrinated into the whole ""be who everyone wants you to be"" mindset, so I was always focused on doing what would make her happiest. Even when she started dating this absolute piece of trash guy and asked we would be okay with him moving in after meeting him once of course I said yes. My mom obviously wouldn't invite a literal garbage man to live with us and it would make her so happy if I were to live with this complete stranger. Turns out he was selfish and possibly even evil when she wasn't around. The basics, he was an alcoholic who liked Jerry Springer and may have beaten my baby cousin when nobody else was around. After a few years she finally kicked him out because he was drunk and tried to pick a fight with my brother when she went to throw the laundry in the dryer. What probably took under 5 minutes was enough time for the two of them to be literally nose to nose. That's what she walked in on. Even though he was largely ruining her life while they were together she was still getting worse and worse after she dumped him though. She really started to take things out on my cousin and that's when things got extra complicated because I also wanted my cousin to be happy and she's literally a child, so I had to protect her when I mom would give her punishments way out of proportion for whatever way my cousin had acted out. Can't do that while making mom happy though. Still want to make her happy even though she was abusing a child. Still wanted to live with my dad, but now I couldn't leave because my cousin would be all alone if I wasn't there. My brother didn't care one way or another about anyone but himself, so she needed me. I tried for a while to help her without standing up to my mom, but eventually I kinda started to hate my mom. Except I still wanted to make her happy. But I wanted to make my cousin happy even more, so I started arguing with her a lot over the ways she wanted to punish my cousin. If young me had just gone to live with my dad I could have had a healthy environment to grow up in and maybe I wouldn't have been so sick from stress that I missed 40 days of school each semester in high school. Almost definitely also wouldn't be living with possibly 5 different mental illnesses. My dad's not the greatest parent, but we never fight because we just get along. He's a nice guy and absolutely not an abuser. He's not nurturing either, but I probably would have at least been more comfortable talking about any problems I had and actually dealing with them instead of repressing them to the point that friends of mine who I actually barely even knew started to realize something was wrong before even I did.  Anyway, just kinda like to vent sometimes. I don't know how to actually deal with this stuff, so hopefully just talking about it helps.",False,False

It was really shitty of her to make jokes when I talked about it as a kid and to act completely shocked in high school when I wanted to join a team (grade 9). Basically my whole life was spent trying to fit into peoples' expectations because of the way I was treated as a kid, so when it came to doing something people didn't expect of me I guess I just wanted to minimize what people were aware of as much as possible.

I didn’t count calories or anything in high school, but I frequently skipped breakfast and lunch because I hated school food and I technically was supposed to get free meals. I never really felt hungry. I’d eat a packet of candy so I had energy for extracurriculars like cheerleading. And then dinner was frequently a shit show because my family fought over getting their fair share of food and I ‘kept the peace’ by eating as little as possible.  I might be fooling myself but it never felt like it was about body image back then. It didn’t cause me the stress that food and exercise cause now.

I was still missing at least 40 days of school per semester though. I'm surprised I even managed to pass all of my courses. I was sick a lot between not eating right, not sleeping right, and all the stress I was under. Definitely didn't help that my mom was a heavy smoker too.
