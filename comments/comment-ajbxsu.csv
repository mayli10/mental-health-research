I'm pretty damaged myself, but I can usually control my bingeing, so I'll try. You seem to be distressed, and rightly so. Do you have anyone you can talk to? Is your doctor aware of your issues with ED?  For your bingeing problem, have you tried taking your time to eat when you binge? Not eating in front of the TV, using a smaller fork/spoon and a smaller plate usually do the trick for me. I also try not to buy food I'm certain I'll get through in minutes, like cookies, rice, bread and cakes. I put conscious obstacles (i.e. distance) between me and the food. You can make a point of eating in front of people (if you're able to), to benefit from the social pressure. You can also try to restrict your food intake by budgeting. I only allow myself a certain amount of money per day that I can spend on food (makes me have to shop more often, but at least I don't go on self-loathing spirals as much).   If you manage to overcome some of your bingeing, you won't feel like punishing yourself as much when you're restricting. You can do this. Don't be your ED's bitch. We're all obsessed with control, here, so try to control how much your ED affects you life, and make that disease YOUR bitch (&lt; this isn't good, healthy advice, btw, but it's kept me out of the hospital, so...)  Lastly, please be kinder to yourself and your body. I don't know what made you need surgery, but I'm sure your body can't be all that bad, so try and be a good owner of it, if you can. Also, for your stomach issues, may I suggest eating more fiber?  ",False,False
