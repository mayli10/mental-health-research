I used to consider it IF, but now I'm consistently going 24 hours before eating and then I absolutely stuff my face. I'm pretty sure it's what caused me to have a seizure the other night though, because I ate so much so fast. I'm having a really hard time eating lately :/",False,False

It was mainly to put off the anxiety that eating anything would cause. It really felt like a chore I ""had"" to do in order to keep from fainting or exhaustion (and even that didn't deter me...at first), a daily obligation I didn't want to complete",False,False

I don’t eat until after 3pm or 4pm so I can baby horde all my meals at one time and feel like I’m properly eating something. But even when it’s like 3-4pm I’ll clean or check homework or anything to past the time of not eating.,False,False
