I'll go through a whole bag in one sitting sometimes. Pickles? Give me the whole damn jar. I'll even dip fuckin bread into salad dressing because vinegar is my best friend. I know vinegar can be used for veggies and salad and other healthy shit, but maybe it's the salt or fat content that pairs with it so well.  That being said, I've heard a lot about doing an ACV shot in the morning, might give it a try. I bought a big bottle of the stuff for that purpose.",False,False

Most people without EDs don’t even realise what a caloric blessing it is lol. I would give you tips for millet, but since it’s about binging I’m not sure if that’s appropriate. Oh and vegan nuggets/fake meat... I aspire to be a person who eats an actual serving and leaves the rest for the next day lol.  No, thank you. I honestly thought I was the only person in the world who likes raw cold tofu! It was kind of therapeutic to write this all out tbh :) have a lovely evening x",False,False

Almost everything you mention (not the millet, i am too bad at cooking it) I can relate. Granola is def. the devil and OMG the veggie hot dogs!!!! Give me all the sausages. This + bread are like the combo of an obligatory binge. Thank you for shared. Feeling less lonely.",False,True

I especially love smoked tofu, I will eat it cold and raw because of the flavour. Vegan cheese is heaven, but it breaks me out (likewise with all the nutbutters), but at least I have an excuse to avoid it I guess.  I personally love most veggies and fruit, but my fav binge ones would be:  1- Butternut squash. God tier vegetable, I could eat a whole one in one sitting just roasted and lightly salted.  2. Grapes. Especially green slightly grapes that have a crunch or candy cotton variety. I would die for them, but my gut after all that fibre? Not too happy.  3. Pineapple. Again could easily finish a kilo of it if my mouth wouldn’t nearly start bleeding from the acid.  4. Beans. I love all kind of beans, just boiled and lightly salted. But I never but them, because I know I can’t contain myself and the bloat after isn’t worth it.  5. Quinoa. The nutty flavour just f*s me up, so good salty or sweet with some almond milk.  6. Millet. This is a huge childhood comfort food to me, so I don’t risk having it in the cupboard because I know I will make a whole bag of it if I feel down. It’s so creamy and just a bit of stevia makes it amazing.  7. Coconut flour. I used to be so obsessed with it I lived almost entirely off it. I would mix it with cashew milk, add some stevia and cacao nibs and it was the most perfect “porridge”. However after binging on a whole bag once I can’t look at it anymore because it gave me the worst stomach ache imaginable.  8. Frozen fruit. When I get too stubborn to order actual food, but desperately want something sweet. My teeth don’t appreciate it.  9. Veggie hot dogs/patties. I am physically unable to buy a package and not finish it on the same day.  10. Veggies dips (hummus is great, but the oil in it scares me sometimes so I make my own). Oh and vegan patte, it’s like crack! Sometimes on corn thins, sometimes by itself.  11.  Granola. I have established that it’s something I can’t have in my house ever, because it has all the components I love (sweet + crunchy).   BONUS: if I crave cereal I buy a small pack of sweet and salty popcorn, small bag of vegan chocolate chips and coconut bites. I melt the chocolate in microwave in a big bowl, add popcorn, crunchy bites and top with sweetened cashew/soy milk. It comes to around 400 cals, but it’s really good and satisfying (and easy to portion control since all the stuff is pre-packed).  I probably binged on a lot of healthy foods after per example whole day of restriction. Thankfully I am terrified of anything unhealthy and rarely go for those, but if I have per example a vegan pizza and ice cream my stomach will hurt much less than having a few mangoes and broccoli. It does reduce the calorie damage though :)",False,False

They are a deep hole. You used to have orthorexia, do you? Sounds like 'healthy' 'safe' choices. I had them too like everyday when i was at my worst (yay for 'Buddha bowls' of healthy things clearly separated with no oil etc.!!)  Ah and : sweet potatoes for me.",False,True

I used to eat them in such quantities that I would purposely go a week without buying them so my skin wouldn't turn yellow.  2. Gummies. I can mindlessly plow through those fuckers like a vacuum cleaner.  3. Soy milk. Yeah, I don't know.  4. Protein bars.  5. This one paleo pancake mix. Not the pancakes. Just spoonfuls of powder.  6. Spinach. Can go through an entire pound pretty quick.  7. Cereal. Doesn't matter what kind. Starts with soy milk, usually transitions to dry.  8. Rice cakes. How do people not consume the entire bag in one go?  9. Celery. Basically my 'safe' binge food.   10. Ketchup or mustard. Literally just the condiment.  11. Tangerines. I'll survive on those for days if given the opportunity.  And then the usual sweets and bread and such.",False,False
