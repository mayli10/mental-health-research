I guess it’d do no harm for binge only episodes. I try to rinse asap after I’m done, even if it’s just a swish of water.   If it were me, I’d probably just brush my teeth soon after anyway, because the longer the sugars are hanging around your teeth, the more likely you’ll get cavities.

But do you know if there is much to do after eating really chewy sticky stuff like taffy or syrupy stuff (besides just not eating it)?,False,True
