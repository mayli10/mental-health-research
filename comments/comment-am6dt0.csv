It's manipulative and controlling. You have no need to feel guilty.  The next time she cares so much about *privilege*, ask her when she last donated food to the people she's so concerned about. Since she's such a *sincere* activist.  You're an adult; she has no legal right to make you eat if you say no. Normally I wouldn't encourage anyone in this sub to turn down food, but with how she's duct-taping guilt and helplessness to it, she is actively making this *worse* and *harder*.  That's not the kind of love that anyone needs.  The only way her behavior is even understandable is if things are so desperate that if she doesn't find some way to make you eat even a little, you will die soon. And even then, it's not acceptable, because if things are that horrifyingly precarious, what she needs to be doing is helping you get professional medical treatment.  Just...wow. I'm so sorry.",False,False

On week days I can do that, but on weekends when she is at home 24 hours I can't do nothing, she just cook something for me without asking me first, and I said to her I don't want to eat, she just throw the emotionally "" I made with so much love"" or ""people don't have food and you have the privilage to eat something food and refuse"" I hate this feeling, I feel so guilty that I endeup eating half and saying i'm full. I hate eating and just wish a food pill so in this way I will never have to eat again. ",False,True

But you know what they say about roads paved with good intentions...  Nondisordered people don't seem to get that forcing disordered people to eat isn't a cure, it's like debarking a dog. Sometimes it feels like they don't even want to help/fix the problem at all, they just don't want to see it...",False,False
