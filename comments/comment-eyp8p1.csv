For atypical anorexia you have every symptom of anorexia just not an underweight bmi. I‚Äôm not gonna speak for everyone but I feel a lot of people won‚Äôt seek/get proper help since they‚Äôre not underweight which is bad because your heart can stop just as easily when you‚Äôre starving yourself at a ‚Äúhealthy‚Äù bmi vs. an underweight one.,False,False

I'm probably about to get downvoted to hell but to offer an alternative perspective, all disorders are fucking horrible and all symptoms can be debilitating, you may not realize it but in this thread alone you are glorifying the fuck out of anorexia and pushing the narrative that fuels the tip posts you hate so much by acting like having AN is some special club only the chosen ones can join and it's so much more special and hard than any other ed.   Nobody posting on an ED forum trying to restrict has a healthy relationship with food. And you specifically called out posts from people struggling w binging trying to celebrate getting out of a binge cycle not asking for tips whatsoever and I think that's a little mean and childish. I hate the stupid ED clout shit but I've had diagnosed AN half my life and I can still empathize with how horrible it feels to be in a binge cycle you desperately want to escape. Restricting isn't harder or more deserving of praise.   Just saying. I would never give anyone info that would possibly harm them or worsen an ED but this isn't a restrictors club here and every disorder should be able to commiserate about their equally debilitating struggles, ESPECIALLY the actual deadliest ed in the world.
