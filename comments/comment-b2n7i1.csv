Maybe not as bad as starving yourself constantly.. but nonetheless! Eat because your are hungry and want to fuel your body. Not because you want to not hurt your moms feelings. You are the child and she is the parent. She needs to get her shit together and not be offended because her daughter didn't eat some crisps. That is HER problem not yours. Best of luck! :),False,False

I was planning on fasting today but my mom brought me a huge piece of birthday cake from work cause it's my favorite so I'm sure I'll eat the whole thing cause I have no self control. I've tried telling her I'm going on a diet or cutting out sugar or whatever but she forgets and says she just knew I'd like whatever it is she brought home, so I eat it anyway. It's a rough cycle abd Idk what to do about it but just know I'm in the same boat. ",False,False
