I paied that much for an MRI copay once. Holy hell insurance makes no sense!

That sounds like one of my nightmare scenarios. It sounds like that non profit was the company that ""helped"" you. It's such a wonky line, forcing help on people. It isn't unheard of though, when non profits take money from the government to ""help"" people, and then they don't do shit. John Oliver did a show about some rehabs that use UAs as basically a way to get the government/insurance to pay them.   https://www.rollingstone.com/tv/tv-news/watch-john-oliver-reveal-scams-of-americas-35-billion-rehab-industry-627776/  We have no oversight for shit like this.",False,False

The place police took me to says it's a nonprofit receiving federal funding, so maybe not having to pay was just lucky? Regardless of pay, the system is broken in my opinion. I should never have been committed in the first place, and when a parent called in to advocate on my behalf to no avail, they flew down and visited in person to still have to see me locked up for the full 72 hours. All of this while I wasn't being treated at all for anything; no medication, no counseling, just sitting and waiting with no shoes and one pair of clothes while people with mental health issues that legitimately made them violent were freely walking about around me. All of this the weekend before finals so I couldn't study (no metal ringed notebooks allowed).",False,False

Its a valid concern because I know my copay for 3 weeks of residential was $4,000. The girl I know who was there on an involuntary basis came from a family with money, so it makes me wonder if they default to the insurance someone already has or if its assessed case by case.",False,False

Or is it Medicare (federal)coverage? Is it a separate waiver of some kind? Do they only pay for x amount of time?    I'm really just curious because for some things, even with doctors recommending care, Medicare will only pay for so much time (like for something like skilled nursing its 100 days- and even then its 2 weeks at 100% and then 80% and your supplemental insurance is *supposed to* pick up the rest. )Medicaid is different though and can work differently from state to state. Then there has to be a facility that can take you. Some states don't have that readily available (lookin' at you Iowa).  Its really about having the right circumstances though. It helps immensely if you have family in your corner to advocate for you. (I say this as a positive even though I know OP doesn't *want* help but it is a good thing when people want you to live)  I'm sure you didn't see a bill but was there ever an explanation of benefits? That tells you what services were provided/the amount billed? Again, I'm just curious because medical treatment doesn't make any goddamn sense in this country.",False,False

So, just as points of interest...  In the US, the general criteria for an involuntary 72-hour psychiatric hold are being either a danger to self, a danger to others, or gravely disabled (inability to take basic care of yourself). Depending on their evaluation of you, holds can be extended *far* past 72-hours.  With forced physical care itâ€™s also murky - I think some questions of mental competence come into play. I know after an intentional OD my expressed desire for no medical attention was disregarded. I think there have been some court cases over forced feeding for adult ED patients.  Bottom line though, I hope none of us find ourselves in these situations - it usually means things are reallllllllly bad.",False,False
