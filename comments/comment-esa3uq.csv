Lately though, it kind of catches up with me and I'll snap out of it and realize how I just spoke to myself, and how I would never in a million years even say that to anyone else.  Not saying you have to change the dialogue, but maybe check in to the validity of calling yourself a slob/lazy/disgraceful/greedy/POS and whether you prescribe those words to others. Are those your words? Did you come up with that? Or is something in society/your family/toxic friends driving you there?  I never realized how harmful those thoughts were, it was just so natural to feel that way, I never questioned that voice even once. But it wasn't my true voice. It still isn't my true voice even if I think it from time to time.",False,False

I had a hellish month and feel like I completely derailed. My gw now seems so ridiculously out of reach. I hate the self-sabotage.
