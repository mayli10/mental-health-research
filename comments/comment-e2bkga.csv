That's how relationships are supposed to work, you try to avoid doing things that hurt the other person. And honestly it's NOT an unreasonable request, no matter how much people try to normalize it it's shitty to openly look at porn when it hurts your partner!!",False,False

I'm just afraid to say anything and come off as ""crazy and insecure"" you know? Do I have the right to tell him to unfollow them if it hurts me? That's my dilemma.",False,True

If he pulled something petty like that I'd be pissed and I try to live by that logic when I'm in a relationship. Thank you for your feedback ü•∞,False,True

I‚Äôd probably break up with a guy who did that and made no effort to hide it. It‚Äôs one thing for him to watch porn but a totally different thing to have it all out in the open.

I don't understand why some guys follow that shit on their main account where their friends and family can see it lmao. he might be addicted to looking at it as a way to cope with his problems, but to me that still doesn't justify following 1k+ accounts. don't most people occasionally go incognito on google chrome and leave no trace behind? anyway, I'm clueless when it comes to men and I don't understand their motives. I'm sorry you're feeling hurt and I've been in the same situation before. I hope it gets better üíï p.s. if you want to show him how it feels you could follow a bunch of body building/fitness accounts and like shirtless pics of guys while he's browsing his stash at night ü§≠ jk that's probably terrible advice but I like to give people a taste of their own medicine.",False,False
