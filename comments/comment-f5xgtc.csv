Don't take more than the recommended dose. If you're not actually constipated that will be more than enough and you're less likely (still likely tho) to do serious damage to your digestive track. Make sure and drink more water than you normally would as you will be losing some, maybe even take a dioralyte to keep your electrolytes in check..",False,False

I’m tough when it comes to pain, but laxatives have given me some of the worst. Its not worth it, at least not stimulant lax. I suggest just eating fiber if you wanna shit for weigh ins. Less pain, and less fear of shifting yourself",False,False

PLEASE do not take laxatives if you can help it. Almost anything else is better. HARM REDUCTION: Go on a walk or drink some coffee to get yourself digestion moving. Drink a lot of water or a probiotic. Remember - the digestive system works by putting pressure on your guts so that things keep moving right along. At the very least please remember that food *technically* is only going to stay in your body for around 8-10 hours depending on your digestion. Even if it’s longer I promise you waiting it out until you feel okay again will be better than going down this path. I love you kind stranger ... I know how desperate you must feel if you’re at this point. But please please please don’t take the lax if you can help it. PM me if you’d like some other harm reduction strategies - I have a few I like to use but didn’t want to overwhelm you. ❤️,False,False

I've been abusing laxatives for 5 years and please just don't do it. It is really harmful for your body and much easier to change your mind if you don't do it to begin with.
