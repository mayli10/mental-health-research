This is serious, and we are all here listening and here to support you. Your feelings are valid. Parents suck sometimes, and I went through something very similar when I was younger.   If you feel comfortable, tell another trusted adult in your life. A counselor, teacher, etc. If you don’t, that’s okay too. Unfortunately some people just can’t get it through their thick skulls how serious this is, and sometimes you just need someone to listen and be supportive.   Hang in there, okay? There are people who care and people who listen or help, or whatever you need. Sometimes those people aren’t our parents though. I’m so sorry. Please reach out if you need to talk.",False,False
