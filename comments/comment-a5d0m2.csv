I'm stuck in an excellent yoyo in that I don't want to be underweight starve and die but I don't want to gain weight either. So I have this incredibly small range of safe weight that's not quite under weight but not even close to over weight (110-115 maxing out at 120 but God forbid I ever go back there). And yeah I've probably never weighed more than 125 in my life but God knows I'm TERRIFIED OF THAT because that's only 10+lb away from an overweight BMI. God I hate this.  It's so exhausting because the worst part is I've BEEN healthy before I'm just so afraid of getting fat AGAIN.,False,False
