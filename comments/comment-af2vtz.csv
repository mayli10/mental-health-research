Have you ever tried the Enlightened cookies and cream ice cream bars by any chance (if they’re available near you?)  *Sometimes* one will satisfy my craving. 80 cals per bar + protein. And they’re good! Not quite as good but pretty good imho, and one bar feels slightly more substantial to me than one serving of Oreos. (  (Of course I often have to take it with me or step far, far away from the freezer so that one “ice cream” bar doesn’t immediately turn into four, lol. But there are only four in the box. So even if I become a rabid fucking animal and end up gorging myself on the whole damn package, it’s still way less calories/carbs/sugar than eating a whole package of cookies. Haha.)  ......Oreos are great tho. Fuck. I feel your pain.",False,False
