My boyfriend lives near Texas and I live in New York, we're about 1400 miles away from one another. It is super easy to lie to him but I just don't want to. I feel like it's hurting him. I feel badly too because he doesn't really have anyone to vent to as a gay man in the South in a long distance relationship and I'm so out of it all the time.  I hope you are too, this shit is so difficult and can be really taxing in a relationship.",False,False

I relapsed in August or September of this past year and we've been together for two and a half years. It's hard to make people not worry when what we're doing is worrisome and they care. Ultimately, with these people that love you, you can't just say ""Don't worry!"" because you're hurting yourself and they want the best for you. With my boyfriend I'm trying to make an effort to be healthier and I told him he could access where I record my food. I try not to lie to him because I feel that that puts him into sort of a ""fear of the unknown"" area. Recently I've been trying to find us a hobby that we'll both like so that even though I'm struggling with my eating disorder we're spending time together and still fostering our relationship.",False,False
