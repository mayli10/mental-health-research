Your body has muscle memory and will be eager to recuperate lost muscle. Stay safe, we're here for you",False,False

But then I stopped for a long time (thanks surgery) and now I can barely run 3 minutes after running 3 half marathons.  So I’m trying to get a bit more in shape starting with the elliptical and always do glute and side-glute (like the adduction/abduction “gyno” machines) that my surgery hip will allow. I also joined a martial arts gym and I’m hoping that will help with my arms, it’s like more punching than kicking, which I can’t really do anyway 😕 but you can do this all at home until you can work up to weights! Just look up the exercises and start there. I have a few apps called “Easy arms/legs/butt”, you can set the intensity, time, and equipment you have available. ",False,False

I’ve been dizzy and nauseated for a few months (med side effects and a chronic illness) so I stopped going to the gym. I’m planning to get back to going before the end of this month, no matter what. But my quads and glutes are just...gone. I have the body of a flabby old woman even though I’m at just about my lw.   I was working out 5 days per week making good progress for months and then it just went off the rails. Now my shoulder hurt for two days after I took out the trash; actually getting back to weightlifting isn’t going to be pretty.   Make sure you get enough protein, it makes a *huge* difference!",False,False

My 2 cents would be to eat maintenance/at a slight surplus if you can, and keep training; you'll lean out and feel much better. ",False,False
