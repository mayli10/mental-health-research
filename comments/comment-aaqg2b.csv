It’s not your true weight, it’s nowhere close, because of all the extras: the food weight, the water weight, the bloating, the hormonal reaction to the fact that you’ve been eating more than usual. Would the number upset you if you’d been fully dressed wearing army boots and holding a puppy? Probably not, so this shouldn’t upset you either. Regroup and don’t weigh again until you initially wanted to! You don’t even know how accurate your sister’s scales are. I only trust my weight on my own scales. ",False,False
