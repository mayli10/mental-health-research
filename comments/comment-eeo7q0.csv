When i hit my first GW i remember thinking i still wasn’t skinny and couldn’t believe that number didn’t equal thin. So i made a new GW. And i hit that one. And i still didn’t think i was thin. So now i have a new GW and knowing how the other ones went... i don’t know when it will be enough. And I’m still just as sad when i started.   We will get through this. Life sucks and shit is hard. I think my goal now is to accept things in my life that i can’t control and work to make the thins i can control a little bit better. I’m not going to stop restricting - but i want to work on other things besides my weight. It will be okay ❤️,False,False
