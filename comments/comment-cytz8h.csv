Unfortunately, I also know it's really unhealthy. And despite the symptoms, I wish I had my period back because as an athlete I'm terrified of osteoporosis. I'm not even underweight and it's a sign that my body is already breaking down",False,False

I got a surgery to laser off what could be gotten rid of, then was put on meds to stop my periods (and stop the endo) and now I have an IUD that helps a lot. Just wanted to let you ladies know that it can get better eventually!",False,False

I'm trying to find a gyno who will actually take me seriously. Anyways, my periods are currently how yours were- light and spotty and only a few days. Usually they last 9 days with cramps so bad I cant even move",False,False

My periods are INSANELY heavy and painful, I get some cramps and my last few periods were very light and only lasted a few days, they usually lasted 8-10 days.   The cramping is gone now but I still get stabbing pains occasionally. The last time I was supposed to have my period, I bloated so bad and my cervix felt like it was getting punched every time I sat down. I couldn't sit right, it was awful.",False,False
