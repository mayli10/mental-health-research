It is a helpful assumption when we eat out really... I guess I should thank child me for that? ðŸ˜‚,False,True

I think its the idea of the amount of food i am expected to eat over a period of time. Im very controlling about how i eat and if i eat its something i eat very fast and its something small like a rice cake with peanut butter or carrots with hummus or an apple. I cant think of the last time i sat down to eat a real meal. The idea of a meal is a commitment to someone who doesnt eat them.,False,False
