I quit gymnastics, and I started eating normally and gained from underweight. I did some work on myself retraining how to recognize thoughts and behaviors and patterns. I was able to do this a few times, but every relapse it got harder, and now I feel totally stuck.  Just my two cents. Eating disorders are chronic, and they often get worse with each relapse the same way it happened with my alcoholism. The first time I quit drinking, I got sober for 3.5 years with no treatment and just going to AA. The second time, I had to spend a month in inpatient rehab because I just couldn't stop.",False,False

I know exactly what you mean about people who are aggressive in their victim narrative. And by claiming anorexia or an eating disorder, I feel they're really disenfranchising a lot of people. There's nothing invalid about being negatively impacted by diet culture - there's a lot to be upset about there! But you dont need to claim a mental illness and equate it with dieting to feel valid.  When I was studying psychology (around 2000) eating disorders were briefly touched on as part of the syllabus but they literally ascribed them to societal pressures to be thin. It's not like bio/neuro/genetic factors weren't known about then but the beauty myth sociological narrative had taken over.   At the same time, I was wasting my time in treatment with the same crap. Anorexia had just become ammo for a feminist campaign against the media and it impacted people's treatment.
