A trusted adult? A parent, maybe a therapist? All I can suggest is to stay away from recovery tags on tumblr and Instagram because some very messed up people are putting thinspo in them. In fact, it may be best to stay away from the internet in general, spend time outside with your friends/family/pets. Remember that it is okay to have these thoughts, recovery is a long and difficult journey and having these thoughts do not make you weak. There will be times when your ED screams at you, you just need to scream back louder ðŸ’–",False,False
