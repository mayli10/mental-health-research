But! Life doesnt start being over at a certain age, despite what society says. Some people dont become successful till they're middle aged. Some people dont start college till after most people graduate. That doesnt mean they arent successful. Every life has a different path. You create that path. You dont have to be bound by the timelines our society has created. Seriously, you are young, your life hasn't really started yet. Trust me, if you keep working hard, you will get things how you want them!",False,False
