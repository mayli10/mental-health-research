I’m pretty tall and there were some days I was burning nearly 3500 calories as we booked it up the mountains. So by the end of the second day I probably had a 6500-7000 calorie deficit which just doesn’t work. The typical low or even high restriction (300 / 1000) would still leave you as a casualty needing serious help to get out in a few days because you’d be at a 5500-6700 deficit.  Find something with energy that you can eat, even if it isn’t nutritious. If you need to (and your BF is familiar with your ED), ask him to pack foods without the labels if you think it’d help. While my original comment was sort of brag-y/humorous, I’ll be totally honest and say that you shouldn’t go backpacking if you can’t eat enough. You’re out in the wilderness and if shit goes wrong, it goes *very* wrong very fast. I’ve stopped going winter backpacking and have had to dramatically cut down how hard of trips I take because I know I’ll either become a medical emergency or die. I hope once I get better I can go on all the backpacking trips I want to again, but I know that’s unfortunately far off",False,False

I made it two days nine mile days before I was fading so hard my friends though I was dying. Ended up giving up on that one because I didn't want to end up causing a medical emergency lol  but even in normal circumstances I'm a weak bitch and only can do like four days before I get hit with flu symptoms and feel like I can't move,False,False
