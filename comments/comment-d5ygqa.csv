My roommate and I had chronic constipation for months on end and finally (independently) tried dulcolax, I missed class for three days, and she went to the hospital. We threw the boxes away and then read that the pain from that is so bad it can actually simulate childbirth. Use anything other than dulcolax, every doctor I've spoken to has told me to veer clear and use stool softeners like miralax instead.",False,False

Magnesium citrate can be found in most pharmacies and that shit is no joke, it’s what surgeons give to patients who need to have an empty Howell for surgery the next day.  It’s a salt solution that pulls excess water into your large intestine and softens the hell outta your shits.  You will absolutely blow foam all day if you take this whole bottle.  Seconding the recommendation for psyllium husk and plenty of water.  Also just a good filling option if you’re restricting.  I also really like Swiss Kriss, an herbal laxative.  If you’re a jazz head like me, you may find it interesting that Louis Armstrong was a huge fan of it as well and would recommend it to friends and eventually [wound up becoming something of a spokesman for it.](https://auctions.potterauctions.com/ItemImages/000010/62_469_1_med.jpeg) (if you’re not a jazz fan and wonder why he was all about this, well, heroin really can constipate a person, and Louis knew heroin.)",False,False

I used it extensively when I was pregnant (because I abruptly quit coffee and could not poop for like a month), at the behest of my doctor. It can take a little while to work, and you need to drink a lot of water with it, but I found it both helpful and non-irritating. Decaf coffee also seems to help. Senna tea, too, if you’re looking for a natural option.",False,False

I know it's not natural, but I've found it to be ~very~ effective and doesn't make me feel sick.   Also psyllium husk (Metamucil) could be another option. Make sure to drink lots of water with it! It's literally just fiber so if there isnt enough water it can add to the constipation.",False,False
