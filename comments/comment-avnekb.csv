Keto is for people with epilepsy, diabetes, and insulin resistance. There‚Äôs no reason to do the ketogenic diet for any other reason, and especially not for particular ‚Äúhealth benefits‚Äù or weight loss. It was never about weight loss, it was about managing epilepsy or managing healthy blood sugar levels and body fat percentage.  And considering that, I think it‚Äôs pretty rude to say people who do eat ketogenic smell bad because of it just because the way of eating doesn‚Äôt suit your morals.",False,False

Looking back now as a vegan it's even more disgusting. Carbs are not (necessarily) the devil, sugar and flour products are. Oil is bullshit. We need to eat whole foods and plenty of fiber.

But JUST eating protein and fat, especially when people tend to choose saturated fat sources, for long periods of time is terrible on your cardiovascular health, and there is a LOT of evidence to back this is up.  Too much protein is bad for you. Normal people dont need more than 50g per day, the rest you will just pee out. Making your kidneys process hundereds of grams of amini acids in your blood is terrible for them and will lead to kidney stones.  Too much saturated fat and cholesterol is bad for you. Unsaturated fat is generally considered harmless in moderation, but the fat from coconut oil or animals is heavily associated with reduced artery function and eventually, heart disease. Doesn't matter if you are young, the effect is cumulative and it will make you more likely to have problems in later life.   A lot of people eating the fad version of keto will make their diet literally consist of these two things, and have hundreds of grams of each per day for months or years. It's bad for you.",False,False

The problem with the rise in popularity is that no-ones doing it correctly. You don't need 'fat bombs'. Also, you don't have to eat meat or animal products to be keto. Personally, I blame shows like 'the doctors' and gossip/'health' magazines.  Basically, your diet SHOULD be:  50% leafy greens and vegetables  25% fat  20% protein   5% unprocessed carbs  When you actually calculate this into grams/ounces it's not that much. You will get everything from your balanced meals. No bacon and eggs for breakfast everyday and no 'fat bombs'. It's actually a well balanced diet if you do it properly.
