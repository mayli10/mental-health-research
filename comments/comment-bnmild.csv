I take [Oxylent](https://www.amazon.com/Oxylent-Multivitamin-Supplement-Mandarin-Packet/dp/B002DSS3BA) everyday and when I forget to take it, I feel shaky and dizzy.  I have to take colostrum &amp; collagen for a health condition, and I’ve noticed that they really help with inflammation/muscle repair. Collagen in particular has really improved my skin, hair &amp; nails! I love to mix [Primal Kitchen](https://www.amazon.com/Primal-Kitchen-Collagen-Protein-Vanilla/dp/B071ZG164V/ref=mp_s_a_1_6?keywords=vanilla+collagen+powder&amp;qid=1557665982&amp;s=gateway&amp;sprefix=vanilla+collagen&amp;sr=8-6) vanilla coconut powder with tea, coconut milk, and Jordan’s Skinny syrup; I’m currently drinking a delicious birthday cake flavored tea.",False,False

There's probably a correlation between muscle recovery and calories consumption, but I'm too lazy to actually research it.",False,False

Electrolytes will also help significantly with muscle recovery.,False,False
