I use the word crash dieting all the time and people are totes cool with it! If I were to say I starve myself, well then I’d have some problems even though they are the same thing....",False,False

Like, I'm not in control, I'm controlled by a mental illness!!! And still be like ""oh wow how can you eat so much"" if you decide to be like fuck this and have a nice big meal at a restaurant or something, it's so fucked up.   It's not until people get to Eugenia Cooney levels of bad that people actually start to worry. Until then your body is still praised and seen as an ideal. It's all over media, super underweight girls being lauded for their beauty and cute bodies. Just the other day I saw some completely normal-sized girl (probably the low side of a normal BMI) being called ""thick"" on a popular subreddit. Like???? No she is not thick she's totally normal sized, jfc.   Rant over sorry lol.",False,False

Obviously the main difference is they can’t keep it up and we do, but your confused and frustrated feelings are totally valid. I was in denial all the way to getting emaciated because I was just “~*eating healthy*~”",False,False
