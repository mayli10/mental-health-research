And if you believe that it’s healthier to be dying of malnourishment than have a BMI of 31 with no health issues then you can go fuck yourself,False,False

Everyone here does. We want you to be healthy. I know from experience that being healthy is so so worth being larger. I would rather have a high BMI and be able to live my life and eat without worrying than be at a “healthy” BMI and be absolutely miserable. ,False,False

My weight has fluctuated a ton and I’ve seen all sides. My BMI went from 18 (healthy) to 15 (during eating disorder) to 31  (healthy but “overweight”) and then dropped back down to 22 from a relapse. It’s really hard to navigate. ,False,False

I know it probably doesn't mean much but people care, I don't want your ED telling you otherwise (although believe me i know how easy it is to just believe that)",False,False

I’ve overshot every single time I’ve tried to recover, even when eating what should have been a deficit still, let alone a “recovery” amount of calories. It’s awful and terrifying and I just feel that fear so hard. You’re not alone. ",False,False
