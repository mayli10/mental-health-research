I was told the same thing. Honestly my therapist was pretty right, my binges have definitely reduced (but it took a while for that to happen tbh), but I still do binge for reasons unrelated to restriction. We‚Äôre trying to get to the bottom of the residual hinges at the moment. Honestly if you can, keep trying to restrict as little as you can. I know it‚Äôs super hard, I‚Äôve put on about 17 kg from my all-time low weight and about 10 kg from starting therapy, but now with my binges finally getting down to manageable rates I‚Äôve verrrrrry slowly been losing some weight. I can honestly say that even though it sometimes doesn‚Äôt feel like it, and that I almost constantly feel like shit about my body, the reduction in binges has been worth all of it. ",False,False

I had mia for years, I fought *SO* hard to overcome purging. Hoping that it would fix it. No, I would still binge. Now I'm either end.

I stopped restricting and gained 20/30lbs. My very first time struggling with binging as a child I never dieted or anything restrictive. Most times when I struggle with binge eating, it isn‚Äôt from restriction but it‚Äôll trigger restriction due to feeling invalidated and being fearful of blowing up :/   I‚Äôve come to find that being mindful of my urges, cravings, etc., was the most helpful to avoid/decrease binges :) ",False,False

In my experience it takes a few weeks to months of not restricting and eating a nutritious diet before the urges to binge go away completely, though they do decrease dramatically in the process.

Also, once you are in therapy you will be able to identify your triggers and how to avoid them/deal with them. ",False,False
