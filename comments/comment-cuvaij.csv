I went through a ""I must conserve all my energy for restriction"" phase and felt like absolute shit, and also messed my back up from sitting too much! I have a standing desk now which I love because I can fidget while I work/not-work.   I try to be vigilant with not letting other basic self-care fall through the cracks. Shower every day, wash my face, brush my teeth, trim my nails, and do things that make me feel prettier when I'm down like wearing jewelry and mascara.   I also carry hard sugar candy (usually jolly ranchers because I don't find them very tempting) in case I get really shaky and need the boost immediately, and then I'll eat something that'll give me energy for longer. I try to really make my meals count, nutritionally. I drink a ton of water.  And I try to do something I really care about every day like write or be with friends, and limit the amount of time I spend on reddit, looking at thinspo, watching Secret Eaters, etc. Whether or not it's healthy in the long term, I kind of compartmentalize my ED behavior and try to maintain an identity outside of it.",False,False

Vitamin A sometimes (if I'm not eating baby carrots). I'm not sure how effective Vitamin B complex supplements are since they're water soluble, but I take them anyway. Everyone recommends Biotin for hair and nails!  Also, mixing caffeine and supplements reduces their absorption. Cauliflower is a great source of calcium and Vit C. Or maybe you could squeeze a large lemon into 1 or 2L of water and add mint and ginger and stuff for Vit C + it's refreshing?  Good luck with walking more! Maybe you could start with fun dance workouts from YouTube, just to start moving and feel better? Even 3-5 minutes a day is a start.  I definitely get the sleeping too much thing - I graduated college last year, I'm unemployed and really have nothing (or no one) to do ðŸ˜‚   If I had the option I'd get a job as a dog walker for a bunch of dogs around the neighborhood (yay fluffy furry babies + activity) but any sort of responsibility makes me panic ðŸ˜‚",False,False

Are there any supplements you would reccomend? I do want to start taking more walks even if it's just around the block, I notice I get a lot more tired if I just go through the motions. I tend to sleep too much imo so just any sort of activity would definitely help. Large Tee and undies is my aesthetic!",False,True

And getting some after sunrise/near sunset light is nice. I try to eat some veggies or fruit if they're under my limit or instead of not so healthy but low cal meals.   I know naps are inevitable during super restrictive periods but after some naps I wake up so tired and breathless, having a schedule helps (like waking up before noon, a late afternoon nap and then sleeping at night as opposed to drifting in and out of sleep, just lying in bed and on your phone).  And for mental health- getting *something* atleast 1 thing done helps? Something for school, or laundry, or even brushing your teeth like you said. Watching comforting films (Harry Potter, Home Alone, Studio Ghibli etc.,) and old sitcoms (unless the actresses are triggering ðŸ˜­)  and/or doing something creative helps too. And large tee+underwear dance parties are so uplifting!",False,False
