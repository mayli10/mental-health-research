If not, I would suggest he holds off on it until your pup is a little older. Raising two puppies in the same household is something that should be undertaken by only experienced dog owners. It’s highly likely the pups will bond to each other much more closely than any person. This sets you up for training difficulties and severe separation anxiety between the two dogs. If your brother already got the dog, and you can’t convince him to return it, get in touch with a trainer ASAP, ask if they have any experience dealing with littermate syndrome and that you want to prevent it in your household.   Sorry if this sounds harsh, but I’ve seen this scenario play out with multiple friends of mine. Friend is depressed —&gt; gets a dog —&gt; can’t properly take care of dog because of mental health issues so dog is under-exercised and untrained —&gt; stress from dog being poorly behaved and guilt from not providing proper care makes mental health worse —&gt; care of dog is worse and it becomes a feedback loop of misery for both friend and dog.  I was able to convince one of my friends to give her dog over to me. The dog ended up much happier and my friend was able to get another dog that was more suited for her lifestyle when she was in a much better mental space so she’s happier now too. My other friends still have large, poorly trained dogs that they can’t take anywhere bc of bad behavior, they can’t go on walks bc they’re malnourished and weak as fuck, and they’re stuck at home all the time bc they don’t want to leave the dog alone bc they already feel enough guilt as it is. They love their dogs yes, but they’ll readily admit that their lives would be 1000x easier if they got the dogs when they were mentally sound and healthy. You have two choices right now: admit the dog is too much to handle for you right now and rehome it, or commit to the dog and take better care of yourself so you can actually be responsible for it.   If you’re committed to having a dog right now, it’s time to kick your own ass and take care of yourself. Training a dog is actually a great way of mitigating anxiety. I love training my dog, because during, I have to put aside all my worries and concern in order to convince my dog that I am a zen master who knows all. It is a great way to practice mindfulness because a dog is so attuned to your emotional state, that they will feed off your frustration, so you have to practice stepping away, taking a few deep breaths, and coming back to it when you’re more calm and patient. Training requires mental focus, patience, and the ability to let go of perfectionism. These are all skills also essential in recovery. If you do it right, the relationship you develop with your dog in training can set you up for developing a healthier relationship with food and eating.   Look into crate training to help with housebreaking. Teaching a dog to be comfortable being contained will also allow you to put the puppy in an xpen or crate, while you have an hour or two to yourself without worrying about puppy getting into trouble. This also sets you up for avoiding separation anxiety. A lot of people make the mistake of being around their dog 24/7 and meeting their every desire all the time. You need time alone, and your puppy needs time alone to learn how to entertain himself and self-soothe. Otherwise you will end up with a needy, pushy, demanding pup who won’t ever let you have time to yourself. This is very hard for people who rely on their dogs for emotional support, and they actually see their dogs desire to constantly be around them as a good thing. Don’t fall into this trap. An emotionally mature dog should be okay with being alone for a bit, not falling into pieces if you leave their sight for a moment. This is not loyalty or love, it’s extreme dependence and very unhealthy. Don’t feel guilty for needing a break from the dog, it’s essential for your mental wellbeing and his.   And it’s time to let go of guilt in general. Dogs don’t have a concept of guilt. Their needs are being met or they’re not. How sorry you feel about the situation does nothing to improve your situation or the dog’s. It’s time to be more compassionate to yourself.",False,False

Mom got a puppy, since I’m an unemployed piece of shit, I’m stuck taking care of him/training him, everything. And I have the same exact thoughts, especially about how I’m the worst owner and he deserves someone better. Plus kinda hating my mom for doing this to me, cause I did not sign up for this. But it’s what happens when you move back home during a divorce. Sigh. I’m sorry. I feel your pain. It does get better once he’s trained though, I promise, it’s not nearly as bad as it was the first 2-3 months.",False,False
