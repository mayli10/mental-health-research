The question is, what is metabolically and mentally healthy (the two are tied together).  &amp;#x200B;  If you exist in a state of constantly feeling physically deprived of food to the point where you show all the classical signs of a restrictive eating disorder, such as, feeling the overwhelming need to control your body weight, intentionally ignoring physical hunger, food obsession, scale obsession, AND you show physical symptoms of metabolic adaptation, low T3, low body temperature, amenorrhea, constipation, persistent fatigue or lack of energy, dry skin, hair/skin problems, abnormal sensitivity to cold temperatures, etc... you may be maintaining your weight, but there is no way that you are at an optimal weight, body composition, and calorie intake, there is no way you are performing optimally athletically, and it is unlikely that you are in a sustainable state physically or mentally.  &amp;#x200B;  Weight maintenance itself is not evidence that you are at an appropriate intake level and objectively physically healthy. Health is more than a number on a scale and a routine blood test showing your cholesterol and HbA1c are normal. Two women in my life, same height, roughly the same intake, different genetics, very different builds, very different overall activity levels. One is the classical ""ectomorph"" (yes, I know somatotypes are BS) who leads an inactive lifestyle and has a naturally low appetite, also has a low TDEE and a normal relationship with food. The other exercises regularly and ""has to intermittent fast and save calories for the evening because I can't sleep when I'm hungry"", has chronically low body temp, and is constantly focused on food and gets visibly angry when mealtimes are delayed for any reason. This person also has a history of chronic dieting and unsurprisingly carries much more body fat than the other person. Diet history has a huge impact on your TDEE. Reverse dieting and adding body fat to your body does wonders, as anyone who has recovered from an eating disorder can attest. Metabolic adaptation is an extremely powerful force that turns calorie math on its head. Read this study which shows that mitigating metabolic adaptation is actually more important than energy restriction alone for weight loss, if you don't believe me: [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28925405](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28925405)  &amp;#x200B;  I think most of the delusional people on /r/1200isplenty and other subs confound the fact that we live in an obesogenic environment with a strict need to implement unnecessary diet strategies, none of which are inherently disordered in and of themselves, like fasting, intermittent fasting, ketosis, low carb, veganism (for dietary rather than ethical reasons), etc. There is no silver bullet for weight maintenance. Successful weight maintainers with a healthy body composition do share some qualities, but none of them have anything to do with diet structure or composition. They monitor themselves, they moderate themselves, they exercise, and they use a diet system that is habitual. Willpower is a finite resource that is not part of the equation. Lots of subreddits around here celebrate the intentional use of willpower to manipulate body composition, and when this isn't done with a specific goal in mind (ie, I want to prep for a bodybuilding show, or, I want to lose excessive body fat to improve my health), it often leads to a disordered relationship with food.",False,False
