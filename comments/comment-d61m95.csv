It’s funny how the idea of getting rid of everything is so appealing until you realize you might run the risk of purging your lax. Lol. 22oz prune juice, 30ml milk of magnesia, and 3 dulcolax like every night. I don’t know how it stayed in.  Anywho, be safe friend :)",False,False

I was taking three to four pills a day for around a year and would experience bouts of intense nausea whenever I took more than two at once.  I never actually threw up (was too afraid to waste the pills lol) but it was really hard to resist that feeling.  I don’t take laxatives anymore but get a similar, genuinely nauseated reaction whenever I eat too much seaweed. Go figure.",False,False
