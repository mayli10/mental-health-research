ESPECIALLY if itâ€™s on uber eats because those restaurants can close / open the Uber eats service whenever they want basically. Iâ€™ve waited for my fave place to open, when they did I quickly started ordering, then they made it â€˜unavailableâ€™ again before I could order ðŸ˜­  For some reason, if a specific binge goes wrong or that ONE item is unavailable I just go CRAZY like crying crazy. It ruins my night. ",False,False

I thought they were open everyday.   idk about pizza hut but I work at a different chain pizza place and we close earlier on sundays. so op saying ""just wait until 9"" could've screwed them if the store *closed* at 9",False,False

I thought they were open everyday. But maybe that's just a locational thing.   In terms of alcohol, I may not know you, fellow internet stranger with an eating disorder, but I'm proud of you for even *trying* with sobriety. Hey, it's a step in the right direction, right? Things like this don't happen overnight. Trial and tribulations, success and failure orbiting around each other, fucking up every now and then only to accept that shit happens, it do *indeed* be like that, and try again- this is how it goes. It's a process. But tomorrow is not today. And today does not have to mirror tomorrow. And if it doesn't work out and you end up back in the spot tomorrow that you were today? Well, there's still another day after that. We're not dead yet. You've got the time to try and you deserve the reassurance of patience. You deserve to look forward to a potentionally better, slightly less shitty day because *you deserve good things, too.* Basically, you got this!  I really hope that didn't come off as preachy, though, haha. Sorry if it did!",False,False
