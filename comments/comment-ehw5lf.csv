I encourage you to find people who will believe you and support you through this time, no matter your weight.  I encourage you to find people who do not even judge you on your weight.   They’ll treat you better temporarily, maybe. Mostly because they get worried.  I wasn’t treated better, just with sympathy days before death. During my rapid weight loss, everyone stopped talking to me, I had no one. People made assumptions, judged, and didn’t care.   I pulled myself out of it, alone, no support, and began having friends again, and really worked hard. I still have my lapses, but I’m glad I can function now.",False,False

I am 22.   I want to tell you something that helped me:  You are probably seeing people in school mostly, yeah?  Just teens.  I encourage you to go outside and take a walk down a busier street, or walk into a coffee shop or store, and look around.  Is everyone skinny? No.  Could they have an eating disorder? Yes.  Could they be just normal people? Absolutely.  Are they just trying to set goals, prioritise, and make the best of their lives as time continually moves forward? Most, probably.   People younger than 14 probably haven’t fully hit puberty yet, so of course some of them will be sticks.  It is not normal for most females to be sticks.   Look at old Renaissance paintings - I tell this to my girlfriend when she’s down - that she looks just like one of them - and those paintings were women of utmost beauty to the eye.  No heroine thin frame to be found.   Take some deep breathes and look at the bigger picture for a moment.  I know how hard recovery can be, as I’ve had my bouts of anorexia and currently trying to recover.   Hope this helps.",False,False
