I was 20 when I finally, for the first time, felt real desire to have sex &amp; also was at healthy and my biggest weight. But even then it was still sporadical &amp; couldn't compared myself to peers cause I have no desire to meet someone for sex, I don't even have desire to be in relationship 'cause it involves sex and it just doesn't seem worth stressing over STDs &amp; pregnancy. It's very perplexing to me that 99% of people are more than willing to risk their health, happiness, hormone balance over sex. Also when you're sexually active woman you must have gyno on dial-up so to speak... I visited so many doctors since childhood, there's was always some health issue with me... And frankly can't stand them anymore. Everytime I go for my regular doctor checkup I hate myself, feels like I'm wasting life &amp; something is wrong with me... last time I went she said we see each other in month... Yeah, fuck that. I cannot imagine being obliged to see someone who puts your fingers in hooha.  It shouldn't fuck you up... idk why you say that, I consider myself very lucky. Silver lining in my fucked up life lol.",False,False

I had poor diet during childhood (very picky eater), then ED started around 12, but I recovered year later, got my period, got bums-boobs-hips-etc, so I guess I went thru puberty? But then I got sick again at 16... Recovered at 19... (then at 21 again, now year later I'm slowly recovering again... jeez, what a ride...)
