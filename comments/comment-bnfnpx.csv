Anyway, I used to purge with my toothbrush to the point where I involuntarily gagged when I brushed my teeth (not by gagging myself, but just my body would reflexively gag) and it sounds silly, but what helped me was getting one of those little fingertip toothbrushes (yes, like the ones you use on babies or pets). I guess I associated toothbrush = purge so using the fingertip toothbrush helped me a little in overcoming that particular trigger. If toothpaste is a bigger problem, you could try kid’s toothpaste. It’s not as thick and comes in different flavors so maybe your brain won’t panic and make you want to gag",False,False

There is medicine for it, and it's extremely important to treat because you risk ulcers and esophageal cancer otherwise. I think a therapist is the best person to help with the toothbrush problem because it sounds like its driven by anxiety.",False,False
