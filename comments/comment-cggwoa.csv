Sometimes you get better and sometimes you get a little worse. I kinda wish being better lasted a little longer, but I've had enough problems I had to deal with to know that I'm not going to be down forever. It's going to be the same for you too. You're just at a low point right now, but eventually you'll get better again. I think maybe that sometimes recovery just gets too exhausting, even when you get to that point where you don't notice all the little things you do to stay healthy anymore. I feel that sometimes you just need a break from doing all the stuff that's good for you to just relax and let things happen as they may. Eventually it begins to feel more difficult to ignore your problems than to deal with them and that's when things start to get better again.",False,False

I got back up to a healthy weight despite all the trouble I had in even gaining weight duenti my health, but there was always still that little voice in the back of my head telling me that 118 was too much and even when I tried my best to maintain even a minimum healthy weight I would still end up losing and feeling good about it. Now I'm back to worrying I've over-eaten if I twice in the same day. This morning I had about 300 calories at breakfast and I couldn't stop thinking about having maybe as much 400 calories for lunch. That's nowhere even close to my BMR and much further from what I'm supposed to eat in a day. It's not even half of what I'm supposed to eat and I feel so gross about just having that. I'm pretty sure this is the start of a relapse. I just sort of don't care if I lose weight at this point.",False,False
