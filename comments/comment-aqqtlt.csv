Luckily this is the first time this has happened to such a degree. I’m hoping that once I calm down enough to talk to him about we’re able to get our feelings out and what we can do differently in the future to make both of us happy. Fingers crossed. ,False,True

Last weekend he was super super affectionate and we connected well. My libido suffers from my moods and medications, and it’s been rough lately.

I am so sorry this happened to you. I can't imagine how lonely and defeated you must have felt lying next to him. Is this a common pattern? Have you ever checked out r/deadbedrooms?  I have a pretty high libido, but if my partner told me I was doing it ""wrong"" and then refused my affection, I would never touch him again. How could I? Your partner is supposed to be your most intimate friend aside from lover. What kind of person would treat their loved one that way? ",False,False

We ended up having a big emotional chat about it after one particularly self esteem punching exchange. It came out that he was having self esteem issues too and that he was getting more and more nervous about his sexual performance the more I made silly extreme efforts to try and be sexy and entice a spontaneous sexy reaction from him. So he would make excuses which I would  read entirely as issues with me being hideous and he wasn't  aware how crappy it made me feel. And I was putting him in all sorts of scenarios he felt massively pressured in. He said he would feel emasculated if sex didn't go well (e.g. a few times before this blew up there were occasion's where he couldn't keep it up or finished so fast that I didn't finish etc ... Which of course I had interpreted as him not caring about me or not finding me attractive! He would then turn over and ""go to sleep"" because he was embarrassed but I had just thought he didn't care!) so he would prefer to avoid sex if it seemed like I was expecting exciting things to happen.   After this big chat we then worked together to help each other with our issues and do what works for both of us in the build up to sex and we are doing amazingly now.   I don't know if this could be similar to your scenario or not, but a really honest chat and trying to see things from his side may help you realise that this isn't your fault?? Your comment was heartbreaking to read and I'm very sorry you are going through this. I really hope things improve for you.  ",False,False

He's obviously not interested, if I were you I'd tell him to straighten the fuck up or hit the road. I remember having boyfriends who were like that and feeling so desperate and worthless and just horrible about myself... I thought I must be hideous and if I was just prettier, or thinner, or tried harder, I'd make them want me as if I was the attractive, desirable, intelligent, female I wanted to be. Well, staying with them was just feeding my need for self pity and played well with my victim syndrome. I don't know when or how, but when I started thinking of myself of someone who deserved to be *worshiped* my life changed dramatically. I didn't jump at the first guy who paid any attention to me the way I used to, and I wound up with some great experiences... albeit running at the sight of the first red flag. Idk, just a little insight from someone who can relate to this way too much. Literally made me angry when I started reading your comments and began to remember how I felt when I was treated exactly the same way for ages.",False,False

I tried again before bed and was told that I was doing it wrong. I got in bed and held him really close and went to kiss him and he pulled away and he just started piling on everything I should have done. Like that I shouldn’t have been in bed and should have already had my clothes off when he came into the room. I apologized and said that I thought it would be nice if he undressed me. It didn’t go anywhere. He wouldn’t touch me. I ended up taking it off myself and getting back into bed and he sarcastically thanked me for the “wonderful” Valentine’s Day.   Currently in bed sobbing while he snores like a baby. I feel so ugly and defeated. ,False,True
