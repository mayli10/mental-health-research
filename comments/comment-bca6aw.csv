A friend told me that another friend of ours saw me and told him I look very skinny. I had to get uniforms for a new job and the guy there kept saying how small I was. Before I would look in the mirror and still see myself as fat but now i‚Äôm starting to catch glimpses of what i might really look like. I‚Äôm gaunt, there‚Äôs dark circles under my eyes. My hair is thin. i‚Äôm starting to see my individual ribs when I raise my arms, my hipbones are more prominent. My legs are thinner.   I can‚Äôt always see it. sometimes I still look fat but sometimes if I see my reflection unexpectedly in a shop window or from a different angle i‚Äôm a little shocked. I‚Äôm not even underweight yet.   started a new job that‚Äôs just part time 4 hours a day and is low stress. It feels manageable. because it‚Äôs only 4 hours I don‚Äôt have to eat lunch there and get asked about food like my last full time job. We‚Äôre allowed to have tea or coffee at the desk and it‚Äôs not stressful and everyone is nice. I just hope i don‚Äôt fuck it up.   I should probably update my flair now i‚Äôm diagnosed but idk what option to put. They told me it‚Äôs atypical anorexia nervosa but I feel like a fraud if I put AN in my flair because it‚Äôs not the exact same thing but also idk if EDNOS is what I should put??",False,False

To be honest, considering how much harm I have been doing to my body for the past 3.5 weeks because of my ED, I was fucking terrified. I did not want to go to the hospital though because I did not want my psychiatrist or plastic surgeon to find out about my behaviors.  So I finally decided to eat a very substantial amount last night and keep it in me..which helped me feel a little better..but me being me, that led to a binge. Of course, with such severe symptoms, I didn't purge.  But now that I've woken up, I'm experiencing horrible nausea due to the binge, and I'm STILL experiencing pins and needles on my left side and slight chest pain (though nothing as bad as last night).  I don't know what to do. I don't want to go to the doctor and confess everything just for them to not be able to do anything for me and have all my behaviors written down on my record, and have my Vyvanse prescription and plastic surgery taken away.  I thought I was invincible because I'm too fat to be clinically underweight yet. My ED led me to believe I was invincible because the high from the food deprivation felt amazing and I was starting to finally be on the road to skinny. This was just a total reality check to find out I was indeed not invincible.   Guys..just please don't combine Vyvanse and phentermine and bingeing/purging/flushing and restricting to ~350 Calories a day...it just isn't worth it. Especially not when it causes you to have insomnia and sleep just ~5 hours every night.  I always read all these horror stories online about ED people ending up in the hospital because of some kind of electrolyte balance or even worse things, and I just thought something like that could never happen to me. Just a month ago I felt completely normal...I guess this is this first time I've *really* deviated from the BED side of the spectrum, but you just never think bad things like that will happen to you until your ED consumes you and they do.  And as I type this, all my ED is saying to me is, ""You're just making excuses for yourself so that you can eat food you don't deserve, you gluttonous whale."" I'm trying to write off all of my symptoms as just being all in my head, but they're kind of too severe to really ignore. I HAVE been writing off the chest pangs for weeks..but I don't think I can write off the fact that walking to the other side of my house just now just left me winded and with my heart racing..guys..it was a 10 second walk, if even that.",False,False
