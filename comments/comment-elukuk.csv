I blame myself for how my ED makes me suffer every day.   Then I come back again to the realization that wanting to be sick is a sign of sickness itself. That making myself sicker and enjoying it is a sign that I am ill, and that I have been for a while, for even longer than before the actual behaviors I engage in began.   Being ill isn’t a moral failing. It’s not a failure of willpower to keep yourself healthy. We don’t tell patients in treatment for cancer that “if they’d only had a more positive mindset, they wouldn’t have gotten sick”. ED’s are considered an illness because they *are* one, and it’s not your fault that you got sick. It can happen to anyone, and it’s so hard to fight when your illness fights back - but it’s worth it.   Be kind to yourself, as much as you can. You are worthy of kindness. &lt;3",False,False
