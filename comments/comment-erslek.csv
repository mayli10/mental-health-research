It can get really addictive and you are putting your health at risk also laxatives and such don´t really lead to weighloss * try not to restrict too heavy the next few days, if you really want to loose some weight lower your calorie intake a little for a few days and do a quick workout daily and you should be fine going to extremes to loose the weight will just make it more likely for you to binge in the future  I promise you everything will be alright, one binge won´t make you fat  Take care of yourself",False,False
