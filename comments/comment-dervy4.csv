Everyone in those subs swear that there's no way any of them could have disordered eating, and a lot of us here swear there's no way they couldn't.  I think some of them may be on the path to an ED (looking at the people who feel guilty as hell for breaking a fast one hour early, or are repulsed by food) but not all of them",False,False

She’s had an eating disorder since I was a young teen.  Not diagnosed, not acknowledged, but utterly obvious to me, particularly in hindsight.  These days, she, along with my dad, eats an extremely restrictive diet, fasts for multiple days at a time, never shuts up about AuToPhAgY, and does genuinely believe fasting and restricting the way she does is healthy, AND is still hyper-focused on her weight and on getting smaller.  I agree with you that not everyone who fasts and etc are in denial of an ED, but I think many of them probably are, and, like my mom, at the same time, they believe they are doing something healthy.",False,False

It doesn't mean you're going to get worse or make yourself sick or be diagnosed, but it's not normal.  Fasting and OMAD inherently require you to be obsessive, especially at first. There wouldn't be whole subreddits dedicated to theorycrafting these diets if they were normal.  Very feel people are ""normal"" though when it comes to food and eating, so it's whatever.  Fasting in the wlid because you didn't catch any food that day is natural.  Fasting while living in a world where food is constantly being thrown at you requires a slightly demented headspace :)",False,False

On one hand, i would starve myself until 1 or 2 pm. And then would feel guilty about literally anything I put in my mouth.

I think it's a way to resolve the cognitive dissonance involved in trying to lose weight but also insisting that you're not doing it for superficial reasons.  That being said, I don't think it is inherently disordered to fast to lose weight. All weight loss comes from a caloric deficit, and no one calls it disordered when someone changes their diet to include more vegetables and less candy bars. The whole ""three meals a day"" thing as the ONLY healthy option is imo a very American idea and honestly part of a cultural obsession with food that got things this bad to begin with, so using that as a reason why fasters are disordered is a little too black and white thinking for me I guess.  ALTHOUGH the way that subreddit is going is really bad tbh. They're always going on about how fasting is a tool and while I agree to some extent, I think the MAJORITY of them are ""misusing"" it. It's not normal to feel like crap about yourself after breaking a three day fast with a single egg, and the fact that those kind of posts get so many upvotes is a really obvious indicator that something is wrong. I think fasting isn't inherently unhealthy, but come on.",False,False

There are several key differences IMO.  When I do OMAD (2 or 3 hour eating window) it's planned in advance. It's nutrient dense with lots of vegetables. I end up full every day without guilt or feeling like shit after eating. I'm not obsessed with food all day but still look forward to it. And my personal favorite: I don't have to count calories and still maintain a stable weight.,False,False

But these people doing it for years just... it's sus is all I'm sayin  IF seems fine when done reasonably (i.e. 16:8 or fasting once a week) but then that weird one (I think it's alternate day fasting?) where you eat like 500 cals a day 2 days of the week or some shit, that seems disordered to me.",False,False

Restricting and fasting aren't automatically disordered behaviors. People count calories or fast for a number of reasons.
