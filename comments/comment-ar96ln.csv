I try to use stevia when I have it (maybe not the best sweetener, but completely plant based and better than splenda (linked to cancer in rats) or diet mountain dew (was my demon for a while, has some of the same ingredients found in flame retardant lol).

My mom has been drinking diet coke since age 10; she's sixty now and has suffered no ill health, same with my dad and my 30 year old brother.  But it's also good for your teeth and bloating to cut out soda, anyway, so whatever you end up doing there's no judgment here. ",False,False
