I don't think I'll ever be totally free, but I've maintained a healthy weight for over a decade. It got better for me. I suspect it can get better for you. I just wanted to tell you that in hopes that it makes you feel less hopeless. ",False,False

There are ways to say it and maintain your freedom.   Your therapist will ground you if you say you're going to kill yourself. Do not mention any sort of suicide planning or intent to actually go through with it.   You can get away with expressing a desire to not want to deal with life anymore. You can get away with stuff like ""there's no reason to live,"" ""I hate my life,"" or ""I just don't see the point of struggling."" I've even gotten away with ""I'd kill myself but honestly I can't afford a failed attempt. I can't just drop out of my life for 3 days."" ",False,False

That's super realistic insight and I really appreciate it. I'm very hesitant to reach out to my therapist because she has the power to take so much freedom from me. But really thanks for the advice.

Your eating disorder was serving a purpose. It was probably suppressing your depression and suicidality. Without it numbing you out all the mental health/trauma/issues are going to be at the forefront of your mind. Please please reach out to your therapist, doctor, or call a crisis line. There are people who care about you. There will be joy to experience again. These feelings of hopelessness do NOT last forever. Here if you need to talk.",False,False

It sounds like treatment didn't do a good job of helping you prepare for handing emotions, or overshot your goal weight maybe.
