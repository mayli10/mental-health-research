EDs can cause gastroparesis. About 25% of cases of gastroparesis are caused by this. You might be able to kick it out of not digesting by going liquids/soft foods. I was told by the top doctor for the disease in the country that when it comes to your stomach; if you donâ€™t use it, it wonâ€™t work. Look at the gastroparesis diets, start on the soft or liquid stages and work back up to normal foods. I promise you donâ€™t want it to progress to the vomiting on yourself/feeding tube stages if youâ€™ve slowed down your digestion. Be nice to your tummy for awhile.",False,False

Try bulk forming laxatives or stool softeners- yes they're laxatives, but not the kind that usually come to mind when you think of laxatives. Basically it's not an overnight fix, but it will help ~move things along~ without hours of diarrhea. You've gotta drink LOTS of water with them to help... uh, smooth your stool? If you're not drinking enough, it can make your bloating worse.   Once I didn't poop for like 3 weeks, stool softeners definitely helped.   If you want something more natural, fiber is a bulk forming laxative. Psyllium husk fiber is good. Or you can try eating a ton of watermelon, that can get things moving sometimes ðŸ˜‚  ",False,False
