It didn't work and I am so embarrassed that I would do something so dumb, but I did it because I thought I could help him by being a mirror. So I get it.   Maybe you could tell him how it makes you feel? I don't think it's good to encourage him to do that though (by eating to keep him from starving), it kind of breaks down the relationship...It did for me anyways. He needs to know that it's not up to him to save you. He can support your process, and listen, but he can't fix it.",False,False
