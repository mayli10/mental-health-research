My brain was fucked up somewhere in childhood and probably prenatal development and that's not my fault. Just the same way a diabetic 1 can't help that one day their islet cells just stopped fucking producing proper insulin. So I have to be a lot more careful in what I do with my brain (self care vs self destruction) what I give my brain to consume (empowering media vs hurtful media) and the things to help balance it (self medication vs doctor medication). Cause you wouldn't tell a diabetic not to take insulin, you wouldn't tell a diabetic not to get exercise and lower their blood sugar spikes, you wouldn't tell a diabetic to ignore doctor advise and make their own insulin without any proper pharmacological training.   We're chronically ill. Do I hate it? Yes. But will that make it manageable? Apparently not so I've learned. I too thought once I do enough therapy and blah I'll be cured. And then it came back. Maybe not as forcefully as before but it came back. And if I don't manage it. It will consume my life.   I too want to be normal. But life deprived me of those cards so I guess we'll just have to keep going ‚ù§ ",False,False
