Personally, I think measurement errors are much more likely than anything else. There was just a post about how food labeling can be off by 20%!!! And I imagine I'm talking to food measuring pros, but we all know how easy it is for something to slide in. Like the person who posted about learning that tzaziki has mega calories.  I'd look there first. I guess it gets you to the same point either way, though, doesn't it?",False,False

I suspect you’ll find that you have ketones in your urine from restricting and doing cardio. That combination can make you lose muscle. Losing muscle lowers your BMR/metabolism.   That being said, maintenance could be about bloating or constipation or god knows what else.",False,False
