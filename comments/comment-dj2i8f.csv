Like, I have BPD and there's no way to cure that, but through a lot of hard work I made it so that I don't even have to think about it anymore. I'm all better. Still, when I go through a particularly stressful period in my life I do have to make an effort to not lose control because my symptoms start to return. I see my own eating disorder the same way personally. I worked really hard to get better, stopped thinking about it all the time, but then stuff happened that made me start thinking about it again and it became a huge problem. I think the biggest issue was a healthcare provider saying that he wouldn't run the test my GP sent me to him for because I weighed like 10lbs more than his arbitrary standard for concern. I was still trying to slow down my weight loss from my health problems at that point, but then I lost all motivation to do so. I had already started associating eating less with feeling better so then being denied treatment for my health made a connection to weighing less would lead to becoming healthier. It seems that somehow I have stopped losing weight despite my eating habits and increased activity from school starting again which is weird, but that makes me want to restrict even more so that maybe I can reach a weight where he'll be worried about me. I even tried purging for the first time the other night because I was feeling sick and couldn't sleep because of it and all I could think about was that throwing would make me feel better. I feel that I was fully recovered, but then I relapsed anyway. So like if true recovery were possible than reasonably your brain would no longer be susceptible to ED thought patterns. That's why I think you can only say people with eating disorders go into remission. You can be totally better and it can last for the rest of your life, but under the right circumstances it can become a problem again.",False,False
