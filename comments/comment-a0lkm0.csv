My go-to's are:  Starkist Tuna Creations. 70 cals per pouch. I'm obsessed with the buffalo flavor, but the ranch is also good. I just really love seafood. I also do shrimp or crab.

But only this specific brand from Whole Foods that I can't recall but it's 90 cals a serving and 180 for the whole pack.   Turkey lunch meat.

It's, like, genuinely really delicious and only 80 cals a cup.   Uhhh, what else? Sugar-free jello is a lifesaver. As is whipped cream for a quick sweet fix. And the Swiss Miss diet hot cocoas.   As far as sauces, I love mustard. I put it on chicken and turkey. And liquid aminos from Braggs. They're 0 cals and taste like soy sauce so I use that for stir-fry.
