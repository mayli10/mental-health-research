If I ever feel like stuffing my face I try to eat that instead of planning a binge and 10/10 times it saves me xD    Ahh yeah I hate that &gt;.&lt; so hard to log stuff from restaurants, I wish everything everywhere had to have the calories listed on the menu =(",False,False

Those are so good too haha  Actually I really doubt the bibimbap was actually that much, I only had half a bowl of rice in it, it was just the online generic info making me super paranoid about it. So it wasnt even nutritional info from the restaurant, it was one of this ""bibimbap"" logs on livestrong or fitbit websites. All the vegetables were fresh and dressing free, the only thing that was kinda higher calorie was a pretty small portion of meat, and the half a bowl of rice, I just hate how my ed logic works sometimes",False,True

Still has rice but itâ€™s way easier to just have a small amount per wrap. And can have just a little fillings (little rice, pork or tofu if youâ€™re vegan, onion, and samjjang) Iâ€™m each leaf, but like a ton of them lol. Could also try with riced cauliflower instead but I havenâ€™t done that yet. Itâ€™s become a huge binge-saver for me cause when I feel like stuffing my face, I just do lettuce wraps instead and it feels like a ton of food but turns out decent calories-wise",False,False
