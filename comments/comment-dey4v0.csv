But it sucks that mental health treatment is still at a point where you have to be “sick enough” to get treatment, instead of getting people the help they need before it gets worse. The first time I tried to get treatment, they told me I was too healthy, which of course I heard as “challenge accepted!”. I hope you are able to find the support you need.",False,False
