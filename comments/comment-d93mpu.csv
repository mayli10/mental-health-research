But if you need one, you should really try to power through and get used to wearing one. It sucks at first, it genuinely does. But my nighttime teeth clenching exposed the dentin on my molars, and they got so sensitive I could barely eat (and trust me, ED or not, you actually seriously do not want to be in a situation where you scream when you try to chew).   The situation has improved now that I use a nightguard, and the enamel has largely remineralized. But I still can only eat grapes, raisins, chocolate, and cold desserts with the utmost care, bc two of my molars still really hurt in certain places. It's been such a nightmare, and I tell people about this whenever I can bc I want to save them from the same fate!",False,False

My dentist scared me into getting one, and I was kind of skeptical / hesitant to spend the money, but now the [thick hard plastic] night guard is worn thin with suuuper deep grooves where I’ve bitten down in my sleep, so I’m a believer",False,False
