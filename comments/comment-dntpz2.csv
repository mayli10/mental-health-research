I think you have a point that she still views my weight as relative to her own weight, so like, when she's shopping or whatever and she tries on something that is \[X\] percent bigger than her she assumes it'll fit me... Thank you for the perspective! (Still wish she wouldn't SAY it though lol.)",False,True

I feel like I can't be mad because I'm getting free stuff, but idk. Even before I spiralled into more restrictive eating I still would've been careful about saying shit like ""this is too big for me so you should have it!"" because you never know what people are going through??",False,True

Like the clothes I get from my friend are usually because she shops online, so she could just say that it didn't look the way she thought it would and she doesn't want it. And my sister thrifts a lot and so I get stuff she just literally doesn't wear.  They also just... don't have to say anything. None of us like to waste stuff so it's no wonder we'd  hand stuff around. I guess I'm just tired of the CONSTANT reminder.",False,True

I‚Äôm sorry this happens tho but I can kinda relate cause something similar happened the other day where I was trying some pants on.. they didn‚Äôt fit so that‚Äôs what I told my mom and she laughed and said: But they were from your sister and she‚Äôs always been bigger than you!!   I‚Äôm sure it wasn‚Äôt malicious on her part but like . That kinda hurt lol,False,False

This was a huge trigger for me this relapse. My sister has lost a lot of weight, YAY HER seriously i'm so happy for her, but she literally went through her clothes and when i travelled from another state to visit her she told me she had some clothes that were too big for her that she wanted me to go through to see if i wanted any. Also during this trip my dad made a joke about my weight. And i just. Couldn't get any more triggered. People could just say HEY THESE DON'T FIT ME ANYMORE DO YOU WANNA GO THROUGH THEM? like how hard is it to just change your language?",False,False

So it's not that you look fatter than you actually are (I mean, the clothes she gave you were also too big for you) but that at this point she's seeing herself as smaller than she is...",False,False

Once, a friend accidentally implied that i am far from skinny..  i said something like ‚Äúand I don‚Äôt have as skinny hips as them‚Äù talking about tall skinny lanky boys, and she goes ‚Äúno DEFINITELY  not hahah‚Äù I was like üôÉ kill me  I know it wasnt intentional and it‚Äôs probably my own insecurities playing out but I haaate being the bigger friend.
