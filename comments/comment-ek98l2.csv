I don't think they know my relationship with food is this piss poor but due to it, I'm always anxious and irritable, almost nothing sparks joy anymore, and my personality has boiled down to exercise and food.  I don't even want to hang around me but I think saying that proves that the fear is my own projection",False,False

I think not precisely because they were sick of me or my illness....more because it’s really painful to watch someone you care about destroying themselves and you‘re there caring about them more than they seem to care about themselves.    But some people stayed (kinda shocking to me really). And I’m healing in some respects so I hope in time maybe some people will come back. &lt;3 I hope your people will stay.,False,False
