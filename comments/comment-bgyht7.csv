Like, it's to the point where I can't even other any other acai bowls because this one is so fucking good. It just has like acai and almond butter and almond milk, but idk, it tastes so creamy and honestly the perfect flavor profile. It's a shame I think the bowl has to be around 1000 Calories or more 😫 they're pretty big, but you know I'd still eat all of it lol..I need to make the drive over there right before a b/p honestly.",False,False

I can’t remember the last time I bought a hot meal. I load mine up too, I add fruit and nuts and nut butter and chopped up protein bars and just about anything I can think of. My city has some of the most amazing smoothie bowl places too, I’m spoilt with them.",False,False
