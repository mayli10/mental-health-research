The only thing that controls my binges is not restricting severely or disciplining myself for eating/binging.  Had to deal with the underlying issues that caused me to emotionally eat, and focus more on my hunger cues.  Good luck, it’s a tough cycle to break but we all believe in you.",False,False

That makes me feel disgusting. I also log it in Lose It just to visually see how much. I HATE seeing it go red when I go over my cals so that helps!,False,False

As for emotionally based binges, it's helpful to learn new coping skills for the emotions and situations that trigger you to binge (self soothing things like tea, giving yourself a hug etc.)",False,False

Anything involving Nikocado Avocado usually does the trick for me.....  stay safe and take care of yourself ✌,False,False
