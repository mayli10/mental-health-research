I haven't really been into real sex anyway and i have pretty bad sexual assaults when i just didn't care what happens and it fucked me up badly. In my teens i usually just masturbated but i don't even find masturbation nice anymore. I find it gross now. Everything sex related is gross now and its weird. I have been in recovery for 1 and a half year but my sex drive has lessened from little to nothing after that. Aaand i havent had sex since.. 3 years.  No wetness down there anymore for two years either. Gynegology appointment was hellish experience half a year ago. She even put lube a generous amount but it didn't help at all. It was my first and last appointment. I'm never going back.  Body dysmorphia is a serious one. I couldn't enjoy having sex at all with anyone. I had 6 different guys and everyone of them just made me feel more shit.",False,False

On a day where I eat healthy but still enough calories I get wet pretty easy but the whole time I'm thinking about how my body looks and sometimes I convince myself he's faking being attracted to me or thinking about someone else. And on days where I eat whatever, I have a high sex drive but the bloating and stomach gurgles I get from eating more than I'm used to make me scared to have sex.  LPT:  having sex with the lights off helps the self-consciousness. At least for me. ",False,False

BUT functionally these conditions are kind of the same. asexuality can't be expected to ever be ""cured"" but an ED can. but sexuality is fluid so some asexuals change.  if you're comfortable identifying as an asexual though, I think that's fine, even if it's because of your ED. labels are kind of arbitrary anyway :)",False,False

Also, if you go to a gyn, ask her what lubs she recommends. Some are actually bad for us and can cause infections, mostly yeast, if they contains glycerin.

We have ""sex"" every couple of weeks, and its mostly me just trying to make him feel nice. I never feel a need to orgasm anymore. Often I feel nothing.
