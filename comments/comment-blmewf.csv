Hunger and exercise never “count” unless I’ve already been on a losing streak and I’m feeling ok about my weight. Otherwise I’m just angry dwelling on why I can’t just hurry up and lose some fucking pounds already,False,False

Hunger makes me feel proud, like I'm achieving something and finally exercising self-control (even if I'm not really that in-control), but the reactive hunger I sometimes get right after eating makes me feel hypocritical. It's like my body is being sarcasatic, lmao. ""OOoOhh I'm so HUngry after that giant burrito and pizza!! I bet I'm burning sSooOOooo many calories right now!"" Shut the fuck up, stomach. Passive aggressive organ.  The lowkey hunger I feel during sustained restriction is the only kind of hunger I like. The fake hunger I get about a half-hour after a big meal or the exaggerated hunger I feel the day after a binge just feel spiteful.",False,False
