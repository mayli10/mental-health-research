It’s crushing to open up to someone like that and be shamed. You are not disgusting!   Do you have access to therapy or counseling of any type? Do you have insurance? With the severity of your symptoms therapy and possibly even a higher level of care (partial hospitalization or inpatient) might be warranted. When my bulimia was at its worst PHP was very helpful for me. It is possible, but very difficult to recover on your own. Part of why intuitive eating is tough for people w severe eds is that our hunger and satiety cues may not be functioning well. I commend you for all the work you have done already and please seek help if you can. ❤️",False,False

I'm 24 and also started binging and purging around 13-14. Luckily I think I've got it much more under control lately and I've been feeling much more positive. I totally get what you mean about having an unsupportive family and not being able to open up to anyone about it. It sounds like without being able to do counseling you are doing the next best things. The tips I can offer that help me with binges are 1) exercise and/or find a useful hobby and 2) up your calorie intake. Exercise works for me because it makes me feel good about myself and I dont want to ruin that by bingeing and purging. Try working out first thing in the morning to start your day off right. Another thing you can do is find a hobby, I like hobbies where you make something or things like gardening where you can see the fruit of your labor. Next, upping your calorie intake will make you fuller and reduce the urge to binge. Try adding in more fruits, veggies, and raw nuts because they are filling and will make you feel good. Posting on forums really helps me when I was feeling down, so maybe posting here will help you feel supported as well. Lastly, as cliche as it sounds just know that things will get better. Bad things are always going to happen in life and things will never be perfect, but as you age your brain will get stronger and more resilient. You'll be able to handle what life throws at you a little better and you will start to feel more and more at peace with yourself.",False,False
