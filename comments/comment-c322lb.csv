I remember when my behaviors switched form heavy restriction to b/p-ing and even though I tried to tell my doctor about my changing symptoms you know the first thing she told me when she saw my weight gain? “Congrats on gaining weight back all by yourself you’re so amazing!!” To this day I’m still mortified by that line and the hypocrisy, unprofessionalism, and incompetence from so many medical “professionals” that disillusioned me and wasted so much of my mental energy in battling this illness",False,False

I’m already considered underweight if you discount my excess skin. But somehow me literally starving to death (they’re considering placing a feeding tube ffs), is a good thing.",False,False
