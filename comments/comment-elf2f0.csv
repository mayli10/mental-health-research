The science that does exist on it is pretty clear it's not for everyone.  2) Most people on those subs are overweight or obese, which may make fasting easier for them. They have plenty of excess stuff in their bodies to burn. Even if you did have extra weight, depriving yourself for so long means you lack stuff (like nutrients that are stored in certain organs) your body can't get from metabolizing fat.   3) Most people reporting good fasting things do not have an eating disorder.  4) Personal anecdote - I felt good the first couple times I did a fast and now I feel the way you're describing when I try. I'm not sure why. I agree that it sucks to read the positive stories when it doesn't work for you. I honestly think most of the stuff posted in those subs is kinda toxic, although I bought into them hard once upon a time.",False,False

I try to remember there’s multiple layers of selection bias happening: 1. People who feel good about their fasting experience are more likely to post. 2. When posting, those people are more likely to emphasize the victories and their perceived awesomeness rather than the full picture. 3. My brain is *way* more likely to remember the people reporting exceptional experiences and ignore the posts about stopping earlier than planned or feeling crappy or what-even-are-electrolytes.   I’d also guess there are many people there struggling to find a place of balance with nutrition, eating, their body, etc. They may well be flirting with disordered eating or an ED and not know it (or not want to see it). That thought in itself doesn’t help me much (cuz WhY caN’t I bE MOaR diSoRDerEd?) but finding a mote of compassion or empathy for that person...remembering they are also just a human trying to find their way...that does help a bit.   &lt;3",False,False

I promise you're not the only one that feels how you do.",False,False
