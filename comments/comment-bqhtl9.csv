My BMI was only like 23.8 at that point. But then she would act worried when I started cutting calories to lose weight? I really dont understand what she expected after teasing me about my weight for so long  I lost 25 lbs since then and i told her I'd stop because she calls me too skinny now but I'm not at my gw yet.,False,False
