I was just under the assumption you showed up and just wanted the rice. I love rice too and would happily eat it alone as a side. ",False,False

You can appreciate the natural flavours of food, but I think it's crazy to suggest a bowl of plain rice tastes better than sushi. Also, going to a restaurant for most people is an occasion, I would even as someone with an ED, find it super weird if someone I didn't know had an ED just ordered plain rice.",False,False

It's so weird to me how they don't just appreciate the natural flavours of different foods, but I also get it because I was the same way before anorexia. Thinking about it though, it kinda makes me think of the whole ""white people don't season their food"" stereotype. Eating disorders are largely seen as a thing that happens to young white girls in Western countries. That's obviously not accurate, but when you consider all the women who had disordered eating habits and then grew up and had to start cooking for other people it makes sense. A lot of cultures do use a lot of oil or salty seasonings in their dishes and those are things that people with eating disorders tend to avoid.",False,False
