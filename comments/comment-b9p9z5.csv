Before editing devices. I posted a photo from a vacation and I was wearing a bikini. Several people said, ‚Äòoh you lost a lot of weight‚Äô or they said, ‚Äòwas that really me?‚Äô Haha yeah I faked a picture with my family dear fucking Brandon. It really bothered me bc I had no idea people thought I was chubby and that‚Äôs when it all started. Weight loss is an up and down process. I‚Äôm sorry some dick messaged you. Sending positive vibes üòò",False,False

If putting someone down is the only way you can think of to prop yourself up and feel good about you, you kind of fucking suck. Anyone with *anything* to be proud of themselves for doesn‚Äôt do that. Anyone with an ounce of basic human decency doesn‚Äôt do that. And anyone who‚Äôs opinion could even potentially matter doesn‚Äôt do that.  Try not to let some pathetic, weak minded douchebag decide your opinion of yourself for you. He sucks. The fact that he felt compelled to say something so *obviously* shitty to another human being tells you exactly how much his opinion was worth. Chalk it up to a sad, sad attempt at negging and keep your chin up.  For the record, you have value and deserve to be treated with dignity, *regardless* of what you look like or how you feel about how you look. I can‚Äôt make anyone else love their body. Shit I can‚Äôt even do that for myself. But whatever you are feeling about your body should have absolutely *zero* effect on how other people are allowed to treat you. You are worthy. By virtue of existing you are entitled to be treated with respect. Don‚Äôt let *anyone* tell you differently. And certainly don‚Äôt ever let the least of humanity convince you otherwise.",False,False
