And I'm on this sub to try to help people, not because I'm sick.  I had struggled with anorexia and body dysmorphia for over a year, and it was getting to an extreme point where I didn't want to live. (Bet you can relate.) Anyways, let's just say I was losing hope very quickly, and I was running out of options. I was going to a youth group (that I still attend) and was trying to know God so desperately because for some reason, I felt like I didn't have a true real relationship with him. Even though I believed he sacrificed his only son for me, I just didn't feel it in my heart and I was beginning to question the whole Bible all together.  One night I was almost convinced I didn't need to keep trying to find God, and there was no use for me living. I felt like I was drowning.  I almost killed myself, but something was holding me back.   I said a prayer that night so intense and real that I was beside myself with tears. I needed out of the sicknesses I was wrapped up in, and God seemed to be the only way.  Now, about a year later, I know God. Truly, 100% know him. He saved my life, he can save yours, keep trying please.  And always remember, in God's eyes, you are absolutely perfect. You are beautiful, strong, courageous, and God LOVES you no matter what. It won't be easy, it might be anything but. I'm not trying to push anything, you shouldn't care what I say anyways. But putting your trust and your life into his hands, might be the only way to save yourself.   Hope everything gets better, lots of love -Saraüíïüíïüíï",False,False
