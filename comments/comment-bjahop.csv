I have no issue discussing opinions and hearing the other persons side, if you took the time to read my replies to others you would’ve seen that. But I’m just not going to go back and forth with people after they call me passive aggressive when that just isn’t the case whatsoever.",False,True

I actually think it’s funny that a select few are getting so uptight by my opinion when people are agreeing with me.

They’re allowed to have their own opinion (and share it) just like you are,False,False

Especially when they ask me how I lost weight, I either respond by saying “not eating” or “I just hate myself more than I love food” or straight up told them I’m in recovery from an ED. Sometimes it leads to good conversations and some educational opportunity, or better yet it just shuts them down so I can go back to working/eating in peace.",False,False

After seeing a few other people’s responses to this post, I think I’m just a very honest and blunt person. So when people do make comments about my healthy food or that I’m thinner than before or they complain they can’t lose weight, I literally respond by saying I have an ED and obviously if they’re eating McDonald’s three times a week that isn’t going to do anything for their weight. I follow the mantra if you can dish it, you can take it. If someone wants to open the conversation to discussing eating habits or what our bodies look like, I don’t have an issue.",False,True

But I don’t say anything because they didn’t ask for my advice and it’s none of my business. And some people can be catty as fuck, acting like my underweight body is effortless and not a source of constant pain and anguish every minute of my life....",False,False

I don't get comments like this because I'm not underweight but if I were I'd find it triggering and uncomfortable as hell. You have no way of knowing \*why\* the person is underweight - just genetics, sports, mental illness, maybe even a very serious physical illness that they don't wanna talk about.  I wouldn't call it skinny ""shaming"" (because as you said, the stigma against fat people is soooo much worse) but weight and food are such a loaded topic for so many people that I think it's better to just avoid it.",False,False
