Any restriction or fasting or whatever I do is purely done in attempts to control my issues with overeating and binge eating. It's a big part of why I have no idea where I fit in terms of diagnosis and will likely never get a diagnosis or any help (the UK sucks)  &amp;#x200B;  Can't help you on IGs sorry but I really hope you find something that works for you to step towards recovery and just eating healthily without the mental bullshit &lt;3,False,False

She had restrictive ana but almost all her current posts are about believing in your self worth and value and not shaming yourself, worth a look. The other one is Jordan shrinks, she has an IG and a YouTube which are both good. She didn’t start with an ED but what I like about her is she is very sensible and logical about food and weight loss. She developed a binge eating disorder which she’s recently started to recover from, she’s like 200+ days binge free atm or something.   Not sure if they’re what you’re wanting but they might be worth a look!",False,False

I.e. I'm pretty sure if I didn't live off of coke zero and sf red bull I would be a lot bigger but having those to fill boredom and keep me alert stops me from binging as much so instead I'm maintaining. I'm in the process of leaving a stressful living situation so I'm hoping in a few months when things are settled I can focus on healthy weight loss. I might start keeping a binge diary to identify what I'm feeling when I get the urge to binge or give in and go through with it.",False,False

Unfortunately I've been more on the binge side of things the last few years so it averages out to approximately maintaining a high weight, sometimes I lose a bit and gain it back.",False,False
