I have vividly remembered that moment over and over again for the past few years, and have racked my brain trying to understand why he would respond that way. I was actually close to underweight but probably looked ‚Äòhealthy slim‚Äô at that point. Did he say that because I was too big? Or he thought I was lying? If he thought I was lying, then it means I looked nowhere near as sick as I felt.  The HA funny but not really funny thing is, he was the first person I had ever told because I was really struggling and was desperate for help or support, but that comment made me uglycry in a public bathroom and has been a constant trigger for many, many hardcore relapses since.
