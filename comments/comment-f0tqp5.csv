Then we're usually so busy I don't really get a break all night, but I pack a little tub of plain mixed nuts (almonds, walnuts, cashews and pecans) equal to about a handful, and the same sized tub of fresh berries (raspberries, strawberries and blueberries). I can usually grab a tub to snack on while I catch up on paperwork; tends to be the fruit first around midnight-2am for a sugar boost, then the nuts around 4-6am for the protein and slow acting energy to get me to end of shift and then home to bed.   For reference, my shifts run 20:00-08:30, but can be anywhere from 12-14 hours at a time, if that helps at all.",False,False

A few smaller meals + snacks + caffeine is what works for me.

Also, my ex is a night shift nurse and I got him hooked on Bang lmao",False,False
