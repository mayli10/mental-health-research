Are you me? I plan snacks out for others and it drives me INSANE when they don’t hit thier TDEE. It’s awkward too, asking for their height and shit to calculate thier TDEE",False,False

Particularly if you’re not going to eat them with her. If she too has disordered eating habits this could be very stressful for her. Perhaps offer to talk about what happened with her and how she feels instead?,False,False

I notice myself mainly being aware and concerned towards my family and their eating habits. I will sometimes comment on how much they're eating in a very polite way like ""will that meal keep you going for the day?"" or ""what are you going to eat for dinner?"" I didn't even realize I was doing this and then one day my mom asked me why I was always asking about her food. I think at least for me and some others who do the same, it is simply cause I care and don't want someone else to experience my hardships with eating. And also both of my parents went through eating disorders in their teens so there is a family history of it that makes me more cautious too.",False,False
