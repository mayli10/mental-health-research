I use bronkaid but I have to cycle it because I get used to it and it no longer works on me so like two weeks on two off. I take one in the AM with caffeine and aspirin and then again at noon. Double dosing does nothing for me just wastes a pill. I'm also a heavy 2-3 pot a day coffee drinker and I had to reduce my intake to 1 pot because I was getting used to it.  Just walk up to a pharmacy counter (Walgreens CVS Kroger Meijer etc doesn't matter) ""one box of bronkaid please"" they'll ask for your ID you pay and go on your way. ",False,False

Ive never had a pharmacist act weird when I ask for it. If you're feeling really paranoid just alternate pharmacies when you pick it up. Also consider getting a pill cutter because I found that a full dose was too much for me at first.  Obviously check your countries laws as well. I know in the US its perfectly legal but in other countries like the UK its not.,False,False

I am so used to stims so if you arent a caffeine fiend please take it slow. I usually take at least 300mg caff with a 25g bronk. It wears off roughly 4-5 hrs later.   From my experience it does not help as much with a 2nd dose. And you should not even consider a second dose until you are sure you can handle it!!  Drink lots of water and I mean a lot. I try to get a gallon a day personally but your mouth will get hella dry on this stuff.  You need to show ID and im never asked why im buying it but you can just say asthma if they do.   ,False,False
