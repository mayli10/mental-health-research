That was actually a relief, because my step-dad was emotionally abusive. But while they were married he tore down my already fragile self-esteem, so starting high school in a new town was tough. But the tipping point was the fact that I couldn’t seem to make friends with people who already knew each other, and not even one guy knew I existed. I started feeling like I was ugly, and I thought that if I was ugly I could at least be skinny.",False,False

Later it became about control and a bit of spite or competition.  Early on Mom was always talking negatively about her body so by the time I was 6 I was aware of my weight and being chubby in my eyes; I told her I wanted to be a cheerleader but I'd have to lose weight. For a couple years she got quieter but I noticed her plate/food she ate. By the time I was in middle it was back to the same old same old.  By middle school I was already pretty depressed and had a girl ask me if I was pregnant. Later on I'd just internalize everything someone said to me. (""You have a soft jawline"", ""if you were skinnier you'd almost be pretty"" etc etc)  This Christmas I got bad again because I realized I was a bigger pants size than my mom, aunt, and grandma. So when I went back to school I became obsessive over counting, especially due to all the stress this semester / being stupidly off my meds for too long.",False,False

It was just simple BED back then.  I was getting better a few years ago, but then I participated in a public event for a sort of game, which resulted in me being in some pictures and livestreams... and my picture got circulated around groups with people making fun of my weight and such. Then I took a pretty sharp nosedive into extreme ED behaviors and now I guess I count as Bulimic?",False,False

To make things worse gender dysphoria had to come into this mess as soon as I hit puberty so it was always like... so do I want to be so thin because I’m fat or so that I have no visibly gendered body or do I want to be a man or both— I cycled through extreme binging and extreme diets just like my mother always did. And eventually I came out as trans but my family isn’t supportive at all so.... Frustration with that and the waiting time for hormones (I’m talking about years) brought me back to this really strong urge to regain agency over the way my body looks in any way possible. It brought me back to “if I can’t pass as a man I want to at least be androgynous and I want specifically to be dummy stick thin” and that’s how I just... started restricting so much, it went from a bad relationship with food/disordered eating into an all consuming eating disorder. I lost a bunch of weight (but didn’t get the androgynous body I wanted because bone structure is a bicht)... then got on hormones last year and I started to feel better. I seriously thought I was fully recovered for the first few months. Until I started gaining a little weight back (because testosterone will do that) and I just... lost my mind, because I let the disordered thought patterns and need for control get way, way past the original intent. Now it’s not even I want to be skinny to “pass”, it’s just that I am terrified of gaining more weight and I’m terrified of letting go of that sense of control I want over the way my body looks. It doesn’t help at all that my mother is still weight obsessed, my sister also has an eating disorder (because of course) and she’s way thinner than me (... because of course she is). It also doesn’t help that nosy people keep commenting on my weight loss in such a positive way all the time, too. :(",False,False

I don't think it helps that my mum has an eating disorder and other mental health issues and from the age of 11/12 when she got really bad I was just left to sort out my own meals, honestly it was super weird when I first went to go stay with my long distance boyfriend and his family actually cooked a proper dinner and all ate together every day, like what?? I can't even remember the last time my family did that.   Also calorie counting is a huge trigger for me for some reason, probably because it takes me back to when my ED was at its worst and I got obsessed with calories.
