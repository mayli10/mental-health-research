But try not to worry about the calories on your cheat day. Often, it's the psychological stress of having good/bad foods and counting calories that contributes to stress binging (if that's a thing you're susceptible to)  My cheat days are way more effective at stabilizing my health and mood if I just aim for relatively wholesome, not low cal. Like I had a PB sandwich recently that fucking rejuvenated me. Sure, not low cal at all but the 500 calories for my phat PB sandwich &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; binging on a fatty food later because I feel deprived. These kinds of cheat days, where I let myself have anything I'm craving (as long as it's not like completely nutritionally void, like chips, unless I really need chips haha) have actually done virtually nothing to set back my weight loss compared to the binging I'd do after being too strict about my cheat days.",False,False

I use 2 bananas, either two frozen or one fresh and one frozen. The frozen ones i put out to thaw about 30-45 mins before making it just bcus my mixer canâ€™t handle it otherwise but if you have a strong mixer you could probs use them directly! Then i mix those up until nice and creamy, i add a tad bit of milk or natural youghurt to make the blending  easier, and then i pour in some unsweetened cocoa powder (be careful with the amount tho or it can get bitter, a little at a time is better) and some coconut flakes and voilÃ¡! Super tasty and filling icecream, itâ€™s my go-to meal when i have pms-cravings",False,False
