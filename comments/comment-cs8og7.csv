She simply told me, ""it's okay to not be okay."" I put so much pressure, guilt, etc. on myself for not having my shit together that that simple statement open a flood gate of tears and brought me so much relief.",False,False

Often we can give each other a look and know what the other is thinking. She is able to recognize when a specific method or thing we are trying isnâ€™t working, acknowledges it, and is always willing to try something new. Despite the anxiety that comes with making myself vulnerable, I feel safe in her office.",False,False

My therapist now though is amazing. I'm tearing up just thinking about what she has done for me and, I know it is her job but she goes beyond that all the time. We have casual conversations as well so it feels nice to not always feel like you're being evaluated or observed for a potential solution. She has given me hope and confidence and countless coping mechanisms that I've been practicing for months. Sometimes when I feel I've made no progress at all with my mental health she makes me realize really how far I've come. There's so much more to say but now I'm crying. I just beg people to talk to someone because it can be life changing. Whenever I feel I have no one by my side I just remember that she will always be there for me.",False,False
