Granted I have seen posts in 1200isplenty and the like that sound like they're definitely coming from someone with an eating disorder, but fasting is a tool that can be used by non disordered people to accomplish various things.  Humans have evolved around intermittent fasting periods, and some research suggests that small regular meals don't give your body enough time to use your metabolism for other things (free radicals, healing, etc).  I think the difference is the end goal and the obsession.  You can juice fast for a while and not be disordered just like you can drink a shit load of alcohol  and not be an alcoholic.  The alcoholic/ED person knows in their heart which is true.  The ED person is going to tempt themselves with trouble by going on a long fast just like an alcoholic is tempting fate by getting drunk.

It won’t kill most people to skip a meal or two, especially if they’re overweight, and you likely won’t see any negative implications even if not overweight.   However, it’s definitely not normal to make a habit of it. In fact, I think it can be pretty unhealthy to do so (which doesn’t stop me), but I think the people over at /r/fasting are mostly kidding themselves about whether they have disordered eating. I saw a couple people wanting to go 20 days without calories, and abusing drugs to get energy in the middle of days/weeks long fasts. I think part of the problem is the myth that if you’re overweight you can’t have an ED; they think they have weight they actually need to lose so it’s okay and not a disorder. That’s wrong though, as most of us here know.",False,False
