It's pasta so you can imagine the calories, but it's so good when you can fit it in your limit!!!",False,False

Food wise: they have seaweed snacks but I'm not super into them, verrrry low calorie though! Spices, I buy black peppercorn there. Super great deals on pickles if you can eat, like, a gallon of them. They had individually packed hummus and guac last time I was there but I don't remember the calorie count. I love buying cherry tomatoes there too. I buy the huge bag of garlic sometimes.  Morningstar nuggets when they have them. Beware the Morningstar black bean patties! They're like twice as big as normal ones for some reason and close to 200 calories each.   If you have an Aldi nearby that's where I usually go to buy supplemental food since it's reasonably sized and still a good price. They're getting way more vegan friendly too!",False,False
