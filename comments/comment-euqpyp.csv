Your eating disorder is what wants you to think that you are faking so it can get worse. It doesn’t sound like you are faking to me. All EDs are different so if your symptoms don’t align exactly with another then that doesn’t make you inferior or fake compared to them.,False,False

The psych i went to, after around 3 sessions and a personality test just told me to my face that i was overthinking things and that i was actually perfectly fine, even though it all felt at the time and still does feel real. That was the last straw for my mum tho so no more therapists for me, which might be a good thing ig lol",False,True

Whenever I've read people talk about binging with food they always mention that they lose control and stuff but i feel like i don't, i kinda give up control but I'm still fully aware of what I'm doing.",False,True

I think it is less about how much you restrict but rather your mindset while restricting. And if you are faking I can tell you that you are not faking. It’s very common for people with EDs to think they are faking or “not sick enough” which is not true and everyone deserves help. If you were faking you’d be 100% sure that you are faking. It’s your body and you know when something is off. Your struggles are completely valid and you deserve help.,False,False

Unfortunately there's still this idea, even among us sufferers, that we're not valid unless we meet certain physical criteria. Your struggle is real, you're not a fake.",False,False
