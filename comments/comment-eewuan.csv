I think it’s completely relatable to feel the way you described - you’re not alone in this!   I once heard someone flip around the “I’m not sick enough yet for help” line of thought, and instead essentially ask ‘am I well enough for the life I want to be part of?’ Because everyone is worthy of help. The main person putting up signs saying ‘you must be this sick to deserve a better life’ is me, and the bitch of it is there is no ‘sick enough’. The only way I’ve ever hit bottom is to stop digging.   I hope you’ll keep talking with your therapist. And when you’re ready to start disclosing things to your parents, I hope you are met with compassion and support. &lt;3",False,False
