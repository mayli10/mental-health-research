I have a flowy, breezy maxi dress that I tell myself looks *effortless* &amp; *chic* while also hiding my thighs for 73% of my time in the sun, maybe something like that would make you feel better? (TJ Maxx has A TON of cute ones right now for under $25 if you have one near you!)",False,False

The one I have is light pink and kinda sheer but it makes me feel sooooo much better. If anyone asks about it I just say that Iâ€™m protecting myself from the sun, which is true, but it deff makes me feel better about myself. I only take it off to actually go in the water",False,False
