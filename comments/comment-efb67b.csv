I’ve struggled with bulimia on and off for 12 years and 5 years ago is when it started getting really bad. I can’t go a day without doing it and I feel like it has taken control over my life. At this point, I’ve given up hope that I will ever get better.   Can you talk to a doctor? Maybe go to a support group?  If you feel like you have any control left, I pray that you will get help before it gets worse. ... because it will. ❤️",False,False
