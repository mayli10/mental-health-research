I lost 50lbs when I worked days and back shifts, but when I was suddenly thrown on to night shifts (without being asked or it being discussed), I gained back 75lbs. It's been 2 years, I'm miserable. I can't stop binging, and I can't get into any healthy eating habits. I end up binging, and sleeping. That's basically been my life the past two years. I'd rather be dead. Currently at 255lbs. I was so proud the day I got under 200lbs, and even more when I got to 180lb. Everyone was so proud of me. Now look at me.",False,False
