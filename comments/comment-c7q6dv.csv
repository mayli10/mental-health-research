It has slowed down so it burns less and that's why you are plateauing.,False,False

I'm not sure but i would say try eating a bit more for a day - i don't mean a binge, but a high restriction maybe. Just for one day. It may be hard but it can break the plateau by speeding up your metabolism again. I'm in no way qualified for this advice but it's just what i've learned for personal experience.",False,False

After a few months of training and seeing zero gains, you realize you are plateauing. First, remember that there are diminishing gains as you try. As we move closer to our upper limits (strength or size, which are limited by physics and genetics), things move much slower than they did when we began to train.  Now, I don’t know how long you’ve been training, what your training program is or your diet. But I’d suggest you **examine your routine and diet carefully**. If your training routine looks good, sometimes the solution is as simple as adding another 250–500 calories a day to your diet. If that doesn’t work, then going to a lower volume, a higher intensity training program will begin to move you forward again (like working in the 4–6 rep range). Make sure you are [progressively overloading](https://hvmn.com/blog/training/overload-principle-training-with-purpose) your muscles if you haven't. If you are already doing that, try a month of lower intensity, higher volume work.  So, without knowing about the above and being able to make specific recommendations about your training or diet, I’ll suggest this: **take a full 9–10 break with zero training**.  Stop your bodybuilding training for a full nine days. Replace it with a low-intensity exercise like walking. Time and time again, I’ve seen that just a total break for more than a week can help an individual break through a plateau. I do it about every 2.5 to 3 months myself and almost always see some additional gains at a quicker pace when I resume training.   Why is this the case? I can’t pull a study for this, but there is some anecdotal evidence that suggests that when we resume training after a significant break that the hormonal response to training is increased (and it seems that perhaps this increase lasts about five weeks) which in turn leads to gains associated with the increased hormonal responses. Now, I’m a little skeptical that this is actually the mechanism explaining this since the hormonal increases, although measurable, are small, and there may be some other biological factors involved.  To sum up...  **If your diet and training program look good, and switching them up does not help you break through the plateau, take a break of 9–10 days from training.**      If this doesn't work for you, try the recommendations of Shawn LeBrun here:  [https://www.bodybuilding.com/fun/lebrun4.htm](https://www.bodybuilding.com/fun/lebrun4.htm) he's a fitness expert.
