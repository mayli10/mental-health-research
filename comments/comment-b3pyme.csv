Last Sunday my extended family had a massive dinner gathering and I prepared in advance for that by eating alot in front of my relatives (since they all notice Im thin already) and then locking myself in my room after to exercise followed by a 20 hour fast. ,False,True

I can fast or restrict heavily whenever my bf is gone but when he gets home it's binge city.   It doesn't help that he eats so much and I get so jealous ðŸ˜­ and he likes to eat out a lot. I push him to get qdoba if we gotta eat out that way I can get the mini burrito bowl. ,False,False

I feel an immense amount of pressure to eat normally and in my brain 'eating normally' is just eating every little thing (and hella fast).   I have gotten slightly better since at work I bring my own food and don't let myself buy any food unless if the students are having a bake sale (and then I cave and then wind up binging).   I don't know what it is about eating in front of others that turns that switch in my brain, but I always overeat when with other people. I'm just going to blame that on the fact that my parents would get mad if you didn't eat everything on the plate, and my mom was a little heavy handed on the servings. So I'd eat fast to try and get it over with.   I even notice this with my SO - when they're gone for a trip, I eat much less and am full and sated all day and into the night. But when they're home I really overeat and will binge right in front of them. ",False,False

Just last week though I ordered a large binge meal at a restaurant and as I added more to the order the server said ""oh wow!"". I don't know what he meant by that, but it made me think I was ordering an unusual amount of food.  So I self-consciously looked around me to compare what I was eating with what others were eating. There were some very overweight or obese people eating the same amount or less than me, a couple of huge muscular bodybuilders and one very skinny twenty-something year old woman.  Maybe it was a bit much.",False,False
