Itâ€™s always on day 2 of a fast that itâ€™s really dangerous to shop because Iâ€™ll get stuck for an hour or more when Iâ€™m just there for 1-2 items.   One time a creepy dude bought me ice cream after watching me pick up and set back every single carton in the freezer for more than 10 minutesðŸ˜‚ (he was creepy because he followed me to my car after waiting a solid 90 min for me to finish shopping..like bro wtf),False,False
