However, if you're overweight, fully committing to building a healthy relationship with food will probably result in your body reaching a healthier weight, so in that sense i guess it is possible. The difference is the weight loss being a side effect of your goal to recover, not a main goal on and of itself ",False,False

I think this disorder convinces is we have weight to lose when we really don’t. I’ve also found trying to lose weight and recover is kinda hard because (at least for me) I keep engaging in behaviors to lose weight. Trying to lose weight in a healthy way doesn’t exist for me at this moment lol. ,False,False
