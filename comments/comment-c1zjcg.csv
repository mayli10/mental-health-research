Apparently there is indeed a reddit for everything, I think that nowadays the situation with my mom got much better though (we live in different countries now and only speak through the phone)  Idk if she's truly a narc mom or only have a lot of narc tendencies/traits but it seems like she's finally starting to care and reach out even in her our little (and a bit triggering) way if you understand what I mean",False,True

What you're feeling is completely valid and understandable. Don't be too hard on yourself - I know it sounds really bad when you think about it as ""envying a suicide attempt"". But considering the circumstances, it's completely valid and even expected for you to wish you were in a position of favor and support and affection. **You're not a bad person for feeling this way.** You're just dealing with a really shitty situation.",False,False
