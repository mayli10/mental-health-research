Years of abuse has made me automatically think Iâ€™m a burden to others and hard to deal with. I was also told I was overreacting basically anytime I was upset so I always feel like Iâ€™m being over dramatic as well. Yay emotional abuse ðŸ™ƒ,False,True

Iâ€™m not trying to be dramatic or difficult but I honestly donâ€™t. I have sensory issues that have caused a lot of food anxiety my whole life. I was shamed as a kid for hating vegetables among other foods. Iâ€™d get yelled at for not finishing things because I didnâ€™t like them. My dietitian has said it sounds like Iâ€™m a super taster. Others have said it sounds like ARFID. Food has always been a source of anxiety for me. It just morphed into anorexia when I got a little older.",False,True

I can't imagine being gay with a really religious family. That all sounds very tough and horrible.,False,False

I was abused my whole life and experienced sexual trauma. I had just realized Iâ€™m gay before it started. I come from an extremely religious family. My dad would refer to gay people as faggots. Iâ€™ve never really had it good in life.,False,True

You don't deserve to suffer from an ED. The ED is hell, and treatment and recovery can be hellish. I don't know what else to say except I'm sorry you're having a rough time. Do you remember life before your ED developed?",False,False
