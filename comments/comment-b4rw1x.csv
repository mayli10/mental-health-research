You can also bring empty reusable water bottles and fill them up with water in the parks for free, and throw in flavor packets if needed! Having those options keeps my anxiety down and keeps me from missing out.  If all else fails, maybe you can ""split"" a treat with someone else, and let them eat more. It's a win-win, because you both don't eat as much junk as you would have if you had ordered one each.  Just remember to have fun and not stress too much, just one or two days of extra indulgence won't do much to your body overall",False,False
