I’m still on it now and have been the same weight for almost 3 years now. I feel like weight gain related to bc isn’t because of the pill itself, but because that individual feels more confident + less period symptoms = more appetite. I would say it greatly varies from person to person. I would give it a try for 6ish months to see how it affects you (keep in mind different pills have different levels of hormones, which have different side effects)",False,False
