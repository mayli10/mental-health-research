Yesterday I went to grab a cookie and my grandma politely asked me to not eat in the room because she has just cleaned. Me absolutely hating to eat without watching something what I LIKE or any other form of entertainment. I decided to put the cookie back and walk empty handed to my room. I hate thinking that I'd have to just sit down and eat without doing something. It made me not even want the cookie anymore.,False,False

I would always need to be watching an interesting show or movie or reading something engaging while I was eating. My mother pointed out to me when my binge eating was really bad, not in a mean-spirited way but a gentle way, just pointing out an observation. It was interesting of her to notice this but Iâ€™ve seen a fair few eating-disordered traits in her so I chalk her keen eye up to that.   I found it very interesting once she brought it up, and itâ€™s something thatâ€™s stuck with me even now. I am in the middle of a restriction phase at the moment and I always make an effort to pay attention to my food instead of being distracted - otherwise I find myself reaching for my phone.",False,False

We both desperately (key word: desperately) want to find ""the perfect video"" or something before eating (like r/mealtimevideos), I think for the numbing effect-- we watch something to heighten the received stimulation when eating is already a rewarding act in and of itself, and eating becomes associated with ""relaxing"", which is dangerous imo because depending on your mental state if you're stressed or depressed or withdrawing and wind down/have ""me time"" too often, you eat a lot. Which is what i do (i basically OMAD because i eat all my cals for the day, while gradually, in a frenzied state of mind as i consume content)   The purpose is to distract myself and avoid confronting my real issues. Food has never been emotional for me (i.e. I'm not an emotional eater), moreso for the numbing effect, avoid my issues, distract myself and procrastinate  I want to eat without distractions, but i always return to my vices (e.g. frequenting this subreddit, getting on my phone at night, etc.)  How we tend to do anything is how we tend to do everything. I don't give the act of eating my undivided attention, the same way i fail to give many other things my undivided attention, and fail to practice mindfulness and being present overall  Something i am trying is to only eat around people. No more eating solely in my room OMAD style with the excuse/justification ""i enjoy my food better this way"". Starting to pack my lunch, breakfast the school provides, and eat dinner with my family, even if i have my own food id prefer to eat, because food shouldn't be solely about enjoyment. It's fuel and needs to be treated as such. I hate the way i am, bratty and throwing internal hissy fits and trashing food because i dont want what my family is having for dinner, when i should be grateful someone prepared something for me, meaning i dont have to spend time making my own food, and giving me the option to spend my time in better ways (even though i don't put every minute to good use in the first place, i should appreciate the ability to do so, supposing i applied myself and didn't procrastinate)",False,False
