If talking about you at all. It's haaaaard but I try to remember that most people aren't actually thinking about me unless they're actually talking to me and if they're talking to me then they're more interested in what I am saying than what I look like. Especially family. People only really care what you look like if they're attracted to you and then it's mostly positive stuff.,False,False

You think I look fat? Well fuck you very much, I’m having fun surrounded by the people I love. We don’t need that kinda attitude around here biiiiitch.”  * talk to the ED voice like it’s a whiny kid sibling that you love. Be the kind stern voice of reason. eg. “No BEDBulimic, they aren’t talking smack about you. They’re prob glad that your eyes look brighter and that you’re more at peace than the last time they saw you. They love you kiddo! Even if you doubt that!”  2 totally different approaches lol but they’ve helped me before",False,False
