Yesterday I caved and logged it all. I thought it would be in the 2500's but it was only 1500, and that was with a donut, cake, pie, and ice cream. To help me feel more assured, I've given myself mental ""permission"" to eat multiple helpings of veggies if I choose after my first plate of food and permission for one snack. That way I dont get this feeling of I'm eating something Im.not supposed to be and end up binging. And that way i know my intake will be relatively low without having to count it  Dont know if that will help you",False,False

I wanted to escape the food chatter but in the end I just gained weight and it’s still there. So now I’m going back to counting calories ,False,False
