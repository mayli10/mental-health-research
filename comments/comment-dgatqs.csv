I wish he would see/understand how much it effects me and how easy it is to not let that happen. Just a text. Even saying that he can’t text right now or is busy or something to give me some peace of mind.,False,True

I hate being fucked around like this. I would assume he is not planning to hang out with you.  I know this is hard, but make other plans with someone else (a friend or family member), so you have something else to do. He is going to continue to mess you around if he knows that you are always there as a back up when he chooses.  I would even be tempted to leave your phone at home when you go to work so you don't have the urge to message him again",False,False

I feel so fucking sad.,False,True

I can really relate to your pain atm. There is a concept of a 'favourite person' in the borderline community where you place all your self worth onto the actions of someone else. Usually a significant other or crush.  Everything you do revolves around them. Whether they show you attention or not determines your mood. It's definitely not a choice, but it's obsessive and their validation is paramount to your happiness.   It's fine if your FP is willing to play ball, but when they aren't it can literally destroy your world.  It sucks for the FP as well. Its a lot of pressure knowing someones mood is so tied to everything that you do.  Constantly messaging him is not going to end well. Four messages is too much. Get a diary and write everything down. Get out of the house. Find something to distract you. Stop messaging him.  He is probably ignoring you because its too much for him to deal with atm. Dickhead move on his part, but continual attempts to contact him when he's not replying will make you the one in the wrong.  Do you do anything to self soothe which helps bring you down when you're distressed?",False,False

It makes me feel so so so crazy. Like staring at my phone crying crazy. Or any moment that my phone goes off makes me instantly happy for a second until I realize it’s not him.   He still hasn’t responded which I know he knows drives me up the wall. He also knows because I’ve texted him like 4 times telling him how shitty I feel!! We’ve talked about it before and he’s gunna just say the same thing “I’m sorry I’m dumb I wasn’t looking at my phone”. And we’ve talked about how shitty I feel about it in person and in the moment he sounds so understanding but then in a few weeks it happens again. And YES I KNOW. The most logical answer to all of this is to just walk away but I can’t do that right now.  I don’t know how to explain it but everything in my life is so crazy and that’s probably the most stable out of all of them even though it has the potential to make me feel so shitty. And I feel more strongly about our situation than he does which adds extra layers of confusion. And my bipolar ass doesn’t know how to take care of myself. He’s also one of the few people who knows about my issues (ed included) and has stuck around, and been an actual support system for me even though everything I just said makes it sound like he isn’t.  It’s really confusing but yeah he sucks half the week and then other half it’s great and I’m not at the place to cut him off because that would be another way for me to spiral out of control. The worst part is that I feel like if I complain or make all of this too complicated he’s gunna dip out because we aren’t actually “dating”. But we hang out, have sex, go on dates, give each other gifts on holidays, act couple-y cute in private and now in public. But yeah not dating!!",False,True

No one wants to feel so obviously second best in a relationship.  I have BPD and this shit sends me fucking spiralling. Being in a relationship with someone that is only on board part of the time when it's convenient for them, makes me flip out. All my insecurities and rage and everything just swirls like crazy.   I would just give yourself distance from him for now. Don't message him until he messages you. You need to cool off and restabilise.   Is he usually receptive when you talk about your feelings? Like if you tell him it's really hard when he stands you up like this will he take it on?",False,False
