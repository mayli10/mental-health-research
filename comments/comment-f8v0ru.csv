But telling someone you have an ED might not help them at all. It could be perceived as unsolicited advice, or worse, she could become competitive about her ED worsening her health..  I personally wouldn't want my friends to know, but those are just my 2 cents.",False,False

Maybe telling her and letting her know how much of a pain in the ass it is to have one will snap her out of it.   Like really let her know all the nasty details of having one: ""I haven't shit in X days"", ""I pulled a big glob of hair off my head the other day"", ""I'm wearing 2 of each clothing because I'm freezing my ass off"", ""I fainted the other day and bonked my head""",False,False
