It might seem counter intuitive, but the advice is to actually full disclosure with that too. If he’s understanding and caring, he’ll react well. If you’re honest about the cognitive dissonance and the internal conflict, he’ll be able to understand more and it won’t look like you’re being deceitful if he notices any discrepancy between your statements and your behaviors. Whatever goals you set and share with him, make sure you’re not deceiving yourself (in other words, your ED isn’t deceiving you) when you originally make them. If you know your ED won’t let you do something, don’t promise your loved ones you’ll do it. Negotiate with your ED what it can accept and it’s easier to stick to it. Make promises to yourself not just to others. Good luck!",False,False
