My GW has always been a ""healthy"" BMI but now I feel like I'll have to be underweight to even look normal in clothes because of all my loose skin :////  Also I always felt shitty for leaving weight loss so ""late"" (relatively speaking) because I felt like my skin might've kept its shape a bit better if I'd lost weight when I was younger, but hearing from other people experiencing the same thing makes me realise that was never a certainty anyway so I'll try not to beat myself up about it. Thank you for sharing! :)",False,False
