If yes, that might be where the anger is coming from, and he's misplacing it on the relapse when it's actually about you miscommunicating. He worries for you, so knowing that you've been in a relapse and doing badly without him knowing can twist some nerves.  I hope you're doing okay : (",False,False

I think he is worried out of his mind and it comes off as anger. Still not cool but a far stretch from the person you described. I always look at the situation and remind myself that the other person doesnâ€™t have all the information. A serious conversation about this is needed tho between op and her boyfriend. With emphasis on the difficulty of recovery and how reactions like that discourage her from coming out with struggles.,False,False

Seems like he has a serious lack of empathy combined with anger issues going on and OP is an easy outlet for him to project anger and shame onto.  Care is nurturing. It's listening to what the OP's ED is about and then supporting her despite of the ED.  Instead the boyfriend makes assumptions about the ED for himself and then punishes OP for it.  Does he think EDs are a ""serious mental illness"" because he listens and sees OP struggle with it, or because he's seen the media play of: frail anorexic girl dramatically inpatient in hospital and suddenly reemerged from her life or death situation healed?  Feels like the latter since he seems to thinks he can just muscle the ED away with yelling and shaming OP for her actions. ðŸ™„",False,False

It's just making you feel worse, and making *your* personal struggle about *his* anger and how *he* is disappointed.  That's really uncool imo.  You might need to have a serious conversation with him about what kind of support you need, and what he is willing/able to offer.  Maybe you can ask is he is angry with you, and go from there?",False,False
