People just assume that the only way you get to underweight is starving yourself (not wrong) and in the process you will lose your muscles (wrong). I kept my protein high and felt the need to work off my Calories a lot of the time so my muscles stuck around,False,True

While they removed the &lt;15% or 17.5 criteria, it's still an unhealthy low weight. My screwed up brain saw the dsm 4 criteria and used it for GW.   That being said, AN is not the only eating disorder that should be taken seriously. Public perception and insurance companies like to pretend that eating disorders are all about being skeletons. But there's atypical anorexia and other OSFEDs that are just as serious and will affect both mental and physical health. Eating disorders are a ***mental*** illness that can have physical manifestations. Just like any other mental illness, the severity isn't necessarily obvious physically.",False,True

Honestly I love seeing muscular women.... but I just want to be small and dainty looking? It probably has something to do with that being the exact opposite of what I am because I just don't want to like what's in the mirror.   It just bothers me that underweight with muscles is so often portrayed as #goals and still healthy.,False,True
