I avoid going out with them simply because I think I look like an embarassement next to them. It breaks my heart when they donâ€™t know why I donâ€™t wanna hang out but if I tell them Iâ€™m afraid theyâ€™ll think that Iâ€™m envious or something while Iâ€™m literally just ashamed of myself.,False,False

Like yeah, it sucks so bad when I see someone whoâ€™s a lot skinnier than me and itâ€™s quite triggering, but itâ€™s also like eh, Iâ€™m not gonna be able to get there for ages. But when itâ€™s someone whoâ€™s JUST skinnier than you, especially if youâ€™re gonna be seeing them on a regular basis, itâ€™s like oh my god I would do anything to yeet this weight off as fast as I can so I can be skinnier than them now ðŸ˜©",False,False

Sometimes I wish I lived in space so my space suit would be the same size as everyone else's and all would be well but then I'd just be obsessed with getting *â€¢Â°~ visible cheekbones~Â°â€¢* inside my stupid space helmet.
