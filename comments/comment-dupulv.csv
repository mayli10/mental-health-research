I find Juul very convenient but expensive. When I first switched, I probably used a pod every two days. When I lived in Florida a 4 pack was $12. Now that i live in San Francisco (where it's banned LOL) I have to drive to the nearest city which sells them for nearly $30.   I find starting at around 3-5mg nic is usually a good place to start if you have already started smoking. Then you can start gradually weening off of them and get to zero.",False,False

Most people who gain weight probably do so because they eat more instead. If itâ€™s any consolation when my aunt quit she actually lost weight cos every time she went to buy fags she bought crisps too, lol.",False,False

I used to smoke this very specific pack of cigs that were like $11 a pack (idk I feel like that's very expensive LOL). I switched to Juul, however, I get really short breaths with them and I'm more into smoking because it's sometime for my mouth to do. You only need a couple of puffs with Juul to get what you get with a cig, so the oral fixation trick with Juul wasn't doing it for me.  Not sure where you are, but CBD and caffeine (I prefer matcha or natural energy drinks like Yerba Mate) gives me that non-anxious feeling of cigs. You can get a vape pen, tincture, or edibles. It makes you more chill without the high.",False,False

(Not sure whether i remembered it right tho)  But i think most ppl gain cause they try to distract themselves with food (cause they've got extra time). Maybe try to replace it with diet soda?
