Glad you’ve found something that works and isn’t miserable af! Well done you :))",False,False

Usually everything makes me feel like, unbearably full for hours on end but this is just a glass of almost-liquid so I don't get that heavy/pukey feeling that so often follows a meal. I drink it at night before bed so I don't really have to worry about it interfering with following meals, either. It's particularly nice because I don't wake up starving and consequently kick off my day with a b/p session. I'm not sure how it would play out at a different time tbh but that's what works for me :) anyhow, I'm delighted to have supplied something possibly more pleasant than straight olive oil!

I was put on smoothies a month ago and I found I lost even more weight as I intuitively ate less chocolate. My smoothies were pure fruits though maybe that’s not enough... ice cream is definitely a really good energy dense food.  Some days I find this constant over-intuition eating more of a chore than other days. I haven’t resorted to it yet, but I have a backup plan I’ve given serious consideration to... drinking a shot of olive oil! If I get desperate I will try this, and report how it went down but I think I’d prefer to try yours as a second to last resort ;) yours sounds much more appealing! :))",False,False
