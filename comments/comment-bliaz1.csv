I got dry hair/skin a few months in, but that was mainly because dairy and eggs were my main source of dietary fat and now I eat some walnuts and an omega3 supplement and that has completely gone away  Also, TMI: I smell better. I didn’t smell bad at all before, but from my breath, to my sweat, to my vagina it all smells less strong and, according to the SO, cleaner and “sweeter” than before. I don’t know if this is just from dairy because I also cut out most processed foods at the same time, but it’s a dope side effect",False,False
