You can't choose what anyone picks as models. Barbie IS meant to represent a nice body. From the history of Barbie's creation:  &gt;The doll was marketed as a ""Teen-age Fashion Model""...  Also, many artists and other events are centered around Barbie so she definitely has an influence outside of being a doll and children and easily-influenced people are likely to be interested in the topic and pick something they want to emulate about the doll. It could be the blond hair. The pink clothes. Or the body figure.",False,False
