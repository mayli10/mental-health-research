This is such a big one for me! I get into the mindset of thinking ""Oh, you've fucked up today. Might as well go eat everything you've ever craved now because you're gonna have to restrict for weeks to work this off"". The finality of it all is what makes me binge. Now, I try to end it and tell myself if I really want that cookie, I can go buy one (1) single serving tomorrow instead. I also try to be kind to myself, and focus on how proud I am of myself for stopping, versus how disappointed I am for starting to binge in the first place. It's still really hard but believing that I can actually still have a treat the next day, instead of thinking this is the last time I'll eat anything enjoyable for weeks, has really helped",False,False
