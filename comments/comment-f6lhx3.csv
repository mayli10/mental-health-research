I remember getting irrationally angry when my friend came out of our clinic at school behind me and prevented me from body checking myself in the reflective windows.   And I’m so obsessed with measuring the diameter of every body part lately, like I carry a tape measure with me everywhere 🤦🏽‍♀️  It’s so debilitating sometimes, I get panicky if I don’t measure myself before and after drinking coffee or something. God forbid I actually poop one day and I’m at school and don’t have a tape measure or mirror or something to check my self on",False,False
