I think it's normal. Body's in shock or something.  Elevated heart rate doesn't sound too abnormal or concerning, but if it is higher than when you exercise or it persists for longer than you feel it should, go to a doctor's. Don't need to tell them what exactly you were doing, but make sure your heart is ok.   (The chest hurting might be heartburn as well. From, you know, trying to purge.)",False,False
