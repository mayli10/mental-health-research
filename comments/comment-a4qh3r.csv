One time I had mono so bad I threw up and all the blood vessels in my face popped. Went to school through the whole thing.   She also has no idea how to deal with my depression. One time we were fighting and the end of the argument was her aggressively bumping past me and being like ""this is because you're bipolar like your FATHER"" and also acts like she has no idea how degrading it is when she asks ""have you had your meds today"" like jfc.   I guess this is a long way to say.... Just because your parent is in the medical field doesn't mean that they have a single clue about mental health. ",False,False

My mom's super weird about it, and makes all kinds of weird comments too. I swear, she has the memory of a goldfish because she just does not remember anything about problems that she didn't ""fix.""
