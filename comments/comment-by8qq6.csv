Shit then up properly. People suck. Jealous people suck more. Acknowledge, move on. Nothing else you can do!",False,False

I hope you can push their worthless opinions away from your mind because people like that do not deserve your time. Best wishes my dearðŸ’˜ðŸ’˜ðŸ’˜,False,False

Honestly that's very inappropriate for someone to just pick you up and they also need to find something else to do than to keep talking about you.,False,False

I'd complain to HR. I'd be upset too.  Your colleagues mostly sound jealous.,False,False

I've been there.   What I'd do is have a word with your manager, if they're the cool kind, otherwise get in touch with HR.  Other than that there's nothing you can do really. People will be shitty if you're too fat or too thin, which blows my fucking mind - maybe it's hidden jealousy on their part?  I have an asian coworker who's BMI is aroung 14.5 - I know for a fact she doesn't have an eating disorder. Just eats a bit less than most people. Over a lifetime though, that makes all the difference. She tells me about all the shit people (think they) say behind her back and am mortified for her - she's gonna quit soon because of this utterly toxic environment.  I don't know anything about your work situation, but it's up to you to check the pros and cons of staying where you are.",False,False
