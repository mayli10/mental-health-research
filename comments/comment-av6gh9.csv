When you go regularly and then stop, your muscle can start to feel tight, joints might ache, and if you use it for stress relief that stress can build up. So if you think youâ€™ve been bitchy to him, apologize and say your source of stress relief is the gym and youâ€™ve just missed going with him, and that you understand his reasons. Make sure he knows youâ€™re not bitchy AT HIM but at the situation.   You donâ€™t have to tell him about the ED if you donâ€™t want to, because itâ€™s so common for gym folks to feel this way! But you can still own up to being mean if you have been.   Also.... body weight fitness in the living room? So you donâ€™t have to do NOTHING and stress about it ",False,False
