People tend to just think about themselves and going vegan really made me see my family in a new light to say the least. I think they understand that I care about animals but they really don‚Äôt listen or take things in.",False,False

They‚Äôve accepted (though it took years) that i‚Äôm never going to eat meat again, but still try to feed me cheese and butter. It‚Äôs so frustrating. Being vegan isn‚Äôt preventing me from gaining weight, it‚Äôs my crippling anxiety around food...Anyway, i hope things get better! and good for you for sticking by your values. Not having parental support can be really difficult, especially if it‚Äôs a triggering part of your life like your diet",False,False

Told me she was gonna force feed me meat. Needless to say, that shit was fucking traumatising. The next day she told me she only blew up because she didn't want me to get an eating disorder. She was about 6 years too late with that worry. Being vegan does not inherintly equal being skinny, I wish people would understand that.",False,False

I know she‚Äôs just ‚Äú‚Äùconcerned‚Äù‚Äù about my health but It‚Äôs so triggering to the point I‚Äôve decided to start switching towards a fully raw vegan because I can‚Äôt eat tofu or anything that used to be a safe food for me without crying anymore. And they can‚Äôt b*tch about how unhealthy my food is when I‚Äôm only eating raw salad 24/7 lmaoü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è And yeah I know raw vegan diet is terrible for you and I‚Äôm kinda just hoping it kills me TBH. ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è,False,False
