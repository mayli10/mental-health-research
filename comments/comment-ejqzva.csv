It kept up forever, until i snapped in the last year of highschool into a year long binge and gained like 25 pounds. then I decided that they were right all along and let myself spiral.

The birth order is boy, me, boy, boy, boy, &amp; the last 5 kids are girls so I was raised as the only girl until I was about 11 or 12 and my mom used me as like her little mini me/dress up doll and centered most of my childhood around this. I had SO many clothes and she would dress me up really cute for school everyday or just to parade me around somewhere to get compliments. One day while we were hanging out and I was around 8 she said that I was her favorite kid and she count always count on me to just be quiet and look pretty (I have always been very shy/quiet and it was much worse when I was a kid, people literally thought I was mute but I just had anxiety) &amp; basically that’s when I started hyper-focusing on what I look like all the time and it snowballed into an eating disorder. I got scouted to model when I was like 15 and she was more excited/involved in that than she ever was with my school even though I was an honor roll student every semester. I’ve never bought it up to her because she would probably feel bad but I was reduced to my looks as a kid all the time and it still fucks with me. I noticed she hasn’t repeated this with my sisters though so that’s good.",False,False

Never taking about anything deep. Even now. Everything is a joke. They’re religious and dislike gay people and everything no conservative. I’m worried I’m not straight (in my 20s and only just considering it lmao) but can’t really afford myself the time to figure it out because my parents would never accept it, and I live with them again right now. We have no other family here (we moved countries when I was 12) so I have to live here atm.   My dad being overweight like me, but my mum and brother’s being very thin. My mum never mentioned my weight, but would comment of my eating and lack of movement and would insult dads weight often. My dad doing disored/extreme diets my whole life. My Mum constantly calling me over sensitive when I’d get upset and telling me how much harder I am to raise than my brothers. My dad having anger issues and a very short temper, resulting in many fights with my brothers who are similar to him. Smacking as punishment, but when he lost control he would smack a lot harder and for longer until Mum stopped him. My parents constantly having phases of not talking. I’ve always had anxiety, even as a child, and my mum would find it hilarious to mess with me by her pretending to faint, pretending to not know who I am and that I’d have to leave, telling me if I didn’t go to sleep immediately people would come and take me away etc. My dad constantly listening to conservative and religious speakers about a woman’s place and how toxic feminism is (I’m his only daughter, so I can’t help but think he thinks less of me than my brothers).   Sorry lmao I’m in therapy right now and literally just started thinking of these instances to discuss, so this post kinda triggered an unload lmao.",False,False
