Youre on the right page but if I were you, Id stick to sweet potato as the other comment said as its much lower carbs etc. Youll also get the same pumpkin consistency if you use the beauregard/orange variety as opposed to the red one (which is more floury/potato like)",False,False

If you do go pumpkin make SURE you use a pie pumpkin, not just any pumpkin. You have to roast it and peel it and all these steps.  I use Martha Stuart's recipe for pumpkin pie spice because it has things like allspice and ginger that are necessary.  The main calorie bomb is the crust. If you dont want to do the crust it basically just means eating baby food - the texture of just pie filling and nothing else is not appealing.  Theres also pumpkin pie bars so you could have a small part yourself then shove the rest off on friends/family.",False,False
