I still got paid and he said he had a great time, but  made the comment that I looked the opposite. He said I looked SMALLER than my pictures??? So I mean, it was nice to hear but he didn't wan to see me again because of it. :(",False,False

It's their bullshit way of trying to make themselves feel superior to me. And I've totally let it get to me before but its toxic and I have to release that shit.  You are a dope ass queen. You are strong, powerful, disciplined, and hot as fuck. That's why you can get away with the occasional indulgence.   Keep on.",False,False

I'm allowing myself to say it in such a straightforward way only because I have the exact same mindset as you do.   You do realize, on an intellectual level, you have absolutely no reason to feel this way, right (although that's pretty much the whole story of EDs). Also, being familiar with sex work clients myself, he was most likely saying this to either nag you or feel better about himself, somehow, or both.  I'm sure you're hot as hell, and it doesn't matter regardless. The Pizza Hut is not because of this stranger but because of your inner turmoil and interpretation of things. Please stay strong, and I hope the pizza was at least tasty. Here in Israel Pizza Hut has been my favorite place in the world as a child, but in the last decade they changed something and it SUCKS.   &amp;#x200B;",False,False

Some awful people get off on making other people insecure. Either to feel superior or in the hopes that you‚Äôll try to win them over. I know that must have felt awful but I hope you don‚Äôt let it take up space in your mind too long. There‚Äôs no other reason he would have said that then to try to make you feel badly.

I guess we just have to assume this will happen a few times.  It‚Äôs just never, ever happened to me before even on vanilla dating sites and he paid for the room, paid me and Ubered me both ways ($80) and even said he had a great time only to make that comment after?
