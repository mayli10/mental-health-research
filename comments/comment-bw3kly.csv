We started with the structured CBT approach which was what I needed at the time, but the structure has changed over time and at present time, we work on what I bring in to sessions. When I'm getting worse, she often gently challenges me and pushes me into the direction of recovery. She's also been tough on me and referred me to inpatient when I wasn't capable as continuing on as an outpatient. I honestly don't think I'd be here today without my psychologist.",False,False

I found that more structured stuff like CBT didn't really seem to ""stick"" for me - I find it really annoying to keep recording stuff throughout the day - so the therapist I'm seeing right now does mindfulness-based therapy. In session, I usually ramble for an hour about whatever's stressing me out that week - sometimes it's food, sometimes it's work/school/relationships, and my therapist usually shares some insight into how I can deal with the situation, both in the short term and the long term. With food, I appreciate that my therapist understands that I'm not going to go from restriction to healthy eating overnight, so she usually helps me identify triggers and helps me find ways to eat a little bit more + take care of myself better. I would definitely give it a shot if you can afford it.  Feel free to DM me about it if you have more specific q's!",False,False
