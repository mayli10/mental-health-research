But the number of people offering advice on how to further things wasn't the majority. I wouldn't be here if they were. I was subscribed to r/bingeeatingdisorder first for a while before I happened to see r/proed, and thought ""pro ED huh must be one of those pro-ana communities i hear about"" and checked it out and read stuff because, well, it was relateable even though it's super different from my experience, and in doing so I realized how supportive and loving and caring it was.  but of course not every thread is the same - people have different viewpoints and are all at different stages of their path. personally i believe it's really important to let everyone say anything, because otherwise it sort of loses the point of being a ""you can say anything here and we won't judge"" space, but i acknowledge this means people can post unhealthy things, and be met with support for that as well. (just as when they post healthy things they're supported. they're supported either way.)  but it's different for everyone, and if being around that kind of stuff is bad for a person, then they can absolutely make the choice to not be around it. which is another thing i liked about r/proed because if someone ever said ""i can't be around this, i've gotta go"", the only responses were ""awesome, that's understandable, you do you""",False,False

Hell, that helped me when I was really sick. I do have a problem with people offering advice on how to further them. There's absolutely no reason to do that, in my opinion.

I understand all the misunderstandings that went down and I think the thread got a little out of hand. I’d rather that the people just explain it was a support community than resort to getting fighty haha.

I made that statement and I was under the impression that the r/proed subreddit was promoting disorders. I didn't know anything about it and should have taken the time to research it.    I've had my own issues with eds and my first instinct was to protect myself and OP from the subreddit, hence my comment. I didn't mean to offend anyone and if my comment played a part in getting your subreddit shut down, I'm so, so sorry. ",False,False
