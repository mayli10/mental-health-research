I am just coming to terms with this as my trigger, it‚Äôs so bad once I‚Äôm full once, I‚Äôll just KEEP eating different things and keep stuffing myself all day üò≠ it‚Äôs hard because my boyfriend keeps telling me to eat breakfast and to eat normal healthy balanced meals and that will stop my snacking, but I‚Äôm afraid that that method of being healthy just won‚Äôt work for me because of my impulses! So basically today I‚Äôm back to skipping breakfast(and possibly lunch). I‚Äôm actually glad I‚Äôm not alone in this, I‚Äôm just sorry u deal with it too. Curse my never ending expanding stomach üò≠ ",False,False

I love fasting. I am very much an all or nothing person. When I eat anything I start chasing more of the good feeling... and when I stop feeling the hunger (which I LOVE) I feel like shit and mind switches to well you're not going to eat again for a while so might as well make it worth it. And then I binge until I literally hurt and feel sick physically (and I don't purge so I get to feel this bad for a long time).,False,False
