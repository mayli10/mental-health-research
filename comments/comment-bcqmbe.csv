Like, from ages 16-20, I had little to no ability to feel full.  I tried recovering, and after several months in that phase, it came back!  I've relapsed since then, but I've retained the ability to get full. Trying not to fuck that up this time..because it sucks not knowing when to stop bingeing and only stopping because you can literally feel pressure from new stretch marks forming. I guess I'm lucky at least my skin's baroreceptors were still intact.",False,False

I keep going until either thereâ€™s nothing left or I get disgusted with what Iâ€™m doing and physically distance myself from whatever I was eating. Iâ€™d love for clear queues again. I donâ€™t know how Iâ€™ll ever recover,False,False

I can keep eating until I burst probably. When I purge it Iâ€™m still hungry after and want more and more. If I start a binge with turkey breast or some protein bars, (like 19-30 grams of protein each), the binge is FAR less substantial.   I even like to eat a protein bar after a big b/p session because it keeps me from going crazy again. I did a thing with eating two 25 cal each turkey slices in the morning after I first woke up and that also helped keep the mental/physical need to binge at bay. Upping your protein intake might help!",False,False

I lost the feeling of being full. I went to the store and bought 2 whole pies (never buy a key lime pie with the intention to purge it lol), a gallon of ice cream, and a frozen pizza and ate nearly everything. Like, howâ€™s that even possible? To fit that much food into a human stomach????  Thereâ€™s no such thing as satisfaction anymore. Itâ€™s either empty and hungry or in physical pain from eating so much although your mind says otherwise.  My brain and stomach have finally started communicating again (ish) after a few weeks of 32-38 hour fasts. Not that this is a healthy coping mechanism, but it might help you.",False,False
