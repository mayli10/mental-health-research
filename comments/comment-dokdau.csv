I was scrolling through my old Tumblr posts and found some old selfies - some from when I was a low healthy weight and some more from when I was underweight. I haven't taken a selfie in years now because I can't stand how I look now. The contrast made me want to cry.,False,False

I miss them constantly and wish I could have them back but at the same time I know they were horribly triggering for me. That’s sort of why I want them back sometimes...it’s so hard but we need to just let go.,False,False
