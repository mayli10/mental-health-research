Husband sees me naked on the regular and it takes a big drop for him to notice. But if I lose 5 before visiting friends and family (2-3x a year), they definitly notice and mention it.  And yessss.

The people I'm around every day (including me, lol) don't notice, but when I go home every few months to see family and high school friends they definitely do.
