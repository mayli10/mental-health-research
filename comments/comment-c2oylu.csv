He’s not going to judge you or anything. He’s there to help you. Imagine how awesome it will feel to get it off your chest. Opening up and being vulnerable is extremely difficult but essential in therapy. All you need is ten seconds of courage to tell him. Alternatively you could perhaps email him if telling him in person is too difficult but you’ll also still have to talk about it eventually. I believe in you and best of luck :),False,False
