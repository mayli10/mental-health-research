During college I lived in an older inner city apartment with roaches that’s came out if I left any food overnight.  I highly recommend Advion Roach Bait Gel  (check on amazon or just google it).  I tried the bug spray and it always felt so gross to leave bug spray residue on my furniture.,False,False

Also since you can’t spray poison try spraying windex, that suffocates them. I live in an area that has a lot of roaches &amp; those are some tips pest control gave me.",False,False

Hopefully your drunk-guy-down-the-hall is more put together than mine because his peeing and sleeping in the hall at the absolute most random of times is not helping the problem lol. Asking your SO to dispose of them is a safer route for sure, though. I don't have pets to worry about so I can thankfully use my trusty Raid.",False,False

I'm in the same boat.   It sounds bad but honestly I'll probably ask my SO to dispose of the traps if I buy them since he's less afraid of them than me,False,True

I live in a big apartment complex so it's impossible to fully rid my place of them since there will always be that one person on your floor whose place is an utter mess, i.e. the drunk guy down the hall from me. I can never make food after seeing one either because I'm so phobic with anything bug related.   By the way, as a pro tip, try to make meals in the daytime or at least not late at night. I notice that roaches usually come out the most past midnight, at least they do where I stay, so I try to make my actual meals before that time despite being a night owl. Oh, and have you considered a natural repellent since you said you had pets? I'm not sure what kind would work but there's got to be some. You could also bait them with the roach motels but then you'd have to actually *dispose* of them. Ack. I don't even want to imagine what would happen if it falls while trying to get rid of it.",False,False

I wish they would just live their roach lives outside! I highly recommend spraying and placing roach bait traps. It can keep them at bay for months.,False,False
