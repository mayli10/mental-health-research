But in terms of calorie content it's not enough to gain weight, so you'll be fine once it's out of your system.",False,False

You will burn more calories, but the food will still be inside of you. Just try to remember that this is not your actual weight. It is artificially skewed after eating a larger volume of food than usual.",False,False

The lowest BMR I've seen for someone was around 1200 calories and then you also burn more calories throughout the day, so you probably burn around 1400 minimum in a day. You need an excess of 3500 calories to gain 1 lb. You maybe have an excess of 200 calories. It's just food and water still in your body that hasn't been removed yet.",False,False
