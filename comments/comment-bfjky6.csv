Honestly I think beans are good just with hot sauce or hot sauce and bbq sauce. heated of course lol. you can also just make it into a chili lol  cup ramen is safe for me. i've never eaten more than one cup ramen at a time, i guess that's why? plus you can throw in some veggies while it cooks.  fruit, yogurt, oatmeal... those are all restriction type foods, but a meal of those can vary a ton in calories so it'll be good for getting in some extra nutrients and fiber and stuff  eggs? like scrambled eggs? sometimes the calories of multiple eggs bothers me but it's quite nutritious and tasty. honestly in my opinion, scrambled eggs is the epitome of a food that straddles the restriction-food and normal-eating-food for me hahaha but maybe that's weird  tuna salad. i'm crazy about tuna so this probably won't resonate with anyone else lol but you can keep it pretty low cal by using light mayo or miracle whip. just a spoonful for a can will make the texture a whole lot nicer. and you can add some veggies in there too mmmm really good on bread or crackers but i just eat it straight out of the bowl haha  that's what comes to mind",False,False

If your fam has a big dinner like mine, I always go for the green bean casserole, sweet potato, mashed potatoes, and jello salad (I think this is a weird midwest thing, it's basically cool whip with fruit cocktail in it, lumpy but tasty). I skip the easter ham because I'm vegetarian but that's a good middle ground between healthy and unhealthy I think.",False,False
