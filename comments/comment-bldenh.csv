I’m glad you shared. I don’t know the details of your life and what you’re going through but I’m sorry that you’ve reached a point where you feel like suicide is the best option. I’m not going to say I understand how you feel because I’ve personally never experienced being suicidal. However, it seems like a lot of people who attempt suicide and live are often very greatful in later years that they are still around.   There are some great communities on reddit, including this one, full of people who have been at the point where you are. If you haven’t already I think it could be helpful to talk to those people. Also phoning a suicide hotline in your area to talk it all could be helpful. It’s not up to me to tell you that you should stick around because as I said, I don’t know your life or what you’ve been through. But as another person as commented, suicide is a permanent solution to a temporary problem. Each day and each hour that you’re still here may be bringing you closer to the point where things start to turn around. Hang in there and be proud of yourself for each moment that you’ve made it through when you really thought you couldn’t or wouldn’t at the time. ❤️❤️",False,False

So basically as long as I lose enough fat ASAP I'm not really too worried about my health. (Sorry to put this on you out of nowhere, I know you didn't ask!

I’m not sure the exact timeframe but I usually give it around a week. Weigh yourself everyday if you must but understand that the weights you get will not be reflective of actual fat lost. If you have to weigh every day then choose one day, for example a Monday, to count as the ‘official’ weight for that week. Minor daily fluctuations can happen for a bunch of different reasons and will only stress you out. Sounds like they already have.  31 days is an incredibly long time and I seriously urge you to reconsider. Refeeding syndrome is serious, dangerous, and can be deadly. It takes as little as 3 days of fasting to put you at risk of refeeding syndrome. When the effects of refeeding syndrome occur the individual usually does not have enough time to get to a hospital as it happens so quickly.   Please at least check the fasting sub for harm minimisation tips, like what minerals to make sure you’re consuming.  If you’re trying to achieve a certain amount of weight loss by a certain date please also reconsider your goals. I don’t know what your current weight is but you’re much better off eating real food and just eating at a deficient and accepting that you’ll be at a higher weight at that time. You can lose the rest later, it doesn’t have to be a race. Especially as there is a high risk of something going wrong within those 31 days of water fasting that will stop you from reaching your weight goal anyway. You don’t need to be this extreme x",False,False

Even if you were obese, fasting for an entire month will deprive you of critical minerals that are necessary for your heart to contract. It’s not the lack of energy that kills people who starve for a prolonged period it’s usually that their heart stops. You likely won’t be able to supplement these in correct quantities  with just vitamin/mineral pills and gummies.   I have been tempted to do things like this before but please, I hope you reconsider. Fasts beyond a few days usually require doctor supervision.   Be safe ❤️",False,False
