I made a [playlist](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/0wkJUfzdiSfb0PDzWESBrW?si=vZKgiqVZQ4yRdt5pEuKUeA) of all the recommendations I found including all the songs from the [Body + Mind playlist](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/2ylqlTV68q0Wap4d9Kpi0J?si=OFvwZbweTl679gI0ygt8NA) from the previous sub. It's collaborative so if anyone wants to add to it they can. This [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/anamiamusic) has a real mix too.,False,False
