If you have 12 monthly goals to go the entire month without weighing yourself, then slipping up a few times isn't a big deal, since you get a fresh start every month. Even setting week-long goals is a great idea with successes worth celebrating.  Take care of yourself and set yourself up to succeed. ‚ù§Ô∏è",False,False
