But I look in the mirror and just... ugh. I'm huge now. I feel embarrassed around other people, especially ones that knew me at my smallest. I am very lucky that no one really said anything when I got fat, but I know they noticed.",False,False

I was anorexic for a decade, then I was at a healthy weight (and totally hot) for a couple years. Now I am... I dunno, I say fat, maybe one person has said chubby, everyone else seems to think I weigh less than I do. But I am 20lbs overweight. I lost ten pounds twice and then gained it back. I dunno. It sucks. I have to do so much to lose weight, like I have to pretty much channel my anorexia and stop eating, but as soon as I loosen up a little I get fat again. Part of me wants to just give up, part of me wants to start doing meth so I can stop eating lol.",False,False
