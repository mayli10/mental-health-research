I ended up binging anyway lmao (go me: every day since last Tuesday) so it honestly doesn’t even matter anymore how much I ate. Definitely won’t buy it again to avoid confusion. Thanks a lot!,False,True

I don’t have any real answers behind it other than a lot of the food products are imported and repackaged and I wonder if it’s a translation error? Not sure how shit like that passes labeling laws but my local Dollarama sells bags of nuts and candies with calorie counts that are sometimes up to 50% less than the actual calories of the product in another brand.  Jasmine rice (like most other rices) is around 160 calories for a 1/4 cup dry which swells up to about 3/4 cup when it’s cooked.  The nutritional information on your pack of rice is clearly wrong, unless it’s some sort of weird low carb konjac and rice mix but then the ingredients would list more than just rice.",False,False
