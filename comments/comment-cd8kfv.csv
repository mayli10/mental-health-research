Iâ€™ve had so many dreams about binging (and not being able to purge after) that when I do binge, it honestly feels like I am in a dream. And I donâ€™t know where all my food goes, and I then hope it is a dream and try to snap out of it. Itâ€™s like I am watching myself binge as if t is a dream. But there I am, sitting on the floor bloated and feeling like crap and feeling miserable knowing that it wasnâ€™t a dream I could just wake up from.",False,False

During a couple months of very low restricting I was OBSESSED with food and would watch mukbangs, cheat day videos, literally anything with people eating food for hours after class.   Eventually I would get this weird sensation late at night as if I wasnâ€™t in my own body and my perception of feeling was gone. Thatâ€™s when I would go into my kitchen and eat anything I could find. I would walk a mile from my apartment to go to McDonaldâ€™s and stop and get donuts from 7-11 to eat on the way.   As soon as I am beyond full to the point of being sick I come out of it. It was almost like going back into my body once the feeling of being sickly full came on.",False,False

Often during binges I feel like I'm watching someone else use my body and I can't control it. Other times, I'm finding food wrappers of shit I don't remember buying or eating and it just ðŸ˜¬  When it comes to dissociation, grounding techniques might help bring you back to reality. The weird feeling might be the start of the dissociation itself, or the thing that causes your dissociation. Dissociation is usually a coping mechanism the body develops as a response to stress, so knowing your triggers and finding new ways to deal with them will also probably help prevent them in the future!",False,False
