I gained weight on purpose though so I feel like I need to be under an 18 BMI consistently instead of just under 18.5 before I'm actually allowed to say I'm underweight again. You must have been pretty small if you gained 20 lbs and are still underweight at your height. I feel like it probably is just your body dysmorphia. I get that you checked your arm circumference, but shape can cause a huge difference in appearance even at the same circumference. Like for example, my waist circumference was the same 15 lbs lower as it was at a minimum healthy weight and yet I look a lot different at each weight. The measurement is the same, but there is a difference in shape.",False,False

I recently gained 20 lbs(and it shows)...in what I would call I reckless relapse....but I think the correct term is healthy recovery. I'm only a couple pounds to normal weight now.,False,True

I feel the same way about my thighs, but when I stand up and touch them it makes me realize that they're actually totally normal. I would imagine it's the same for you with your arms.",False,False
