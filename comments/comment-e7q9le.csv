I’m usually more jittery anyway when I’m stressed, plus our brains need more fuel. Try adding complex carbs and protein to your meals/snacks. It’s what got me through finals in high school.",False,False

I recommend going to workout, then eat a little bit, take a nap, then try studying again (preferably in a library or some place other than your home/apartment). You don’t have to eat a lot, just something to warm your stomach so that your body can get some rest (I find that a tbsp of raw unsweetened nut butter works the best). If you really can’t eat anything then I recommend drinking some warm lemon water or almond milk (30 cal).   The workout will make the sleeping easier.   I hope you find a way to study at least a little bit. Sending well wishes!",False,False
