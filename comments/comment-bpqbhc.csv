It was probably just a poor reaction do to such a rapid change in the amount you ate. You probably also have the flu if you have flu-like symptoms. Like, eating doesn't cause fever and chest congestion unless there was something seriously wrong with what you ate (*and even then I can't see why it would cause chest congestion*). I don't think a laxative will really help. Just try to eat only when you feel hungry. If you feel full don't force yourself to eat more. Take care of the symptoms you have now and hopefully you'll feel better soon. I'm not sure how to bring down a fever, but some cheap cough syrup like Robitussin might help clear your chest or at the very least make breathing a little easier.",False,False

(Or if you don't want to go all the way/if insurance doesn't pay for that you could go online and take one of those symptom quizzes, I mean, I'm sorry I really suck at advice but that's what I would do.)",False,False
