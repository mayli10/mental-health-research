I understand that its hard to trust others when they mention weight, size or shape and you probably don't see it the same way that they do, but I don't think people will be sensitive enough to lie if they think you've gained weight.",False,False

I definitely felt that way for a long time, like my life would completely spiral out of control and I'd gain 200 lbs if I gave that up.  It's really hard to disagree with the disorder, but the reality is that if you eat a reasonable, moderate, healthy amount and exercise in reasonable, moderate, healthy amounts, then you will be (and look like) a reasonable, healthy person. Not overweight, not underweight. It definitely doesn't feel that way at first though. For me, I just kind of had to do it and trust the process, and then eventually as my fears WEREN'T realized, it felt more and more comfortable as I realized I was still ultimately in control of myself and nothing was ruined. But it's definitely a process for sure. And it's difficult to work through if you struggle with binging. But it's possible.  I've been in recovery for a while, and I can totally relate to feeling like that in the past. Take care xx",False,False

I have a hard time trusting what people say because of it.,False,False

I’m not supposed to weigh myself, but when I catch myself in a restrictive phase I often do anyway because it reminds me that I haven’t gained weight (and before when I had gained weight, I could rationalize that it was still a lower-healthy BMI (and reminding myself that I’m the only one who thinks I look fat at a low-healthy BMI).
