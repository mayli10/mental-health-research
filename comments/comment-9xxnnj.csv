The insurance thing is not fun, I‚Äôm so sorry about that.  I have good insurance at the moment because I can stay on my dad‚Äôs til I‚Äôm 26 and he has a good job and didn‚Äôt disown me or anything.(the parent standards are so low for young-ish trans people lol). My ED for sure gives me something to do right now.  I‚Äôm just constantly that meme with the dog in the burning room saying ‚ÄúI‚Äôm fine.‚Äù  Attempting suicide is such a bad idea.  It was actually just the 2 year anniversary of my attempt recently and I just remembered today because I was so occupied with food I didn‚Äôt think about it.  THAT is how good of a distraction ED is( like not good good but holy crap how???). But that was a really bad time and messed up so much that I‚Äôm still recovering from so 0/10 I do not recommend.  If you want to DM me we could talk some.  Sounds like we have a bit in common.",False,False

So I‚Äôm trans and currently my ed is mostly focused on the fact that changing parts of my body takes too much time even on HRT and other parts of my body will not change without surgery.  And that socially transitioning is f*cking hard.  I know that not eating is really bad for you but it‚Äôs the only thing holding me together.  AND I know that not eating is way faster at limiting the appearance of my body being seen as a gender I‚Äôm not.  I was starting to edge into suicidal thoughts right before my ED popped back up but they just went away as time went on because it‚Äôs hard to make time for those when your too busy counting and double counting calories.  That being said it‚Äôs absolutely not what I would recommend for coping with any of the for-mentioned things.  There are way better ways to deal with things in life but it‚Äôs like my old go to at this point and I don‚Äôt want to stop right now because it makes me feel like I‚Äôm in control even if I can‚Äôt be.,False,False
