This is a bit silly, but it works for me: I will buy a paint by number and slowly paint it up to pass time / reduce my stress. It's the only activity that gets rid of my idleness when I can't bring myself to do anything other than lie down / scroll all day waiting for the day to pass. Also, sometimes I will take a walk and make myself focus on the details of my surroundings. Getting out my apartment, away from my room, and in some fresh air can help me 'reset'.",False,False
