I see a bunch of emotionally supportive comments here already so I'm going to offer something practical. You could, if you want to, offer to have your boyfriend take a bunch of pictures of you. Sexy ones, fun ones, silly ones, anything that will make you both feel good. Turn it into a fun photo shoot. Offer to do this as a kind of exposure therapy--you are going to make an effort to review the pictures and only say nice things about yourself. If that sounds really hard to do, let your boyfriend look at them first and let him first describe how great you look. Take the compliment and agree with him, he loves you and wouldn't lie to you but you know FULL WELL that your ED lies to you all the time, keep that in mind to make this whole experience more positive.   Then you get to look at the pictures and tell him about the composition, the lighting, the colors, the general artistry. You could tell him about how his directions for your poses were really good, etc. Really give him the experience of being a photographer, like a professional one. It could be an awesome opportunity for both of you to support each other and for you to reassure both your boyfriend and yourself that you are making a huge effort to be healthy and love yourself.   You could turn this whole thing around. Granted I understand how difficult it is, believe me, I can't stand myself in photos. BUT if you go in with the determination to do this for him, not for yourself, I know you'll get through it. Your description of the love you guys share really makes me believe that you love him more than you hate yourself, and I know you can rock this. ",False,False

It’s hard for me to escape the mindset that it’s a choice that I’m making and not a disorder that I don’t have much control over.  I am trying, and that’s the important thing, even if all I can do for right now is just keep my head above water and fight as hard as I can to not let myself go completely head first into an ocean of disordered thoughts and behaviors.  I have to remind myself I’m not doing it on purpose and the voice in my head telling me I could stop anytime I want does nothing but feed into my disordered thinking.  Thank you for your kind words ❤️ it means a lot to me.",False,True

I had an appointment set up months in advance for an intake session last month but I couldn’t find parking so I was 10 minutes late and they couldn’t see me or reschedule me any earlier than the day after Christmas.  As dumb as it sounds that sent me into an absolute spiral since I was trying so hard just to hold on until then and it all came crashing down in a matter of minutes.  I made the appointment so it’s just another month of waiting.  I feel really broken and worried that even if I see them they won’t be able to fix me.  I don’t know.  Sorry for making this super long reply ",False,True

He's also a photographer, with similar confidence issues. One conversation will never leave me -- we went to Japan together like 2 years ago, right before I fell into my ED hard, when i was at my highest weight. He told me he's kept so many of his pictures from that trip from me because he's afraid of how I'll react to seeing myself.

You're just sick. If eating disorders were something that we could be willed out of or loved out of - either by our own or by others - almost all of us would be recovered already.
