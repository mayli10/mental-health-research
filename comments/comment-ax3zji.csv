I was eating to binge so I asked my husband for the chips he keeps stockpiled in his room. I ate a whole bag and then purged. Mid purge he tried to use the restroom and when I jammed the door with my foot he hollered out ""are you giving my potato chips to the toilet?!?!"" I couldnt help but laugh at how ridiculous it sounded... yet was true. ",False,False

Until he starts cursing or calling you a bitch or other vile names? If he hits?  Or if it just becomes a regular thing to the point where he expects you to just get used to it?   More importantly, can you do the same to him and it not be an issue? These are important questions to ask before you decide to tolerate it or not.   There's plenty of people who do not use that as an excuse to act cruel. So if anything, it's still a choice in how you treat people. ",False,False

It's important that you don't just throw the whole man away - yet.  Dumpling someone for their lack of tenancy is not okay. Set boundaries and be calm in your delivery that this sort of negative towards your disorder is NOT ok.  If he doesn't correct his behavior in the future THEN you should re-evaluate your future with him.   Ladies, stop telling people to dump their SO when slip ups happen. Everyone is human. Be compassionate.",False,False

Sometimes I think wow I guess being on that side might get tiring sometimes but nah, it takes nothing to be sensitive and supportive and sometimes I feel it just gives you a little glimpse into what they're really thinking, for better or worse. Especially considering it's a text so he had to write it out and could easily have deleted it.   You deserve so much more!!!!! ❤️",False,False
