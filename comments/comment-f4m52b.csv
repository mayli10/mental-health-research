My parents are especially bad for this every time I enter the kitchen they are down my neck about it I make anything to eat. I miss living at my own place. That’s why I wait until they go to bed or leave the house to cook it’s the only way I can do it now.,False,False

Literally yesterday I had a trigger like that. I am visiting my mom who lives in another country for a few days now, so I went to the shops and got my favourite candy which I can’t get in Holland (where I currently live). Anyway, I was enjoying (not bingeing!) the candy IN THE OPEN (which is to someone with bulimia is a huge achievement) and, as she decided to clear up the few candy wrappers she commented: “Oh you finally got to the candy didn’t you?”. I replied that I don’t comment on her drinking or her excessive smoking — all those being numbing agents, so if she can stop commenting on my food I would appreciate it.  Then a couple of hours later I realised how hurt I was. That comment was haunting me from my childhood (I’m in my early 30s now). So instead of soothing myself with food, I journaled about my feelings. I started writing angrily, how she and my elder sister are obsessed about dieting, how both are numbing themselves through other means etc etc. How I was right and they were wrong. I was rolling in my fury propelled by my own self-righteousness.  Until I realised that they will never EVER become the loving, understanding adults I needed them to be when I was growing up. They have their own shit and demons to deal with — if I was to expect them to change so I don’t feel hurt, I’ll be waiting until I or they die — and will be ALWAYS placing the onus of my happiness and peace of mind in their hands and their comments, rather than my own reaction to their words.  So, really... I need to be the loving adult I always wanted to have growing up. Such adult that listens and cares for me — which is essentially what I did, when I went journalling: I listened to my anger. I acknowledged its validity. And I sat with it. I didn’t leave or abandon myself, like the adults from my childhood did. But I stayed and listened to my aching soul.  Then I also went and unwrapped each and every candy, and threw away the wrappers, because also there would be no way for my mom to “track” how much I ate of them. And placed the candy in a bowl on display. Heck, I’m in this country twice a year, and I allow myself to enjoy that damn candy in the open for as much as I want. And, I trust the adult in me to support me in case comments from my mom hurt me again. That adult is awesome :)  (In the hindsight, part of me wishes that I didn’t even deliver that comeback on my mom smoking or drinking habits, I think this was less mature of me. But it’s a learning curve. I’m learning everyday)",False,False

Somehow if people make a comment about my food, I'm not allowed to eat it anymore. Then it makes me so irrationally mad.
