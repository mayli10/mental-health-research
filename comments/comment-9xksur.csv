The sub being banned made me feel some negative feels.  First of all, it made me feel grubby.  Subs are banned because they're usually the kind subscribed to by dregs of society.  Now we've been driven underground.  END THE STIGMA?  That does NOT mean end a support network.    The isolation thing hit me more because I don't feel I belong at MPA.  I tried, but there seems to be a kind of hierarchy there and those damn gif signatures did my head in.  Being an older person with an ED, the site was kinda geared towards a younger demographic and I know there was a peer group age-wise place to hang out, but I don't have much in common with people my age.  Sounds like I'm asking for a tailor made forum, but that's what /proED felt like to me.    I was on the verge of actually believing recovery was something I really wanted.  I was sick of feeling sick to death of my ED and sick to death of others sick to death of theirs and I'm all, YEAH FUCK THIS.  I've kind of lost my mojo with that the past few days, but it'll come back.  I can't blame Reddit for this, but ... nah, yes I CAN blame Reddit for this.  There's AA for alcoholics, NA for substance abusers to share their thoughts but NOTHING for those with EDs (not here anyway).    I'm going to stop thinking about it now because it's not going to change anything, but ffs, Reddit admins are a bunch of useless twats.     Weird how after 100 years there're still proED groups on livejournal.  I looked them up and it makes me wonder what happened with the ones who posted in them in 2005.  ",False,False

And ED sufferers are often affected for life. Even people who recover face temptation to relapse and have to battle disordered thinking.
