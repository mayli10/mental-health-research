She said nothing about the health benefits of not being fat, just that girls wouldn't like me. And now I have a girlfriend and wonder literally every single day if  she's lying or she'd like me more if my body fat distribution wasn't a fucking mess.",False,False

My mother will sit around and tell me how I'm too thin and need to eat more all the time.  Cut to yesterday when she was home all day and watched me only eat a banana and three eggs and tell me ""You shouldn't be eating so much if you want to diet you know."" Like are you insane???",False,False
