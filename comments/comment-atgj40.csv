Angel food cake is quite low calorie in comparison to more traditional cakes. . . The ‚Äúnaked cakes‚Äù that keep showing up on wedding Pinterest boards‚Äîthe ones with no frosting at all and a fresh chopped fruit garnish‚Äîmight also be a decent option.  If you‚Äôre not locked down to a very traditional cake option, a stack of petits fours or macarons are ornate enough to look like a birthday treat while each has fewer calories due to their super small size.",False,False

Grated carrot (I typically use 1 medium carrot, but you can add more or less depending on how much you like carrot)  Just mix the flour and soda until it's a cake batter consistency, add carrot and bake like you would a regular cake. I do 160¬∞C (320¬∞F) until cooked (may take around 30 minutes, less for cupcakes)  Comes out to around 1,030 calories in total. Just divide by the number of serves (i.e.- 8 slices of a standard cake is 129cal per piece.)  You can use a boxed cake mix, but that would increase the calories. ",False,False

I usually make a carrot cake with flour, diet ginger beer/ginger ale and grated carrot. You can either use a packet cake mix or self-raising flour. If using flour I generally use around 1.5-2 cups and add as much soda as needed, add in any extras and bake like a normal cake. The thing with using diet sodas is that there are so many possible flavours. I recently found a diet passion fruit soda recently and I can't wait to make a cake with it. Works out to be between 130-150 per piece with self-raising flour, or roughly 90 cal per cupcake (if it makes 12, I've personally never done cupcakes)",False,False
