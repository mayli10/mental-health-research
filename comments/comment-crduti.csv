I dream of being the ""hot girl"" in the office, wearing cute heels and pencil skirts and all that, which isn't even my style at ALL but I feel like if I was skinnier I'd be more confident about dressing nice. I'm in a primarily male-dominated field (well, still in school for it, but didn't even apply for internships or anything bc of lack of confidence WHOOPS) and I feel like, with my current appearance, I'd just be the ""new girl"" that all the hot guys at work make fun of or just ignore. As per usual. :')  &amp;#x200B;  it's times like this when I realize how much this disorder has really taken from me and how I would do anything to go back to being ""normal."" I don't think i'll ever not have these thoughts :(   &amp;#x200B;  Anyway, I'm sure this wasn't really too much of a help or anything but just know that you're not alone. I think if you could muster the courage to apply to a few places maybe it would help build some confidence bc I guarantee that employers probably aren't judging on appearance as much as we are telling ourselves, it's the ed convincing us to overthink everything ðŸ˜’good luck ðŸ’•",False,False
