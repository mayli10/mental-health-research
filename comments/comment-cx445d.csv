[Seed](https://shop.seed.com/products/female-daily-synbiotic)  probiotic is my favorite, but you can find cheaper options at Whole Foods/Amazon/GNC, etc. Fermented foods like kimchi are also a great source of probiotics.   Digestive enzymes and/or Betaine HCL taken before a meal can also aid with digestion and help with bloating, and they’re easy to find at health stores/on Amazon.  You may also want to look into a lectin avoidance diet if you’re having digestive problems... I have severe GI issues &amp; merely following the recommended FODMAPs diet didn’t help me, but getting lectins out of my diet helped my pain and discomfort tremendously.  Both supplementing polyphenols (found in olive oil for example) and adding them to my diet has also helped improve my gut health.",False,False
