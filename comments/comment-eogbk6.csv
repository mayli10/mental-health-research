I really like it. But I don't want it in my pizza. Or my pasta. Or my Chinese food. And I'm basically just mad at good food having calories.

The same way that I like mashed cauliflower for itself, not as a replacement for potatoes.  Riced cauliflower can burn in hell though. Horrible texture.",False,False
