No doctor sees the results.  Go off lax for a few days and then retake the test. They email you the forms so you can take it anytime up to 6 months later, whenever you are ready. There's no appointment needed, you just walk in. Note that early mornings are busy because of fasting tests.i usuallly go after 10am and it's always empty.  I work out excessively, and that can throw test results off big time. When I retake the test after stopping working out, it's always fine.",False,False

Im scared if i see a doctor now, even if i am only trying to figure out this kidney stuff, will become a huge dramatic ordeal. Iâ€™m in my first year of grad school and working a job i truly love and iâ€™m not prepared to put any of that on hold.",False,True
