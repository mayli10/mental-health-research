I told her about everything and she just sent me home with some instructions to get rid of my laxatives and follow up with her on Monday regarding my laxative intake (if any) and fluid intake. She didn’t seem to be phased by my description of not being able to stay warm.   Now my chest hurts, I’m freezing even though I’m in my winter jacket, scarf, two pairs of socks and have been inside for an hour. I don’t know whether or not I should go to the emergency department (it’s literally in the same building as I’m at the hospital).",False,True
