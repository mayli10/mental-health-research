Especially if they occasionally watch you eat 3 plates of food sometimes and go you’re so small! But you have a real appetite! How do you do it?? And I swear sometimes I look at them like they are stupid. Like, Sandra, it’s called b/p, this feels like easy math. Bonus points sometimes I go overboard purging and blood vessels are burst in my eyes after a bathroom break. What do you think is happening? But I also answer with intuitive eating like a giant lying liar.",False,True

I’m sure you looked poised and professional. I’m sure you took part in skilled labor and did things that impacted lives.

I am lucky (cursed) because I work with men who do not notice my eating habits but who comment on my weight very regularly. It keeps me scared to eat at work lol. There are other women in my building and they have often asked how I lose weight, but I try to just tell them “eating intuitively and clean”, as I can tell that they have a healthy relationship with food and wouldn’t want to put any disordered ideas in their pretty heads :( lol.",False,False

I could definitely tell in college pretty easily at the coffee shop I worked at. Maybe everyone was bad at hiding it? Maybe it was closer quarters interaction? But at my office job, everyone is a question mark...change of subject but it’s an office where everyone brings communal cakes and cookies several times a week and it’s rough.",False,True

It makes me wonder who else I may encounter who suffers from the same things I do. Like the totally normal looking and friendly secretary at any business I walk into could have just purged until she was crying in the bathroom and I’d have no idea.,False,False

This morning I literally binged a 1200 calorie breakfast burrito at my desk and purged it in my buildings restroom then popped lax at my desk to keep myself from eating more. All while in pumps, a skirt, cute blouse, and a full face of makeup. ED’s are the most contradicting things ever. I feel like two different people.",False,False
