You could brainstorm plans about things you plan to eat each day in order to give your body energy/vitamins/promote your health/treat yourself, or you could even go as far as pre-prepping meals and carrying them with you etc.  Sometimes when I remember foods and recipes I haven't eaten in a while that are yummy I'll make the step to write them down on a white-board on my fridge and I find that it helps me incorporate variety.     Not sure if this is the type of suggestion you were looking for",False,False

I've been off the prozac for a week now and I already feel sooo much better. I've been eating more regularly and moderately and thats been really good for recovery (no binge restrict cycle, just consistent eating), and it feels good to not be zonked from drugs. I would definitely talk to you doctor and try and get off those meds if they aren't helping you, but again I'm not a professional, and this is just my personal experience....I don't like being on drugs in general haha.
