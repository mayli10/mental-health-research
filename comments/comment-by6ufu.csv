I was put on lexapro, which made me sleep all the goddamn time. Went from sleeping 4-5 hours a whole day+ night to sleeping 10-12 every day without fail. Then put on prozac, which made me nauseous, and i lost maybe 10 pounds in a month?? Enough for the doc to switch me to zoloft. Which made me dizzy af all the time where i had to stop doing regular activities like running or driving a car. Then, got put on paxil, but before my prescription was filled i tried to kill myself. In the hospital they also prescribed paxil, but a higher dose. At first i slept all the time. But it had no affect on my appetite. I was at the time trying to restrict (disordered eating before the eating disorder) and the paxil helped ease the symptoms causing me to be so self loathing as to restrict. I'm still on paxil, but my therapist thinks I need to speak to a doctor about upping the dosage because it has definitely become less effective",False,False
