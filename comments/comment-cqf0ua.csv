I’m sorry you have to deal with the frustration as well! It’s so hard.   It sounds like the other residential program I had my family doctor put in a referral for, should be helpful. Just waiting on them to contact me for an assessment",False,True

Doctors in my area won't even give the names of practices who offer sliding scale rates based on income, bc even with insurance that I've seen the coverage is laughable. It's better than nothing, but what I've had previously was up to $400 a year which covers maybe 3 visits if you're lucky. I don't have resources to share unfortunately, just venting bc I share the frustration. I hope you'll be able to get the help that you need",False,False
