Even back when I was in denial and a part of the fasting sub I couldn’t make sense of what to do bc everyone had different ideas and it felt overwhelming to me so I just go as long as I can without.    (Btw just in case others read this and think so, in no way shape or from am I trying to encourage or look for encouragement. I’m not going eat either way so I just want help not passing out or something. I don’t have health insurance atm so I can’t really afford that)",False,True
