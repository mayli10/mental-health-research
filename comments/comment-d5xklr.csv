Apparently it’s a thing - childhood hypoglycemia, I think? They told my mom it would get better with age, and it definitely has. I’m 28 now.  What it looks like today is that my blood sugar drops quickly and I feel very shaky, nauseas, dizzy, confused, and sweaty. I really think the only reason I am able to restrict is bc I stick with high restriction (900-1000) and I make that as balanced as I can with few simple carbs. I don’t have a choice but to eat a snack sometimes, you know?  Definitely bring it up with your doctor. Hypoglycemia (and chronic low blood sugar) is really uncomfortable and can throw a wrench in your day.  *Im not an MD, lol. So take this as just my personal experience! :)",False,False
