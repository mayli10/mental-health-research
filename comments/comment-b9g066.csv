I thought Iâ€™d kill my self if I ever hit 170, so imagine my heart break when the doctor told me I was 218 and obese.   I found a way to channel that shame into exercise, apparently building muscle is a great way to encourage and sustain weight loss.   It sucks you had to see the scale, and Iâ€™m sorry. The temptation to weigh yourself is insane. But in due time it doesnâ€™t matter where you started, I hope you feel better soon, I support you ðŸ’•",False,False
