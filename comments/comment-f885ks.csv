If you have a mental health issue, even if itâ€™s sub-clinical (meaning that it doesnâ€™t officially meet criteria), it sounds like youâ€™re being negatively affected by all the obsessive eating/food related thoughts and behaviors. If youâ€™re in a place, either in your family or in a community/country, where mental health or specifically eating disorders isnâ€™t acknowledged or discussed, youâ€™re not going to have a ton of access to outside resources. Luckily the internet exists and there ARE lots of resources out there for free. But in order to want to pursue any of that you have to, at least on some level, want a change from where you are now. If youâ€™re not there, thatâ€™s okay too, but then the focus turns more into motivation and whether/why you want or donâ€™t want change.  As an FYI- Iâ€™m a therapist specializing in EDs. I was trained in the US but now live abroad and definitely get the dearth of mental health resources that exist in most areas of the world. Feel free to PM if you ever need to vent more. Iâ€™d be happy to offer feedback.",False,False

Reddit isnâ€™t the place to come for mental health diagnoses, but if your concerned/curious enough about your behaviors to post here, itâ€™s not a bad idea to check in with some who can offer you more guidance and resources.",False,False
