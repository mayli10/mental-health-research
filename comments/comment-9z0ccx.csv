I really didn't understand how I'd gone wrong!   To explain myself, in Canada where I am , starting off with ""look,..."" (unless it's something like ""look at the size of that moose!"") in a conversation like this means you've misinterpreted or offended someone with your response and they're explaining how you done fucked up. I read it like ""look here dummy, you don't know my life"" so I took it a wee bit personally because I didn't understand where I had fucked up in my response.  Thank you for clearing it up. I'm sorry you felt the need to delete your comment. I know now it wasn't meant that way and others obviously had a clearer view of your meaning than I did.  I'm thinking I shouldn't reddit when I've just woken up. I'm extra sensitive when I'm tired and hungry and haven't had coffee. ",False,False
