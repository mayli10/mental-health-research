This girl seriously ate about 8 fast food meals and desserts and drinks. Even if you did it would be 90% water weight. Which goes away much faster. Just watch your salt intake and as weird as it sounds, stay hydrated! You'll bounce back.",False,False

She at about 10,000 calories in one day and gained about 9 lbs (water weight too). It took her 6 days of eating (at maintenance even!), to get back to her starting weight. It opened my eyes a lot. For that day at least.",False,False

I never go out to eat or do things like this anymore so itâ€™s super scary to not count. like Iâ€™ll eat something and itâ€™s as though I can see my body growing larger when I look in the mirror. dysmorphia is just fucked, I guess.

To gain, youâ€™d have to eat 3500 OVER your TDEE. Give it a week until the faux lbs settle.   Iâ€™ve overate/ binged like, 3x this previous week and went up about 3ish pounds but this morning I weighed myself and Iâ€™m back at my LW :) Donâ€™t fret!   Edit: just saw ur stats, your TDEE is pretty high, youâ€™re safe ",False,False
