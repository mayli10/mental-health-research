I was so underweight with my EX and he never noticed me restricting. But when I started dating my now awesome BF I decided to recover/weight restore. He made it pretty clear that he thought I looked very sickly when we met and that I look better now but I can‚Äôt go half a day without eating a full meal without him telling me to eat. It‚Äôs good because I am try to recover but it‚Äôs annoying when I want to restrict again. He has no concept of calories so the only way I can is to eat huge volumes of low cal foods.,False,False
