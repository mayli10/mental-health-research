That “factoid” is based on a single, small study that’s been over-interpreted by journalists.  I’ve read the actual study, and what it *actually* concluded was that there was a broad range of how much food someone could purge, depending on how big the binge was and how effective a purger they were.",False,False

I haven't purged in a few days since I am high restricting to 100-300kcals a day. Which purging not only that ""fact"" scared me, but even sometimes I can't get everything out. I tried flushing 2 times in one day and it works, but damn..it sucks so much.",False,False

Probably made up and propogated by manipulative therapists. It's definitely true that it'd be really hard to get 100% of food out of your stomach, but a large amount can be purged, especially if you're flushing (though flushing makes purging even more dangerous for your health). The biggest 'fact' I see used to try to validate this erroneous statement is that digestion begins in the stomach. And this is, in fact, true. But most people don't understand that digestions is not absorption. Digestion just means that nutrients are being broken down into smaller components, not that nutrients are being absorbed into the bloodstream to be made available to your body. So the stomach does play a large role in digestion, but almost no nutrients are absorbed in the stomach- aside from alcohol. Almost all of the absorption of the body takes place in the small intestine, and food needs to be thoroughly digested before it is emptied into the small intestine. So if you're purging immediately after eating, almost none of that food will have been emptied into the small intestine, and so theoretically almost all of those contents can be purged out of the stomach.",False,False
