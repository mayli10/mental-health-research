It’s sort of weird when it goes away for a second and I think I look nice for once, or at least not completely horrible. Then the next day all I can focus on is the fat on my legs. I notice it’s much worse every time I weigh myself and my weight hasn’t gone down. It’s crazy and irrational because the difference could be 1 lb and I’ll instantly think I look better sometimes. But not every time..",False,False
