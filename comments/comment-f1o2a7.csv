If you’re not a coffee drinker and your restricting hard or have been restricting hard a tea would be better. Best thing you can do now is maybe sip some water. Limit the effects.   Coffee drinkers use coffee when restricting since the caffeine acts like a natural sedative or energy boost. When the body is suffering from hunger pains and hypertension caffeine augments these feelings.   Problem with purging coffee is it’s a hard substance to purge. Its granular. It tends to cling to the sides of the esophagus. Some foods are next to impossible to purge and sometimes after several purges the body lacks the muscle strength to purge. Hence high blood pressure and the nosebleed.  No judgement you had a bad day. With ED’s you get these days. Try go for a walk and reset.   I am 35 years of age. I started my ED in anorexia and then transitioned into bulimia and now I sit somewhere in between. So, take it from me let today pass and don’t be so hard on yourself. Takes time to figure this out. You have a lot to learn. So today be kind rewind and start a new tomorrow.  &amp;#x200B;  Hope this helped.",False,False
