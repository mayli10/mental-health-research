I don't like them watching me cook and i especially don't like them watching me eat.  Absolutely me. I hate people watching me eat because i feel like they will judge me about how much i eat. I like to cook alone mainly because i weigh all my food and i don't want to anyone to see me do it.   I also save most of my calories for the afternoon/dinner and so my dinners are normally high volume. I always think that everyone thinks im a fatass because i eat so much for dinner even though it fits in my calories.",False,False

And, I constantly get comments for eating healthier choices, like skinless grilled chicken, asparagus etc, but a giant bowl of ice cream or chips gets almost no comments. It drives me crazy, because not only do I have to brace myself to eat, but I have to get ready to handle the comments and long, judgemental stares as people hover over my plate, asking what the hell I'm eating. I can't wait until I'm around literally no one ever, lol, just to be free from that.",False,False

If I don't I need to estimate so I need to be real sneaky. Like there's a reason for putting rice in a cup b4 eating,False,False

I had that problem even before I developed my ED. Didn't like roommates commenting on food or seeing me eat. I think my secretive behaviour led to binging and eventually to purging and high restricting. ,False,False
