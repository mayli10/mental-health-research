It is one of my favorite things to do.   &amp;#x200B;  One of the things I found out however was as I lost weight, hiking began to suck a lot because I had zero energy. I would hike, I would get dizzy and close to passing out and then the cravings and the binging would happen. The more you hike, the more energy you will need to keep going and your body is going to force you to eat.  I cut hiking out for a while because I thought it was forcing me to gain weight, when in reality, it was my ED telling me to cut more things out.   &amp;#x200B;  One of my steps in recovery is learning how to hike again and do it not as a goal to lose weight, but to enjoy the actual hiking.   &amp;#x200B;  Please reach out if you need help, or if you want to consider talking to someone about your eating.",False,False
