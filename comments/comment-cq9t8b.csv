I think the distinction between disordered eating and an eating disorder is where it becomes a psychological compulsion and impacts your life. So the more psychologically/mentally you internalise your physical disordered eating, and the more your life starts to revolve around it as a result, the closer it becomes to being an eating disorder.

One time I sobbed my way through a Kraft Blue Box and since I make it with water it's only 750 calories but holy fuck I was so uncomfortable I made myself sick just from the volume. I also was chugging diet cherry dr pepper so that's basically 0 cal but I was so grossly full and hated it but couldn't stop.,False,False

Like, no, you didn't gain fat eating 1200 calories, even if you usually eat a lot less than that. My 8000 calorie binge definitely led to fat gain though. I know it's hard for people who don't normally eat very much to feel like more calories is ok to eat, but it makes me feel really shitty because I'm binging my way to obesity",False,True

Which I know, every person's experience in their eating disorder is completely different- and I'm sure my binges that are 3/4x my TDEE, would feel small to someone else. And I also know binges are more about the mental state- the lack of control, the eating beyond fullness, eating very fast, the works- but I can't help but feel so vastly ""wrong"" at my eating disorder.   But whenever someone posts about a, like, ending the day at 1500 calories after a ""huge"" binge of 600 calories I just remember the time I ate two large pizzas and a half gallon of ice cream myself. After eating two normal meals in the early part of the day. And I could definitely have still eaten more, I just didn't have anymore food in the house ü§°.",False,False
