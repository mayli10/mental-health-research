It all has to do with how you carry the weight.  2) don’t stress too much about developing ortho until you start feeling like you can’t stop and are out of control with how much you exercise and what foods you consume. If having a rest day and a “nonhealthy” food item sends you into a total panic (over exercising, strict dieting etc) then I would start to self check.   Hang in there, recovery looks different for everyone, and you’re on a good path so far :)",False,False
