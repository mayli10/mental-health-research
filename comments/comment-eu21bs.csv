My relapse has been triggered by rapid weight gain which makes it worse. I am fatter than I was when ´´recovered´´ but with the eating disorder mentality. Such a loser, cannot believe I am back at this place again after years. I find it almost impossible to cope but I know that giving in to the anxiety won´t make the weight go away faster so I just need to chill and wait. A few weeks of restriction and exercise and we´ll feel better guys! I´m going to try and find something else to concentrate on, make a plan to follow and just relax. Otherwise, if I obsess too much, I know I´ll binge. Although anything but fasting when in this situation feels weird doesn´t it?",False,False
