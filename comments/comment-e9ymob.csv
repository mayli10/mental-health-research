I just find it so hard to 100% believe. Part of me that’s logical knows you’re right, but another part of me is convinced I’m gonna have this chin forever. Ahh! Haha but thanks for the reassurance :)",False,True

If I'm not mistaken this kind of fat does contribute to your belly size, so I imagine you are seeing a decrease there quicker than in other areas. When you lose enough to stop being considered obese I'm sure that your neck will be much smaller. 100lbs is already so much and you should be very proud of that :) just keep going until you get your weight where it needs to be and everything should fall into place along the way.",False,False
