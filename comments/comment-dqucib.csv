Debby Ryan is a perfectly healthy and normal weight even though she’s not stick thin.",False,False

Some people say ""skinny"" to mean ""thinner than average"" or ""underweight"", and some people say ""skinny"" simply to mean ""not fat/chubby"". So it's not that she's particularly thin, but rather that she's not fat, so she is, by default, skinny. That's the definition/usage I grew up hearing and using - you were either fat or thin, even if you weren't much thinner than average.",False,False

They refer to people who are perfectly average weights as “skinny,” and I honestly think it’s because being overweight has become the norm.  Those people do legitimately look skinny to them by comparison.  I’m also in the states having grown up in a country where thinness is normal, so it’s maybe kind of magnified for me as well.",False,False

I figured that maybe by American standards she was skinny but I looked at her and is like ""That's exactly how I look like..."" If that's skinny in America then maybe I should move.",False,False
