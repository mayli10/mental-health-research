I don’t know if your grandma is aware of your ED, but if she isn’t that could explain why she felt okay with saying that (I’m not saying it’s okay though).  I’m really sorry that this happened to you.  Maybe try learning the recipe so you can cook it for yourself! :)  Cry cry cry it out. Crying is good for you! When you’ve calmed down a bit, you might consider telling your grandmother that her comment hurt you.  Easier said than done, I know, but I have faith in you! You’ll get through this",False,False
