Just because her body is growing weaker does not mean she is getting “worse”.  She will continue to lose weight even if her mental health stays the same. She may continue to lose weight even after her mental health improves and that might be out of her control. If she is telling you you are helping her, you are. It might not show physically, but the way her body looks is a symptom of her disorder, it does not define her disorder. Her “condition getting worse” does not mean she is not continually trying just as hard to get better.  Just please remember that especially long term.   And thank you for being such a good friend by reaching out to find out how best to support her, it’s clear you care deeply and that you’re someone she can trust. Don’t stop listening to her.",False,False
