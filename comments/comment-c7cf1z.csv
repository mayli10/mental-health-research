Have you thought about finding something exciting that takes brain energy after your driver's test? Like a sewing class or painting class or finding a book you've always meant to read? Little stuff like that has helped me stay motivated to \~\~feed my brain.\~\~  Anyway, congratulations and good luck :)",False,False

Give it your height, weight, age, and gender and it will calculate your TDEE.  Longer answer: What TDEE cculators actually do is the following. Given height, weight, and (optionally) age and gender, it first calculates your BMR, basal metabolic rate. That is how many calories your body needs to exist, like if it were bed-ridden and comatose. To get the TDEE, the calculator takes your BMR and multiplies it by an activity level. Sedentary is around 1.2, that's the extra calories burned by a small amount of walking, thinking, that sort of thing. If you are on your feet all day (e.g nurse, waiter) it might be 1.4 or something idk, if you are extremely active the multiplier is even higher. Then TDEE = BMR * activity. You don't actually have to worry about the numbers -- the calculator does it for you -- I just find it interesting. In practice most active calorie obsessed people like to put sedentary, get their TDEE for sedentary, then add in their exercise calories on their own instead of guessing.",False,False
