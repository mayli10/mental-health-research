This one has been frustrating though because I've been stuck in my ""binge period"" for months now and everything I used to do to get myself out of my bingeing hasn't worked yet, so now I feel extra disgusting. :')",False,False

Both the same effect on my weight - steady gain. Sometimes I can manage longer periods of restriction when I lose around 15 lbs or so (which only happens once or twice a year maybe), and then the overeating/bingeing cycle starts again and I gain it all back. I'm in the middle of a longer restriction period at the moment and it's great, but the semester is starting soon so who knows what will happen. I'd be alright with maintenance once the year starts but I know from experience that the amount doesn't matter much - sometimes even fasting is easier than eating in moderation since all I have to do is not eat, vs. stopping once I've started, which is sometimes much harder.",False,False

Avoid the scale until I notice my clothes are getting tighter. Start restricting again, easing back into the extreme restriction and after a few days of this I get the courage to weigh myself and assess the damage of binge mode. And that's it. Rinse and repeat.
