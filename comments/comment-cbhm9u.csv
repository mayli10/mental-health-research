But I also know some people just do it to get reassurance. Just know they probably aren't trying to be malicious to you.,False,False

Body dysmorphia is a bitch.   I’m underweight and very often think I look so fat. I feel like I can feel all of the fat on my body hanging off of me. I feel like my stomach looks huge 99% of the time.   I wouldn’t make these comments in front of other people that are bigger than me for sure. Nor would I post it on social media. But it is definitely possible to think you’re fat when you aren’t.   My SO always says “what do you think about all of these people that are clearly much bigger than you?” Or the other day “how can you feel fat when you’re the skinniest person here?” But it isn’t about anyone else or how anyone else looks. I could think someone 20 lbs heavier than me looks great and still think I look like a pile of lard.",False,False

Body dysmorphia exists and so many people are affected by it. Not saying that she definitely has it but you can never know these things unless you know them personally,False,False

That's why I even said that line. Yes I agree with you, it's sad how society keeps bashing us no matter what we do and as I've grew to become more empathetic with girls and women. But then there are people who dont take the slightest consideration to think about how others feel.",False,True

My coworker keeps talking about how she’s lost weight because she “forgets” to eat, and then was commenting the other day about her “fat” that was showing while she was wearing a crop top and jeans. It was literally just her skin folding slightly when she turned her upper body. Not fat.",False,False

Are you remembering that our culture tells women to put them selves down because if we don’t then we’re seen as vain and stupid? We have to constantly demean ourselves in someway or we are accused of being “full of ourselves.” Just remember that when you see women speaking ill of themselves. We aren’t even allowed to accept it if somebody calls us beautiful, we have to say that’s so sweet of you to say but no it’s not true. If we dont, then we are a bitch. It’s just not easy to be female.",False,False
