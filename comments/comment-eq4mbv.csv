I fear or dislike most doctors, so naturally my reaction is to just stop taking meds, instead of either trying to find better doctors or returning to a previous doctor (all of whom I'm scared of or don't trust). I know how stupid I'm being when I do this, but for some fucking reason I end up doing it anyway, and then two weeks later my body and brain are both having nuclear-level meltdowns and everything is terrible.   idk what I'd do without my gender team tbh, they're the only ones who figured out that I do this shit, and found ways to get insurance to let their GP prescribe my meds.",False,False

I'm recently coming to terms with dealing with my Bipolar disorder and was very responsible with taking my meds initially but I've been wanting to take them less and less lately. Today is the day where I was fully intending on not taking them anymore because I feel *totally fine* so it's like midday now. I still want to skip them but I'm going to take them today, right now, even though it's way later than I usually take them, because you took the time to write an advisory post like this and I'd feel oddly guilty if I didn't so thank you lol.",False,False

""Obviously you know it'll be bad if you quit so why would you ya dumbo?"" Fast forward to me being on like five of em and not refilling em half the time and then getting absolutely wrecked by being dangerously manic for a week or two each time ü§™  Given the type of person I am, I'm really confused as to how I'm able to be as honest as I am in my therapy and psych appointments. I tend to downplay how bad my restriction is (ya bish ain't wanna get residential'd), but with literally everything else I'm able to talk about it without much issue. Come to think of it, a lot of that is probably cause I never engage with my trauma or emotions, so it's really easy to talk about it cause I'm refusing to treat it like it's real.
