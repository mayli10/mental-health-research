Honestly her recovery story is really inspiring to me so I’m sure if I let it motivate me then I could start doing at least a little better.,False,True

Maybe it could be like that with your friend?! When you eat together practice healthy habits even if you don’t on your own. It will probably make you feel better that you’re not doing it alone and will help not to trigger her as well! Best of luck! :),False,False

It will be a lot harder if we end up going to dinner regularly since we both live on campus but at least for today I can focus on being with my friend. Thank you!,False,True

I know it can be really hard but maybe for today treat this as a special day where you get to spend quality time with your friend and try to not focus too hard on the ED behaviors. Just focus on being with them and having a good time. I know it’s a lot easier said than done. But your friend could be vulnerable and also you deserve to have a day where you don’t have to struggle with these things. Even if just for one meal. I am bad at advice but I hope this is at least a teeny bit helpful.",False,False
