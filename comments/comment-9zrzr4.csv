I buy the frozen pre-packed ones in a pack of 10 bags at Costco, and for one microwavable little bag, it's 158 calories and 13 grams of protein.    Also, Enlightened Roasted Broad Bean Crisps.  It's 100 calories and 7 grams of protein in a 1 oz bag.  They're fava beans that come in a few different flavors, my preference being sea salt.  I also recommend Biena Roasted Chickpea Snacks, with 120 calories and 5 grams of protein in a 1/4 cup serving for the cinnamon crunch and honey roasted flavor, and 130 calories and 6 grams of protein in a 1/4 cup serving for the sea salt flavor.  I like getting Costco Quinoa Salad, as a cup serving has 280-296 calories and 12 grams of protein.  It is very healthy with many veggies.  A treat would be the Silk Dairy Free Strawberry Yogurt, with that 5.6 oz container having 130 calories and 6 grams of protein.  But if I'm in a rush, I'll eat a Bhu Fit Cinnamon Apple protein bar with 180 calories and 12 grams of protein, or a Luna Lemon bar, with 190 calories and 8 grams of protein.  It all depends on what you want, I'm on a plant based diet to lose weight, and these are some of my regulars.",False,False

An important compound for hair retention is choline, which you can get in large quantities from eggs (1 egg = 28% DV).  You also need to make sure you get enough lysine, which you can also get from eggs (1 egg = 22% DV).  Lysine is particularly important for people with EDs and for vegetarians, both groups that tend to have low zinc and iron.  Lysine helps you more efficiently absorb zinc and iron, without which (among other things) your hair will become brittle and limp.  Another important ingredient for hair is cysteine, and again, 1 egg will give you 51% of your DV.  Cysteine is one of the things that keratin (hair/nails) is made of, and if you are deficient in it, your hair will grow more slowly, and replacement hairs will grow in at a lower rate.

You can actually mash them up and make them into a mock tuna salad sandwich that is really incredible.  Spinach is a protein powerhouse. One cup of spinach has about the same protein of a hard-boiled egg.   Some other great ones are peas, beans, lentils, and pumpkin seeds.  ðŸ’™",False,False
