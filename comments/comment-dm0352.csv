Whenever I feel my depression start creeping up I get super annoyed but then when my appetite disappears I’m like “I guess this makes up for my shitty mood”,False,False

I’ve sort of been teetering for the past couple months but as of this week I feel like I’m really breaking my recovery once and for all. It’s a sick kind of honeymoon phase. I get weirdly nostalgic about the things I used to do when I was severely restricting for years at a time. I sort of like the sneaking around aspect, too. No one around me knows the things I’ve been doing this week again that I haven’t done in 2 years. It’s like I’m discovering it for the first time again and I don’t want to get better, at least not yet. I sort of want to spiral for a bit.",False,False

At the same time though I told my SO last night that I felt so beautiful and empty and I hated to ruin it by having dinner. Straight up. Plot twist I ate anyway but yes feel validated lol we feel it too I promise.,False,False

I don't get excited, I wish I felt the way I did this summer when my mental health seemed perfect and I was genuinely happy and content. But, I can never be that way again, I've tried. Maybe next year, but for now it's time to starve.",False,False
