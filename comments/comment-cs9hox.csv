I‚Äôm more of a coffee person than tea, but for some reason they‚Äôre just a perfect combination with tea. They‚Äôre good in oatmeal too, or on unsweetened Greek yogurt. They almost always have them at TJ maxx/ homegoods/ Marshals if you want to save some money or just don‚Äôt want to order them online, but obv they have limited flavors available.",False,False

I'm a Starbucks barista, and I've found that using half the pumps of sweetener plus replacing half of the milk with water still tastes yummy! You could also get just like 1 pump of flavor and then ask for a couple of stevia packets to still get the sweetness in there as well, if you like",False,False
