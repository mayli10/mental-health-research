Definitely get your blood sugar level checked OP.   How much are you eating/restricting?,False,False

(Note: Not a doctor) I know this is difficult advice to follow because of what subreddit were in, but it sounds like you're dealing with low blood sugar (maybe even low iron) that can be abated by upping your calorie/carb intake.   I think exercise is a great way to keep your body and mind active and healthy, but an eating disorder makes it all a lot more complicated if you're operating at a significant deficit all the time :c   The frequent urination and blurry vision sound really concerning, and I really think seeing a doctor is wise.   Also, are you feeling these same symptoms when doing other types of exercise like cardio? Or even maybe lighter activities like yoga? If you experience the exhaustion/ vision issues solely from weightlifting I might attribute it to some issues with blood pressure, possibly.",False,False
