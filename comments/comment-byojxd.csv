You don’t really know what ur doing, you want to do things as quickly as possible, you just feel like you want to get things over with. I think you eventually just start thinking more long term and practical after you’ve “tried” things that didn’t work. We see a lot of fit ppl coming out about their experiences with eating disorders so I think this is a good answer",False,False

I exercise and I don't focus on how many calories I'm burning while doing it.  Tbh I can't perceive exercise as something completely ""omg it's so funnn!!""—ie, I don't think I would do something intensely physical such as hiking in my free time. And I'm not really into sports.  If I got down to the root of it, I exercise because of my ED. I'm in a sort of weird harm-reduction state where it's hard for me to feel like I deserve to eat. I feel worried about my calorie burn if I don't exercise, and it stresses me out to have a different TDEE every day, so I exercise every day. I don't skip a workout unless I don't eat at all that day, which is quite rare.  Right now it's part of my routine so I don't consider it something I think about all the time. It's just something I do in order to feel ready to eat I guess :/  For me, exercise videos help a lot because I'm very uncoordinated. Watching the video makes me feel more inclined to enjoy the exercise—as silly as it sounds, the people making the video are really nice and what they say just lifts my spirits, so to speak. Also I get stressed about whether or not I am burning enough if I exercise in a less structured manner so the video makes it simpler and more manageable.",False,False
