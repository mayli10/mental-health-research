And going out with a friend instead sounds like a really great way to turn your day around. I think you should definitely have a conversation with your husband (in a few days, let it die down a bit) over how the day was a bit of a letdown for you.   Let him know that the story you were telling yourself based on his actions- which is very different from ""you made me feel bad!!""- is that you weren't special to him and he doesn't care about celebrating your love together. It's possible that he didn't know how special holidays are to you, or maybe something really stressful happened at work today, or something else that might have nothing to do with you. Or a million other reasons.  It's important for you to hear his side of it, listen with compassion and not judgement (judge actions, not character, etc). Hopefully you can figure out how to open up more to each other and next Valentine's Day can be better for you :)",False,False

Did your husband know that Valentine‚Äôs Day was important to you? Is that something you‚Äôve expressed before? I think all too often we assume that our partners just know what we want, what we‚Äôre thinking and expect their actions to align with those things. (I‚Äôm TOTALLY guilty of this.) Is it possible it could‚Äôve been a miscommunication? Maybe you mentioned something about a Valentine‚Äôs Day being a stupid, commercialized holiday and he clung on to that thinking ‚Äúoh she doesn‚Äôt care about vday anyway.‚Äù  Regardless, at the end of the day if your feelings were hurt, then something wasn‚Äôt right. And even if miscommunication *was* the case, it sounds like he‚Äôs not putting effort into your relationship in general which isn‚Äôt fair to you at all. You‚Äôre right that your relationship should be be your only source of joy, but it should give you SOME!

I said I‚Äôd love to go because we‚Äôve never been to it and I said he should make a reservation early because it‚Äôs Valentine‚Äôs Day in a busy city. So anyways fast forward two days and I saw where he was talking to some of his friends on discord about Valentine‚Äôs Day. He was complaining about having to spend money and that i wouldn‚Äôt pay for dinner and that I insisted that we go to dinner (mind you he brought it up and i can‚Äôt tell you how many times i offer to pay and he refuses), said I‚Äôm a bad gift giver, complained that I haven‚Äôt bought lingerie to surprise him with and just in general makes me seem like I ruin his life.
