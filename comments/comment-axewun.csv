I’ll elaborate...  People who are all up in your face about “health” and how great their food choices are annoy the shit out of me when I catch them eating “veggie straws” and “terra chips” as their vegetable servings. Those people are the ones whom I would have no problem whipping up some “healthy brownies” for; extra butter, sugar, flour and all.   However, I love making healthier, vegan alternatives to heavy dishes that my parents like, and giving my version to them to try. When it is someone I care very much about, and they don’t watch their weight as much, I want to help them make healthier choices",False,False
