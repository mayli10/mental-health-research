I chose the days that I did because nobody in my family knows about my ED and I'm trying not to draw attention to it. So my fasting days work around my mom's work schedule so she doesn't see how little I eat. Wednesdays have been a thing with my dad for a while before I spiraled into my ED so I have to keep a short eating window open for then. Idk what I'll do if that's ever thrown off though. Weekends I stick to just restriction because I need to be able to do things like yard work, clean the house, etc. without feeling like I'm gonna pass out lol.",False,False
