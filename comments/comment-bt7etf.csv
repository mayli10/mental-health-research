If you don't eat meat often I'd say thats a go to. btw don't forget to rest! If your aching you might need to give your body some time to sit down too.,False,False

No worries on the vitamins though i'm pretty obsessive about my vitamin intake. I'll have to get on the protein pronto. The only reason i've been eating is because i'm visiting my grandma in the south and i dont want to raise suspicions. The food down here is so unhealthy though i'm sure i'm not getting proper protein.,False,True
