That sounds like an awesome shirt lol  my vent~ I low restricted all week in anticipation of eating nachos without a calorie count last night. I know I was still under maintenance.

It‚Äôs also been under heavy media scrutiny recently due to the cub porn/cybercrime article, and even before that they had a reputation for capricious server shutdowns (IOW they could pull a reddit and ban a flurry of ED related servers to appease some funders).  That‚Äôs not getting into the concerns of how to lock down content, how to vet users so that you can keep trolls out without letting the server die due to no new members, the question of shared servers on user profiles...  I like Discord but there are serious concerns with using it for sensitive topics like this.

My graph of daily weigh ins for the past month in MFP is absolutely depressing. I lost ~65 pounds from the start of my relapse mid-August to the end of the year and yet I've only lost a total of about 5 pounds in the past month. I know weight loss slow downs when you're in the healthy BMI category, and I did binge three times (but the overage from that should've been no more than ~7000 calories total for all three, probably less) so the math says I should've lost more than I have unless my BMR has completely tanked. I also keep fluctuating like 5 pounds every few days from water weight and it's fucking with my head so badly.  That being said, even though the scale doesn't say I'm losing, I feel skinnier when I look in the mirror. For the first time ever, I feel like my hips, thighs, and stomach (which is where I hold all my weight) are all thinning out. My upper arms actually look almost like normal person arms instead of marshmallows. I can feel my hip bones press into my arms when I have my hands in my coat pockets and they feel delightfully sharp.   I bought a few pairs of men's boxer briefs in a size small the other day (I used to wear a large at my HW) and they make me feel amazing, the way they sit snuggly at my waist and hug my thighs. I fit a small. I can wear a women's medium. I think today I'll wear my size 6 jeans instead of the 8s because I don't feel bloated. Those are all such impossibly thin sizes to me as a 5'10 person who always called themselves big boned.   Sometimes when I look at my clothing sizes and this newly felt thinness in the mirror, I think that I almost might be willing to maintain here. I could be happy with my body at this weight one day, I think. I'm at by far my lowest adult weight, I'm about 15 pounds below my previous lowest weight at this height when I was 13. But I still have 15-20 pounds to get to my UGW which'll put me at a BMI of just under 19. I'm stubborn and I want to be able to get there at least once, just to prove that I can. I started at a BMI of over 31. Right now my BMI is about 21.5. I've done a lot, but it's not enougy yet, and I feel like it probably won't be enough even when I hit that mythical under 19 BMI, and I don't know what I'll do then.  My ED has been manifesting itself in food hoarding lately. I've started going on shopping trips just to find discount junk food to C/S. I have a section of my pantry devoted to this food now, and I think it's making me C/S more because I feel like the food'll go to waste otherwise (even though it's all shelf/freezer stable stuff). Yesterday was one of those shopping trips, but I managed to stop myself from C/Sing last night because I try to save that for when I have the urge to binge and last night I felt pretty satiated after my OMAD. I have a feeling that if/when I recover, or at least try to get into slightly healthier habits once I hit my GW, C/S is going to be the hardest habit to break.",False,False
