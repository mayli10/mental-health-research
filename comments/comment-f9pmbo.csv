Maybe you're just underestimating, but especially if you're underweight and/or losing, you need to eat more. Find something to eat even if it tastes bland. **If you can't mentally convince yourself to do that, then you're not thinking rationally, you have a disorder.**  Personally it took me a long time to realize I had an eating disorder. I understood I needed to gain weight and wasn't ""trying"" to lose, but at the same time I was constantly worried about eating ""too much"", couldn't skip running for a day, every time my weight went down I felt proud for some reason...  There are some people who just don't eat enough but don't have the ""mindset"", they still think rationally. Instead it's because they're hunger is messed up or other issues - e.g. maybe they have some digestive problem, they're stomach hurts after eating, so they just don't. But those people eat, or drink, or anything to not starve, even if they don't feel like they ""need to"", once they realize.",False,False

I can’t tell you if you have an eating disorder or not but in the DSM-5 it says one of the diagnostic criteria is “Intense fear of gaining weight or becoming fat, or persistent behavior that interferes with weight gain, even though at a significantly low weight.” and you stated that it’s not really a problem for you. I’m not here to tell you that your struggles aren’t valid though because they are 100% valid and deserve help. You might possibly have another eating disorder or maybe some other mood disorder unrelated to EDs (which is fine and still valid) but it’s best if you go ask a medical professional because I’m not sure as I’m just a 15 year old high school student who Googled “anorexia diagnostic criteria” and copy and pasted it. You could have anorexia and I may have just been sharing non-sense but this is my attempt to share my point of view. As for being aware, I think many/most acknowledge their ED habits so you’re not alone in that and it doesn’t make you a fake because you notice it. Anyhow, I wish you luck with figuring out the issue and finding a solution to it as well! c: Feel free to msg me if you have any questions or just want to talk.",False,False
