You have your own page you post on, and you see others pages only if you have their username, so it’s fairly private. ",False,False

I also tried to get him to hide the scale from me and it was similar to how I hid the car keys from him to take away the urge to use.,False,False

I think this will get better, and big shout out to the mods for working with the admins to make sure we have a space. It just almost feels like we had our trust betrayed or something, you know? Like we had a space and it was ripped from us and now we can't fully trust that it won't happen again. But I agree that we can cultivate this space now.",False,True

People with ED didn't just go away, everyone was on the 1200 subs and being there I could tell was triggering for people on both sides. I think the clean needle metaphor makes perfect sense. I feel like calling it *pro* ED made it just seem encouraging to those who have never seen or been through it. I think we can work on making this a community where we all talk about our OWN eating disorder and how it effects our life. Im happy we're making this into the community it deserves to be.
