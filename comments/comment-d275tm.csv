I probably shouldn't post my actual meal plan here because I eat so little, but healthy foods that I like are carrots, tofu, spinach, pasta, sweet potatoes, and quite a few others. Kidney beans are my favourite bean, but any kind of bean is probably a good idea because they're all high in protein and nutrients. For meats I would recommend turkey mostly because it can be used to substitute a lot of red or white meats in recipes very well. If you like fish it really depends on what's available, but I've heard that Alaskan salmon is a healthy and sustainable fish. For white meat fish you may want to go for cod. If you have a fishing license you may be able to catch a few yourself. I think walnuts are pretty great source of healthy fats. Just 6 walnut halves is all you need to get enough omega-3. Including high sources of omega-6 in your diet such a tofu alongside walnuts would be a good way to get enough healthy fats without overdoing it in calories. Other than that you may just want to include fruits and veggies. They tend to be low in calories and quite filling. Bananas are a great source of potassium of course, but they are rather calorie dense for a plant so I wouldn't recommend using them as your main source of potassium. One banana a day should be perfectly fine though.  If you want to plan out meals more in depth I would recommend [cronometer.com](https://cronometer.com). I use it for meal planning all the time because it keeps track of all kinds of vitamins and minerals as well as your macronutrients and a bit of other information. Be careful with it though. I get kind of obsessed with making meal plans. The amount of time I spend making meal plans and then not actually following through with them is kind of ridiculous. It's also easy to make meal plans that end up not being very practical. That being said, I recently made a meal plan that gives me all of my required nutrients while only being 1,220 calories and it's pretty simple to make, so following through with it shouldn't be tough. I had to include a meal replacement shake, a vitamin D supplement, and some potassium citrate powder to do it though. That works for me because I got really sick recently when I tried to eat more. I probably messed up my body by restricting so heavily for so long. 1,220 calories really isn't enough for me to maintain my weight so I would still probably lose about 3 lbs per month, but it's kind of the best I can do right now. I am a bit worried it might be too much food for me though because it's 3 meals in a day plus a snack. But that's not really on topic I guess. I think a girl of average height can maintain a healthy weight at around 1,500-1,800 calories depending on physical activity. With regular eating instead of relying on supplements that should be manageable.",False,False

I always put the full cup for calories just in case i make a mistake and pour too much which is 30cals  I donâ€™t eat lunch until noon every day. I refuse to eat before noon. I have thin sliced chicken with olive oil and boiled zucchini (189 cals)  Dinner- a bowl of bagged slaw with 4 cherry tomatoes, cucumber slices, and olive oil/balsamic (100-150 cals, which is mostly from the olive oil haha)  Sometimes for snack Iâ€™ll have a small Fuji Apple (around 100 cals depending on the size) and Iâ€™ll have another coffee with almond milk.   For treat at night time i measure out a serving of nestle semi sweet chocolate chips (70cals)  Itâ€™s pretty low this week because i am restricting to get to my GW. I sometimes will eat 600-900 calories and Iâ€™ll add things like a little extra chocolate after lunch, and some meatballs with my dinner. I change dinner sometimes to spaghetti squash and meatballs because itâ€™s easy and filling but i think i like my current routine he most.",False,False

I also will go on a run but i don't count that in my calorie counting app.   i eat like a normal human being during the weekend despite my best efforts because my boyfriend stays with me and he doesn't know i've relapsed.",False,False

I focus more on exercise because i donâ€™t want my body to freak out about starvation. i usually eat oatmeal for breakfast. either oatmeal, salad, soup or hummus for lunch. and whatever my parents make for dinner. absolutely no dessert! if i want have some frozen blueberries or grapes. i tend to stick to healthy foods and eat more calories than usual so i can get out of a bing cycle",False,False

And then for snacks I love pickled vegetables and ice lollies. I binge on and off but when I'm feeling good this is the kinda food I eat. Sorry if this is triggering but I tend to eat 4-5 250cal meals with some snacks and that tends to keep me satiated with some days a little higher.  Hope this helps ðŸ˜Š",False,False
