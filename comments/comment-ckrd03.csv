On the weeks leading up to my last recital ever (gave up afterwards) I only ate three saltines and a tootsie pop every day. I chewed on fries and spat them out. This was aproximately a month or so?  Sad thing is: I looked fantastic in my recital, but I couldn’t watch a bit of the tape my parents took because I was so ashamed of what I did. I miss ballet so much.",False,False

I even kept working out when I was injured.",False,False

Repeating this exact pattern almost every night for months.  All of a sudden stop eating completely and have nothing but a small glass of water in the evening, for weeks.  Drop tons of weight, write sad letter to mom, have classmate find letter and rat on me.  College counselour threatens me with not being able to graduate unless I get counseling.  Drives me to my grandfather's house, who makes me stay with him and eat dinner:  salmon, rice and corn.  24 hours later, involuntarily vomit up salmon, rice and corn.  Realize I cannot digest food.",False,False

Also, the time I spent over two hours in a grocery putting things in my cart and taking them back out only to leave having purchased nothing and sobbing all the way home because I’d eaten nothing that day and was terrified to eat at all. I think I had carrots for “dinner” that night.   Eating the food people left on their plates while cleaning up after a party.   Getting caught sneaking food into a bathroom to eat shamefully in private.  Being terrified to eat meat because “calories”, but binging on spoonfuls of brown sugar later.   The past two years have been tough.",False,False
