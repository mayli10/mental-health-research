My stepdad was watching TV in the living room and I stood there, like a dumbass and asked him ""Am I supposed to eat if I'm hungry?"" and he looks at me and he said, ""Yes, you are. Make sure you eat before you go to bed."" I ate a peanut butter sandwich and I felt so loved because he wanted me to bed okay.

We aren't close but it made me feel like he cared.",False,False
