I can find light mayo/miracle whip for around 20 cals a tbsp, and usually half a can of tuna + 1 tbsp is enough to make it the right consistency. Then you can pack that plus a few crackers or a rice cake and/or some veggies (you can add celery/onionand what not to the egg or tuna salad as well to make it look like it's more then it is for not much extra calorie wise ). It'll look look less snack-like and its full of protein which is good.    You could maybe swap the mayo for a small amount of mushed avocado if mayo is too much (I avoided it like crazy until I found the light miracle whip I use). ",False,False

Maybe some tea/coffee or do they supply it? Also, I found out today that Ayam has a low cal sweet chilli sauce (4 cal per tablespoon).

I think that I‚Äôm going to pack a clementine, some carrots, and a little bit of hummus for tomorrow. Does that sound reasonable?

There‚Äôs a lot of veggie soup in my freezer (bulk recipe), I don‚Äôt know why I didn‚Äôt think of soup. Thank you.   Other than soup, the only foods I really eat right now are pretty eclectic‚Äîlike hard boiled eggs, baby carrots, broccoli, spinach, tinned tuna, clementines, and couscous. Sometimes hummus and sometimes string cheese. I usually have a clementine and an egg every morning for breakfast and then pick one or two things for dinner from what I have. If I packed carrots, hummus, and an egg or a clementine, do you think that would be seen as an acceptable lunch?   I‚Äôm sorry if I seem obsessive, I really dislike eating in front of anyone and I also really don‚Äôt want anyone to ask about or be concerned about my eating. ",False,True

I am adding those to my list now; I haven‚Äôt eaten them in a long time, but it‚Äôs a great idea. I‚Äôm going to roast some vegetables later this week when I have access to the kitchen, and I could portion those out to last for days.
