The only thing that works is to change your chemical imbalance in your brain with medication all for life, and I'm definitely not doing that.   I thought going away for years would help. It didn't. I thought finding someone I loved would help. It didn't. I thought getting back with my family would help. It didn't. I just want to give up now, and admit that nothing will ever make me happy. But I want to try once more, even if each time is more difficult than the last. ",False,False

I get so scared sometimes that I'll never get out of this. I wish there was a way to know that there was a light at the end of the tunnel for me.  Until then this subreddit (and proEd used to be) is the only thing that makes me feel okay. ,False,True
