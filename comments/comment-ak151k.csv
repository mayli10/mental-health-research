I will tell you the two most important words I know: bup, bup. Just keep interrupting her like a broken record. Its annoying as hell to the other person. Try that or less contact as she sounds toxic as hell.   My friend has a bulimic mom. Shes purged at my friends house twice and both times she was swiftly asked to leave. She no longer purges there anymore. ",False,False

""jokes"" that make light of a cause of your suffering and anxiety is insensitive.  She may have lots of her own struggles but exposing you to so much disrespect (your word) is harmful, and the fact that she refuses to accept your request to stop talking about her current diet changes and ideas about her weight loss/body is mean.   &amp;#x200B;  Please continue to seek perspective about her behaviour and consider reaching out to resources on your own about how you can maintain health/recovery    ",False,False

I’m really sorry you have to deal with that. I know you said you’ve already talked to her but maybe try showing her this post or really make it known to her that her behavior is unacceptable and she’s creating an extremely toxic environment for you both ,False,False
