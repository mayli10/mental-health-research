Three drinks has been perfect for me and I can normally fit it into my calories.  Winding down is important to me and most of my social obligations are at bars and I’m trying to “do it all”.  I’d agree with the above poster and maybe you could ween yourself off slowly.  Is alcohol an actual problem for you?  You are valid to be concerned!  EDs suck.",False,False

Like, drinking alcohol and water/soda and changing the ratio, like okay, x number of drinks and x number glasses of water, and working to decrease the alcohol? Idk, that's a tough situation and I hope you figure it out. I'm here if you need to talk",False,False
