All my ED has done is gotten worse and worse over the years. I finally told my psychiatrist what I did to purge, and his face contorted into such concerned disgust; it’s crazy teaching mental health professionals new ED methods that they have never heard before.  I’m close to the lowest weight in my life, and I’m also the most alone and unhappy I have ever been. I thought that getting down here would grant me the perfect life, but it’s down actually the complete opposite. I’m eating more normally, but my hair won’t stop falling out; I went from a lion’s mane to having genuinely thin hair..and it’s not stopping. I’m afraid I’m gonna start full on going bald soon.  I hate this. I was happier when I was fatter and just binge eating once a week. Now the void is so big, I can’t even use binge eating to fill it up anymore.",False,False

My ED developed when I was at the lowest point in my life.  My life is objectively way better now and I have a lot going on for me... but I still struggle with my ED.  I want to be better so badly.  I am so ready to not be disordered.  But that's not how my eating disorder works.  For better or worse it is independent from my personality or whereabouts.  It doesn't care if I'm at a high or low point.  It'll take me down— any time of day, in front of anyone, at any event— unprompted. It doesn't fucking care about me.",False,False
