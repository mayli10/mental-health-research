Literally cannot finish the log unless you eat 1000kcal.  I usually will plan a 1000 day and end up somewhere around 850-900 if I don’t eat a snack or two.  I love seeing the “in 5 weeks you’d weigh...” number.,False,False

You literally can't gain weight even high restricting. You'll feel much better with a few more calories, so try it as an experiment. See how you feel after a couple weeks.",False,False
