I did however used the videos to help explain how to do the exercises properly. Like to make sure not to raise your butt too high when doing a push up. Lol. I just looked up typed out routines. If I wasnt familiar with an exercise, I looked it up and went from there. Unfortunately the magazine I used is no longer in print. Thank god I kept my copies.   I cant do trainers. My anxieties I guess. I don't want them to see how weak I am. Lol",False,False

You feel those success endorphins every time you complete your set and every time you see yourself being able to lift a higher amount next time. And then in a couple of weeks (I go 3-4x a week and stay for 1- 1 1/2 hours doing all the machines and cardio but just 2x week for 45 mins each is a great start) you start seeing results on your body, not just the scale but your actual body, and that's the best feeling of success ever! I've been doing it for 4 years now and my body looks great, I'm not bulky like a man or anything (those girls have to do A LOT to look that way, and some of them even take drugs, so it's not something you need to even worry about!) so I really hope you continue!",False,False

She was very nice and said that she told them not to approach me but they did so anyway.

The moment you apologized and got off the bike they should have just shut the fuck up and left you alone (or better yet, politely explain to you the proper procedure. Not their job, but it's the decent thing to do since the gym that happily took your money didn't bother to do their job!) The fact that they just kept going on and on, two against one to the point where you felt so hurt you had to come write this here, that's just unbelievable how rude that is! I'm so sorry you had to deal with something like that!  When you feel up to it, approach one of the gym employees, tell them what happened and explain that you are not there to get yelled at by assholes, you are there to get in shape, so can that employee please do their fucking job and explain to you how to avoid having assholes yell at you pretty please with a cherry on top?  Also, start learning the strength machines, they will give you a leaner and more toned look. The people at the gym are paid to teach you how to use the machines safely. You are literally entitled to have them explain things to you since you are paying them money. I'm just really annoyed that at the horrible customer service that you've gotten. The fact that you were accosted and yelled at by two grown women and nobody even did anything! Not cool at all!",False,False

Don't let it get to you. You will learn from their mistakes and become a better person but they will always be bitches.  As for working out. I'm not sure how you are at lifting. I'm going to assume a beginner. Try looking up some novice routines involving weight lifting that you are able to do. Keep your chin up.,False,False
