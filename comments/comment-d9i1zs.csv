I get what you're saying but personally I don't really think it's creepy bc she put it out there onto her public Instagram so people are gonna react idk. Also I guess you're right, I just brushed it off as like ""locker room talk"" *cringe at that term* and that was all he said about it, nothing further than ""she's hot"", but I guess guys should be held more accountable for stuff like that.",False,False

He may have the right to THINK his ex is attractive but he totally doesn't have every right to be screencapping her bikini pics and sending them to his friends with ""she's so hot"" while dating you. I'd blow a god damn fuse! That's so hella disrespectful and I'm sorry he hurt you like that. Nott to mention that's HELLA creepy to that girl.",False,False

Based on this, your ex sounds like a real peach.",False,False

But yeah I understand how relieving it must've felt for you to come before her. And of course!! As soon as I read your post I was like I feel that so much I have to say something,False,False

Basically, I know how that feels and its super shitty thay youve had a similar experience. Youre absolutely right though, Ive never been able to talk to anyone about this because if you dont have that ED mindset its hard to understand that its not just jealousy. Thank you for taking the time to reply, it means alot to have someone who gets it give me the advice I needed to hear.",False,True

My bf has an ex that's so perfect. One time I caught him sending a screenshot of one of her posts in a bikini to his friends with the caption ""she's so hot"". I know they don't talk at all but damm that hurted, especially bc we don't look a like even a little (God I wish). I never confronted him about it I guess he has every right to find her hot. But sis sometimes you have to just do what's best for you and unfriend her for your sanity. If anyone says anything you can just be like ""well we don't even talk"" but I bet no one will really even notice",False,False
