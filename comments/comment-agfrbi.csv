Same with the losing weight a healthy way my brain just wonâ€™t compute just eat a moderate amount with a few treats, and move your body more.

It's not for eating usually but it's an app to help you when you want to binge (or self harm) and riding out the wave. So far it's helped though I'll let you know when a big one hits lol,False,False

Like, I've never been able to fast ever, and trying to restrict below 500 calories makes me crazy. But planning a higher restriction phase is super motivating because I know I'll actually do it and I crave that feeling of accomplishment. If you're having frequent binges it may be a sign that you need to restrict a little higher. It's so easy to binge thousands of calories and completely contract all of your restriction when you're not having enough!",False,False

Mine was with fasting, if I plan to fast Iâ€™d think I need to load up and Iâ€™d end up eating at maintenance or some crap I found it works when I make the decision to â€˜not eatâ€™ instead of to â€˜fastâ€™, so a prohibition rather than an action How that works I dunno ",False,False

Whenever I think of doing a fast, I immediately binge. I get scared of being hungry. It doesnâ€™t help me either when I try to lose weight a healthy way or just maintain either. ",False,False
