In the end we never went to the restaurant and just got pissed at the pub. somehow I'm ok with drinking my calories lmao,False,True

Last time I had a celebration dinner with my sister, she chose Cheesecake Factory for the locale, and most of their dishes are mind blowingly caloric, but they do have a lighter menu section - great, I think, until I realize all the dishes have ""skinnylicious"" in the name. That name feels so patronizing, like who the f wants to have to say ""I'll have the skinnylicious salad""??  In your situation, I feel like you'll look finicky with either excuse, nutritional or financial, but you don't want to chose a calorie bomb and feel anxious throughout the meal... Just order the low carb box and try to be as nonchalant as possible, and likely he won't even think twice about it. You've got this!",False,False

I just tell people I dont want to put crap into it. One a la carte steak taco on flour. With shredded lettuce and cheese instead of guacamole and pico. And a side of refried beans that I hardly touch. Is my go-to at a Mexican restaurant.,False,False

Don't pick something just because you think he might be less ""judge-y"" about it. And you can still be the cool girl and have your healthy options too ;) I mean healthy/clean eating is super in right now. Don't sweat it!",False,False

The most he’d say is “do you usually eat pretty healthy?” Or “cutting back on carbs?” To which you answer “yes” and eat your food.,False,False

He might joke a bit about you getting a healthy option but joking and judging are two completely different things. I'd never want to be around anyone who judges me for my food options. Low carb box sounds great! Instead of saying you're just broke I'd be straight up and say ""It's so nice to have healthy options when eating out"" Also, why not try and be a bit of the salad and diet coke gal AND cold pizza? Moderation is key. But seriously, get the low carb box or vegan box.",False,False
