At your age I don't think doctor's really use BMI. Before you're an adult when you may still need growing it's totally normal for weight to be all over the place. Lots of people settle into a different weight as adults anyway. Not everybody sees a massive change to weight when they stop growing, but it does happen. Weight loss and weight gain are both possibilities. She could be less concerned because of your age. I know that on my laptop I have a link saved to BMI calculator that does change the results based on age, but I'm on mobile at the moment. I'm sure that at a sub16 BMI you may still be outside of the normal range, but I'm not totally sure how it works for people under 18 years old.",False,False

I think it was partially unfortunate phrasing too tho.,False,True

I know this disorder can twist things - I hope it was just an unfortunate phrasing.",False,False
