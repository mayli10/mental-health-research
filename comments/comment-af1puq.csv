I have zero social life, but get so distracted at work and in class (night school) that I hardly even think about food. 3 days this week I kept it under 200cals by only eating soup at 9:30 for dinner. I guess this could also be attributed to the fact that I’m now up to 4 ECA stacks a day, but who really knows!!",False,False

I restricted fairly well all day (including lunch at Olive Garden), thought about just eating and purging but I promised myself I would stop that. So I had two slices (they’re quite thin, more homemade than fast food), more fries than I wanted but less than I could have had, and just stopped. I felt full but not uncomfortably so, and now I’m getting some exercise done. I feel like the rest of my life is in shambles, I can’t get anything done, but at least my eating is getting better.",False,False

I'm having a few problems. I don't actually want to go into treatment, so I'm just wasting time, resources. I am also below the bmi cutoff for this new treatment center.
