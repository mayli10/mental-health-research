Some are still going in and out of treatment. But others have completely recovered (or at least seem completely recovered) and are successfully doing school, careers, families, etc.   And yeah, insurance really prevents IP programs from actually doing good work, but one good thing about Walden is that they take most insurance, including Medicaid and Medicare, which not every place does. Given that they also take involuntary patients, it's sort of the last resort for some people; if all else fails you can  always go back to Walden.",False,False

No one spoke positively of it, but a lot of us were managing our symptoms pretty well. Wonder how many of us have relapsed. I didn’t keep in touch after the first year or so. Insurance makes this all so much more complicated than it needs to be.",False,True

Walden's IP, at least historically, has not been great imo. But it's not clear to me how much of that is specific to Walden and how much is due to the nature of IP and how insurance-based it all is. And yeah, Alcott is in Waltham in the Children's Hospital, but they have all levels of care nearby.",False,False

I don’t think my insurance covered enough for IP, that might have been it, or maybe I wasn’t as bad as I remember or something else. When I was there it was super focused on meal compliance moreso than treatment modalities but there was a dbt/mindfulness component too. Idk. I still hve mixed feelings about Walden.",False,True

And I never did Walden's resi, only IP, which doesn't really have a treatment approach imo--by 2014 they had even discontinued the level system.   (And I'm not sure which you meant: you were IP on Alcott and did a program elsewhere, or just did a program elsewhere?)",False,False

No I was there earlier, and I was at their satellite location that has since moved out in western mass. Renfrew’s whole treatment approach is so ducking different from Walden that it’s been throwing me for a major loop.",False,True

I was on Alcott 5 times between 2011 and 2014. If we were there at the same time that would be amazing and also prove my point about how small a world ED treatment is lol.,False,False

I would see people I'd seen before, or that I knew in real life, or find people who had been in treatment with people I knew irl--and I went to ED treatment out of state. I was looking at my friend recommendations on facebook the other day and someone from my college had a bunch of mutual friends, and I thought nothing of it--we went to the same college, we're bound to have mutual friends--and then I checked who the mutual friends were and it's people I went to treatment with and I was like 'oh you have an ED too.'",False,False
