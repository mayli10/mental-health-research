I just wonder, though, how can you not feel like that when guys are pretty open about wanting a skinny woman (idk if you're a woman, but it's definitely been my experience as a woman). I've dated a lot of the finance bro-y types, a few down-to-earth lumberjack types, even a guy who was straight up morbidly obese himself, and every single one has said something that makes it pretty clear that they value thinner women more.  So since seems pretty universal that guys like thin women, how are we not supposed to feel like they would like us just the same if we were bigger? I mean maybe in middle age after a few years of marriage when all the shallow stuff doesn't  matter any more....but it seems hard not to have that little voice saying what it said to you when there's so many examples of it being kinda true :/",False,False

No new boy exactly but I’m recently single and at my lowest weight ever, getting more interest from men than I’ve ever had in my life.
