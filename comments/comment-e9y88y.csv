It’s a type of person I mostly try to avoid, but sometimes those interactions are unavoidable.   I remind myself they’re a sick person that is struggling, just like I am. They feel insecure and empty and are trying to get other people to fill them up - make them feel ok and wanted and special. Sadly, it’s an approach that’s unlikely to really help with what ails them, but that’s something they’ll have to figure out for themselves. It helps me see their annoying behavior in a different light and I can be much more neutral about it.   And for my own reaction...my feelings of competitiveness or inadequacy...I remind myself the Pain Olympics are freaking stupid and I’m not gonna enter that screwed up race. Someone else being in pain doesn’t change the fact that *I’m* in pain. That I’m struggling. My path is still mine to walk.   Dunno if any of that is at all useful. I’m sorry you’re having so many encounters with this person. And I hope you have some people in your life that are supporting you &lt;3",False,False
