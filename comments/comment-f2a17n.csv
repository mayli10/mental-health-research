At work always after our first break *everyone* talks about food and it's torture. Then they all eat in front of me while I drink water. I can't escape it either :/ My daily cycle.,False,False

They probably figure everyone has to eat, so it‚Äôs easy common ground.   And of course something like half the population is ‚Äúdieting‚Äù at any given time, so these people are probably hoping to either commiserate with someone or maybe find a way to get to eat more on their own diet.   It can be awkward and frustrating, but I always remind myself that it‚Äôs ignorance and not malice.",False,False

I don't know why, but people in my office constantly comment on me eating (even though I fast most of the time and very rarely eat lunch).   For some reason, my friend who I work with (who's very overweight) CONSTANTLY comments on the food that I eat, and calls me a ""bottomless pit"". We're Irish and it's normal in friendships to constantly slag each other and rip the piss but some days it gets to me, even though I know he means nothing by it.   What annoys me even more though, is when other people in the office (mostly middle-aged men and women) decide that my lunch, or lack thereof, is their business. Like fuck off Margaret you nosy bag please let me eat my soup in peace üòë",False,False

People are so dumb about how many calories are in things. I was eating with my parents the other night (we were having fajitas) and I only took some chicken and then a big portion of veggies (while both my parents had cheese, tortillas, and sour cream) and my mom commented about how much I was eating.

This happens to me too but on a different scale as I eat more.  They see you eating crackers spread out and assume you eat lots of crackers each time, unfortunately. Really though they actually don‚Äôt care how much you eat, even though they commented, so don‚Äôt worry about it.  Enjoy your crackers and coffee, you deserve them! :3",False,False
