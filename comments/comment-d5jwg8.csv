Multiply that by the number of days to see your change in weight over a period of time  So for instance, if you eat 700cal per day and burn 1400 total, -700/3500 is a daily weight change of -0.2lbs per day so you would lose .2lbs per day. Multiply by 14 days, and you would lose 2.8lbs in two weeks.   Of course that doesn’t take into account water weight, food weight, water retention, etc",False,False
