There are such things as balance and health.   Your friend sounds like she could be a mix of genuine concern for people possibly developing an ED *and* also actively trying to discourage any type of diet, even a healthy one, because of some personal reason she is dealing with. I don’t want to speculate as to what that reason is but the fact that she is actively trying to discourage you from, from how I read it, a healthy way to diet and exercise, is not a positive thing.   There is a middle ground and it seems like you’ve been on your way to finding it, but she’s discouraging you from staying on that path. I personally would not want to open up anymore about my diet or exercise to someone who actively discouraged me from pursuing the healthy middle ground that many of us eating disorder sufferers have trouble finding and sticking to.  I say that if you’re finding that middle ground, stick with it as much as you possibly can, despite her trying to steer you away from it. Just remember, there is balance in food and exercise and life. The middle ground is real and if you’re finding it, then keep going towards it.  (P.S. Also, while starvation mode is a thing, the way she’s describing it is incorrect. Eating fewer calories will not make you gain an uncontrollable amount of weight now nor later on down the road. That’s not how thermodynamics works. The only way you’ll gain weight is if you take in more calories than your body needs. Starvation mode is only real in the way that your metabolism will slow down over a prolonged period of calorie restriction in order to adapt to that lower calorie amount. However, if you start to take in more calories, your metabolism will speed up to match it. It is ONLY when you take in more calories than your body knows what to do with that you will gain weight.)",False,False
