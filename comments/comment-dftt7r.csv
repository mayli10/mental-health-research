But I actually think oder stims like amphetamines could help as they last longer and for me it helps not only by not having a big appetite but also with not thinking about food. I would't suggest it to anyone who has anorexia but for someone with BED or bulimia I think that if not abused could help.

From my experience:  sure, I can not eat even during a weekend bender. But when it's time to sober up it's binge time. And to think you're gonna be on coke 24/7 is insane, because you can't afford it, (it adds up quick and you need more) so you'll either spend all your money or your heart will give out after a prolonged sesh.  Also this shit is addictive, I have people in my life who have been ruined by it. Eventually going to work treating the cash as drug tokens.  Cocaine as a drug can be fun if done rarely.
