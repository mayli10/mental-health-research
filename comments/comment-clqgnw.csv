I wasn't even overweight at any point, but I did have chubby cheeks and burgeoning tummy pudge. Became anorexic over one summer, and that fall actual adults were telling me I looked great. Literally wtf, I was eleven and underweight. But it was apparently better than having, GASP, noticeable tummy pudge!!  And honestly my family never noticed. Or didn't want to. (I'm sure my mom is aware I have an ED but it's in the part of her brain she doesn't open.) Unfortunately, you can't always count on people to notice red flags and act on them. In our society, ""red flags"" are engrained in us for weight gain, but not for weight loss. People notice immediately if someone's gained 10 lbs and want to tell them ""it's not good that you're gaining weight so fast!"" (as if they don't already fuckin know that). But lose 10 lbs equally fast, especially if you're someone who could allegedly ""stand to lose a few""? Well, people usually think that's just great.",False,False

People, even our own family, have their own shit going on. You can’t hide it and expect them to know at the same time. It’s not fair. Either accept it or tell them. I know that’s harsh but viewing things the way you do will make you miserable and start to change how you feel about everyone around you when in fact you are testing them beyond what is reasonable. They are ignorant to what you’re going through because they’ve never gone through it themselves. You do you. Tell them and get help in your own time. Then see if they are failing you or not.",False,False

Right now I’m restricting myself so much and my grandmother is telling everyone in our family to eat like me so that they can lose weight as well.

I blame capitalism.",False,False

My Mom was literally buying me a new pair of AE jeans a size smaller every other week, for one as a reward for my weight loss, and also because I was dropping sizes so quickly and they weren’t fitting. Not a single family member or friend was concerned, despite being underweight, until my ex-boyfriend “outed” me by showing my parents pictures of my self injured stomach (long story). It really is sad how oblivious people can be.",False,False

She knows about my depression and self harm because I have it as a teen when I lived with her and my dad. Plus she is super helpful and supportive of me even with my issues. She and my husband are the only ones that know.,False,False
