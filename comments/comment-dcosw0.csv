I think she just wanted me to have some nice clothing that fits properly because most of my clothes now are too small or way too big (in an attempt to hide weight gain)",False,True

She probably didn't think about what the size might do to your head- she likely wants you to have some really nice clothes that will last a while that you can wear on any day- bloated or not, and thought that getting one or two sizes up will make sure the clothes dont get tighter on you if you bloat throughout the day or gain a little more weight. Maybe it would help if you call her or text her and let her know that seeing a size large was very upsetting for you and just clear the air?",False,False

If so, she could've chosen a bigger size on purpose so that they would fit loosely and not remind you of any weight you may gain",False,False

What about if you cut out the size labels?,False,False
