And nobody here at college with me knows, I dont want them to know me as the bulimic chick who clogged the shower drains.  Your day does sound exciting. I have no friends here so nobody invites me to drink, but drink I did at easter",False,False

There was booze and apparently I hit on grandmothers without knowing I'm doing that.   Did you eat today? And also, does anyone in person know about the ED?",False,True

Told my boyfriend and he just ignored it in favor of telling me he got sick again. He gets sick all the time but won't see a doctor about it. So it's frustrating that i spend so much time worrying about his health and when i almost pass out I'm expected to continue worrying about his health.  How was your day?,False,False

Our problems become so trivial then when we realize what they really are and how non important the phenomena is.   We'll struggle with it now and it'll be hard for a while, but there will be a switch. I only hope it comes sooner rather than later for both of us, y'know? This thing is so destructive physically and mentally, it doesn't really have any benefit either.   But we still do it anyway hahah. How was your day?",False,True

For sure I mean just think about the little things like standing in the middle of a breeze.   I like to put aside the things that hold me back for just a moment sometimes. Make that day stay as yesterday. Come back here and feel tomorrow as now, and when that is true, it really does become now and yesterday is...  yesterday.",False,True

Got so mad at things that deserved no attention. Shy. Known as the girl who never smiles. Weird eating problems, obsessive about food being clean. At a catholic elementary school, learning that you should always put other people's wants and needs first (foreshadowing in the play of my life)  Act 1, Part 2 Ages 13-14 First boyfriend, first sexual abuse. Didn't know that's what it was, I didn't even know what sex was, so I thought that's how it was supposed to be. Thought I was broken and ungrateful for not liking what was happening to me. Thought I had to let it happen because the Catholics taught me ""I am Third."" First time skipping meals (a recurring theme.) Self harm became my favorite pass-time.  Act 1, Part 3 Ages 15-17 Second boyfriend. Claimed he wouldn't use me like the first did. Happened anyways. Skipping more meals, binging later, self-harm off the charts. Never sleeping to avoid the nightmares. Grades slipping, friends abandoning. No emotions, no personality, no hopes.  Interlude Age 18 On the anniversary of my first time being sexually abused while awake, I dissociated to the point that I don't remember the day. I do remember ""waking up"" in a hospital, stitches in my arm, mother telling me ""you say you don't want to burden us but this is the burden."" One week in a psych ward, using my best acting skills to convince them of rapid improvement. Got out. Empty inside. No change.  Act 2, Part 1 Age 19 Goes to college. Eating problems come back, harder than before. The often tempting and considered purging becomes a reality. Eating, purging, exercising, restricting. No emotions. Hatred for life and everything in it.  Has good things in the future to look forward to. Doesn't care. Empty inside.  Act 2, Part 2 Age 20 Future me. May not make it that far.",False,False

Diagnosed with several disorders before I even understood I was alive. Seems smart, but socially incapable  Act 1, part 2 - Ages 10 - 12 Less shy, but still introverted. Doesn't seem to care for anything specific. Anxious of any social situation, but likes to go outside. Transferred to a 'plus class' for the 'smart kids'  Act 2, part 1 - Ages 13 - 18 Started taking drugs with my 'friends'. Where did the time go? Bit more outgoing than the previous characters, still doesn't like being around people. Awfully depressed and full of hatred   Act 2, part 2 - Ages 19 - 21 Slowly getting more outgoing, actually kind of likes being around people. Started to develop actual interests. Continually trying to get off drugs but failing miserably  Act 3 - Age 22 Future me. Neither likes cigarettes nor drugs. Has actual interests and wants to be around like minded people. Joins several groups, mostly science- and political related. Actually wants to live.",False,False
