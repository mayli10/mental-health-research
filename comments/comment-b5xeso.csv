I just went straight into University stuff after high school and kept forcing myself to go even though I was achieving below what I reasonably could have and ended up dropping out after a year and a half anyway because all the other problems I was having were too much. I took some time off and went back (to a worse University, but they had better external support as I was still a bit too unwell to go to class all the time and needed to work more than most students for $$$ as I had no family support) and in the end I wish that I had just taken some time off at the beginning because it was a lot easier when I went back. Not sure how it is in America, but I thought in most places where you do your undergraduate doesn't matter so much, it's more post-graduate. That's the way it is here, anyway, so, while I understand it is super disappointing, not getting into the College you wanted for undergraduate may not be a big deal if you do your honours/masters somewhere else.",False,False
