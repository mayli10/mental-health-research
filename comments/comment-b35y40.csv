The laxatives bring me back to my pre-binge weight (or close to it) and motivate me to lose more because I feel thinner. ",False,False

And sometimes I still can’t do it for way too long, but that’ll happen after a while. :(  I never thought they’d make me lose weight or anything if that’s even a thing people really think (although I have wondered if they might affect absorption in some way), but I just. Physically cannot stand the feeling of being constipated/bloated. It’s like the feeling of being full. I just hate it? So at some point, laxatives helped me feel better.   Like when I first found myself really binging again but before I relapsed into puke style purging (which didn’t take long unfortunately), they used to relieve some discomfort and ease my mind a bit after the damage was done.   And they were so immediately effective at first, which was such a legitimate relief after having been constipated for so long prior to my use of them, just in general. I never really consciously decided to start using them all the time, I guess. I just kinda found myself using them more and more until they became a part of my routine... Sure wish I hadn’t, lol!!!! But yeah.",False,False

When you fast, your digestive system starts to slow down during it, so once you end the fast, things still aren't really moving, so you tend to bloat and gain food weight. Some people rely on lax to help get things working again, and if you do it often enough it starts becoming that you basically can't use the bathroom unless you lax, and that isn't fun at all.",False,False

The reason for this is that nutrients are absorbed in the small intestines. Obviously if someone vomits that food never reached the intestines, but laxatives just make the food move through them faster.   I usually only use laxatives when actually constipated, which thanks to my ED is unfortunately frequent, but sometimes Ill take them to reduce morning-after-binge bloating. I never expect them to make me lose weight though, because they don't make you lose real weight. They just dehydrate the fuck of ya.",False,False
