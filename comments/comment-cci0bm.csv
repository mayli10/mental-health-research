Once I recovered I realized that I was severely lacking empathy when it came to other eating issues.   Second time around when I relapsed in I just felt bad for everyone who had to be in the same boat as me. Proed helped a lot here because I'd always been limited to communicating with other restrictors and i was starting to see the side of those with B/P and BED and we could all commensurate regardless of the differences.   Interesting I find when I go awhile without eating or low restricting I get that mean streak back. One of the driving forces of my recovery had thus been just wanting to be a kinder person",False,False

It’s not about them at all, it’s a projection of my own issues. It’s really hard to explain that it bothers me because I see myself as that person and hate myself. It’s kind of narcissistic, I guess.   I might get downvoted for this, but I think it’s ok to have these thoughts/feelings as long as we acknowledge that it’s more about us than them, if that makes sense? And obviously treat people with kindness and respect.",False,False

So many times I want to just yell at my mom “stop eating”. But it’s really because I want to control MY eating and I’m pissed that her compulsive overeating turned me into a fat kid. Like I’m a grown adult who is responsible for her own ED, but damn I wonder how my life would have been if I was a normal-weight kid.",False,False

Now I’m just a fatty who started dieting at age 8, restriction led to binging, ended up with bulimia, and still. fucking. fat. In this horrible restrict-b/p cycle. But honestly I just hate being around fat people who eat all the time because I really hate myself and my lack of control.   PSA: I really am against fat-shaming and I think all women deserve to love their bodies, even if that body isn’t healthy. It’s all me and my own issues.
