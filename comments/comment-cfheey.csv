I have a target v neck from a few years ago in a small and it’s about the same size as an xs I picked up recently (both mossimo) 🤷🏼‍♀️ I’m not a fan of the term “vanity sizing,” but I’m pretty sure that’s the situation here",False,False

It’s impossible to shop there if you’re a size 0-2 :/",False,False
