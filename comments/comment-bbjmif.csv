Maybe my ED just wins the negotiation more frequently lol. I wanted to eat the last two little sugar free soda brownies I store at my bfs house so since it was higher in calories than the celery, cucumbers, and dip that I brought as a snack... I had to skip the veggie snack for the brownies. But my birthday is coming up and I’d like to be a normal person who goes to a nice high end dinner and eats cake and drinks without inhibition, so the current negotiation plan is to eat very lightly the day before and fast the day after.",False,False
