I usually just ignored it but one day i lashed out and asked why she never bothered to ask me because i was getting noticeably thinner as well. She said ‚Äúwell i thought bringing up other people‚Äôs weight loss would help you open up‚Äù * sigh * communication was never my family‚Äôs strong point, but the fact of the matter is she did notice but didnt know how to address the issue.",False,False

People care though.",False,False

I get really bad breath from not eating enough/fasting. And my husband knows this and he knows when I'm not eating and he will even mention several times about how i've not been eating, even buying me gum but never seems concerned. So in my mind I'm like yeah, cus he wants you skinny duh üôÑ.",False,False

It‚Äôs sort of like if someone looks pregnant but you aren‚Äôt sure - obviously you don‚Äôt want to say something and be wrong, because that‚Äôs fucking embarrassing for everyone, but, if that person is pregnant, they might be hurt that no one is congratulating them.   I‚Äôve had multiple friends tell me after the fact that they knew something was wrong but were afraid to say anything because, basically, they didn‚Äôt want to tell me that I looked like boiled shit.   I‚Äôd guess that people have noticed, but are just too afraid or nervous to say anything.",False,False
