Another thing, being Latina, I’ve noticed guys sexualize us so much and they all want to be with one at least once, but the average guy doesn’t see us as relationship material and will end up proposing to your average blonde white girl. Something is leading me to believe that men see latinas in the same way they see thicc girls- for a good time, not a long time :/",False,False

And that is very rare to see outside of photoshopped Instagram pictures.  So skinny girls are also attractive and much more common.
