Your focus is so much on what ""should be"" based on some arbitrary guideline which isn't really representative of ANY person so much as it represents a capitalistic ideal.  You are forcing yourself into a mold that wasnt designed with heath in mind. Most of us dont fit in that mold. Efforts to fit cause us to do unhealthy things and lose sight of our own wellbeing.",False,False

BMI isn‚Äôt necessarily representative, and if you find that for you it isn‚Äôt, then girl maybe it ain‚Äôt ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è so it COULD deff be a matter of ED brain, and I think it‚Äôs fair to keep an eye on that.",False,False

There is a capitalistic reason that its recommended we eat so mamy servings of grains....its related to price setting during the new deal after the depression. Its a form of market manipulation.  Similarly, the 2000 kcal magic number is general. Its not meant to be a goal post. Its barely based on shotty science. Its painfully generalized.  BMI guidelines follow the same train of jacked up logic. Jason Moma is, medicly speaking, morbidly obese. The cutoff is an arbitrary number which assumes that you eat like youre racing towards diabetes and spend 14 hours a day sitting down....its not representative of anything other than the food industries dependence on our complacency.  Please don't base your self worth on a measure designed to prop up a food system which harms people. Its an illusion.",False,False
