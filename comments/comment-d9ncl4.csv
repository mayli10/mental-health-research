Nurse practitioners take an oath that basically says ‚Äúput the patient first, trust them, protect them‚Äù and it really shows. I‚Äôm not ready for recovery either, just trying to keep an eye on how my internal systems are doin.   Sending you good thoughts and love. I‚Äôm always here if you want to talküíï",False,False

My last appt was sept 3 and i have lost over 10lbs since then. I have an apt coming on next Thursday and i am not sure if they will weigh me or not. I‚Äôm scared if they do they will be like how have you lost so much weight? Because I‚Äôm total I‚Äôve lost over 25lbs since the last time i saw this particular doctor.  Edited to add this might also just be feeling guilty because some people lost the weight in a healthy way and feel really good about it! Maybe I‚Äôll try that route haha,False,False
