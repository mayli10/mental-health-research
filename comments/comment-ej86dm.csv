Mind you I'm going on 3 years of personal experience.  If you can swallow a pill you place and remove a tube.  May I ask what french your tube is?  I can't stand anything above a 10 F for long term placement.  Also, some tubes are just not as pliable as others which makes them more uncomfortable than others.  Corpak and Kangaroo are my preference.  Weighted J tubes are the worst things on the planet but are needed in some cases.  I'm assuming your tube is obviously for an eating disorder.  If you want to yank it out because it's uncomfortable you need to talk to your doctor and tell them it's painful.  A lot of people inpatient or not being treated with ED feel like they can't say anything about personal discomfort which is SO wrong.  You are paying for it you have every right to speak up and to be as comfortable as possible while you are going through some pretty rough stuff.  On the other hand, some of it is part of ED.  The mental aspect of this tube ""defeating"" your ED can be causing physical discomfort from a mental aspect.  I don't have ED, I have other medical problems that calls for tube feeds.  I hope you are seeking advice on your road to recovery and not trying to skirt around the treatments required therapy.  Best of luck, when in doubt don't rip it out, contact your doctor and express your discomfort.",False,False

I wasn’t medically stable to go to treatment and so it was a way to get me there faster as well. Regarding the discomfort - they can give you numbing spray for your throat but honestly after a day or two you don’t really notice it. Also ask them to use the smallest (like paediatric) size as that helps too - I had a small adult one but if I had to do again I’d ask for the next size down.,False,False

If you have to get one, keep your head tilted down while it’s being inserted and drink water thru a straw - it makes it easier.",False,False

Don’t know if it would help but I found having the feed run overnight helped because I could take sleeping pills and for some reason the ED part of my brain didn’t quite “get” what was happening and I didn’t really register it had even happened.,False,False
