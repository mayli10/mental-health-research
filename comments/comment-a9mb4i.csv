Before her most actresses were big breasted and curvy. ACTUAL curvy, like still slim and definitely not overweight but not the tiny girl-child frame that Audrey had. Think Rita Hayworth or Jayne Mansfield.  The other interesting thing is Audrey struggled a lot with her weight throughout her life. She was a teenager in Brussels during the WWII Nazi occupation. Food was so scarce that her family resorted to making flour out of tulip bulbs in order to survive. Tulip bulbs are toxic and Audrey practically starving through this period led to a lot of problems with nutrition absorption and digestion later in life, which is one of the reasons why she was so thin. Of course she also trained as a ballerina (I think in the end she was too short to be a Prima ballerina) so she would have been weight conscious from her training. Her ballet background would account for her gracefulness. Sorry, like many girls I love Audrey and was obsessed with her as a child/teen. ",False,False
