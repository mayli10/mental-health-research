M&amp;S also does a chargrilled chicken and courgetti ready meal that is 233 calories, high protein, and deliciously filling. Highly recommend. M&amp;S actually does lush low calorie microwave stuff. That's not even by far the lowest calorie meal they have, it's just the lowest cal one they stock in the little M&amp;S I walk past on my way home from uni. I have to go slightly out of my way to the big M&amp;S if I want the even lower cal stuff.    Tescos does a salmon in watercress sauce with potatoes and broccoli and green beans, which is ¬£3 usually but was 2 for ¬£4 last week when I was in (not sure if the offer is still on). It's another meal that feels big and filling and like a proper non-disordered and high protein meal for just 297 calories. I often have it before a ballet class. That or the microwaveable ""Quorn comforting cottage pie"" (315 cals). Or the Tescos pulled ham in mustard sauce with mash, green beans, and carrots for 279 cals (that was included in the two for ¬£4 offer with the salmon meal).  I'm just about to have a bowl of weight watchers baked beans from tescos which is 294 calories for a tin. Beans are super filling and full of protein and these are the lowest calorie ones I've found. I also like Heinz no added sugar spaghetti hoops, which are good for warmth and volume but not great for protein or long term fullness, but they're only 162 calories for a whole delicious bowl (made more delicious by the copious addition of Tabasco).   I adore ready meals because a) they're quick and easy, and b) the calories are right on the box =D",False,False

I sautee a bunch of veggies like mushrooms, peppers, onions, some minced garlic, broccoli, etc,in about 3 grams of cooking spray first, then add about 300 grams of egg whites. To make it extra filling, add 12-16 grams of psyllium husk powder to the egg whites before cooking. Strange (will look super weird while cooking, keep the eggs moving), but trust me, it works. About 300 calories for a bigass plate of food. * Steamed veggies. My favorites are broccoli, cauliflower + carrots, and roasted brussels sprouts. I add sriracha, adobo, and nutritional yeast flakes for flavor. &lt;150 calories usually. * Fiber One original cereal with frozen berries and cashew milk (good carb source). 250 calories or so for a large bowl. Very filling. * Protein shake made with 1.5 cups cashew milk, 38 grams whey protein, one cup frozen berries, 16 grams psyllium husk powder. Use a blender and add the psyllium while blending so it doesn't clump as much. 300 calories and hits like a Mack truck thanks to the high volume + psyllium husk.

Get things like Country Vegetable, Beef and Vegetable, Carrot and Coriander, Slow Roast Tomato, etc. In the UK, you can get these fresh for under 100 kcal for 300g of soup. I personally prefer fresh.  - Oatmeal or Cream of Wheat. A typical serving of these only has 100 kcals, so you can just use water to cook them, but if you're willing to spare a few calories then I'd recommend a milk such as unsweetened almond, soya light, or coconut. Tastes far better for 20-30 additional calories. Zero kcal sweetener, bit of cinnamon etc and it's lovely.  - Volume eat veggies. Carrot and Swede mash is incredibly low for the volume depending on the brand, like potentially 500g for 150 kcals, if made without butter. I LOVE this stuff. There's general steamed veggies too, cauli rice, etc. Spiralised veggies in tomato soup is amazing.  - Konjac noodles .. I mean, these need no introduction. Like 400g of these + some miso soup + vegetable stock (or not) and you've got a HUGE bowl of food for less than 100 kcal. You should par boil them before dry frying them, as they don't burn. This removes the jelly like texture.  - *SOME* ice lollies. In the UK we have ones that are 25 kcals, but they're quite small. I personally love a coconut milk one that has a dash of cream, tastes like coconut ice (duh) for 70 kcal and it's a typical pop.  - Popcorn.. Ofc.
