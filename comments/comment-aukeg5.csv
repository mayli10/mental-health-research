I’ve only binged a handful of times since starting to take it over a year ago, so from personal experience it’s definitely helpful!

I've been binging 5 days a week several times per day for months. My docs are acting like that's a mild case. Although, I don't live in the states currently so the FDA doesn't apply here.

I got prescribed it for other things but it also helps me for BED. I notice the difference in my appetite and feel the urge to binge less. Ive been taking it for awhile now and I feel like it has allowed me to distinguish when I'm actually hungry vs eating from boredom/anxiety. Now I will only really binge based on hormones from PMS. I have really enjoyed it and the energy that comes from taking it. I took adderall for years and hated how the stimulants worked, even the extended release version. I feel like this is more even and makes me less jittery. I take about 60mg and would highly recommend. ",False,False
