Chances are this has absolutely happened to her before. They’re trained for this so it’s not awkward to them. I wrote down the whole situation down in a journal and gave it to him to read. I prefaced it by saying “I really, REALLY don’t want to be here right now and I really don’t wanna have this conversation that’s about to happen but everyone has said that it needs to happen. Soo just read this.”  And it was fine.",False,False

If you don’t, chances are you’ll start holding things back and your progress will halt. Don’t feel weird. It happens ALLLLL the time. Same thing happened to me. I thought I might be gay and was scared to tell him because I didn’t want to see his reaction but I told him and he didn’t really react which made me realize I could trust him.  So then I developed a HUGE erotic transference and it was really frustrating but I told him and we worked through it and I realized a lot of things and I feel like I can trust him more and honestly it’s really only helped. It’s the MOST AWKWARD THING EVER to tell them but it’s so beneficial.",False,False

Brain tricks us a lot into thinking we're in love with them because they listen tonus and make us feel valid, yet they're doing this from a completely professional level. I've had ""crushes"" on my therapists, but have always known it's because of that, even when I was younger.  I never act on it (actively think about it) because I know 1. It's wrong and 2. I will completely forget about it when treatment is over.",False,False
