That being said, I know there is a lot of circumstantial things involved with recovery like money, time, support outside of it, etc. And it takes a lot of willpower and bravery in the first place just to start.

I pretend there's a regular meal in front of me like a large slice of lasagne and veg and go into details about the smell, the taste, the look, and it gets almost erotic because being able to eat something normal seems like a really amazing thing...instead of picking at a cold plate of bits of salad and a few beans or w/e.  My main envy is when other people are in the coffee shop I'm drinking a crappy Americano at and they're drinking fancy syrup things with cream on top and scoffing big slices of cake.  I can't even imagine what it'd be like to do that without any thoughts about calories and weight gain and just really enjoying drinking and eating.  I like to think they lack self control and I'm better than them, but that's not true.  They're the ones experiencing pleasure while I'm the miserable bish sipping flavoured water.  Ugh.",False,False
