I told him it was for baking but he mercifully doesn’t bat an eyelash when I weigh an apple or the portions of pasta I made us last night, etc.  ",False,False

Like if the box says 1 cup of cereal per serving then you want to measure out 1 cup for that 1 serving you are going to eat. Not a mixing bowl full of cereal. ,False,False

He’s asked about my food scale being in a cabinet before and i’ve been able to explain it as weighing dry foods for baking, but if he notices/asks why i’m weighing baby spinach someday I don’t know wtf I’ll be able to tell him!!  Also living with him definitely has me eating more of his foods, which are delicious but definitely not low cal :/ And I worry a lot that my weird eating habits that I’ve concocted around enjoying my allowed calories for the day will rub off on him :((((( ",False,False

It’s a lot easier to keep our habits when we are alone. i do applaud you for really putting effort for trying to eat “normally” around others even if it to avoid suspicion it’s a difficult thing. from my own experience it’s impossible to keep up with your own routines and rituals when people are constantly watching you. i just try to tell others i’m watching what i eat or if they want to go out i never have the money to go eat out too. don’t feel you need to justify every time you go treat yourself too something unhealthy with your friends. there will always be a next day ,False,False
