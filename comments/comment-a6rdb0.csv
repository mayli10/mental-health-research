I’ve been having a very rough and anxious night, so seeing comments that this actually did help a few of you made me feel so much better. I have very slightly improved some lives today - thank you for letting me know, as feeling useful makes a huge difference in my sense of self-worth (I feel like a waste of space most of the time). &lt;3",False,True

It makes me feel kind of like that, but usually it’s overridden by the weird face. I hate my face, but my “ugly” faces seem so much worse than those of my friends so it’s reassuring that there are other people who can make their faces look freaky like mine.  I promise I look like a troll, but things like &lt;any celebrity ever&gt; make me feel worse than the subreddit does because we only get to see their pretty faces most of the time and it seems like they can’t look bad.

Felt so naive when I first discovered it as I didn’t realise so many regular people shopped their pics.
