I have a divorced family, so my options are usually 'see my dad' or 'see my mum', though with my partner in the mix now I have the option to just see her too.   I could, in theory, tell my partner I'm with one member of my family, and then tell my family I'm with my partner. Everyone in my house is going to be out for the holidays, at various members of their own families house's etc. So I'd be 100% alone and I could just do whatever I wanted to do.   This whole holiday brings me nothing but anxiety and I hate it more and more each year because of the same reasons, and like after all this time you'd think I wouldn't be thinking of elaborate (and frankly sad) ways to get out of Christmas food etc. But yet here I am being an absolute weird shit, refusing to allow myself a few days of Christmas food.",False,False

My bf and I visit his family/friends in Montreal during the holidays so I have to pre-plan all my outfits. How the living hell am I to do that without knowing if I‚Äôll be bloated that day? Also, will other ppl even notice my buldging bloat or is this another ED mind trick made up in my head for only me to see?!?!

Mind you, I‚Äôm sure my metabolism was higher as my ED wasn‚Äôt as bad as it is these days.",False,False
