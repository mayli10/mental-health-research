Stay strong!!",False,False

I’ve decided to treat it as an anomaly and move on as if it never happened. Normally I would drop right into restriction and exercise. But I can’t restrict 100% because of all the people around, and I don’t have opportunity for exercise. Yesterday was a test of iron will not to restrict or binge but I managed somewhat to eat a portion of home cooked chicken for dinner even if I skipped everything except the meat.",False,True

They honestly sound like quite a feat and it just points to the inner strength that you have!  Relapses... happen, unfortunately :( I think vacations are especially difficult situations tbh and I can't imagine how awful it must feel. But please try reminding yourself that it doesn't cancel out any of your progress, and it's never too late to start another streak and continue on recovery.  Stay strong and take care &lt;3",False,False
