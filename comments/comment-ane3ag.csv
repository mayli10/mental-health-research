The doctor had asked me if I had any disordered eating, and I was honest with her, but I'm a normal weight and I don't b or p, so I'm not sure she really got the full scope of what I'm dealing with.   I am super careful now in making sure I get enough electrolytes, as that's what triggers the seizures. ",False,False

IDK it just made me feel tired and empty and head-achey ALL THE TIME. Naturally, I kept on trying to fix it with food.   I'm on Wellbutrin now and holy shit i feel like God on steroids. It's an SDRI, not an SSRI so I guess it works different than typical antidepressants. .... I just.. feel happy sometimes. Like inexplicably happy. It's crazy.   It also demolished my appetite for the first few weeks, which was a bonus  I'm on it for ADHD and OCD-related anxiety after I had a nervous breakdown and I've found it also helps me see things in the 'long run - as in, I'm now chill with eating at a 500-1000 cal deficit instead of a 2000 one. This has also greatly reduced bingeing behaviours, as well as the fact that I'm not eating as much bc I'm not anxious as much   All in all I've lost 16 lbs since starting it AND I've started to get my life back. I had to fight to get on Wellbutrin but I'm forever happy I did ",False,False

Also, a lot of anti depressants have nausea as a side effect. My body is SUPER sensitive to any changes so when I started taking prozac, I was nauseous all the time and lost like 8 pounds in one month without trying at all. That was before the ED flares back up so if I was on it now, I'd lose weight super fast. Also, important to note that it only causes weight gain because of increased appetite. So if you were to eat the same number of calories but spread out throughout the day so you can eat whenever you're hungry, you wont gain. Hope that helps",False,False

I've recently started on 100mg of Pristiq (desvenlafaxine) and it's helped my hunger a fair bit (to the point where I can do multi-day fasts).

If you have a family member who has had success with one of those, the Dr. is more likely to prescribe it (your brain chemistry is likely to be similar to that of your family members -and is likely to respond similarly to the same medication). That said, PLEASE be honest about your family medical history.  Falsifying your family medical history (especially when it comes to antidepressants) can be time-consuming, expensive, and potentially dangerous.  I don't mean to imply that you're likely to be dishonest. I'm just adding a little more info because I know from experience that ED brain is not always Safety brain.

SSRI’s have good success with eating disorders so it might help more than you expect. I’ve been on Prozac for my bulimia for just over a month now and I’m starting to notice feeling a little better. I was nervous about weight gain but haven’t noticed anything, but do keep in mind that different medications work differently on people and you may have to look around to find one that works for you!
