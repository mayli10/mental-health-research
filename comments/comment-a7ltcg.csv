The first time I lost weight I got rid of my large clothes after a few years because ""I'll never let myself get like that again"" SURPRISE BITCH lol. guess who got fat AF when they discovered alcohol. I wish I could go back to that time and bully myself into putting down the fucking fork.   The only time I've ever been able to lose weight was with either heavy restriction or depression loss of appetite.   Tbh for a long time I was in denial about restricting, then I'd come home starving, schmoke some schmoskies, and binge all night. Once I realized I was starving at night because I was restricting too much during the day, I decided to get better at restricting at night ðŸ™ƒ   I also really relate to the idea of ""if I restrict, I'll get skinny in a week"" me @ me: you know it doesn't work like that. But that don't stop a girl from trying. ",False,False

I know Iâ€™m at the normal/healthy weight and still have huge body dismorphia. So when I go a while without eating anything my friends will tell me Iâ€™m getting too skinny and donâ€™t look as good, then I get depressed about being skinny and donâ€™t let myself eat cause Iâ€™m a piece of shit and I donâ€™t deserve to eat. I loooove when Iâ€™m actually in a good head space, and can eat three meals a day, and go to the gym and see friends. But the good days are far and few in-between. ",False,False

I restricted got to my lowest weight a few years ago, since put on a stupid amount, my head has clicked to restriction again. Losing weight so Iâ€™m happy. I was seen by a clinic a couple years ago, but they only deal with anorexia and bulimia, so they basically said I was too fat to have an ED. At one point I was diagnosed with BED even though I was purging every day, only because I binged they said that.   The services are shit here.
