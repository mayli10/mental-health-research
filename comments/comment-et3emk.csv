If you are underweight, you are not healthy, especially if you have become that severely underweight through disordered eating habits. Another thing to keep in mind is that people with EDs often have a level of denial about the severity of their problem, which is another component of the disorder.",False,False

I definitely would suggest seeking treatment - I know how hard it can be to admit to others that there’s a problem, but it really sounds like you need professional help at this point.",False,False
