Just wait until you poop it out and your weight will be back to what it was shortly. I suggest drinking coffee to help speed up the process",False,False

I'm glad to hear that you let yourself go and have fun with your loved ones and I'm sure that most of not all of that weight is from bloating/water retention, which often takes some time to go down :(  Your recent fast has probably already probably put you back in a deficit, friend. Please keep yourself hydrated (helps with the water retention!!) and take care. Sending all my love.",False,False
