I loved being on it and miss it- it has a a very steady affect without the anxiety, at least for me. That being said, take as small of a dose as you can and try to not increase the dosage if you don't have to. Usually it just gave me dry mouth and lack of appetite, but too much pushed me into manic episodes and OCD.",False,False

It works perfectly when I don’t try to abuse it for weight loss (skipping it one day to kill my tolerance so that i won’t want to eat anything the next day). Taken as prescribed, I eat almost completely normally.",False,False
