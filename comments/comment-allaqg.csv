Both my parents grew up poor or relatively poor, and I was partially raised by my grandmother who grew up in Austria in the 1930's during their recession post WW1. Fridges were non existent/non-obtainable, or very small in my parents generation making food storeage difficult. I was taught to finish everything on my plate. Back then if you didn't know when your next meal was coming, you would eat as much as you can, and to be honest for them, the portions weren't large enough to worry about over consuming so they'd be finishing much smaller serving sizes  Times change though: we can put more food in the fridge/freezer, we have more proximity and supply of food, and more knowledge of diet/nutrition. I used to play sports, and would switch between running, and weightlifting seasons + always had a quick metabolism so I justified big meals but now that i exercise a little less and am older, I force myself to stop eating when I have had enough. I also eat fast (used to eat really fast) so I wouldn't realize I was full. I live with my brother who is out of the apartment 4 days a week for work and lives off of takeout so i only cook for myself.   &amp;#x200B;  Things to except are:  1. Its ok to put fridge back in the fridge. You'll likely finish it later and your net food consumption may decrease (see point 2) 2. Its just as wasteful to force feed yourself because that excess food is gluttonous and serves no actual benefit; there is a law of diminishing, and negative returns in food consumption. In fact excess eating can  cause you have a large appetite (artificially) and crave food when you don't need it. Controlling portions may decrease your appetite and decrease food consumption overall - referenced in point 1  (nothing wrong with indulging once in a while in excess eating, life is short, so some vices and hedonistic/gluttonous pleasures are to be enjoyed on    occasion)  3. Throw out spoiled or funky smelling food. Mitigating the risk of making yourself sick outweighs the cost of tossing out food. Sometimes plans change    spontaneously and cooking for yourself is hard to time mange. You get better at learning what to refrigerate, what to freeze. It also may be worth it to buy smaller    portions and  pay a little more per unit for dairy/eggs, some produce and other perishable goods that you cant freeze if you're not feeding a family.",False,False

My bf is trying to teach me it's okay to stop eating when you're full, like you don't HAVE to finish the plateful. But I'm struggling cos I hate waste.  Just realised it's ingrained in me because my mum doesn't leave little bits leftover or to throw away, she'll always eat them too. ",False,False

It makes me feel SO guilty even though I know me b/ping with it isn't any less wasteful than just throwing it away.

I live alone a buy lots of foods that I end up not touching because I'm too afraid. Last month I bought a whole gallon of milk and didn't touch it once. Same with almond milk. Two whole cartons wasted. Bread, wasted. Fruit, wasted.   I hate that I waste foods all the time so I'm limiting my grocery shopping and only buy small quantities of things I know I'll eat like soup.
