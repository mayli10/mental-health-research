To me, being called thicc is basically finding a ""nice"" name for someone who could afford to lose a few pounds. Maybe some people look good when they're thick, but I have a very petite bone structure, so I just look like a sausage if I have extra weight on me. Kpop culture really messed up my beauty standards",False,True
