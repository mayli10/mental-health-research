I don't want to suggest anything alarming as there are plenty of a common temporary illnesses which could be the culprit. A cold or the flu could easily be it. Of course, going to your GP over this with no reason to think it's anything serious could lead to treatment which is too harsh and pushes you back into old habits. I think seeing a clinician is a good idea. They won't know your entire medical history like your GP and will probably also look for more common causes of your symptoms rather than less common causes. Your GP might assume that you mean this is a big deal if you went to them instead of a walk-in clinic.",False,False
