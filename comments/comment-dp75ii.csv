I’ve been eating so much for two weeks because I’ve been staying with my grandparents. I’m finally leaving tonight and I can start my fast/restricting. I feel like my body has been poisoned with all the butter and fat I’ve been eating and I just need to flush my system then slowly start with my normal diet of broth, fruits and veg. I’m literally giddy thinking about starting the fast. It’s like a high for me.",False,False
