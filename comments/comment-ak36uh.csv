But I honestly kind of wished I would’ve gotten admitted since I am also a model and I would love to get insight on the weightloss process . I’m currently 5’10 and 140lbs . And although they didn’t tell me to “lose weight” I need to lose 3 inches off my hips to make money and get work . And you don’t see a lot of people on myfitnesspal or reddit who also have goals of achieving unhealthy “low weights” in a none-disorded way so in that sense skinnygossip is helpful . Gives a lot of good insight on the industry . But i gotta admit like a good chunk of the people on there are absolute retards for shaming beautiful women like Barbara for getting healthier after prolonged disordered eating like that’s just fucked ,False,False
