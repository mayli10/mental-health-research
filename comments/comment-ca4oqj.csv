Containing my meal to a small window meant the rest of the time i didnt have to think about food and count calories all the time. It meant i could chill out with logging and eventually i stopped altogether.       I really appreciate your response &amp; your concern, thanks for taking the time.  I am in a much better place mentally now and i dont wish to feel how i used to feel chasing a sub 90lb ugw because it was really difficult having to fight my body all the time and it felt futile sometimes. Even small successes of reaching a new low would be dampened by knowing how quickly that weight would come back in even a day. I am lucky because i managed to stay really active and had good muscle ratio so i never copped severe health issues from it but of course its not the ideal coping mechanism if at the end of the day it just causes more stress.

I get the same urges to go back to the way I was, because having that control in my life felt liberating because I was a sheltered teen. But even with the few upsides of the disorder you can‚Äôt ignore the things it does to you, the irreversible damage to you body, how it fucks your metabolism and body image. We associate being thin with happiness, it‚Äôs what I did. I thought being thin would make me happier, and I won‚Äôt lie it did, but I had to leave two jobs, and give up on my dream job because of what it did to my body. I still count calories and check my BMI to see if it‚Äôs below normal even though I‚Äôve recovered for the most part.  This isn‚Äôt the answer you may have wanted but it‚Äôs the one you need to hear, you‚Äôve recovered and there‚Äôs still time to fight this and not get sucked back in and irreversibly fuck up your body. You can still lose weight if you want to, but given your history I should warn you to pace yourself and not rush things, I almost totally relapsed with r/intermittentfasting and am still afraid of gaining weight. You still have time, make the right choice please.  Anyways, I answered the questions:  Media glamorized it and I didn‚Äôt know the extent of what I was doing   It helped me cope with bullying at school  I hate it when people downplay EDs, like saying ‚ÄúOh actress x is totally anorexic, look how thin she is!‚Äù  I get joy from helping people, that‚Äôs why I stay on these subs even after recovery. I also like reading and telling my dog he‚Äôs a good boy.",False,False

Mainly bp with periods of restriction  2. I have parents with high expectations for me in every area of my life including my looks. Also I'm fairly sure it has something to do with me being a picky eater as a child and responding maybe a bit too well to the praises i got for eating what was served lol  3. I feel like its one of my rare outlets for stress, but I hate what i did to my body and immune system.  4. Fear of being selfish and fear of not amounting to anything in life  5. Making people around me happy, buying cosmetics, petting dogs, house plants, hanging out with kids",False,False

Ex-BPer + restricter, also adhd as its currently understood.      2. Probably hypercritical mother / family were masive foodies / tendency to internalize negative things and equate success to self-punishment       3. Restricting helps me feel a sense of control over myself and gives me something to focus on when things feel overwhelming and bad. It makes me feel like im existing less when i dont really want to be there. -This is a double edged sword because even when i shrink myself and take up less space in the world, people take that space for themselves and i still end up feeling stifled. I mean this in a literal and figurative sense. Regardless of how much i control my own behaviour, sometimes other people will still suck and that isnt my problem.         4.  My pain points are: fear of being selfish/ungrateful for having wants and needs, fear of being unheard and not valued or respected, loss of my father and personal stagnation.       5. Things that make me happy: colours, art, painting my nails, stand-up comedy, preparing a beautiful meal and sharing it with a loved one, having meaningful or hilarious conversations with people i care about, watching my friends and family grow and change into wonderful people.",False,True
