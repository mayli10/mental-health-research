In 2017 when I was at my LW, I survived on 200-400 cals a day for months until a switch snapped and I dived deep into a binge cycle. Your body is probably just craving nutrients. The only reason why my binge cycle continued during that time was because I felt guilty about the binges and in a weird self-destructive way I just kept doing it. As long as you can try to accept it and just take each day as it comes, youâ€™ll be back on your normal intake before you know it and these past few days will be a distant memory.",False,False

Idk much about binge cycles but I know after long term low restriction, a few days of higher calories literally feels like it can save your life!!  Your body has been seriously depleted, not just of calories but also nutrients and trace elements and electrolytes. Youâ€™ve not done a bad thing ðŸ’•",False,False
