I just moved from CA to WA suddenly, knowing no one here, so I feel lonely a lot. Maybe anorexia is my only friend,,,, lol.  I stopped going to the gym because I don’t have time for it (in law school, also always working), and I think eating little to nothing is also another compensation.  Idk if this is weird, but when someone comments on my weight the ED part of my brain gets so happy. Generally though, it’s bothersome. I lost all my curves (I used to have a really nice butt bc squats, lol), and recently someone called me a toothpick at work.  I’m not sure what to do at this point. I’m terrified to gain, but I’m terrified to lose more at risk of getting sent to treatment if I were to pass out or something one day at school or work.  Thank you for asking. Typing this out made me have a few realizations.",False,True

And yes, some people are mean/awkward about it... but taken together, it sounds like a lot of people... people who care for you, and otherwise are noticing.   I know I hate that as well, I don't want anyone talking about me or my weight.   But I would counter that if they push, they are concerned. I don't think the person was being malicious, but being blunt... which is really painful.   Are you doing ok?",False,False

There a quite a few though, that just point it out just to point it out. I had a girl ask me what my weight was and when I told her, she said “that’s so skinny!” I just said thanks? And she said “it’s not a compliment, you so unhealthy, eat a burger”. That is what bothers me.",False,True

My company shared a building and cafeteria with a healthcare company. Every day at lunch I would go to the cafeteria and get a salad and various women (all of whom were pushing 350lbs) from the healthcare company would say something along the lines of, “geez  have a burger already.” Which is horrifically inappropriate to say A) in the work place, B) to someone you don’t know, C) to someone half your age, D) when you work for a company that is supposed to be about health and burgers aren’t healthy and I could have an eating disorder or a health condition otherwise.   After over a year of this I finally snapped when my best friend/work wife was like, “why do you put up with this?” So I talked to them. Then I talked to my HR and their HR. I took down names off of visible badges and dates and times and things they said. And it never stopped. Finally, I gave up and went mean. Every time one of them would say something to me I’d fire back with something like, “Maybe if you had a salad your arm wouldn’t be the size of my waist.” AND SUDDENLY I WAS THE ASSHOLE. Keep in mind these are women in their late 30s to 50s who are all pushing 350lbs working at a health care company PICKING ON A 19 YEAR OLD GIRL WHO CLEARLY IS UNDERWEIGHT AND NEUROTIC. People are awful.",False,False

I can't even go out to get groceries or be at work without someone starring at me or commenting on my weight or asking if I eat or asking if I want something to eat. It was great getting the skinny comments at first but it's so annoying now. I REALLY hate it when someone says how thin I am in front of alot of people cause then EVERYONE around starts looking at me pointing out my bones that are sticking out etc.,False,False
