But things prior to that are important, I suppose.  When I was growing up, I was bullied all throughout school and my mother told me when I was about 8, to just deal with it. She was emotionally neglectful and sometimes outright emotionally abusive. When I was 16, my Dad died of cancer and my family fell apart.  When I was 19, I got involved with a guy about 7 years older than me. He was abusive psychologically, and even more so sexually. He left me feeling that I deserved what he did to me and that if I were a better person, he would have treated me better.  I started binge eating once the PTSD kicked in a few years later (a delay in symptoms isn't uncommon) but I was also dating a guy online. We met and spent some time together. And then when I went to visit him, he neglected to tell me that he decided to date a 15 year old girl (he was 24 mind you - and found it offensive that I told him I can't believe he would want to date a child). I felt really, deeply betrayed because he'd been my main support for years, and then he just disappeared.  So I got it into my stupid brain that if I went on a diet and lost some weight, he might be interested again. I also found that having a focus, like calories and exercise gave me a reason to stop feeling suicidal. So I just went with it. I went quite quickly into restricting and over exercising. I'd walk 20 minutes to the gym each way and then work out for 60 to 90 minutes 6 to 7 days a week.  Then when I reached my goal weight, I stopped. And the weight came back on. So I started purging, restricting, and bingeing. And it's never really gone away, I think the purging particularly persisted for so long because it helped me feel normal again when the memories and self hate were just too much. And though I did get a really solid handle on the purging for a few years, I was stabbed in a domestic incident (I tried to stop my neighbour from killing his wife) last year and now I'm heavier than ever and still purging.  Sorry it's so long!",False,False

So I started eating less, nothing too bad. Then I got onto pro-ana sites, and that majorly triggered me into super low restricting. That in turn caused binging, which caused me to purge. And I've basically just been repeating that same, restrict/binge/purge cycle for about two years now. ",False,False

Looking back at photos I look skinny but in those moments I felt huge, my bone structure looked odd to me, I guess I felt different from other girls. My mum was and is still obsessed with her weight, constantly exercising and yo-yo dieting, always kinda making me feel that I needed to be skinny to be happy. She would always tell me that we had the fat gene and I guess it scared me more than I realised and seeing her hate herself so much.  When I was a teenager I was pretty mentally ill and going through a lot of trauma and gradually put on a fair amount of weight. The thing is I never was sure I was fat.. I have never had a sense of what I look like and had never weighed myself but the clothing size was telling enough. One time at 17 I went to the doctors and they told me I was overweight and that was the reason for my menstrual problems (it wasn't) but like no one had ever really said it so it hit me hard and I started to fast and from that point I haven't really stopped obsessing.

We still talk but I got out and I don't live with them anymore. The kicker is he's actually overweight, like, very overweight.  When I come home now everytime I eat something near him it's ""Wow you must really be hungry"" or ""You really finished those off quickly didn't you!"". Which either triggers me to binge eat secretly or fast. He still only compliments my appearance when I'm underweight. I'm not blaming him for my ED, but he definitely set the match to the tinder I guess. ",False,False

Going hungry makes me feel more in control. Hoarding food makes me feel secure. Binging feels...terrible and wonderful?  When I was 8, my parents divorced and my mother blamed me for it. I switched schools and felt very alone and unworthy. I played tons of little mind games with myself. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not allowed to breathe until the second hand reaches the 5.‚Äù Or ‚ÄúI‚Äôm safe as long as I keep moving.‚Äù And I would fidget and pace in circles. It was very ritualistic, but not really OCD. It was a short step to finding out that fasting was excellent punishment and I would see how many days I could go without eating.  I was taken to specialists to find out why I stopped gaining weight and threw up a lot. No one ever considered that I was doing it in purpose. Ended up with a prescription for Ensure, but I convinced my mom that it tasted so bad she should get me Slim Fast instead.  I‚Äôm in my 30s now, maintaining a healthy weight for the most part, but my ED had never gone away. When I underperform at work, I skip lunch. I exercise purge and binge and mostly get comments about ‚ÄúI wish I could eat and workout like you‚Äù   Haha. No you don‚Äôt.",False,False

I attend middle school - Hotel management in the Hotel academy.  We were on a week long trip from school to Italy. To the moment we had arrived to our destination (as a class), I was somewhat content with being obese and tbh unattractive and floppy. In Italy - for the first time in my life being near the sea and in the warm weather all the time, I had realised how fat I am, how non of my T-shirts, swimsuits or shorts suit me (which was the reason I did not swim once in a whole week), how I have tendencies to hide my body and sweat my ass off all the time etc. The fact we were eating quite a little amounts of food because we were too lazy to cook, and we were walking and moving all the time, made me crave the food less and lose weight. When I arrived back home, I was 5 kilos lighter and used to move much more then before. It was the first summer in probably 5 years I wore dress at least once a week and started to steadily eat less and less, move more, excercise, run every night and then I started to crave everything. I was maybe 90 kilos at that point and I started purging every little ""forbidden"" thing I've managed to eat. It started with one piece of bread, went through one piece of pizza and now I binge and purge daily, huge quantities of food. I am at my lowest weight now (in those 2 years of suffering) and at the height 174 centimetres I weigh 71 kilos. My circulation is all messed up, I have bruises all over my body, I am deathly pale and looking tired as fuck. If I can say something for sure, that bitch of a number on that scale is not worth all of this. And if I ever get out of this God damn circle, I will probably do everything I can to help others out, because this is ridiculously stupid and no one should suffer like this. Even if you don't like yourself at all.",False,False

I pushed into overweight a few times and I felt that way at all times, but in hindsight looking at my photos I was just mostly pretty chonk, getting worse in sad times, and better in good times.  I was bullied, really really hard. Like physically, psychologically, whatever. Constant name calling, constant shaming about my body, constant groping, touching, hitting, pinching. It wasn't just the kids either, teachers would get in on it. I remember once at a swimming lesson my teacher literally called me a 'great fat whale' and the entire class laughed at me. That wasn't what triggered the ED but I feel like that constant, verbal/physical beatdown over years and years became the voice inside my head that tells me to restrict.     What triggered the ED was a specific moment, my Dad was yelling at me, we were arguing, I just sit down at the kitchen table and put my head in my hands and cry my eyes out. He comes over to me, and for some reason I remember thinking ""Oh, my god this is it, this is the moment he admits this is wrong"" he says ""hey, look at me"" and I look up ""everytime I see you... every single day... You're fatter and uglier than the day before.""  ....  Anyway, that just sort of broke me. I hardcore restricted. I wanted to prove to everyone that I wasn't fat, and that I wasn't ugly, but it never came. My Dad just told me how 'healthy' and 'fit' and 'in shape' I was looking. All the way until I was hospitalised. ",False,False

Started college and had no place to store food in my dorm, wanted to start eating healthy only at the dining hall and all healthy food, took advantage of gym access.  I probably lost 3-5 pounds and noticed I got a lot more attention and also noticed it made my face look better.  Then started eating less and noticed more weight loss and just got hooked.
