Yeah Tumblr was so weirdly self destructive. They've been making terrible, TERRIBLE site management decisions since 2012 and it's been slowly driving their users away. but back in 2012 and 2013 it was just a meme. like ""oh tumblr staff, you're so silly! focusing on making tumblr look prettier instead of fixing broken stuff!"" but Tumblr has been shockingly incompetent... I miss the good days too but they totally shot themselves in the foot lmfao.  I don't know what Peach is either lmaoooooo I know it's an app. I avoided trying it because it seems to be down a lot.

Not to risk sounding ancient but I really do miss the good days of tumblr, when fandoms basically ruled like factions, everyone just wanted to pull off thigh high socks, and people put in an insane amount of effort into their themes. (I can't believe i really learnt how to code freaking music players just for the site to die). I feel like mental health communities in general have simply died due to site crack downs, like remember when you would just scroll through tumblr and see self harm talk and ed talk and all types of mental health brutal honesty and now everyone's trying to be as woke and self-care-y as possible. Honestly tumblr had its major flaws but they gutted it to the point of no repair, I think apple taking them off the apple store until they cleaned up was the final stab that killed it. Now its just twitter screenshots and politics.   MPA is hell now, I used to use that all the time and i went back literally yesterday and smelt the poison from a mile away.   what the heck is Peach i keep hearing about that but i feel like an absolute alien",False,True

Tumblr cracked down HARD. and 2011-2012 was actually Tumblr's peak, when they had the highest number of users. I totally remember this time too, the ED community was huge. But so was the platform it was hosted on, and Tumblr was basically the best place for the ED community because the platform was lax enough to host them.  Until the ED community got out of hand and started leaking out, prompting a new wave of anti-pro-ana sentiments that let to Tumblr cracking down.  At the same time, Tumblr started imploding for other reasons. Namely terrible site management. So now the userbase has shrunk by like 80~90% between 2012 and 2019. Literally. Tumblr is nothing now.  So that's part of why the ED community seems to evaporated... Tumblr was basically a catalyst for it and it's gone now.  But there's still a community. I find there's also a sizeable community on Instagram as well, but IG is pretty aggressive about ""thinspo"" and ""self harm posts"" and all that too. Where's everyone else? Not sure. I used MPA for a while but I wouldn't recommend that site as it's also gone down the shitter. But I know that's where tumblr ""refugees"" went to, and those that left seemed to end up on Instagram or Peach.  At this point, I feel like our thinspo is largely outsourced from skinny Russian instagrammers and kpop idols.",False,False
