But also I think I have a big forehead. My husband says I do but it does make me insecure so I do believe that being skinny makes up for that and makes my forehead a non issue because my body looks nice. But I have body dysmorphia I think because some days I honestly think my face is so ugly.,False,False

What you say about yourself does effect how you feel about yourself. If you constantly say self-depricating things you'll continually feel worse and worse about yourself. Be kinder to yourself. I'm certain it will help with your confidence :),False,False

In all actuality I'd be pretty devastated to hear someone call me that. Its funny when I'm shit talking myself, but the idea of grown adults (and high schoolers) actually singling out someone and making fun of their appearance, to their face or otherwise, is a whole other kind of icky.   I probably shouldn't be using it on myself if I'd look down on people for doing it to others. I'm trying to work on talking out of my ass so much, but it's a process lol",False,False

It's just so gross.
