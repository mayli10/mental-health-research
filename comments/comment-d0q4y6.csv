It's worth it to look for a new one that you really trust and respect, otherwise you'll never make any progress.  One idea is to look for dietitians who don't necessarily specialize in EDs.

(Like no, it's not as simple and ironclad as people on loseit necessarily think, but for the decided majority of the population, consistently eating under your estimated TDEE results in fat loss.) And no, restriction doesn't ""stop working."" (...If that were the case, no one would ever starve to death.)   I wouldn't say HAES is ""wrong,"" in the sense that there are legit forms of HAES (that basically say people in any body/condition should work toward feeling good &amp; physically capable in that body, without shame). But then there the ""insane troll logic"" types of HAES (that suggest things like ""weight loss is impossible for virtually everyone,"" ""it's psychologically damaging to deny cravings,"" ""there are no significant health problems associated with chronic obesity,"" etc).  From context, I'd assume this person leans toward the latter end of the spectrum, in which case...yeah, no.
