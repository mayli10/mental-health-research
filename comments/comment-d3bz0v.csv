I do purge (in most of the purging ways), but restriction is definitely the biggie.    Yeah I don't want to it to be ""too late"".

I hope I can get some sort of help, I'm just scared that day treatment round 2 wont be enough, but I'll express my concerns in the appointment.",False,True

Our bodies are pretty amazing at adapting to malnutrition. If we wait until something is medically wrong before getting treatment, it can often be too late. Not meeting criteria for inpatient does not mean that you do not warrant treatment. Take care of yourself &lt;3  As an unrelated question, anyone else have mildly low WBC? I randomly have that, too, and never connected it with restrictive eating, but now I’m curious.",False,False

You are seriously sick and deserve to get better regardless of which program you are placed in.   I highly recommend the book *Sick Enough* by Jennifer Gaudianai. She is a doctor who specializes in EDs and she focuses on management of physical symptoms of EDs. Most doctors are not very knowledgeable about EDs so you may want to ask your doctor(s) to read it as well.,False,False

On the ""sick enough"" here are some ideas - one way to frame it might be you are (or aren't) ""sick enough to need 24 hour a day care"". It doesn't mean you're not sick, it means they don't think they can help you enough in other settings. I guess I don't think of people in IP as ""sicker"" than others, I think of them as needing that setting. (I also never wanted to be in IP and never was, so I'm perhaps coming from a slightly different perspective). I don't know if that helps at all but we're here for you.",False,False
