Always. Forever. Hell, *five*ever. I can remember sitting in my kindergarten classroom wishing I was as skinny as the other girls, even though I've never been overweight a day in my life and in fact have always been on the smaller side. I remember standing waist-high with my mother in grocery store checkout lines ogling anorexic-era Nicole Richie. I've been sucking in my stomach since I was a toddler. I used to tie scarves around my waist to make it look smaller and even injured myself doing it once. I spent my whole childhood daydreaming about growing up and going on a diet.   I feel like I was *born* with an eating disorder There's a very strong history of it in my family and there's solid evidence supporting genetic contributors to the development of disordered eating, so I don't think it was like, a *choice* in that I *decided* to but it, but rather, I more just a conscious and pointed way of succumbing to the constant weight and shape related internal hell I'd experienced my entire life.   I'd been sitting at the computer in the hallway, home alone, watching anorexia recovery videos on youtube just so I could see the super skinny ""before"" pictures, guiltily eating chinese food leftovers, and after literally weeks of ""trying to be anorexic"" (I never gave safe dieting a shot. I was obsessed with eating disorders and felt that I needed to have one). Then, I came across a lyric video for Tied Together with a Smile by Taylor Swift and read all the comments about how it was about her bulimic friend, and I was just *so* jealous of all the girls in the comments talking about their own eating disorders. I just got up, went to the bathroom, and stuck my fingers down my throat.   It sounds stupid as fuck but I think that's just when those thoughts that had always brewed in my head boiled over into action. ",False,False

In time you will look back at running as the torture mechanism you used in the depths of your anorexia. The passion it gives you, the sense of purpose it provides, all of it will be ruined.  Your attempts to exert extreme control over your habits will backfire. This period of feeling super in control will be followed by the part where you are, in your inner critic's eyes, a lazy and selfish failure. The failure, in contrast, achieves NOTHING. You're going to be stuck in this cycle of all or nothing.   There's clearly some kind of a division in your mind, which will start manifesting its existence in various ways now that you're starting to figure out adulthood. And you are unable to prevent the fact that it **will** manifest. The ***way*** it manifests, however, can still be affected. Please consider another way of expressing your extreme need to control. Some way that won't cause irreversible damage to your body. Some way that won't ruin the form of exercise that you've grown to love so much. Some way that won't ruin your relationship to the fuel of life.  On the other hand, you're just doing what feels right. If you still want to pursue this way of life that's understandable.
