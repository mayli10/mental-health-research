I always had an hourglass figure which makes me dysphoric as hell, so I want to lose as much weight as possible so my figure can be more androgynous- especially since top surgery did nothing to change how often I get misgendered lmfao. My breasts may be gone but people see my gigantic fucking Hartman Hips and immeduately think ""WOMAN!!!!!""  It fucking sucks",False,False

It is possible that I see ED/Suicide as my ideal option because I don't wish to endure the issues/possible catastrophes that can accompany a gender transition. It would never actually make me happy to do those things.  When I was thin, I was angular and sharp, I didn't have breasts and I hadn't menstruated in years. It was amazing, and that is where I feel the most safe. Working towards that again because I realized that my curvy, heavier, recovered shape was making me miserable in many ways without me being aware of it.  Not sure if this is helpful, and I don't mean it to be harmful in any way, but I've wanted to be a dude ever since I was a little girl, but never did anything about it outside becoming a skeleton who wore ""men's"" clothing.",False,False

I think it all boils down to having a lack of control with many aspects such as being trans &amp; major dysphoria, family life and negative changes, which subconsciously led me down an ED route. If I can't seemingly control anything going on around me I'm taking control of my body because it's the only thing I feel I have control over.",False,False

I also think I actually struggle more with my body shape now than I did pre-T, since I didn't start hormones until I was nearly 22, so while my fat did redistribute, my actual hips are still wide. It makes it difficult to find clothes that I think are flattering, especially dress clothes when I have to tuck in my shirt.   Also, have you heard of [T-FFED](https://www.transfolxfightingeds.org/)?",False,True
