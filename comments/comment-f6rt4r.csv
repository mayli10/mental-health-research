Once I went to bed and woke up and the scale said I was 7 lbs heavier. I wasnt actually 7 lbs heavier, it was just constipation and water weight because at the time I was only eating around 600 cals a day. So u good.",False,False

I got to a point where even eating over 300 calories I would gain/maintain weight.  I got put into treatment and after a few days eating at a higher amount, I started losing again. Don't really get the science of it but that was my experience and I kept losing after that.   Water weight is a bitch though- could be all sorts of things like hormones, salt, stress or even the weather. I've used water retention tablets during pms before but be careful about taking them if you are fasting.  Look after yourself x",False,False
