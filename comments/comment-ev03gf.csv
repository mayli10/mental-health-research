In other news, my father died this morning. I feel overwhelmed. I feel like I don't have the right to be upset, because it's not as though he really cared about me anyway, and I hadn't seen him in about two years, but I dunno, I'm still crying. Now I want to binge and restrict at the same time to deal with it. I'm a fucking idiot.  Thank you for always putting these threads up.",False,False

I told my mom I wasn’t feeling well this morning and she said “probably because you never eat anything.” After that she was prying me about not eating all day. Makes me feel like total shit but at least I’ll be skinny eventually right? Other than that today wasn’t terrible I guess. I’m pretty comfortable with how much I ate at least. I played call of duty with some friends I haven’t seen in ages and it was a great time. Helped me get my mind off things. It’s the little things that count right?,False,False

Read the NYT article on the Bolton manuscript. Hope they nail him down. I will call Will when I feel like bingeing  it can’t continue. No longer getting empathy from parents as they seem to just be annoyed when I tell them.   I would want the instant room cleaning, I hate organizing things but love the way brushing my teeth and showering feels.",False,True
