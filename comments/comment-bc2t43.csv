I would eat so healthy and would just ‘pick’ at things here and there. I would have 3 meals of 300-400 calories each and then pretty much be constantly snacking whenever there was food around, but I would drastically underestimate the calories in my snacks when I tracked them. Long story short I damaged my metabolism from not eating enough and then I couldn’t help but to eat huge meals some days and then restrict for the following days. Binging is your body’s way of saying it is HUNGRY! You aren’t weak or undisciplined because you binge; your body is just trying to get the nutrients you need.   The way I finally got a healthier relationship with food is by allowing myself to eat more. I raised my calories by 100/day each week until I reached my maintenance calories, which is about 2100 calories. This is a HUGE difference from the 1400 calories or so per day that I ate for yearsss. Right now it seems like your body is deprived so it is trying to hoard away the food as fat. When you give your body what it wants (i.e. enough calories) your body will use the food for fuel. I really hope this helps you in some way because constantly restricting and worrying about food, like I did for years, is not a way to live your life!",False,False
