You’ve made so much progress and it’s a bit unrealistic to expect your mindset to completely change in a fraction of the time that you spent living very disordered. I’m glad you don’t identify with your disorder anymore, that’s a huge barrier to many people’s recovery because giving up the ED means giving up a piece of themselves. A lot of people end up where you are and some end up staying in that twilight zone of recovery for the rest of your life. Whether you will or not is up to you.   It sounds like at this point you are stuck with a lot of behaviors that are ingrained from habit. The foods and amounts that are comfortable to you won’t expand unless you actively broaden your horizon. Likewise, the occasional b/p session needs you to confront and actively want to change to be resolved. I understand how exhausting it is to feel like you’re doing so much better, but still seeing more work to be done. People get so frustrated with the ambivalence toward recovery but ask any normal person if they would love to put in the work of constantly questioning every thought that goes through their head, constantly fighting against your own thoughts, having to accept that you lie to yourself constantly, all the while trying to find something to replace the comfort and safety that these thoughts have given you, for YEARS. It’s worth it but it’s hard so don’t beat yourself up for getting off the self-improvement train for a little bit. It sounds like you sense your life could be more, and are thinking about hopping back on it. You totally should but start small. Make a goal for yourself like “I want to eat more kinds of food” and eventually work up to the goal of “I don’t want to have anxiety about food anymore.” Do you have a therapist? Someone like that or a counselor or a recovery coach could be very helpful to break things down to help you achieve your goals.   Congrats on your recovery progress. I’m sorry you’re still struggling but I think you should be very proud of where you are.",False,False
