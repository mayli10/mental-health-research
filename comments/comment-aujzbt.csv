I love sitting alone with water and coffee and just doing my work. My head feels so much clearer. I know what I need to do and I get it done. The greatest thing is even when I'n anxious and teary-eyed about it (like this morning with my homework), I recover from that so much quicker, rationalize my emotions and can still do my work despite them. Binging throws that all out of the window though, I'm a horrible student when I'm binging. I don't do anything but binge, cry, and do my work at the last minute when I've had enough time with an empty stomach to be able to concentrate.
