It's essentially double damage, you can't purge everything so your sugars will still be affected, and then you're getting the purging effects on top of that too.   Diabetics are especially prone to EDs because we need to constantly monitor intake for our condition, you definitely aren't alone. It's so so hard to deal with ED thoughts when your condition revolves around food. But please, puring is NOT worth it, it WILL make things worse. My experience is obviously slightly different to yours but the effects will be the same. I went through years of it and was hospitalised in the end. I still struggle with BED and neglecting my sugar control sometimes, but not nearly as much as I used to, my body literally cannot handle it any more.  You can get through this, I believe in you!",False,False
