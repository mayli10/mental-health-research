He's just trying to hit you where he thinks it will hurt since you bruised his ego. Plenty of men do the exact same thing and they all assume the worst thing a woman can be is fat. It really ism't a reflection of you. Gross men just call women who reject them fat and ugly. It only proves how little they think of women if looks are so important to them. It really only sucks that he said this to you and happened to be someone with an eating disorder.,False,False

I usually recommend blocking people like this, because many of them feed on reactions, but it takes a lot of guts to actually tell one of those losers off. I think you should be proud.   And seriously, while I know you know this, you HAVE to ignore his bullshit. Unfortunately, there are MILLIONS of shitty dudes out there who message tons of people basically just seeing how far they can get with ""I wanna [ugh] your [whatever], you sexy [whatever]."" And when they're rejected they lash out however they can. It legit has nothing to do with you or your personal appearance.   Like I'm friends with someone super hot, and a shitty dude once messaged them that they were a ""4/10 at best so I would've had to be drunk af to fuck you anyway."" She's a fucking clothes model. She's gorgeous. And that's what she got messaged on kik. It has *nothing* to do with you.",False,False

Sounds like this guy is just toxic and has nothing going for him. Men have been socialized to think they're ""owed"" women and sex. When they're rejected, it's a direct attack on what they think they deserve. It's so fucked up, but kudos to going in on him!!!!!   You are NOT expendable!!! You're probably even not chunky!!! And if you are, you sound like a well-spoken, thoughtful, nice person and that vastly outweighs any perception of your body as ""chunky."" I'm really sorry his words affected you in such a way, even though I hate my dad, all his comments about me being fat still echo around my head. Try to remind yourself that this was literally one comment from a loser - who probably only made that comment because he knew he could hurt you. GROSS I HATE MEN!!!!",False,False
