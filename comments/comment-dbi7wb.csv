Accidentally falling into ED mindsets and telling ourselves that it‚Äôs totally fine and healthy I get and we‚Äôve all been there.  But to call people who are struggling with restrictive EDs ‚Äúpsychotic teenage girls‚Äù really gets me.  First of all, most ED sufferers don‚Äôt experience psychosis (a literal, diagnosable, separate medical condition), and not all of us are female (I think estimates put it at around 1/3 male and 2/3 female- not sure where the 16% of trans* people with EDs fit into those numbers).  But also, and this is a personal pet peeve, I really hate the vilification of teenage girls, especially when it comes from older men. Teenage girls are under so much pressure and all the ones I know are incredible people making a real difference in the world. And yet they get made fun of pretty much no matter what they do.  Drives me absolutely nuts, all of it.",False,False
