But I just have such a hard time ""seeing"" myself, does that makes sense? I just seem to be having more intrusive thoughts lately and I'm frantically looking for what I think is validation. I'm tempted to make a post on r/loseit asking opinions on my current bmi (like if it actually makes me skinny) but I feel like that's a super disordered behaviour and probably not a good idea lol. Just kinda looking for strategies to overcome these kinds of frantic urges so I don't do anything I regret.",False,True

I usually get through dysmorphic episodes by physically looking down at my body in comparison to the people I’m standing/sitting next to or literally contorting my body to see my self from a more realistic angle. I will also physically touch and feel my bones or wrists to remind myself that I’m not actually 6’5 and 400 pounds.,False,False
