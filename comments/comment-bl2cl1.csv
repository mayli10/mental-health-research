Almost happened a handful of times but thank the stars I learned to recognize the symptoms and took my sorry ass to the ER.

That's more of a heavy-period problem than an ED-problem in my case though.   I *hella* support supplement use (and visiting a GP to figure out exactly which ones you need and which in which doses). Recovery is a fucking journey and not everyone is willing or able to do it so it's important that we take care of ourselves while we're unwell; in case the day we recover is too far to reach without their aid, or in case that day never comes and that's what it takes to get as many days as you can.",False,False
