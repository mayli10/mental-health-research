Just look at your weekly calories - of course you feel more limited because you're trying to eat at a deficit, but most thin people can eat at least 1500 without working out. 1700-2000 with. Hell, I got to a BMI of 12.8 at 5'1"" eating 1400+ most days on average (that included accompanying my bf to a buffet and eating 2000 in a single sitting maybe once or twice a month). But it did take over a year and a half. When you're not always thinking about the lack of food nor afraid that one binge will undo a month of deficits, and your body is already ""accustomed"" to maintaining a smaller size, it's actually harder to constantly gain because your appetite reduces after a restaurant-sized meal",False,False

Nobody really questions you or your choices anymore when it's all out there. I'll go out to dinner like 2-3 nights a week, but I get salads a lot or restrict the rest of the week. I also only really do OMAD anyway so it all evens out. I spent the entirety of the summer eating like 6,000 calories on weekends but leveling it out during the week through restriction and exercise so I've maintained my low weight the entire time.",False,False

I'm keto and a non-drinker so it helps. I'll order things like ""chicken on a bed of rice with vegetables"" from a restaurant, then tell them to give me extra vegetables and no rice, which cuts out a good 300 calories from the dish. Then I'll eat most of the vegetables and just some of the chicken. Or get a burger and fries, but no bun on the burger and vegetables instead of fries which saves hella calories. I recently went to a friend's house for a gathering and she said there would be all these dips so I brought my own cauliflower. Bonus points is everyone thinks I'm extremely healthy because they have no idea that when I'm alone I live off of diet soda, sugar free jello, modafinil and nicotine.",False,False
