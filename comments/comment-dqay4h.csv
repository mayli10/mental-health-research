Maybe she was meaning to help and had good intentions but she was way off in helping. I find most people make stupid comments about eating. My partner tells me to either work off extra eating at the gym or to poop it out ðŸ™„  I just say hey it doesnâ€™t work that way. Or I try my best not to hold any comments against them.   My mom still talks about eating healthy and not eating too much junk and gaining weight.   In my situation, I know everyone is just trying to make me feel better and help but their follow through is just really bad. But hey, Iâ€™m not always the greatest at helping either.",False,False

Eating disorders really fuck up relationships. Tonight I had a massive argument with my mum, and Iâ€™m a fucking wreck. Worst argument weâ€™ve had in ages, and yesterday was so lovely. Could cry about it forever, and I donâ€™t think sheâ€™ll really forgive me for the things Iâ€™ve said. Not that it was all my fault, though.   Do you argue with people over food often? &lt;3",False,False

I know why she was happy, she probably felt as if it was the beginning of me recovering (quite the opposite in reality), and for a mother that feeling must have been precious.  That being said I have asked her to stop talking about my eating habits plenty of times in the past and she just keeps doing it, which is a big factor in why I got so mad today.",False,True

You should bring that up later, but don't call her immature, just talk about how it made you feel and ask her not to talk about stuff like that with you because it's triggering. Good luck, parents can really suck ass sometimes haha.",False,False
