It makes it so hard to break the cycle. I feel that with family making comments on weight esp over studies or other things we're doing with our lives :( got no advice aside from try to get out and stay distracted with good things as much as you can (walking around stores, talk with friends often) but I feel you on all that.",False,False

Go to the gym, eat healthy, and just keep at it.  You can never control what others say or think.  All you can do is stay on your journey, speak up if you are having trouble, and remind yourself to be healthy.    And as someone with a PhD, my family never ever asks about my studies.  When I was a sports reporter they didn’t talk about sports at all.  When I worked for a U.S. Senator, we never talked politics.  Now that I’m in academia, all we do is talk about sports and politics.  Go figure.    Some of us have amazing wonderful families that make others jealous with how kind they are and some of us have garbage families that are borderline worthless.  All we can do is be supportive, say kind things, and if they are toxic cut them out of our lives.  But it sounds like they’re trying to be nice, they just don’t know that they’re impacting you.",False,False
