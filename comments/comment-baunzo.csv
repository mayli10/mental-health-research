It’s gonna be an uphill struggle if you’re suffering from ED - because the disorder will make your head run counter to many best practices in lifting, cutting, and muscle gain. I think a good strategy for you would be to seek out non-ED athlete information on the goals you want to attain and methods commonly used, and in parallel manage your ED. and that can be really hard, but try to allow the information from the athlete side into your head, because it comes from an unbiased source.   Our own ED brains will lie to us. I can attest to this as I do a lot of cycling and part of that is to eat while riding, but I kept “forgetting” to eat because deep deep down I thought “calorie burn is better”, as a result followed stress injury, and fatigue.   Being involved in a sport can help you a bit with your ED in that way - your sports brain will have to outsmart your ED brain. But again, it ain’t easy, and stay in your existing ED support network.",False,False

You need rest days to let your body recover (and actually grow muscles).  due to the sub, i assume your goal is weight loss, but hopefully it's actually muscle gain - know then that lifting on a calorie deficit is counterproductive and a recipe for overreach, fatigue and injury.  if your goal is just to ""punish"" your body with calorie burn, just do whatever cardio and don't waste time with lifting.",False,False
