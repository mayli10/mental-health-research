It’s fucking fucked up out here y’all lmao  TW NUMBERS i dont know how to do the thing where you cover it up so this is the warning sorry  . . .  . .    And the thing is I only know because once one of the other girls got drunk and broke down about it (not just about ED but other mental issues as well) at a party and the rest of us went to comfort her and ended up drinking more and all ended up confessing as well. Now at lunch hour it’s always a 4-way Spider-Man meme.   I’d question if every single girl on earth has an ed, but tbf we are all the most obvious ed people at school ( like one of us gets up at 5 am and works out for 2 hours before school and goes to dance class everyday, another has gained 40 pounds in like a year, the third is stick thin and will only eat chocolate and baked goods in tiny amounts, and I’ve lost maybe 30 pounds in the last few months and only eat veggies)",False,False
