Good nutrition is an important part of recovering from any illness, even mental illnesses. A lot of people neglect that the brain has needs just like any other organ. For proper function it needs the proper resources. That means vitamins, minerals, water, and energy. The better your nutrition the better you'll feel overall. It's not a cure for your ED, but it will help.",False,False

Esp the links those are rlly helpful. What I’m getting from what you said is that food=nourishment and an occasional treat is manageable. I really do like fruits so cutting out added sugar when I crave sweets is definitely doable. Only thing I’m worried about is this focus on healthy eating might spark my orthorexia to come back and lead me to restrict again, but it seems like as long as I stay determined to reach a healthy daily calorie intake and remember to put in my body things that are going to benefit it then I think I will be fine.",False,True

I would recommend eating healthy on weekdays and eating whatever you feel like eating on weekends. Eating nutritious foods will help prevent cravings due to deficiencies and eating junk food occasionally does help prevent binge eating when you inevitably do get cravings anyway. When I started eating healthy foods I found that my cravings for things like Doritos went way down. I used to eat them very frequently and then without even trying to cut back I realized that I hadn't even thought of eating chips for a few months. I did mix in plenty of junk food options like pizza pockets and McDonald's, but I never really had cravings for junk food. I just ate that stuff when I was on the go and didn't have time to wait in line for a bagel.   I also cut added sugar from my diet which I recommend you do. Sugar isn't good for you and lots of healthy foods are plenty sweet enough. Since I stopped eating/drinking sugar even things like fully-rippened bananas are nearly too sweet for me. Sometimes I look at sugary foods and just thinking about eating them makes me feel sick. I think part of that is because my stomach just won't be able to tolerate all the sugar the way that it used to. Sugar is addicting, so I do recommend replacing sugar with something healthier until you stop craving it.   If you do feel that you have cravings and need to deal with them you should go for something small that you can suck on. Tic Tacs or other mints are good options. I do keep these strawberry candies at home which take ages to finish. They're not big enough to contain a huge amount of sugar, but they are very sweet and take a long time to dissolve, so they're a great option. Mints might be the better option though. They tend to have even less sugar. I would recommend larger mints though. Tic Tacs really are the smallest I would go. I did used to keep a tin of mints that were smaller than Tic Tacs and they dissolved way too quickly so sometimes I would just have one after another. They're tiny of course so no big deal, but bigger is better.",False,False
