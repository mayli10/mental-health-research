You should celebrate every day but this one special day is a reminder for you that you were given the gift of life and you deserve to enjoy it. You were not put here to simply survive. You deserve to LIVE, not only exist. You have a body, a vessel that is here to allow you to experience whatever you want in life. And food is here to fuel and nourish that vessel. Think ahead to when you are old and on your death bed, looking back on your life. You won't wish you had restricted more than you did. You'll wish you had eaten that delicious cake, enjoyed all of your birthdays and celebrated like there was no tomorrow. Because one day, there really won't be anymore tomorrows. Please take care of your beautiful body and celebrate your magnificent life.",False,False
