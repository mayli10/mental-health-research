I'm sadly never sick but the rare times I am I just don't eat and sleep so bad that I immediately lose 1kg/week.

Here are other things that help: eating food known for helping the immune system (honey, fruits etc), reduce the exercise as it tends to exhaust the body more -even though sweating can help, rest and sleep enough, keep yourself warm with more clothes, try to avoid ""exciting substances"" such as alcohol, coffee, drugs.    Overall if it's a normal cold, it can actually stay up to 15 days, as it's a virus. If it stays longer or starts affecting other parts (especially breathing), try to meet with a doctor. Long colds can evolve into pneumonia! ",False,False
