Where if I don't think the food I ate was 'worth' the calories I usually purge. But before I go to sleep I have this 'need' to feel full, were the feeling of fullness puts me to sleep (and obviously I don't purge that binge).  I'm going to try planing out a full day of food better, but I'm really scared that this has worked it's way up to an addiction and I have never dealt with any sort of addiction before which is quite scary for me. Thank you for your comment, it was quite reassuring to get some advice.",False,True

It might seem counter intuitive if you are already obsessive about food, but in the past, planning and prepping healthy portions has worked for me.  I would start with maintenance calories (like use a TDEE calculator) and adjust from there.  If you have all your food prepared out, and you know itâ€™s theoretically enough, maybe it will be easier?  However, If you are currently recovering from a restrictive eating disorder this does NOT apply.  If this is your situation, please be kind to yourself and eat what your body is telling you too.  You will reach a plateau.",False,False
