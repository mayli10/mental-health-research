It really bugs me how so many people try to pass off as pro-recovery channels when all they do is flaunt how sick they were. It's especially bad on Instagram but YouTube is definitely a close second.",False,False

Knowing just how little they ate or weighed doesn't matter at the end of the day, yet we still want to know? It's weird.   (so stupid too, I know i'm probably going to look this person up later so I can make myself feel bad)",False,False

I was in the car with my parents, it was early evening, and they were listening to talk radio. I guess maybe it was ED Awareness week or something because they were interviewing a recovered anorexic girl, and the host asked her what her lowest weight was. She said, “I don’t want to say a number in case there’s anyone listening who might try to achieve that weight, or compete with it.” At another point the host asked her how little she ate every day, and the girl again said, “I just don’t want to say, for the same reason as before.”   I remember even as a little kid being SO maddeningly frustrated that she wouldn’t just say, I just soooo wanted to know what her answers were, and some bitter little part of me was just telling myself that she mustn’t have lost THAT much weight or been eating THAT few calories, otherwise she’d say.   Of course, as I got older and developed my own eating disorder (a long, long time after that) I realised she was just trying to be responsible.   I’ve never watched any of the videos you’re talking about but fffffuuuuucccckkkk, she sounds irresponsible as all hell.",False,False
