I’ve worked in male-heavy jobs before and known a lot of guys.   When men were liking other girls’ pics, they were always willing to DM, and always willing to meet up and cheat. When men drank alone, they all were willing to cheat on their wives if they had thensliiiightest hint of (often mistakingly -perceived) flirting. And women, much like the OP, would always find a way to blame anyone else- except the men, and would always have a defensive attitude about it lol.  You sound like you have boundaries and are practicing to keep them held up well. Sounds good to me. *shrug*",False,False

If I accidentally see that he has gotten a new friend on facebook and she's a skinny, beautiful girl, or he shows me pictures of his ex-classmates or something (that are beautiful, skinny, etc) - I get very uncomfortable. I never talk to him about it or tell him to stop befriending girls or stop talking to his girl friends from the past because I realize that it's 100% MY problem if I feel jealous or like they're better me. I know he loves me incredibly much and that he wants to spend the rest of his life with me, but despite knowing how much this boy loves me I still have urges to lose tons of weight and ruin my health in order to be skinnier and prettier than all of the girls he knows irl.   So based on my own experience, what you're feeling is valid and ""normal"" (for people like us). You overreacting would be if you told him that he should stop liking their pictures/befriending girls period. Like if you blew up on him and forbid contact with all girls or made him delete his instagram or something like that. Or directly blamed him for not loving you/cheating/lusting after someone else. But these are just your internal thoughts, and it seems like you realise that these thoughts are mostly your disordered brain speaking to you because you did say that you trust him and that you're soulmates.   Personally, I had to realize that all of this was my personal problem, and if it really bothered/triggered me, I should just stop checking out the facebook profiles of his female friends and just never try to find out what he does on the internet (what kind of social media he has, who he follows, who he talks with, whose pictures he likes, etc) or in real life (when he's not with me). It required a lot of strength to accept this because my biggest fear is ending up looking like an idiot - what if (this is hypothetical) it comes up to the surface that he lusts after a certain girl and has lusted after her all this time? And what if she's 10000 times more beautiful than me and skinny and smart and literally everything that I am not? I'd end up feeling like an idiot. A dumbass. A naive girl. A laughing stock. That's literally my biggest fear! But I realized that if I want to have a great, fulfilling, and happy relationship - I should just trust him. And that involves trusting him when he says that he loves me, that he loves my body, that he thinks I'm sexy, that i'm beautiful. And I will trust him in that until he says ""I'm not in love with you"" or ""I like this girl more than you"". But until that day, if it ever comes (hopefully not!), I will trust him 100%. Maybe I'm afraid of ending up being naive and stupid, but I'd rather be that and live in blissful ignorance and happiness than constantly suspecting something and thinking that he doesn't love me and that he lies about finding me attractive. The end result will be the same anyways - either it has always been true and we'll live happily until we die, or he lied about everything and actually thinks that someone who is skinnier and prettier than me is more attractive and choose her over me for example - but what will be different is that I will have lived a happy life without worries until then!   I mean I still have bouts of ""I HAVE TO LOSE ALL THIS WEIGHT AND BE THE MOST PERFECT GIRL HE HAS EVER LAID HIS EYES ON"" but these are slowly becoming less and less frequent as I accept that he loves me incredibly much and that his love goes beyond my looks and my body. Of course, my looks do play a part and they're important for attraction, or initial attraction at the very least. But at this point we've been together for so long and lived through so many great and terrible things, that I know that even though he'll meet/see someone more attractive and hotter than me, he still won't feel the same feelings of passion and lust and love for her as he does for me, just because we are so intimate and close and our love transcends all these superficialities.  Sorry for this long post! I have a cold right now and my brain is a bit fuzzy so sorry if something doesn't make sense or if I misunderstood your post completely. But hopefully I could help even a little &lt;3",False,False

I would never date a guy who is “liking” other girls’ pics. Why is he doing that? He’s probably dm’ing them, too.  Also you mentioned it to him but he continues to do it??   He is a tool. If more women were liking and notifying other handsome mens’ pics, men would be raging angry. Stop putting up with that bullshit.   Imagine if your fathers were publicly clicking the likes on sexy womens pics.... lol. I know as women we are expected to just let “men be men”, but it’s a toxic and sick societal expectation.

I know he doesn’t care about any of these girls and I know he’s not messaging them or commenting on pictures about their looks.

I know he’s not messaging them or telling them how good they look. It’s more my internal problem about how I can soon maybe look like one of these girls.    We have a healthy relationship, I don’t care about porn, friends or any of that. I’m in the trades so I’m constantly around men as well, do I take liking to any? Hell no. I’m loyal and I know he is as well so none of that’s an issue to me.   That’s why I don’t get too bent out of shape about it. Like the other comment someone else said was “he doesn’t think twice about liking a girls picture after it’s done” is true to me. I’ve seen him mindlessly scroll and like photos at a time, even in front of me, so I know it’s not an extreme issue. It’s more my mentality than anything else",False,True

He's lusting after other women when he has you.  I would be highly upset but in my marriage we both have strong boundaries about how we act around the other sex.  No opposite sex friends or talking too friendly or confounding in them unless they're a couple and we are both friends with them.   No flirting, no liking girls pictures, no going out alone and getting drunk at a bar or club. I don't have social media though.   No porn, I'm sure he's looked a few times but it's not when I'm around and it's done on incognito if does happen when I'm not around.   It may sound extreme but we have two kids and we both feel the need to protect our marriage from outsiders.",False,False
