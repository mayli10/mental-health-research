If you feel like she doesn't have the skills to help you, def seek out someone else. I found mine by word of mouth. If there are any ed support groups in your area you may be able to get a good recommendation from someone there",False,False

Maybe I’m wrong but from my own personal history isn’t calling a relatively low # of calories a binge a symptom of anorexia/restrictive ednos, not BED? Even B/P is like bulimia or Ana w/ purge subtype, not BED.  But UGH I totally understand because I had a very recent experience recently. Last session with my therapist I worked up the nerve to bring up my history of anorexia (I left it out of my paperwork because :/) and that I relapsed recently and I basically talked about how I fast/restrict then the same stuff you did (“binges” that are under maintainence) and she told me to buy a book called “Overcoming Binge Eating”. And told me she thinks I could lose 5 lbs by our next session (a little under 2 weeks away).  Logically I know I’m at a normal weight but my BDD &amp; ED say I look fat so her saying that just made me go.... ok. Time to starve, even my therapist thinks I’m so fat I have BED.",False,False
