Measure/get measured. Below a B cup as actually pretty rare. As breasts get smaller, they tend to become more shallow and wide. So you may need a style with wider, shallower wires. You may also wear a 32 band or even a 30.   I recommend trying the brand Timpa. They run small in the band and cups so maybe a 34B?   Only saying this because when my ED was actually working I just kept going down in cup and not band size. Then I finally figured out I was a 32DD/34D and not a 36B. They change shape not just size.",False,False

Bras have always been super uncomfortable for me. They feel like boob hats, worn just to hide my nipples because I want to look professional, but not actually providing me any comfort or support. I just wear bralettes now which are much more comfortable since I‚Äôm so flat-chested.   Plenty of beautiful flat-chested women out there - Keira Knightley!  You can emphasize your chest more with details like ruffles around the chest area. Or you can focus more on emphasizing your hips so you can look curvy and feminine there (peplum shirts).   Make-up, lipstick, clothing. I think there‚Äôs other ways to look feminine!",False,False
