That's really such a massive achievement. But I get what you're saying so much. The invasive thoughts have been so bad that I can't think of anything else, and every time I relapse it just gets worse...but it gets better for a small amount of time. I should really learn, but it tricks me in every way possible and makes me feel like my addiction was the best time of my life, even though I know it wasn't.   Yep I completely understand that! I'm at uni, and I had a part time job when using for a while. H is glamourised so much in movies and online, it's made to look so much more exciting than it was, but in reality my life was more fun and exciting before I ever started. But it doesn't like me to believe that. I also like the ""thin punk junkie"" image, and I hate that I like that because it feels like I'm still romanticising something that was so awful to me. And when I spent all my money on h, I couldn't spend any on food, so that was a major plus as well. Yeah I relate so much to everything you're saying, it's scary. That's who my identity is as well...I honestly have no idea who I am without my addiction and anorexia.  And also my favourite music is about h as well! A lot of people in my recovery groups think it's weird that music is such a trigger for me. But I love Alice in Chains, Nirvana, The Velvet Underground, The Stranglers. Damn man.",False,True

But I would love to be clean for good...I keep doing the same thing: quitting cold turkey in all the pain, and either not making it through or making it through and picking back up because of all the mental and emotional shit and lack of sleep.   I might PM you in the future about it if that's okay, I have been thinking of setting up an appointment soon. Your experience gives me a lot of hope that it will be a good idea, so thank you. I just want to be a normal person again :)",False,True

It does suck to deal with the invasive thoughts of it day after day, especially when most of my favorite music is H-related.  I always held a job and a ‚Äúnormal‚Äù life together while using, but now I hate that I still secretly aspire to this miserable ‚Äúwild waif punk junkie‚Äù personality/image/lifestyle.

Don't feel bad for relapsing. It's the nature of the disease- it takes over parts of your brain that you don't even realize are there until they suddenly pop back up.  I don't think you have to be a current daily user to get benefit from maintenance meds. I've been on suboxone for 2 years and started after I'd quit cold turkey for a couple months and relapsed yet again. I just got sick of the relapse cycle. Suboxone not only keeps me clean but also is the best antidepressant i've ever tried tbh. Not everyone has this experience, and some have very negative experiences, it's worth weighing those carefully. I will always believe, though,  that maintenance is the best possible option for some, and there's absolutely no shame with being on suboxone or methadone long term if it serves you.  Anyway if you ever want to talk about it, feel free to pm me. I hope you find something that works well for you and find a way out of the terrible addiction cycle eventually. ",False,False

I've struggled with identity issues for so long that I co-opted being anorexic and being a heroin addict as my identities. It feels like those are the only things I'm good at, but I think that's just what their voices in my head tell me...since I'm still 90% them, and 10% me.  H ruined my life, but just as you, it softened the destruction. I could even happily eat on it for a while...but that didn't last for long. I'm definitely going to google that, thank you so much! It's sad to me that you can relate, but it does make me feel less alone. I'm actually not on opiate maintenance, but I have been weighing up making an appointment to do it, even though I am currently clean. I do keep relapsing...and I don't like to admit it, it makes me feel like I've failed.   Thank you so much for commenting and I'm so glad you're doing better. This gives me a lot of hope!

I never had an active ED and used h at the same time, but I think they scratched the same itch for me.   I don't feel right in the brain unless I'm using or starving. H took a lot of good things from me, but it also kept away the deepest depression. I did a lot of research on the brain chemistry of mental illness (since ""normal"" antidepressants don't work or make me feel worse, I'd wager there's something wonky going on in my brain). Found a lot of info about endorphin deficiency and it's finally starting to get some clinical recognition. Both starving and using heroin act in similar ways- heroin replaces your natural endorphins, starving stimulates them.  Idk. I'm not a doctor. I do know that taking an opiate maintenance med is the best thing I've ever done for my mental health. If you get mental health benefit from both heroin and not eating, maybe google endorphin deficiencies. Finding out what I did was life changing- I still struggle sometimes, but nowhere near the way I used to. ",False,False
