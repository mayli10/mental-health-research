Such as family members or significant others. (Of course you have to take into consideration their personalities. And how they would take to your ed) in the end, just make sure that if you tell someone that you know it's a safe space.   As a personal story tho, I still haven't told my best friend of two years, (we even dated at one point) about my bulimia. She knows I have issues but I've never told her directly. Idk, it's just a personal thing and if you feel like they should know or if you feel comfortable with them knowing then it shouldn't be too bad.",False,False

The people in my community are particularly ignorant about mental health and EDs. Telling any of them would just hurt both of us and help no one. That's why I really appreciate this sub. It gives me the support and understanding I need that I can't get from my IRL community.,False,False
