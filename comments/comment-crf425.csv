She‚Äôs a sweet heart and goes out of here way to to buy vegan things. But I always decline.   The Only person who is an exception is my roommate. She‚Äôs my best friend and we‚Äôve lived together 10 years now. She‚Äôs the only one who I can really tell anything about my ed to. So Ive had countless binges where I‚Äôve eaten her food lol. Or I just texted her saying ‚Äúcan I eat this.‚Äù And the answer is always yes scaredyk4t you know you don‚Äôt have to ask‚Äù...but I feel that by getting her permission I‚Äôm getting the reassurance that this binge is okay. I need the food since I restrict all day and a 200 cal dinner isn‚Äôt a fucking meal and she knows that I ate something of substance today. I love her üò≠. She also always has a few boxes of mac and cheese so how can you expect me to resist lol.,False,False

A friend offering me a piece of apple? Wtf, no.  I feel like I have to eat MY foods. And they have to eat theirs. Like, I can't share mine because I weighed it and the calories won't be the same after they are something of it.",False,False
