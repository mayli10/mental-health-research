I remember running 28 miles and then walking 15 miles the next day despite the slightly sore feet, but the motivation wasn't exactly to burn calories - I just couldn't  sit still without getting bored. When I developed blisters from walking 20-30 miles a day for 2+ months, all I did was use gauze wrap under my socks so I wouldn't feel a thing. I HAD to move, but I wasn't going to bear the pain. I don't think I overexercise because if it REALLY hurt or I injured something else, then I'd definitely stop and rest to feel better, and because I don't want to be out of commission for even longer. But everyone's limit is different and only you know if a bit of walking the day after a hard workout is enough to warrant concern.",False,False

For real though, it may not be as obviously destructive as traditional purging, but exercise purging can get addictive and can cause harm.  I did mess up my knees and exercised through it. They’re doing better now. No pain but you can audibly hear cracking when I walk stairs. What gets me is knowing I was an absolute stubborn idiot and I know I’d do it again. EDs are stupid self destruction.",False,False

But it's 4:55 I can't stop now, I'll go until 5 minutes. Wait now its 97 calories, I'll go to 100. OK but now it's a total of 11749 steps, I'll go to 12k"" 😅",False,True

Every time I hit a step goal, I’ll notice how close I am to a  nicer, rounder step count or calorie burn or whatever other metric is tracked. 🙄  That being said, rest days are apparently important.

I just got a treadmill and it's a cursed dressed as a blessing because now I can walk thousands of steps any time, with any weather or any clothes...
