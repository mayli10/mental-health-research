It's not totally wrong...it's totally true that we have enzymes in our saliva to start breaking down carbohydrates and if you don't spit out the saliva, you are swallowing those sugars.  And it's easy to let the saliva go down your throat.  Lol this is such a gross convo...but yeah! I'm not a scientist or a doctor or anything so i could be wrong about some of this, but AFAIK, you dont absorb calories that you don't swallow.",False,False

I'm very passionate about informing others about the detrimental effects of c/sing even though I do it....I try really hard to do it in moderation.

I didn't even get into the mental health problems that it can manifest/perpetuate...yanno just your basic self-loathing, guilt, poor body image, etcetera.",False,False

(depends on how long you chew for too obv, since if you chew anything for 0.01s before spitting then clearly you won't absorb much)  But yeah, I gathered this since we learned in high school bio that you have enzymes in your spit that start the breakdown of carbs into sugars. But there's no such enzyme for proteins &amp; fats until they get to the stomach.    It was a pretty neat &amp; quick experiment actually that you can try rn.    You just chew a Pringle for 2 minutes without swallowing, then test the amount of sugar in the chewed up chip vs how much it had initially. You can actually taste the chip turning sweet after chewing it for that long, since the carbs are being broken down into sugars.  So idk the exact percent of carbs that you might avoid using c/s, but I reckon that you can eliminate nearly 100% of the calories in something like a chicken wing or a steak, so long as you're prudent about not swallowing the oil.",False,False

Melty candy, chocolate, anything with oil/butter...gonna be hard to not swallow a bit of that.  There is a myth that you get calories just from food being in your mouth because (chemical) digestion starts in the mouth"" but it just means that your saliva enzymes start breaking it down.  It actually has to get into your intestines to get the energy from it, so whatever physically leaves your mouth  won't give you calories.  That said, there have been some studies that show that c/sing makes you gain weight because it can massively fuck with your hormones, like insulin, even if you aren't swallowing more food. Sorry in a hurry and can't remember the name of another hormone that controls your hunger and satiety but that can also get fucked with when you start chewing food but don't swallow it.  It ends up making you hungrier in the long run and makes it so that your body doesn't know when it's full.    And cavities! And ulcers! Don't try out chewing and spitting cause it's so not worth it.  And if you currently do it... try to at least eat something so you get some food in your tummy to alkalize all that stomach acid.  And take care of your teeth but don't brush right after a c/s binge... wait at least an hour.",False,False
