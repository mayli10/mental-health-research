Perhaps she has some image-based trauma in her past and is trying to compensate now or she feels that she finally has achieved beauty and so will not be quiet.  Someone please remind this girl there is more to life than looks!",False,False

I think she bases her value off her looks, not just weight, but the whole thing; hair, nails, makeup. It can be so exhausting. I wish she was more down to earth honestly.",False,True

I do feel like shes super insecure about something and shes masking it by being so proud of her habits or whatever. even if i tell her my problems she’ll cut me off to talk about how she doesn’t have that problem. An actual convo we had:  Me: “my bf hasn’t been wanting to have sex” Her: “wow as soon as I get to my bfs house hes all over me”  So yeah, it expands past food related topics.

During my freshman and sophomore year of high school, she would constantly make quips about how big I was. I was 5'6 150lbs at the time. She would not shut up about how boys wouldn't like me because I was so big, and the boys liked her because she was so cute and small. I cut her out of my life midway through junior year and NEVER looked back, turns out she had an eating disorder and took her insecurities out on me. Even though I didn't have an eating disorder at the time, it definitely confirmed insecurities I was already feeling, 6 years later I now have a full-blown ED :\~).   &amp;#x200B;  Basically, my advice is to CUT CONTACT!
