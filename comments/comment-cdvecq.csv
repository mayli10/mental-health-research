What Mia Did Next is an ED recovery coach on YouTube and she's a personal favourite â€” she was suicidal at her worst, but now she's been in recovery for many years and has a healthy relationship with food and exercise, and emphasises that full recovery *is* possible. Tabitha Farrar's content is also wonderful, especially if you're struggling from a restrictive ED.   Things *can* get better, friend, if only because there are other people who have made it through this shit and emerged stronger for it. Sending all my love. Stay strong.",False,False
