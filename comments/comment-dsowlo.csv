As a teen (before I considered myself to have an ED) I would rarely eat breakfast and sometimes would skip lunch though I did eat a lot because teenager metabolism.   When I moved out I kinda stuck to the same habit. Doesn’t help that I work in a restaurant so when other people are eating I’m working.  Two meals a day is what seems to fit me right.,False,False
