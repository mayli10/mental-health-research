Here's a nice link with some symptoms of all types: https://www.healthline.com/health/adhd/inattentive-type  With an eating disorder, it's pretty difficult and I like to think of them ""feeding"" off one another (sorry). ADHD of course can't be cured, but it really helps when you have a good diet.

I'm going to a psychiatrist soon to see if I have it and I'd be really interested in hearing a bit about your experience with it, especially along with an eating disorder.
