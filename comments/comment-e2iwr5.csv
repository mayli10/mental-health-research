I used to think it was because he didn’t care, but I think it’s more that he’s non confrontational, I’m sort of the more aggressive partner, and fighting with me doesn’t end well. Talking gently works well when he’s concerned, but maybe your brother just knows you well enough to know he won’t talk you out of what you’re doing and he’s more likely to say the wrong thing than the right thing.",False,False
