This one experience doesn't mean that you're gonna carry on purging.   Stay strong, you don't have to let the urge control you. Just take it little by little, hour by hour, day by day until the purge-free minutes turn into hours, and they turn into days. You've got this. ðŸ’•",False,False

I always tell myself it's not so bad, I can always make up for it by restricting later, that I can burn it off by exercising, that it's too late to purge anyway or that it would be hard to do or someone would hear me. I always try to find and excuse why I can't do it. So far it works for me.",False,False

I have yet to purge, for me it has just been ridiculous amounts of restricting. One day I will purge and then things will get even worse. I feel the same way about self harm - while I have yet to cut my arms up I've held that razor blade in my hand dozens of times and asked myself how it would feel, if it would help ease the pain.  I really hope you manage to escape that vicious cycle :)",False,False
