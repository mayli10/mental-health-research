They’re being dickbags whether they intend to be or not.  Most people have it stuck in their heads that telling someone they’ve lost weight (regardless of their size) is a positive thing.  And I mean, it works for some, it certainly worked for me. I loved people telling me I’d lost weight, and it felt good. Now only I pay the price of being underweight.  You just have to remember that it doesn’t mean you need to lose more, heck your underweight so hell no. Your life is worth a lot more than their comments.   You are literally underweight - not even healthy let alone overweight. And don’t even think about obese as that is far off.   You don’t need to lose weight - So go enjoy your semi-challenge snack! :)",False,False
