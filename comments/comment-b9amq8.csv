I've actually experienced alot of benefits with my IF and in a way I think its better than my extreme restricting during my pro-ana months. I eat at most 1.8-2k cals daily of whole foods and do 16:8 IF and it actually made me lean, skinny but healthy. It also provides me a getaway to have cheat/binge sessions without making it into a binge/purge or chew/spit session so food isnt being wasted as well. ",False,True

I will eat 1.5k-2k cals of donuts, pizzas and brownies in one sitting and fast for 24-32 hours.

I told a dietitian I had become really into the fasting and IF communities because it's like a ""normal"" mask.
