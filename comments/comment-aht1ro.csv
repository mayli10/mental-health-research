OH and a large mcdonalds fries the night before yikes. I'm honestly scared to weigh myself after the last few days because my fat ass has been eating literally all the carbs and salt. Time to reset and move on today- really trying to get some self control back :(",False,False

Ok so I'm in the Midwest and honestly my sister could probably will 1/4 of this cake in one sitting without thinking twice. I mean I haven't taken a ruler to it but it's prolly less than 6 inches across.   The serving size on this thing are for 1/14 of the cake. ðŸ˜‚ 200-something calories. Idk I blacked out the calorie count because ""birthday"" and because jfc I would spend the rest of the night  crying if I really memorized it. I dutifully tried to slice 1/14th worth of the cake and it was pathetically small. ",False,False

Cafeteria underserved all my food so I went and got 2 grilled cheese sandwiches, cookies, yogurt pretzels, cinnamon toast crunch, and ice cream. Purged simply to relieve the massive stomach pain. I honestly have no guilt about what I ate at all. I wanted to eat all the food I wanted. But it caused me so much pain. Like bloating all the way up to my ribs. Felt like my body was trying to push my ribs outwards.  Now I feel super depressed. Everyone I know wants me to gain weight despite not being underweight but my binge put me barely above maintenance and even then the pain was too much to handle",False,False

I do the same thing where I think about the food for weeks before I actually eat it. Finally figured out how to plan for it so I can actually enjoy it without worrying too much about calories. If I can control the unhealthy food it definitely helps stave off binges in the long run!,False,True

Two regular glazed, one chocolate glazed, and one chocolate cake batter. Def over my cal limit but I was tired of thinking about them. I really enjoyed them but they were way sweeter than I remembered so part of me is kinda disappointed as well. I didnâ€™t go on a binge eating episode so Iâ€™m proud of that too. Listening to my cravings has really dropped my desire to binge. Itâ€™s nice. ",False,False
