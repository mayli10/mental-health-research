I just block creeps (whether minor or adult) that ignore the age limits though since its extremely easy to do.      Plus you can create your own groups, so like, the people here in this sub could create their own group and have it show all the posts at once instead of needing to check through every individual post (which was a problem someone else had brought up about Peach in the comments earlier).      Being a reserved person on Vent is also kinda nice cause people cant message each other unless they both follow each other, so it cuts down on the amount of creepy messages you get.      I highly prefer the discord group that I made for ED stuff though. Id take that over any other option.",False,False

I didn‚Äôt like how you had to find people in real life or on other social media, and you couldn‚Äôt just find people to follow in the app because theres no way to search for topics or keywords, only people that you already know the names of. Ive heard a few other people say that Peach is really confusing as well.      I only got Peach because of the Vent app, since Peach is really popular on the app. ",False,False
