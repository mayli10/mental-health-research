I already had plans to enter treatment January 2011. As I left a fitness class, the instructor walked past me on the way out and softly asked me if I was doing okay. She reassuredly told me that she used to have bulimia and used to self-harm. She showed me very faint white lines on her forearm and told me I could talk to her if I wanted to. I don't know how she knew. I was shocked and felt like I ""got caught.""  I guess the ""ED sixth sense"" is right. Maybe she noticed my excessive exercise regimen, my baggy clothes to hide my body, my pale face, my chipmunk cheeks, and saw myself in her. I actually did have severe bulimia and I attempted to hide small cuts with concealer. I was too stunned and embarrassed to say anything so I just said ""Oh...ok"" and walked off. She came up to me when I was on the stairmaster a few days later and said that she was sorry if she startled me, and said ""I understand. Just know that I can listen anytime, I get it."" I just replied with ""Oh, it's okay..."" and muttered a ""thanks."" Years later, it feels really good knowing that she cared and was concerned about me, but I haven't seen her around since 2012. I'm going to ask another long-time instructor where she went, if she might be teaching somewhere else. I feel a need to thank her properly now.",False,False

I used to see her there every day 2008-2013. I would work out in the morning, see her in the locker room crossing the floor butt naked wearing only a swim cap, weigh herself, look defeated (sometimes let out a loud sigh, sometimes even cover her face and cry) and come back in the evening to see her crossing the floor in the locker room butt naked wearing the same swim cap, weighing herself again. Every day without fail. She was one of the sweetest, friendliest people I've ever come across at the gym. We had some nice conversations about college and careers. She would just walk right up to people in that locker room and chat away, ""Oh, it's so great to see you hun, how are the kiddos doing?"" She would tell other women how beautiful they were, and they would look at her awkwardly. She would point to herself, shrug, and say ""I'm a smoker."" Right. She was the thinnest person I had ever seen in person, with a blue roadmap of veins everywhere, protruding cheekbones, every single bone sticking out. She was a walking skeleton. Everyone looked scared of her, but I think her personality helped ease the initial shocking impression. I was a server at a restaurant in 2011 and saw her there with her family in 2012. I remember that she ordered one cup of hot water with one lemon wedge and one cup of water with no ice and one lemon wedge. I got it for her and tried to keep it casual and not ask if she might want something to-go. I haven't seen her since 2013 and I fear that she is no longer alive. I still think of her.",False,False

Just saw a girl at one of my routine fitness classes at the gym who I had never seen before. When I walked in the studio, she had all her equipment on the floor from the previous class that she was putting away. The instructor from this previous class said to her on the way out, ""I saw you here this morning, too!"" in a casual, friendly tone (she's a really sweet lady). The girl looked slightly alarmed as she finished putting her equipment away and pulled out the equipment for the class that I was attending. For most of the class, she spent an abnormally long time grabbing at her hip bones that were jutting out sharply while staring at the mirror, turning at different angles. She seemed to struggle to keep her energy up, but her face looked determined. I know that she stayed for the next class, too.
