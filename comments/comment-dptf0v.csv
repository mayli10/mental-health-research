Hopefully it will help to add some muscle and in return a higher metabolism lol rather than being (semi) skinny-fat",False,True

And it’s hard to figure out what my TDEE should be so I either don’t lose weight or the deficit is really high which is what leads to the huge appetite. The problem is, I don’t want to have a high body fat percentage at a low weight :(",False,False
