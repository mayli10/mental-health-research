I know it sounds like trite advice but starting a new hobby, like knitting or an instrument, and measuring your progress and improvement there is better than watching numbers fluctuate on a scale. It also tends to be much more linear. :)  You're very welcome. You're worth taking time to talk to, I hope you keep climbing up.",False,False

And drank way too much because I'm a wreck but all calories I guess. This morning I feel disgusting, part hangover part fat and bloated. But self talk... It's not weight, it's the other stuff.  Losing weight is the only thing that's made me feel good about myself for the past good knows how long. Hard to give that up.  I want to say thanks for taking the time to reply and give advice. It means a lot ♥️",False,True

What you are describing sounds exactly like why most people get embroiled in EDs, a desire for control. But even if it feels like control right now, it will soon become more uncontrollable than you can imagine. Please keep going down the right path you've set yourself on because you know yourself very well ♥",False,False

Self talk, I will try that, I think it might work. I know it's because of other issues and this is something that takes my mind off it and gives me something to feel good about intellectually. Heart says otherwise but I'll do self talk and find someone to speak to.  I have enough stuff causing me depression and anxiety so having a fully fledged ED ..  Thanks again. Gonna try and best this before it gets too big to handle",False,True

You should do some research into doctors in your area and look into local reviews, though. Not all doctors are good.  You definitely sound like you have disordered thoughts about eating, at any rate, if not a full eating disorder.  Self-talk is where you recognise irrational and harmful thought processes and address them mentally, telling yourself things you know to be rational and healthy instead. Your head/heart comparison is actually a good example. If your heart says ""I feel fat, so I should hit a lower weight for self validation,"" you can self-talk (i.e. head) to tell yourself ""I am at an underweight BMI so my issue is not my weight, and so getting to an even lower BMI will not fix the way that I feel, so I need to do something constructive and beneficial to feel better instead. If I keep feeling this way I may need to talk to my therapist.""  You still have a good handle on self-talk so it's a good time to nip this in the bud before it becomes something you don't have any control over and there is no ""head"" any more, only your heart, and it will be very very cruel to you.",False,False
