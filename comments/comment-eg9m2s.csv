Because recovery in almost all cases entails weight gain. And being ok with that. You can’t recover and just maintain if you’re underweight, you still being actively disordered as your body is trying to get you back up to a healthy weight.   If you’re not trying to recover, disregard.   The only way to avoid bingeing truly is to eat more on a day to day basis. Still might not work as your body is REALLY trying to eat everything you can.",False,False
