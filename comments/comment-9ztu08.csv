It's like any bad habit you give up. You'll get the urges, but just because you think it, doesn't mean you have to do it. I have no regrets in giving up this aspect of my ED. ",False,True

But day by day week by week, you'll eat and not have that urge every time. Then eventually not thinking about purging will occur more that thinking about it.",False,False

I think it's normal to think about it when you  experience the physical/emotional cues that used to precede purging. I can say it has gotten easier over time to ignore the thoughts. After 4ish years I sometimes don't think about it at all.  Congrats on 15mos purge-free btw. That's such a huge accomplishment!,False,False
