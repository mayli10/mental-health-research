I have a hard time playing games and stuff if I’m not moving. I have a Wii U and Wii Fit U so I have a set up where I can stand and use my laptop comfortably while walking in place the whole entire time letting Wii Fit U go and tell me I’m burning calories “jogging” with one of the activities in the game. It’s exercise my guys (I really dunno if it helps me I like to think it does as I’ve messed up my ankles from strain from doing it a lot but I digress)",False,False
