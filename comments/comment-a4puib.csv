I had the same experience every time. Broccoli is good for you, but looking at the carbs it’s devils food lol. So I can’t recommend it enough: 1. Calories, protein then 2. Fats 3. Carbs.

I've been beating myself up for eating any sort of carbs. The other day, I was nearly in tears because I was craving broccoli but it would put me over. I ended up eating the broccoli, but I felt really guilty about it. ",False,True

So I’ve been doing mellow low carb/keto for a while now and I’m here to support you and tell you that I get where you are coming from. In the beginning I was beating myself up like every day, because I couldn’t stick to the 20 net carbs. I noticed that I felt sooo much pressure because of this carb ‘rule’. For the last 3 months I’ve been focusing more on protein rather than total amount of carbs, cuz that makes me feel better in the long run. Some days I’ll eat more than 20 carbs in vegetables. And you know what? I’m okay with that. I feel like less of a loser and am overall nicer to myself now.   Hope this helps!",False,False
