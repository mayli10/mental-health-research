I try to calculate how many calories people are eating even if it's just someone I see in a cafe, minding their own business.  In the last month or so I've also tried to ""check out"" what someone is eating because it ""looks interesting and I might get it"" (I won't because I make what I eat) JUST to estimate calories that they're consuming. Or ""let me take your wrapper to the trash for you since I'm getting up"" (and want to read the calories!!) Or if someone is eating midmorning I ask ""having breakfast"" and then use their response to estimate how many calories they've had (guesstimated breakfast, how much food they're eating now, do they have a snack in their bag? )",False,False

I'm always trying to look at the packages of what my friends are eating and calculating how many cals they've eaten. I get happy when they eat a lot or high cal foods because it means that they will most likely eat more than me in the day and am always pushing for them to eat more.,False,False

I watched my fiancé down an 800 calorie breakfast one morning and just watched and counted in amazement. I can’t imagine a life in which I can eat without feeling guilty so it’s just fascinating. ,False,False
