And it‚Äôs hard to feel that way because I didn‚Äôt even feel hungry. Mostly likely because of the stress binged I‚Äôve had over the last 2 days. I‚Äôll try to keep that in mind. It‚Äôs hard, I am physically trying to recover but mentally, all o want to do a restrict. ",False,False

Ill consider a regular healthy serving a binge as well. And my ed brain yells at me to purge bc ive binged. Despite it just being a pack of ramen with an egg.   Its so difficult to stomp those thoughts out and havw awareness when it comes to it. For a disorder all about control we really lack an understanding of how much we really are eating when its just a regular serving.,False,False

I experienced the exact same thing today - I had a small savory pastry that someone gave me in class, then made some spaghetti and vegetarian meatballs for myself. Not the healthiest stuff, but it was only 1200 calories total, for the whole day.  I was thinking of it in my head as a binge and felt super shitty, but then I realized that I felt so much better from the energy the food gave me (I could barely make it to the aforementioned class because I felt so weak and tired). Like, this was not a binge at all. This IS how normal people eat. I didn't order in 4000 calories worth of shit and shove it down my throat like a manic pig until my stomach hurt. I ate 300 calories, then 900 calories 3 hours later. I cooked slowly and ate slowly.  Tbh I'll probably go back to my old mindset tomorrow, but for now I'm pretty satisfied and proud of myself. About to do all my backlogged schoolwork and finally feel productive for once :)",False,False
