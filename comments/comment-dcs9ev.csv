It only works if you’re still paying attention to how much you eat. For some people, eating larger portions in a shorter period of time is easier than eating the same amount of food in smaller portions throughout the day",False,False

I’m not much of a grazer, so it didn’t occur to me that that would be a diet of its own. Like if I start eating, I’m not gonna stop until I hate the thought of ever eating again.

I’ve never been a snacking person because I normally just eat 2 huge meals a day. I also think that just the act of setting rules like this helps people keep a certain mindset and stay disciplined to reach their goal, which is great!",False,True

Look y'all. I'm fat. I am a binge eater. I ""fast"" for days and days (my longest is 7 days) and then I eat. I have a feeling I eat. I'm bored I eat. I lose enough weight to consider being in the healthy range, then I eat 🤷🏼‍♀️   You tell those mfers that you fasted for 5 days and they will tear you apart. ""yeah it's easy for you, you have an eating disorder"" 🙄 Yeah cause y'all are perfectly normal not eating too 🤣",False,False

That's the diet. They don't tend to binge but rather eat normal meals or snack all 8 hours. They still have a deficit, which is what actually makes them lose weight. But you still somehow have to (optionally) learn how fasting makes you go into ketosis by not burning carbohydrates after the initial 12 hours of fasting. I don't understand the biology of that or if that's even true, but I'm going to assume it isn't.",False,False

Like sometimes just the mental jump of having a “rule” that you can’t eat outside a certain can help people who normally have a hard time not grazing after meals.,False,False

It’s just skipping breakfast and no snacks after dinner. I think limiting the hours you can eat is really just to prevent you from over eating.
