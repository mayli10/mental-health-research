If you were to compare an ideal body in Asia v.s the U.S  it would be vastly different and the Asian perspective would be much slimmer while the western version more full- there shouldn't be too much of a difference in the evolution of attraction between the two   but culturally people idolize different body types. A person's body can also be seen as a symbol of status- 200 years ago many cultures would find fuller bodies and pale skin to be more attractive as they are wealthy enough to be fed and to stay indoors. In recent years one may see a slim body and tan skin  and think that they have enough time ( and with that money) to be able to work out and see the sun - and buy more expensive ""healthy"" foods. Maybe thats all just bullshit though haha, just my take on it",False,False

Also to add to what you've written, there are many factors that contribute to evolution, sexual selection being one of those that sometimes doesn't really go along with what's best from a ""don't get eaten and get lots of kids"" point of view. Take a peakcock for example, the males colorful tail is absolutely not a benefit when it comes to hiding from predators, it makes them slow, bad at flying and very visible. But the females like them and they will not choose a mate that has an ugly tail therefore you get a positive selection for colorful big tails even if they aren't ""evolutionary advantageous"". This example doesn't quite apply to humans but I just wanted to give introspective about how there are many factors at play when it comes to evolution and it's not always all about who can run the fastest. As the person above explained we humans have a complex society that has a big play in how we act, live etc.",False,False

Or is it because they are a genuinely nice person who wouldn't put someone's body as the upmost priority? I'm sorry, I'm sure that you are a very amazing person but the way you phrased that really rubbed me the wrong way. If they don't find a full women's figure attractive are they not a real man? Is someone's preference in attractiveness  the dictator if they are a quality person or not? I feel like that's very judgmental to say the least.",False,False

Guys (from my point of view) just want a girl. Doesn't matter if she's 24, 20 or 17 BMI (not so much in the overweight region, but hey, there's still plenty of men who like overweight women, I myself feel attraction towards an overweight girl). It's true, however, that MOST OF the guys aren't attracted to ""sack of bones"" (and if they do, you should NOPE outta there, because they ain't neither boyfriend nor husband material, they are most likely a psycho or something). Also it's very possible that they give you more attention just because your personality changed as well as your physical appearance.

In short, no. You are correct that (biologically speaking) males seeking partners are drawn to a female body that looks fit enough to be fertile.  Specifically, there are studies which suggest significance of the hip/breast ratio but I'm not sure if that research is current.   That said, cultural pressures have a massive effect on human behavior and thus what we label as attractive. These cultural pressures can override other evolutionary pressures and, on a long enough scale, have and will continue to effect our evolution.   If you are interested in attraction/aesthetics from an anthropological standpoint, Id reccomend picking ""the beauty myth"" by naomi wolf. Classic feminist text. She explores why we lable traits as attractive and how we ultimately express power systems through cultural enforcement of beauty norms.",False,False
