My nieces are definitely in the way to being overweight and have body issues since their mom has the same. The kids donâ€™t even talk right (way less than they should)  she gave them Almond milk instead of actual stuff so the 3yr old niece almost had the rickets from deficiencies and she still uses diapers  Itâ€™s truly wild and so cringey because thereâ€™s nothing I can really do.",False,True

Itâ€™s crazy, my sister had an a level of BDD as a teen and she obsess about herself when she should be caring for them.  True about the deficiencies! My nieces both are super small for their age and the mom gave them mainly ALMOND MILK instead of formula/breast milk. They almost looked like they had the rickets.",False,True

Thatâ€™s flat out concerning, though Iâ€™ve no idea how Iâ€™d respond effectively in that situation. The mom is setting them both up for so much struggle now and in the years to come, not to mention the risk of malnutrition in a growing kiddo (which is fully possible even when calories are high enough...)

Her son is way overweight. Her daughter is going to be well on her way there as well. And she tells people she's underweight. She's not. At all. And it's obvious she's not. Like .. ?? My sister is 5'1-5'2 and fluctuates between 125-130. Underweight for MY height (5'5) is 111. I just .. I don't .. get it? Like wtf does she think she's SUPPOSED to weigh? And she thinks that eating peanut butter and marshmallow fluff sandwiches and drinking protein shakes is how you put on muscle.. without doing any exercise whatsoever. HUH?!?! She puts her kids in front of screens and feeds them nothing but junk because she is a lazy, shitty parent. Yet she wants another kid. How about be a fucking parent to the 2 you already fucking have? The daughter can't even fucking speak sentences yet and she's not even close to potty trained at 3 years old. But yes, shit out another semen demon. ðŸ™„",False,False
