I used to wear 98% lululemon stuff all the time cuz I worked in gyms and that’s what I was required to wear. I know what size I need, and I could order stuff online without trying it on because I know how it will fit (most likely). Now I work somewhere where I need to be fashionable, and have gained 15 pounds not being able to work out as much, and so my Lulu stuff doesn’t fit anymore, and I hate shopping. I hate how my body looks in clothes, I hate trying stuff on (because it just looks awful), all the styles are meant for younger, thinner girls, so I don’t even know where to shop anymore. I hate it. I wear the same like 5 outfits to work, and they don’t look good either. Ugh.",False,False
