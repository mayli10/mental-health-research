He literally agreed that it would be nice if my tits were perkier, and offhandedly went 'yeah sorry' when I pointed out that it wasn't the best response to me expressing an insecurity. He didn't mean it badly, was just... honest. Kind of makes it worse, because he wasn't being malicious, it's just the truth, ugh. But that fucked with my belief that whoever I'm sleeping with doesn't care/notice, because clearly he did and wished it was different:/  But in the end, the confidence thing definitely matters the most! It's like, I know what makes other people attractive to me, but I can't apply the information to myself.   Thank you❤ Last night was good, but a bit strange. I couldn't help asking if I looked different, and he said the weight loss was very noticeable in my face but not much otherwise, and fuck that was triggering. I was like, bitch I've lost 6 inches around my waist, gone down 4 cup sizes... how are you saying it's only noticeable on my face?! I know it was a completely irrational reaction, and I should be glad since I was scared he'd think I looked bad, but ouch. Didn't say anything to let on how I felt though hahaha I should not be anywhere near other people with this mental state",False,True

But you know what? I still got a bf, and when we first started going out he didn’t even notice (or he just didn’t say anything, the sweetheart), because legitimately, bottom line: a woman’s body is beautiful. Period.  When a guy’s got a naked woman in front of him, he and most anyone attracted to women really couldn’t care less about the logistics and the affect gravity has had on your boobs because, in short, “oh shit BOOBS.”  And exactly as you said; flaws are attractive. You’re human, and humans aren’t perfect. I know I’m not attracted to plastic ken dolls. So rock your body and everything on it. Inner confidence always outshines and outlasts superficialities, and if someone doesn’t agree then they don’t deserve to see you prove them wrong.   Hope last night went well for you! ❤️",False,False

I know that I'd probably look better if I gained a little, but seeing the number going up on the scale scares me and automatically makes me feel like I've failed, probably because seeing it go down when I was losing weight was confirmation that I was doing well. Back on the boob subject, something that gets to me is the whole 'I don't care about the size as long as the shape is good', lmao no hope here.   Thanks for the advice❤ it's definitely better to focus on everything else that makes sex great. I know that I don't require physical perfection in my partner and even find flaws attractive/cute, so why can't I see the same for myself?",False,True

I hate my breasts, they sag and have a lot of loose skin and are wrinkly and everything I find unattractive about breasts, and at this point unless my bf makes an effort to take my bra off during sex I always keep it on. It helps with the confidence.   I’m also torn between knowing that I’d actually look better with a few more pounds on my frame and wanting to be as small as possible. I feel like any lowest weight I hit, any pound I gain above that number is unacceptable and moving backwards again. It’s an addiction. Restricting and the high that comes with it is addicting   My advice is to find something about yourself that you are confident about in the bedroom. That doesn’t have to be something physical appearance wise, but performance wise maybe. Something you know you’re good at to preoccupy your mind and give you a boost to counteract that insecurity   Either way go get it girl and just focus on having fun ❤️",False,False
