Sorry to hear you are struggling especially when your birthday is coming up, I know how hard it is when you feel like shit for eating and like you can’t enjoy a birthday or just enjoy freaking life...but you are not an embarrassment and I’m 100% sure your boyfriend agrees with that, this is just a little reminder to at least trying to be kinder to yourself because you deserve it ❤️ and hell go enjoy some more macaroons!!! Happy early birthday 💞",False,False
