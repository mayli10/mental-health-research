But figuring out when I was most likely to b/p and trying to do something else was a big help.

Our brain is constantly monitoring how much energy is coming in compared to how much is being eaten. This is how our appetite has evolved to naturally work: your brain knows that a certain amount of food has a certain amount of energy, and it becomes satisfied after enough energy has been consumed.   With purging you're essentially fooling your brain into thinking that a massive amount of food only has the small amount of calories that you fail to purge each time. As a long-term result you will become more obsessed with food and need to eat way more than before just to feel somewhat satisfied. This doesn't reverse immediately either, making weight gain more severe when you choose to stop purging due to all the other health complications.   It's also important to remember that bulimia recovery is a matter of when, not if. It's never ever a permanent solution, it's a demon that harms you the whole time you're doing it and for a long time afterwards. You will win absolutely nothing from it.
