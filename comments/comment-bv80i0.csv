What I did was I bought an actual free weight that had “15 pounds” written on it. Then I placed it on each of the two scales to see which one  was accurate. If it’s reflecting as 15 pounds on at least one of the scales, then you’ll be able to tell which one is  accurate. Hope that helps some :)",False,False
