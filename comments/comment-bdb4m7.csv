The only people who know about my anxiety and depression struggles are my parents, and although they are incredibly supportive, they don't know the full extent or that I'm currently struggling with an eating disorder. I like the advice your therapist gave you, I think it does help with dealing with some of the guilt and shame.    I am so sorry you relapsed the other day (I can relate) and I hope you are able to keep fighting back. You seem  strong and your mindset going forward sounds realistic. I truly appreciate you as a person and thank you AGAIN for your lovely response! Sorry for not responding right away, I've been taking a series of long depression naps since my initial post, but am feeling slightly better today, and I hope you are too. Sending hugs your way‚ù§Ô∏è",False,True

I‚Äôm sorry you‚Äôre in such an awful, emotionally draining, and isolating place in your life right now :((&lt;3 *hugs*  I think it‚Äôs easy for people observing from the outside to completely miss the part of this disorder where we feel intense guilt and shame every time we give into a disordered behavior. The critical comments we hear from family members and medical professionals about how irresponsible and selfish our behaviors are will never even come *close* to the belittling, searing voice we hear in our heads almost 24/7. I‚Äôm not sure what I can say that would be helpful because I‚Äôm in the same place as you right now (relapsed a couple days ago), but know that you are *suffering* right now and going through something that most people wouldn‚Äôt have a fucking clue how to handle. You‚Äôre trying your best to stay afloat and keep pushing forward. I‚Äôm not trying to justify self destructive behavior, but something my therapist said that gave me some peace was that I don‚Äôt need to punish myself for developing my eating disorder *because I was doing what I needed to do to survive.* Granted, that was only true to a certain extent because at some point it becomes counter productive haha, but my eating disorder was the only thing (I had access to at the time) that got me through the lowest points in my life. Now, for me, it‚Äôs a matter of letting go of a survival mechanism that doesn‚Äôt do me any good anymore.  Idk if any of that is helpful, but thanks for hearing me out and letting me write out some thoughts I think I needed to hear for myself. I‚Äôm also here if you ever need someone to dm and listen&lt;3 I hope things start to turn around for you soon b‚ù§Ô∏è",False,False
