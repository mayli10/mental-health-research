Like, I don't know if I'll end up making myself sick by trying to eat a normal amount of food. I have a tendency to restrict simply because the symptoms of not eating are less significant than the ones I get when I eat. There's no clear pattern though. Just a vague idea that the more I eat the more likely I am to get sick. I figured out how to get better faster when I do get sick, but that's it.  I did remember after making this post that I have some ice cream in the freezer, but I feel that I'm too hungry and even the entire pint won't be enough.  EDIT: Suddenly I feel quite tired, so perhaps I might finally be able to sleep ðŸ˜´",False,True
