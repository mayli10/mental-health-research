It sounds difficult to deal with the fallout from prednisone like that. I hope you are doing better and I'm sending you an internet hug just in case you still feel that way. Thank you for sharing your experience with me and thank you so much for your advice. I'm going to try my hardest to stay hydrated, stay away from junk (and somehow break my 6 month binge ugh), and not mess with my face at night. Easier said than done but holy crap will I try üíôüíô",False,True

I started meticulously logging my food intake my first day on prednisone because I was so terrified of gaining weight. I had lost a lot of weight due to illness, then sadness after a breakup, and secretly wanted to keep it off. So the prednisone itself was not the only precipitating factor in my ED relapse, but that whole thought process around avoiding weight gain and consciously deciding to track my every morsel was 100% the the last straw that sent me spiraling into full-blown anorexia after several years of recovery.  That was in February 2017. It took me over a year to gain back \~25 lbs, and then I promptly lost it all again... I am at the same weight now that I was at diagnosis of my actual chronic illness, which is ironic because I remember feeling ""so thin"" back then (coming out of a recovery mindset and losing weight unintentionally) but now, in ED-mode, I feel so fat.   Feels great to know you can control your weight even on a shitty drug like prednisone, though. Right?",False,False

For me it didn‚Äôt even cause water retention but if it does for you, try not to weigh while you‚Äôre on the med. don‚Äôt restrict water!!! You‚Äôll retain more not less if you do. Water weight will go when you come off it. Apart from retention, weight gain related to steroids is from increased appetite, like 99% of med related weight gain... it‚Äôs highly unusual for people with EDs to be affected in that way since we don‚Äôt eat ‚Äúto appetite‚Äù anyway. Often people with EDs will be on antipsychotics, steroids, etc, and not gain where ‚Äúnormal‚Äù people would. Try to stay as calm as you can because the med may elevate your anxiety a bit... make sure someone knows you‚Äôre taking it so if you have any weird psychological reactions, someone is looking out for you.
