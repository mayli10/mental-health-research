Huh my dad is the same! I learned to eat gigantic portions as a kid from him :(",False,False

I mean, that's simplistic. But was it part of it? I was always the same with food too. My dad also does that, and I wouldn't say he has an eating disorder, but he might be where I got the ADHD from He's just chaotic and eats one gigantic meal a day.",False,True

I did well in school, was an early reader and really just generally curious, ""smart"" child. Thought I did well in highschool but looking back, I can really see how that's when it started. Couldn't manage a schedule, do homework/projects on time. Did horrible in some subjects (math and chem). Did really well in other subjects (English, History, French) so my parents and teachers just thought I was lazy. Then, when I got to college/University I got a lot better because I was interested in what I was doing. Had straight As most semester and a strong GPA. Got into grad school. But it was still just SO HARD. I just can't start proiects, readings or papers ahead of time. I'm a teacher now (while still in grad school) and marking is just horrible. The papers are boring. I have to stop every 5 seconds to correct mistakes so I lose track.   I also have chronic migraines.  Can't regulate my emotions for shit. Super anxious. Had a rough family situation growing up. I'd say I'm also pretty impulsive, especially with money and like, tattoos. I'll find myself eating something and I just won't know why I did it, so I'm also impulsive in that sense.   I've taken Adderall a few times when I had to crank out papers, and it's helped but definitely not in the non-adhd person who feels like they're the protagonist of limitless way. I was just like, able to do my readings without stopping every 3 minutes to look at my phone or get a diet Coke or a snack.    Thank you for sharing, that's really comforting, as well as the advice.",False,True

I was diagnosed when young but refused meds cuz I did well in school and thought I didnâ€™t need it. I would say it contributed to my ED a lot, which I have been suffering with since I was 13. I have some emotional regulation problems, which caused a lot of conflict in my family and defs fueled my Ed. I am also extremely impulsive because of ADHD, which contributed to it as well. I have bulimia. Currently Iâ€™m still struggling but itâ€™s a not better with my meds (adderall) which I went on a few months ago, (also be careful Iâ€™ve tried like 6 meds and the side effects get bad if your purging or fasting or drinking a lot) I still have the thoughts but donâ€™t act on them till my meds wear off in the evening , so itâ€™s improve my life and reduced my b/p a lot.  With fasting sometimes I feel clearer but other times I get migraines (i also have chronic migraines ), but itâ€™s not recommended to fast while on meds so I donâ€™t really do it that often.",False,False

Before that, when I was a teen, I constantly did the 'eat nothing all day, binge in the evening' thing that's relatively common here, not sure if that qualifies as anything really.",False,False
