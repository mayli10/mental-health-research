My fav is butternut squash and cauliflower with a bit of soy cream - so flavourful and low cal. I basically microwave them (too lazy to steam) and blend them in nutri bulled with some spices.,False,False

I like making simple smoothies, salads, soups that are basically just blended veggies and herbs (a bit of soy cream if you are feeling extra).  Iâ€™m honestly mostly too lazy to actually cook and eat convenient things or just microwave butternut squash packets, but if I do I love anything with shirataki. It does bloat you a bit though.

I also used to be obsessed with rice paper rolls, they can be made so low calorie - but the sodium in them is a bit of a drawback.",False,False

A tablespoon or two of trader joes soyaki and any frozen stir fry veggie mix. You can add cubes of tofu if youâ€™re feeling fancy or just want some protein.
