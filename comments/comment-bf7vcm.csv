Maybe on a sticky note to put somewhere you'll see regularly, maybe just in the notes on your phone. It might help to have a reminder that you must be pretty hot for even you, the person who judges and hates and criticises your body enough to have a disorder around it, to have a second where you thought you were looking good. Idk about anyone else, but when my self esteem is low it's hard to remember any time when I didn't think I looked like the kid of Gollum and the great goblin from the hobbit lmao.  Also well done, that's massive!",False,False

I have a 21 bmi right now as well and while I know I’m is a perfectly okay, healthy weight, I also know that it can feel like it’s not enough. the ever-oscillating thoughts I have when I look in the mirror from “ wow I kinda like how I look today” immediately to “my thighs are fucking huge and I want to DIE” are SO very real and exhausting. also, congrats on getting published! even though I know the whole self-discipline thing totally feeds into having an ed, you still did that. hope we can learn to take it easy on ourselves from time to time &lt;3",False,False
