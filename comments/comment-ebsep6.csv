I‚Äôve never know food to feel oily like that and it made my stomach hurt but I ate it and I saw it as variety and a means of filling calories I would have issues getting otherwise + a source of dietary fat  I feel proud but also bad about wasting the calories because even if it‚Äôs technically lower in salt I could have went with a slice of cheese or two for more dietary fat and less calories but would have probably broke my sodium limit goal for the dat and can‚Äôt win either way,False,False
