I’m planning to bring this up this week in therapy. I’ve been avoiding it too long- I guess I’m embarrassed that we talk about my ED but I can’t bring myself to believe it. ,False,True

I'm not sure that this is exactly what you're talking about, but I can definitely understand irrational ED mindsets that cling to you like ivy.  I know you said that you avoid talking about it, but maybe one day you can mention these thoughts to your therapist and begin to work through them outside of the echo chamber of your head. Other than that, all I can really say is that I feel you and I'm sorry that you're stuck dealing with this bullshit on top of 'regular' ED stuff.  ",False,False
