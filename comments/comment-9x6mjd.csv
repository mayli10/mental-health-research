I was thinking when it happened about all the people that are on the edge or close to it already and how this would affect them. I know how easy it is to get triggered by even the smallest thing and spiral into thoughts and actions of self harm. And this, honestly, is a pretty big thing to a lot of people. It is ***unfathomable*** that admins didn't even *read tne fucking sidebar* before banning. They could have messaged the mods, like they've done with plenty of other (more populated) subs, giving the mods a chance to explain or chsnge the sub in a way that complies with admins wishes. Or quarantined it. But to summarily just disappear a strong support space that a lot of people rely on every day to get by, I just can't believe it still. I keep thinking they're going to realize they made a mistake and reinstate it but it looks like they keep just doubling down, finding more ed subs to ban.  Sorry this comment got away from my first focus - you. You are awesome and I hope you're all out of crisps so you can't eat anymore! :D Stop self harming, do it for us! And if you can't, well then please be careful and safe as you can! I'm just going to keep saying to myself ""Tomorrow is another day, another chance to begin again"" and fuck the admins.",False,True
