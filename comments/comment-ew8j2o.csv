She was very understanding and explained that the one she was prescribing me was less safe in other ways (blood clots) but was the safest for my particular needs. I’ve been on it for a few years now and haven’t had any side effects at all that I’ve noticed. (It’s called Yaz, in case you were curious.)",False,False

Ons brand I went on made me so depressed I would go motionless and just cry for hours on end some days. I’ve since switched to a different brand and it’s my favorite I’ve been on so I’ve stuck with it for like 2 years now. I haven’t had any issues while being on this one I’m on now, even while low restricting so  Granted, when I first starting taking birth control like 4 years ago, I bled SO MUCH; like full-on period, for a month &amp; a half straight. It went regular after that, though. But apparently that’s a common occurrence when first starting the pill so idk",False,False

It hurt when they put it in and I had really bad cramps for about 36 hours afterward but then I was fine. I don't get a period anymore, in that I don't get the bleeding part, but I do still get cramps like I used to once a month and a little PMS. so for me it's been really great and I recommend it, that being said I know people who have had bad experiences getting theirs.   another option is nexplanon which is the implant. a few of my friends have it and they raved to me about it. very few side effects + easier to put in/remove. I'm considering switching when I have to get my IUD out.   hope this helped!!",False,False
