I urge you to go about this the healthy way--You will be mentally stronger, happier with yourself, and your body and adult self will thank you. I know its hard to ignore the disordered thoughts but once you give into them, it gets harder and harder to make them go away. I do not want this to take control of your life--I wish it never took control of mine.",False,False

Take it from those of us who are older- screwing up your body, your hormones and your metabolism will _irreversibly_ fuck you up down the line. You might lose a little weight from fasting at this age, but is it going to be worth it down the line when your metabolism stalls out completely at 20 and you can't lose weight ever again?
