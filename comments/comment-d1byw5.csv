When I met him I was doing well at the time, and weighed 115. I haven’t been at my lowest ever weight knowing him, but I have been as low as 84. Right now I’m 95. When he sees I’m losing weight we argue a lot more, and especially about that. If he were attracted to that, I’d probably be much worse off. I can’t imagine how I’d feel in that situation.",False,False

I know my husband thinks I’m sexier when I’m skinny and toned. He says he doesn’t care but I lost 25 pounds in 4 months and it was very obvious he preferred it.   I shouldn’t care but I do. So I got nothing for you except I’m your company in this misery.,False,False

He has said he finds me unattractive when I lose weight so it feeds into my cycle of no matter what I weight I'm not good enough.,False,False

I'm glad our SOs have the decency to not pressure us to be any one weight. Can't help feelings, I guess.",False,False

Or think back to when you were a heavier weight and if he enjoyed touching you/etc back then? Its like when youre a teenager and youre like ""ok I want my boyfriend to look like this"" but then even if he doesnt look like that he can still be attractive to you. Maybe your husband prefers you skinnier but that doesnt mean he doesnt think youre still hot when your heavier. hope this makes sense.",False,False
