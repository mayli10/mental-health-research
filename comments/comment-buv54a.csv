I didn't want to come off as jealous or controlling, but you're probably right. I just didn't want to acknowledge it. Also ""letting"" her be overweight kind of came off as harsh, but my intentions weren't to be judgemental at all.  And yeah, her binge eating is a disordered habit so I didn't know if it would turn into some other disordered habit which kind of worries me.   I'll take your advice into consideration and look at different subs that could help with her weight loss. Thank you for responding, I'm gonna try to support her in a way that won't trigger me.",False,True

Your role here is to be supportive in her efforts and perhaps refer her to outside resources such as r/LoseIt, or encourage her to reach out to a therapist regarding her binge eating.  Frankly, I don't think you should do more than that, because this is obviously negatively affecting you. There seems to be a control or possibly jealousy issue between the lines of your post.   And as a side note, if your friend is binge eating, she already has disordered habits. Counting calories and tracking nutrients can be an empowering experience for many people and is not inherently disordered. You cannot hide facts from her, and if she is going to develop an eating disorder, it will happen with or without you.  Remember that diet culture and food culture are two sides of the same coin.",False,False
