I know my anxiety, body dysmorphia, and extreme self-consciousness skyrocket(ed) whenever someone comments/commented on my body. it's because when someone comments on your body, it confirms to you that people are watching &amp; judging you, and that makes you want to restrict more bc of body dysmorphia, etc, etc. it's a whole cycle. it sucks. the only way I found around that is to hang out with people who never comment on my body or appearance - it really helps. and if I can get out of a situation with judgmental people/body-commenters, I take it.",False,False

Other than the fact you are UW and people are worried about you're weight shows that there is at least some discrepancy between your self-image and reality.  &amp;#x200B;  That's the reason I can't go an hour without checking my collarbones. And why there are thousands of ""guess my BMI"" threads on proana sites. It's all dysmorphic bs. :(  &amp;#x200B;  In my experience, it seems like people (including myself) are very detail-oriented. So instead of just seeing the whole of their body and realizing their overall body comp they just focus on their stomach/thighs/arms etc. And the details just drown the rest of the picture out.",False,False
