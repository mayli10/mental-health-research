Like ...some days I love food. And I enjoy it. Other days I hate it. I’ll restrict, or purge. I’ve never told anyone. I’m technically overweight so it’s hard for me to say I have an ED because I can go days or weeks without worrying about things. But sometimes it’s like my brain goes crazy and I google how many calories are in a freaking grape, and then I log 20 grapes just to make sure I include all my calories?! I also truly 100% believe if I lose weight and get to my goal weight (which isn’t even an outlandish goal weight, it’s just a basics almost normal weight for someone my height) that I will be happy and healthy and get this thing behind me. Like I will die on this hill is how much I believe it. I know it’ll make me feel so much better.   I have put myself in the “disordered eating” box. I’m 30, and this has just been ramping up this year, though I’ve always had body dysmorphia.",False,False

Like, I have had an ED for over a decade, and still have thoughts that I'm faking on a daily basis. Telling people you're super into fitness is also a common cover-up, not evidence of faking. So is thinking you're actually fine and just trying to lose weight bc you're ""fat"" and ""need"" to.   It's not fake, I promise.",False,False
