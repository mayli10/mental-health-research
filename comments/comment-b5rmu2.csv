I hope you find a therapist who actually helps and cares about you. She is not doing a great job...  I'm so sorry for all the things you go through. That seems rough and coping with it is probably intense at the moment. Seeking help is, to me, a good indicator that you need someone to guide you and this therapist has no right to tell you you shouldn't rely on others. If everyone was following this she would have no job?!  ",False,False

I really shouldn't make sweeping generalizations like this, *but* I'm American and I did a short degree in the U.K. I happened to experience several traumatic events in the first week I was there (sexual assault, anaphylactic reaction to food in a restaurant, and then my living situation falling apart two weeks before term began in a town with almost no vacancies). Naturally, I sought refuge at the student counseling centre. I can't even tell you what an absolutely shit experience that was. My God. I was fresh off two years of treatment for EDNOS when I arrived in the U.K., and that was actually the year it morphed into full-fledged anorexia.   Sorry for the rant, but that's just to say I am so sorry you're dealing with all of this on your own. I think a lot of us can relate to this struggle to get help in the first place, to afford treatment, or to be taken seriously. Please listen to the voices of reason and support on this sub and do what you must/can to take care of yourself. It probably gets said a lot, but feel free PM me if it helps.",False,False

They also aren't generally regulated by any governing bodies, so they kind of have free reign to recommend whatever weird shit they want.      Anyways, you might want to look into Clinical Psychologists (therapists who have more education/training, and whose practice is more regulated) or Psychiatrists (medical doctors with psychological training, also highly regulated) who specialize in EDs.

""Cornerstones of wellbeing"" or whatever? Bullshit. Absolute bullshit. That's not where you start. You start with coping skills (like you said) or mindfulness therapy or Cognitive Behavior Therapy (CBT).   My advice going forward would be to look for a psychologist, NOT a psychiatrist, with a Ph.D.. They're far more likely to be able to give you actual therapy than whatever that person has been doing.

If you can, see an outside therapist who specializes in EDs and youll have a way better shot at matching up with someone well. I know its more daunting because its not free and you have to go through insurance, but with most therapists if you talk to them and say your insurance sucks/doesnt cover them/youre just broke, theyll make some kind of deal to lower the price for you. when my ed specialist found out my insurance wouldnt cover her, she halved the price and was understanding about meeting less frequently.   im so sorry youve had these horrible experiences but i hope you still have the energy to try again and find someone good &lt;3",False,False

It is normal if a therapist say : I (personally) can't help you cos I don't have the skills/tools or means to help your specific case, therefore I refer you to other person better qualified.

But I'm in the UK where mental health stuff is honestly terrible, and I feel like part of the ED coming back is that I can't get help from literally anywhere for my (pretty severe) anxiety, so a BIG part of my head is just saying if I starve myself someone might actually take me seriously.
