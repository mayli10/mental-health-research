I was talking to a new dude the other day and was sending him photos of myself from the past few years, there is legit a 50 lb difference between my HW and CW. He's like ""what do you actually look like -now-?""   Mate I have no clue, hope you can like me for my glowing personality.",False,False

I have no earthly idea what size I am. I take measurements but the evil demon living in my brain tells me I’m doing it wrong and I’m actually 4837 inches bigger (and it’s not like irl stores have sizing charts handy anyway because that would be far too helpful, and god knows I can’t get in a dressing room without a full mental breakdown)  Anyway, do you know how to sew? I picked up an old crappy machine at a thrift store a few years ago and it has been a serious lifesaver. I have approx. 0 skills when it comes to anything creative but with YouTube tutorials I was actually able to salvage a bunch of my bigger clothes. I’m poor af too so it has saved me a lot of money since I don’t have to buy new work-appropriate clothes every time my weight fluctuates",False,False
