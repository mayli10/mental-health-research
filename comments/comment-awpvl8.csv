When I do grocery shopping I take so long because I'll be like ""I want Halo top"" and look at the flavors. I'll compare calories for 20 mins. Then I'll decide ""it's too much NVM"" and go to another part of the store. Then decide I DO want it and go back to the ice cream.  I always like when there's an employee in the aisle because then I'm like ""oh no I look psycho"" and just leave without buying anything lol",False,False

Even the simplest choices are hard and I wind up just doing nothing because I can't make up my mind. I think for me it's just a huge fear that no matter what I pick, there will be ""cons"" to deal with. Why do you think you have issues making up your mind?",False,False
