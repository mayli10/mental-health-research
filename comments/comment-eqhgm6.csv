All of that is why you should definitely talk to your therapist- and no, 600 cal/day is not enough to live on for any sustainable amount of time! I am speaking from personal and professional experience. Your body will start to break down and make sacrifices to keep you running.   You’ve got this, there is life beyond this",False,False

That’s seriously amazing, and no one can ever hear that enough.   That definitely sounds like a familiar trajectory to me. When I stopped using, it definitely ‘crept up on me’. It was very much like subconsciously seeking out another way to distance myself from my body, but food seen as ‘okay’ to manipulate like that because of how highly our society prioritizes bodies of a certain size and shape.   We live in a diet culture, and no one is immune; my father also struggled with first an eating disorder and then alcoholism. He’s been sober now for almost ten years—it’s definitely possible.   Dependence is dependence is dependence, and it doesn’t matter if what I’m dependent on is my drug of choice or if it’s food. Restricting and other ED behaviors also 100% give neurochemical effects—it really is just another form of addiction.   Lastly: I’m so proud of you for reaching out, especially this early in your sobriety! You’re never on your own, and you’re more than welcome to post here or message me if you ever want to talk. You got this!",False,False

I am so proud of my fifty days, seriously thank you for even acknowledging that part of my story!   I noticed the strange eating habits a little bit after I stopped the drinking. Initially I convinced myself it was to lose a little weight I had gained from the psych meds, and then it turned into the numbers. The scale number, the calorie number, the number of time I eat a day, the numbers lost, it just became an addiction of that. I am dumbfounded how it even happened.  I am trying to truly stop things before it gets out of hand. I do not want my mind to do that “flip” where suddenly I’m not aware of it anymore. I see it a lot on this sub, the little comments and posts where people have truly lost it to their disordered thinking. I wish nothing but hope and recovery for them, I’m just trying to prevent it.  I will do some research on relapse, and having different disorders at one time, that’s a great idea.  Thank you so much for your response! Makes me feel a little less lonely.",False,True

That’s a huge achievement!   I definitely see where you’re coming from. It’s common for people with addictive personalities to ‘switch’ between different methods of self-medication. I’m no doctor or psychologist, but I’ve been clean for almost ten months now. Eating disordered behaviors picked up BIG time for me after I stopped using, and apparently that’s a common experience among people with a history of more than one maladaptive coping mechanism. ED relapses a decade or more down the line aren’t uncommon, either; I can find some studies on comorbidity and relapse for you, if you want. I did a lot of reading to try to ‘make sense of it all’ for myself, and I’d be happy to share.   I would definitely bring this up to your therapist—it’s awesome that you’re self-aware of this, and conscious enough to do so. I wish you all the best, and I hope that everything works out for you!",False,False

I have an extremely addictive personality, and it turns into an addiction for me. The feeling of not eating, but not feeling hungry (because I do consume those calories, I rarely feel extreme hunger), being in total control of my body and food, feeling like I even have control over the health aspect of it. I know I am getting in my calories, so my body isn’t going to necessarily fail on me or tell me to binge because there is no reason for it to. I give it what it needs while also doing what I want. Great feeling.  Yea I’ll talk to my therapist.",False,True

You should bring this up with your therapist, absolutely.",False,False
