I lost my period too and I kind of welcomed that development, but it is of course a bad sign.      When I pretty much only ate pure protein for a while, my liver was so damaged that upon seeing my blood test results, my doc asked me if I was secretly an alcoholic.      When I restrict heavily, my blood pressure tends to get way too low and I pass out in public frequently.",False,False
