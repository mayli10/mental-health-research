You shouldn’t feel bad about the food. Twenty-two hours is a very, very long time to go without eating. Most people rarely go above seven or eight hours without eating when conscious. You took the time to try to value the meal your mum made instead of just tossing it, and that thought is worth something.  On the downside, chewing food does raise insulin levels, which I do believe puts a dent in fasting. On the upside, you should probably take that as a sign to let yourself eat something like fruit or grains or broth to gently break your fast. Your body needs food to run everything from every cell in your body to the muscles in your heart. Needless to say, you deserve a meal.  Feel better darling, best of luck. You’re doing what you can. Don’t be so hard on yourself.",False,False
