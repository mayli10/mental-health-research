It does blunt your appetite, and there's the temptation to just not eat while you're taking it. Don't do that (seriously, I reached my highest weight doing this because I kept binge eating at night when it wore off). If you take Vyvanse, eat normally during the day, and it kept me from binging at night after it wears off.",False,False
