I read this and then went to your page and read a couple other posts because your situation is exactly one that I was just recently in myself. My (now ex) boyfriend said the exact same things to me, and it was a huge catalyst for my eating disorder- it‚Äôs now worse than its ever been. Please , do not stay with this guy. You deserve better.
