It's frustrating because I can't find relax or find pleasure in the smallest treats anymore, the anxiety just isn't worth it. Even grapes and rice cakes make me feel bad... that didn't stop me from eating a ton of the former, and then running ten miles in the morning!  I hope you had an okay night and, like me, are breathing a sigh of relief that the holidays are over!",False,False

Depression is debilitating and it looms over you on even days where everything *should* be okay. I think my depression started when I was 18 as well, but I had severe anxiety growing up.   Try to stay strong. I sound like a hypocrite saying this, because, I like you, am completely over life, this existence, and have officially given up on being hopeful for the future. But I’m with you here. I understand. ",False,True

It just doesn't feel possible to get better when I literally can't remember a time I wasn't mentally ill.

My ed started around 18-19. I’m 27 now and it’s never gotten better. I wish I had gotten help right when it began. If you don’t mind me asking, how long have you had your ed?

I don't consider myself super-disordered (in terms of b/ping, I don't do that), but I've been haunted by major depressive disorder for a significant chunk of my life, and it makes me feel like I'm hiding something black and rotten inside.  Two years ago, I went to my first New Year's Eve party, hosted by a guy I'd just started seeing. We kissed at midnight, which I'd never done before. I spent the night (nothing happened, I'm a virgin, but it was momentous/strange just to be in bed with a man). I woke up in 2017 thinking that was going to be the year I finally achieved normalcy in all aspects of my life. Ha.  Do you have any intentions for NYE at all? I used to sometimes look forward to being alone, having fancy snacks (prosecco, good chocolate, crackers and olives) and watching some artsy-fartsy movies in my pajamas. Not sure what I'll do this year, I could spend it doing much the same thing with my family nearby, but that might almost be more depressing since they always have fondue and Champagne and I'm tired of being around people enjoying things I can't eat.",False,False
