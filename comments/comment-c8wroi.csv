When I switched to her I was feeling pretty worn out from being passed around a lot over the last year, and I hadn't liked my previous one that much (she wasn't awful, and was very sweet, but she spent most of our time talking to me instead of letting me talk so I felt like I spent a few months receiving no help). So I think I was apprehensive and afraid that I was going to just settle because I didn't want to try any more people (like you said - exhausting). But after a few weeks I realized I felt comfortable and didn't dread going, and that was enough for me to relax and ""enjoy"" my therapy time.  I think there are a few ways you could step back and assess it: do you literally dread or hate going (not just because therapy is hard work and sometimes painful)? Do you feel uncomfortable while you're there? Do you feel like it's helped at all, even in a small way? I think if you feel a strong negative about any of those things, then maybe it's time to look for someone else. You know what's right for you. Trust yourself. But don't give up!  I hope none of that came across as patronizing. I'm definitely not an expert; I'm just glad that I'm in therapy! I hope you find what you are looking for! &lt;3",False,False

I've seen the same person three times so far and am feeling pretty ambivalent about them but I'm trying to decide if I just need to stick it out a bit longer. The thought of trying to find someone new is exhausting lol. But like you said it's not good to settle either I guess.,False,True

It took a bit of searching to find her (and trying out other people), but I’m glad I didn't end up settling even if it took a while. I have had bad experiences in the past (a few years ago), but it has really been worth it for me to try to move past that trauma and find someone who will really listen and try to help me, without just throwing meds or threats at me.   She’s really gentle with me and always meets me where I am. She usually asks me what I want to talk about each time, but also has notes about things we could cover if I don’t have anything in mind (or if I’m avoiding something, let’s be real). She is such a good listener, and when she does have recommendations for me she takes into consideration how I feel about them, like with mindfulness exercises and such. Like, she’ll have me try something, but she never forces me to do something that I didn’t like. She is also so good at picking up things that I do like! I had mentioned this putty I had bought to play with when I want to pick at my nails, and she liked the idea so much that she bought a few kinds to have on hand for me and her other clients. And she always lets me draw when I want to, even when we’re talking. Sometimes she has me sit with my feelings (whether that be sadness, guilt, or a tightness in my throat) and see what happens, or describe them like they are a creature or landscape. It helps me feel more in touch with my central nervous system. Anyway, like I said, I love her. Hahah.  I usually get myself a bubble tea before or after, too. Going to therapy is definitely deserving of a reward - something that will make you feel good - and I like getting fruit teas with no added sugar. Slightly sweet but still pretty good for me.  Good luck with your therapy pursuits!",False,False

I found him 'cause I went to my college's counseling center, and I ended up getting referred to him since he's their only ED specialist.   I've only been seeing him for a bit more than a month and now I'm going to residential, but I'm honestly so grateful for him. He's been my primary support through this really bad time.  I had never sought therapy before, but every other type of doctor has always been extremely dismissive. And, it's because of my therapist that I got referred to a medical doctor and dietitian that really care and also took my concerns seriously.  What I like about my therapist is that he's really honest, while also being very empathetic. He's never been afraid of calling me out on my BS and doing some tough love, but I can tell that he does it from a deep place of caring. And, he's never commented on my appearance, which I highly appreciate.   He specializes in psychoanalytic therapy (as in, he actually attended a psychoanalytic institute for 4-5 years after his post-doctoral); he's extremely knowledgeable. I respect his intelligence, and he knows it's not his place to talk to me about diets and whatnot. I've heard a lot of horror stories here about therapists not knowing the basics of CICO, but he never brings that sort of shit up and I love him for that.",False,False

I am a real challenge because I often don't believe that I'm sick enough to need treatment lol but have been treated for anorexia. I tried an eating disorder group therapy and found it to be super helpful. There was a bit of accountability expected, you didn't want to be the only person not making goals and trying to accomplish them, no matter how small the goals were. It was really nice to be able to talk to other people my age struggling with eating disorders. We weren't allowed to talk about any numbers (number of meals, amount of weight gained or lost, etc). I didn't have bad experiences prior to this (with eating disorder treatment, at least.) There are so many options and I hope that you are able to figure something out for treatment!",False,False
