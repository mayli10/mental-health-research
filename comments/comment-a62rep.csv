So much easier than measuring actual pb. You might need to compensate with a little extra liquid. ,False,False

The five really freaked me out because I had eaten a ton the day before and it terrified me that I could go up so easily.  But even after seeing the correct number I feel like I need to lose to get me farther away from gaining everything back (if that makes sense).  I‚Äôm not happy with my weight I was just like okay letting it sit for awhile as long as I didn‚Äôt gain but now it seems to easy to gain especially with tons of Christmas treats temptations around the corner.    Thanks for the advise anyways.  ,False,True

Will probably do that when facing down charteucerie boards over the next couple weeks of social events :p  And dont worry about that pound- fluctuations of up to 5 are normal. Keep weighing yourself as you maintain and youll get more comfortable with that :) ,False,False
