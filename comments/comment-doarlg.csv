Ever woken up drenched in sweat after a binge day? That’s your metabolism burning what it now considers “excess” energy",False,False

If I’ve been maintaining despite restriction, suddenly eating 500-800 extra (good nutritious) calories seems to remind my body I’m not actually starving to death and I start losing again. I really don’t know if there’s anything more than anecdotal evidence to support that tho",False,False

It's called the Thermic Effect of Food (TEF), and it's basically the metabolic energy cost of digesting the increased amount of food, so the more food you eat, the more calories you burn digesting it.  It's a fraction of the caloric value of the food itself, though, so it's not really relevant to your calculations in any meaningful way.",False,False

Personally I always eat a little more calories before fasting, and I actually lose  a little tiny bit more.    However, I don’t have any scientific proves, you could do a research to know more about it!",False,False
