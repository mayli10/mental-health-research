There both 300 mg of caffeine and have a bunch of different flavors.  For cost I like Folgers instant coffee. I use 1 to 2 table spoons depending on how strong I want it. 2 tbsp is the equivalent of a Bang.  Not caffeine but I find having enough electrolytes also helps a ton with the mental fog. For that I use emergen c electro mix, I found it at Sprouts. This shit is a game changer for me. I actually feel normal despite only eating 500 cal a day.",False,False
