Then, when I was about 18 my ex and his parents would consistently make comments. I was a healthy fucking BMI.   No wonder I have issues.   Your family sound really really toxic. I would just say something like:  ""What do you mean?"" ""Why is it okay to make comments about my weight? I have two children. Which is more of a priority? Looking good for *you* or making sure my children are happy, healthy and loved? Why do you keep attacking me, and reducing my self esteem?""  Alternatively you can say just once ""I would like you to stop making comments about my weight. If you do, I'll leave."" Then, leave.   You can leave the room, just walk out mid sentence each time they do it. If they do it more than 2-3 times just actually leave. They'll soon realise that if they want to see your family, including your precious children they've got to respect you.",False,False

That's why SO rarely interacts with them unless it's a big/important event. He was outside when it happened, and i didn't want to cause a scene so i waited until we got home to tell him. He gets explosively angry.",False,True

Thatâ€™s so shallow and cruel. You have brought new people into the world with minds and thoughts and feelings. Youâ€™re devoting your life to raising those kids...and thatâ€™s so beautiful. Your body had been through so much and I am so so sorry they canâ€™t see it for how strong and powerful it is.    Childbirth looks so rough on the body....so please be gentle with yourself.  You canâ€™t always control how awful other people are, but please donâ€™t be too hard on yourself. You have so much to be proud of, and you deserve to feel good about yourself.",False,False
