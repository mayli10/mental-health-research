I still go on walks when I want to (we're getting some gorgeous fall days and temps) but I've stopped using my Fitbit as part of recovery, so I just walk where I want to walk and come home!",False,False

I was recovering pretty well for a sec BECAUSE i was working out—only weight training. it shifted my whole conception of eating and shit. Like, I’m eating protein and healthy foods so i can build my muscles and be all ripped and shit. and working out wasn’t motivated by a desire to lose weight but rather to just be more able? like i could pick up big boxes if i needed to.  if you feel like you’re still in a place where exercise is making you feel “safe” or that it still operates in a way that makes you feel like you’re controlling your calories in/out, maybe reconsider or try to reframe.  the hardest part is being honest with yourself bc tbh it’s hard to tell what your own motives even are :/",False,False

But like, at the same time, feel somehow mentally \*better\*? It's really hard to explain. There's more brainspace, now that I'm eating more. My creativity has starting stirring again.

Exercise is good for health,  depression, routine, anxiety. My therapist has always encouraged it but I’m not an over exerciser.
