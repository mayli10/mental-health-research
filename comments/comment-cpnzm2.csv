I assume everyone hates me and nobody cares about what I have to say when I try to talk. This is backed up by the fact I have no friends lol. Do you have any hobbies or interests? You could try and join a club of people who share an interest and then you'd have something in common to talk about so you wouldn't have so much pressure and anxiety hanging over you when you try to talk. Also, a whole bunch of fresh new people to meet. This is what I plan on doing when I move soon.   You can message me if you'd like, I understand how you feel!",False,False
