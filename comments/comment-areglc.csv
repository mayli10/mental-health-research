I think my disordered eating came at a time when I felt emotionally constricted (like I just had to survive and not really feel strong emotions and limit myself emotionally). It kind of translated into me just being picky and limiting around food. ,False,False

For many of us the ED is a coping mechanism or it is liked (conmorbidity) to other mental illness.   So sure, under hard situations, or when (in my case) anxiety-depression is manifesting it comes hand by hand with ED thoughts and behaviors. Idk like a bully that is waiting when you are weak to kick you in the floor... but at the same time it is a ""safe"" place to refugee while I am under pressure, I mean safe because it distracts me from the world and I know nothing else  tbh.    Now I am deep in all 3, soon going to the psychiatrist, and maybe some part of my brain wants to get there at its worse to be taken seriously...",False,False

I'm bipolar type1 and when I'm manic I don't eat. When I'm depressed I either don't eat or binge. When I'm in between or hypo manic I'm still obsessed with food and restrict like crazy, but still eat above the danger zone. Tried lithium to keep me from having manic episodes and it just made me depressed and I started binge eating again which led to purging again, which in my book I feel is worse for me physically than just restricting and fasting while I'm manic so I went off of it and decided to just be a bit on the crazy side. I can't really treat one disorder without the other because when I'm fasted it triggers manic episodes so it's like a ""chicken or the egg"" thing ðŸ˜µðŸ”«",False,False

You won't finish if you aren't mentally stable is the real truth. Take some time for yourself. Don't call it dropping out!
