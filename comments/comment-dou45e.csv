People didn’t care too much about how I ate until I had a major weight loss — I got a lot of questions until enough time passed for my weight loss to be old news. Most formerly-obese people who became very thin for societal standards that I’ve talked to relate. Some people like it but for me this curiosity made me feel very self-conscious. :(  This was only rivaled by the time when it slowly started coming out that I didn’t eat a whole bunch foods anymore. {*FTMP: anything that has meat (including red meat, poultry, &amp; similar) as an ingredient*} I got far too much attention over this despite not advertising it.  A lot of diet patterns seem to be a big deal. I definitely would understand why vegan specifically seems to be biggest one to you if it’s the only one you’ve adopted that’s a rare choice. But anyways I think it’s for a mix of reasons;   ***  People are fascinated by decisions that aren’t common especially if they seem to be “active” choices rather than just a result of things like habit or preference.  In general people are fascinated by diet patterns and lifestyle-commitments that encompass diet. However; rarity and novelty do matter. Most people would have no interest in hearing about someone being on Atkins or another low carb diet. Compare to how people react to someone has been committed to Keto for years—there’s gonna be higher intrigue, far more questions, and far more concern/critics.  People are also *highly* fascinated by diets that exclude an entire food group/entire major subgroup.     • + this is especially so if that groups typically eaten daily by most people.     • + this is especially so if it cuts out the most loved &amp; most popular cuisines/entrees in ones society.         People without EDs also seem very much in-tune with the fact that food is one of the best tools for bringing people together, and that particular foods are standard for celebrations, embracing spontaneity, connecting to  ones culture/heritage, experiencing a new culture, enjoying travel etc. Consequently; people are going to be curious about how someone navigates and feels when in these situations. The curiosity increases with how ‘permanent’ the choice seems, how much it restricts variety and how much it seems to sacrifice spontaneity.",False,False
