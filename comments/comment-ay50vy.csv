Its freezing cold outside, but I force myself to walk an hour each day and I'm not even dressed warmly enough. I push through and think about the calories, staring at the shadow of my thighs, then down at my legs and always catching my reflection in store and car windows. All I think about it is keeping this feeling and increasing it, because nothing makes me as calm, happy, and safe as losing weight again.   With EDNOS, I become addicted to binging as well, but its always with the expectation that if I gain, I can restrict and lose again. Its a long, tiring cycle, but I need it. ",False,False

With the ednos, I gain and lose pretty sporadically. But when I start to lose, I really start to lose, and it's because I go down that same rabbit hole.    I've been heavy restricting for only a few weeks again now, and it amazes me how fast I lose all my safe foods.   I bought a ton of stuff a few weeks ago, spent hours at the store meticulously picking out a bunch of low calorie options, and only a few weeks later, half of those things are fear foods for me.   My brain goes at itself like:    ""omg how could you possibly think that black beans were ok to eat?""  ""Well they are reduced sodium and they aren't refried... the nutrients are pretty good... so they would be really filling and provide some decent nutrients for you...""  ""120 calories for a half cup! No! Have another cup of black coffee and grab some broth or diet coke if you still want something. That is ridiculous.""  ""Oh..."" ",False,False
