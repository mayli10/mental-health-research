You are goal is essentially to become underweight. That inherently is not good for your health.   I've been there. I told myself I'd never go below 120 lbs. That would be way too much.  Well that was 10 lbs ago. I'm by no means healthy, even though I don't feel sick. That's the thing with this disorder, it will never be enough, and you'll keep losing weight because of gives you a sense of control.  Please talk to someone about this. This is not healthy, and it will eventually ruin your health.",False,False

I know I’m not magically going to be happy at any weight, but if I can fluctuate up or down this number while still trying to be healthy I’d count it as a partial win. I guess my expectation for myself is that I won’t intentionally diet or set a new goal weight at the 95lb mark.",False,True

I guess that’s my biggest deterrent in taking this too far though? If I get officially labeled or diagnosed with some sort of ED, then I have to recover. I’d rather feel “meh” with my body at a somewhat reasonable point than drive myself off a cliff and be forced to recover to be truly healthy (but not thin).   It’s good to have a (relatively) reasonable limit. No one can enjoy their body if it’s too sick to function. This a good spot to share as a step above screaming into the void, someone will see and hear what you have to say :)  I hope things go well for you!!",False,True

Absolutely amazing :)  Is there anyone irl you can tell this to, to keep yourself accountable?   I have what I think is a hard stopping point (TW NUMBERS!   I tell myself I can’t go below 90. But I also spend time playing with BMI calculators online and know the siren call of lower numbers. If it’s not to hit below 100, it’s to hit a certain BMI, or to just hit 89, just to see how it feels. Crazy shit like that.   I really really love your post. I’m going to try to keep it in mind for the future - psyched for you asserting yourself and wanting to live your life without endangering it. :D",False,False
