It doesnâ€™t matter about what theyâ€™re attracted to, thereâ€™s a whole mess of just being with someone else that fuels them. Talk to your guy, or gtfo.",False,False

I could never imagine that. But listen : starving is not the solution. You can't play the game 'look what you've done to me, this is your fault' because if he's cheating on you he doesn't give a shit about you in the first place, you'll only be hurting yourself.You're strong, you'll be okay.
