To me, it sounds just the same as any other impersonal, manufactured top 40, except you can't understand the lyrics and the idols are worn and overworked and suffering and the industry is evil and the fans can be very racist and batshit insane.  My abuser used to make spotify playlists for me and whenever he would be punishing me by giving me silent treatment until I had a panic attack, my only validation would be these shitty playlists. And they were LOADED with baaaaad kpop tracks and I had to listen to it and suffer bc it was all I had.  I hope the trend dies down because it's given way for so many racist fans to fetishize Asian men and become obsessed with Korean culture in a similar way that Weeaboos are with Japanese culture, not to mention that they are putting massive amounts of cash into pockets of the people who abuse, overwork, and exploit the idols they claim to love so much. I'm less annoyed by the music than I am concerned and worried for these people being grossly mistreated.  I hope this girl doesn't mistreat or fetishize her child in any way.",False,False
