I kinda went trough the same thing (isolating myself due to depression, selfharming in all the ways i can etc..) and i hated myself for wasting so much time with selfloathing so i ended up going really hard during my last semester of highschool were i would constantly attend parties n force myself to socialize. Idk if it was worth it, i should have just probably reached out for help. Anyways, i hope you will get better, remember recovery is always possible. Stay save",False,False
