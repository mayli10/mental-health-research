Yeah, there are definitely some disordered folks who post there. But fasting does not mean a person has an eating disorder. This shit is complex and confusing. When I go through spells of eating regularly for a few months does that mean I no longer have an eating disorder? Or when Christian Bale starves himself down for a role does that mean he has one? What about someone on a hunger strike?      There are tons of reasons someone might be fasting, and a disorder is.... a disorder? They happen because your brain chemistry gets a little wonky. EDs are confusing because they manifest physically and through particular actions, but those actions on their own don‚Äôt inherently mean a person has an ED.     Anyway, im pretty sure the reason ProEd was banned was simply due to the name association with other proana communities. Proed was always pretty tame and had strict rules, as to not encourage unhealthy behaviors in others. Unfortunately the same cannot be said for ProAna communities across the internet as a whole, and reddit probably didn‚Äôt want to look like they were hosting a platform for that kind of shit.",False,False
