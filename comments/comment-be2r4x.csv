The women Iâ€™ve been attracted to look different to the women Iâ€™ve admired in an ED way, and the attraction FEELS different too. The latter fuels ED, the former distracts from it ðŸ˜‰",False,False

Which is cool but I guess a lot to process.  &amp;#x200B;  Someone explained that they realized they were bisexual because someone else pointed out that straight people don't check out and appreciate the bodies of the same sex. Notice, sure like you would notice a cool looking lamp or something, but not check out.   &amp;#x200B;  Thats what made it click for me that im probably kind of gay maybe?",False,False

That should help with your confusion.  When I was younger I wondered the same thing; am I just acknowledging she's pretty or actually attracted to her? I thought about whether I would have a relationship and/or sex with a woman and the answer was yes. Poof, I'm bi!   It's simplistic and might not work if you're asexual, but it helped me figure myself out.",False,False
