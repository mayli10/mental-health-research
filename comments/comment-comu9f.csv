I had never thought of it before but now I can't leave the house without a beanie. At least it's very cold winter where I am so it's not weird. I need to get over it before summer comes, but I don't think I'll be able to. In photos I crop the top of my head out. It crushed me. I can't feel beautiful without that app, I can't let it go. It's so fucked. That button that flicks it back and forth from the original to the edited version is like a knife in the chest. Fuck facetune",False,False
