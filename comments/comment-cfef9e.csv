A lot of us use food as a coping mechanism to deal with stress or to unwind after a hard day or difficult task. When I used to smoke regularly, it helped a lot if I went for walks while I was high or did yoga because then I was “relaxing” my body without food and eventually any munchies cravings just went away and I wouldn’t binge when I was high.",False,False

If so you can ask the bud dealers which stains promote appetite and avoid those. You can describe what kind of high you’re looking for and they’ll point you to the right strain.   If not, I snack on fruit and vegetables when I get the munchies. Also drink lots of water. Your body sometimes makes you hungry when you’re dehydrated.",False,False
