Look at r/fasting.  Loads of people there with good advice for water fasting or intermittent fasting.   Basically you stop eating for lengths of time that suit you but make sure to include good things like vitamins and minerals. You continue to keep up your daily routine too.,False,False

Fat for a while first, then as your body looks for glucose for your brain to function on, it starts to break down muscles for glycogen once it's used up the available glycogen in the liver. You can go a good 4 weeks or so surviving on water alone before you start to suffer the nasty parts of starvation.   You will lose fat continuously as the main source of sustenance and muscle along with it. The less activity you do, the more muscle your body will catabolise leaving you feeling weak and gradually slowing down your metabolism to try to save you from starving to death. Your body will live off your fat stores and lean mass for as long as it can until you're emaciated. This includes eating away at your heart muscle once it has no other lean mass to turn to.  You'll feel like shit all the time. Your muscles will probably cramp up and ache horribly from the electrolyte imbalances that will inevitably hit you. Your sugar may drop and run very low, putting you in danger of some pretty nasty permanent damage if you can't bring it back up. You won't be able to think straight and holding a conversation will be difficult. Your hair may fall out, if you have any. You'll be cold all the time as your body tries to shut off unnecessary functions to save as much energy as possible.   You will be miserable. It's not worth it. Even if you lose enough weight to decide you're comfortable with yourself, you'll probably have very little muscle mass under the fat remaining on your body because you didn't exercise to maintain it so it will have wasted away considerably.   Don't get into this horrific disorder. Don't let it fuck you up as badly as it's fucked the people here up. Once you have it you're stuck with it and it will take your life away from you bit by bit. You'll be absolutely miserable all the time.  Take care of yourself please.",False,False
