I like to give people their own stories in my head. Like ""Oh, look at that wispy girl in a crop top and high waisted shorts! Looks like she spent an hour on her makeup. How, it's only 7:30am!! Well, maybe her makeup is so put-together because she's terribly insecure and anxious over impressing the other girls in her sorority, so she got up at 4am and has been drinking coffee since then, using a shaky hand to try and re-try her eyeliner wings multiple times in the mirror until she got it right.""",False,False
