I strongly suggest you talk to a therapist as they are the only folks who can help you answer that question  and find a way to healing if you are suffering. Good luck to you and take care of yourself!",False,False

It’s self diagnosable, you don’t need external validation for it. I’m also a male btw. I’ve had disordered eating habits for years, I’ve associated food and appearance since I was 5yrs old.   I’ve recovered from AN and I’m here for you, don’t seek validation! If you feel like you have a bad body image and associate it with eating, then you have disordered thinking.   Have a great weekend mate! Analyze your thoughts and ideas then make rational decisions. Look at why you feel that way.",False,False
