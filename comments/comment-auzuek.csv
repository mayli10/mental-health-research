Maybe try and contact a mental health charity - they might be able to help you find affordable services. Please stay safe. Xx,False,False

I relate to every single sentence in this post. 6 1/2 years and an engagement ring. He left me for my mental health issues. And I'm constantly binge drinking and I need to stop to speed up the weightloss process.   Everytime I try to quit drinking I feel like I start drinking more. ðŸ˜©,False,False

It must've suck to be left like that. I know it might be hard, but believe it or not, you should not lose weight just because of him. Sure, you two have been together for a long time and considering the engagement ring, you two are really on the road to forever. But darling, believe me when I say that when a door closes, a new one opens. He might be your world now, but eventually you will realize that you can still enjoy your life without him. You were able to survive before you met him, right? You can still do it again.   Do not chase after people who chose to leave you. You are much better without him. I know you might not feel that now, but I hope someday you will. ",False,False

If you weight less but still have the same mindset, that will probably not change his consideration.   You should work with a therapist. For yourself, not for him.

Iâ€™ve been to both inpatient and the intensive outpatient years ago when I had just turned 18 and my parents paid but I know it was expensive. I have insurance this year through my mom but the costs of whatever insurance wonâ€™t cover are on me and intensive outpatient and inpatient both mean not working for my time there and maybe losing my job because my performance has been absolutely terrible the past week and a half anyways. ,False,True

I felt the same but to my surprise my doctor did just once, when I told him that I was finding it hard to get through my day to day, and that medication was my last resort while I seek out therapy.

Do you have a number for the outpatient care that you can call, or ask your primary care doctor to call on your behalf? Is there any financial aid you can get now you are single?
