Yes but it's more about keeping the number EXACTLY the same. Only down and same. Never up. No because I do have some body image issues and food does actually make my afraid to get fat. ,False,False

For example, even though I need them on most days, the Boosts I bought a week ago are still sitting unopened in my fridge :/ I'll just have to keep working at it and keep trying to overcome my fears.",False,True

I actually really like the way I look right now. I feel comfortable. Clothes fit well. But it's all about the number. I've been maintaining without purposefully trying to for a few months because I know if I go lower, I'm in too deep and I get too sick to function.",False,False

I donâ€™t even care about weight anymore, Iâ€™m just obsessed with calorie numbers. I am trying to slowly increase my numbers so I can get to maintenance at least by Christmas, and then gain some weight after, but itâ€™s so hard.

I hate how thin my arms look and my boney shoulders but I recognise that I'm hardcore addicted to seeing that number go down like some fucked up Skinner Box.  Leads to starving myself until I hit a new LW, then panic binging when I catch a look of myself in a mirror so I can get back to losing.",False,False

Strangely, I'm happy with my body at 58 kilos, or 55 kilos. I'll be happy only at those two weeks weights, but the idea of 56 and 57 kilos freaks me out to the point where I just cycle between trying to gain weight till I'm 58 again, or restrict till 55 again.  I know it's not exactly what you were talking about in your post, but I feel like my ed is an extension of my OCD rather than an actual eating disorderâ„¢.",False,False
