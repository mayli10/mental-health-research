The thing is, I don't actually need to buy any entire packages of anything because I know at some point it's going to end up in our break room for a ""crew tasting."" I take a nibble and get back to work, leaving the rest for my coworkers to graze on. Once I know what something tastes like, a lot of the time it loses allure and I feel satisfied. Every once in a while something will blow my mind and I'll buy tons of it (looking at you--baked lemon ricotta cheese, pepita salsa, and blue cheese mustard). Especially if it's a limited time item. But overall there's so many treats to try that I get sick of all the junk and only want healthy food at home. To all you customers out there--if you didn't know, you can sample anything in the store that doesn't require cooking with no obligation to purchase it. If something is taunting you from the shelves, just bring it to the demo site and they'll open it up for you. We're usually happy to do it since the leftover opened package ends up in our breakroom for the staff to eat ðŸ˜‚",False,False

I swear to god I have to walk down the frozen food aisle with my eyes averted because everything at eyeball-height is delicious cookies and chocolates and just a plethora of delicious forbidden yumminess. Whenever I give in and get something (looking at YOU, tin of Jingle Jangle) it ends up being a midnight bingefest of orgasmic delight and then next-morning regret.  How do you do it?!?!?",False,False

I lived right next door to a Trader Joe's though and went there every day. Sometimes more than once a day. I often joke about my 6 month stint in the city where my only human interaction was with Trader Joe's employees. It was one of the best parts of my time there.   I've worked for Trader Joe's for about 2.5 months now and it sounds scary but... it's been a HUGE push for me to recover. It's amazing. You know how all the employees are so lovely and helpful? There's a reason. Pay and benefits are one side but we're constantly hydrated, caffeinated, and FED. I've worked in food service all of my prior work life but I can honestly say that no job has fed me like Trader Joe's has. It's a really food-positive environment and we're encouraged to taste all of our new products so we can talk to customers about them. There are even scheduled formal tastings when we roll out a lot of new products at once. It's pushed me to get over a lot of my fear foods so I can be the most helpful crew member I can be. Also the exercise is great. My TDEE hovers between 2500-3100 Cals burned every work day. I'm rambling now. TJ's is the best. It's saving my life every day. ",False,False
