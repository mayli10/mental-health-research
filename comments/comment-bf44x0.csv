The good news is that the gown covers EVERYTHING from neck to shins, so the weight gain won't be crazy noticeable. My biggest tip is practice your poses and faces in the mirror so you look good in photos. \[This article\]([https://www.wikihow.com/Look-Thinner-in-Photographs](https://www.wikihow.com/Look-Thinner-in-Photographs)) has some great advice. I also practiced my makeup ahead of time, and tried out a few makeup/outfit/jewelry/shoe options. IMO, a knee-length a-line dress and pointy toe heels looked best under my gown and made my legs look bomb.      Anyways, sorry you're not having the best time. But grad is an exciting time; celebrate all your hard work!! Congratulations and good luck &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3",False,False
