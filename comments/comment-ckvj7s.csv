However I'm working on being more forgiving with myself; I'm having my favourite chocolate for breakfast tomorrow because I've been craving it and would never allow myself to eat it, so I'm like fuck it if I don't eat it I'll end up bingeing on it. All in moderation. Food is meant to be enjoyed.",False,False
