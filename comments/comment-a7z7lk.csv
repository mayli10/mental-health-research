Just depends on how my panic does when I try to lessen the weighing. Bleh.  Thank you, and lots of love to you.",False,True

Maybe start working on lessening it. Like, weigh yourself when you wake up, after the first time you eat that day, and before bed. Or some variation. So you're not completely blind week after week, but you're slowly working on it. A little progress is better than no progress.  I wish you luck",False,False

I know she meant well, I'm just.... Definitely not in the position to be able to do that yet.   Best of luck to you as well.",False,True

I’m sorry you had an unproductive appointment. Weighing only once a week has been difficult for me, but it has improved my self image. Now I don’t spend all day berating myself if I didn’t like the number on the scale, and I’m less likely to restrict which leads to fewer binges. I still put way too much emphasis on my weekly weigh ins however. It’s almost like I can’t even think once I step on that scale. Everything else disappears because I’ve finally got that data again and I’ve satisfied that itch! I know I’m doing the right thing for myself limiting it to weekly weigh ins though. Best of luck to you. ",False,False
