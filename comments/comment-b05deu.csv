I recommend you stop the ephedrine before you become dependent. It's possible you can lower your tolerance again if you cycle off the ephedrine for a bit.  I recommend you try to taper off the caffeine as well if you ever want to lower your tolerance again, but that's where your withdrawal symptoms will really show, so do the ephedrine first at the least.  Other than that, I have no advice, sorry.",False,False
