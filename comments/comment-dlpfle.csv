You seem sweet too.  Despite ED groups getting a lot of bad rep it really is so helpful to vent at people who understand. I was in hospital this morning talking to a mental health team and they just don't understand as much as folks with lived experience do",False,True

I relate to your story. Do you know what sparked that stupid tumor again for you? I find it helpful to try to understand what is going on in my life, how that is different from before and how it may have contributed to relapse, or whatever you want to call it. Like you described it feels so safe, comfortable, like home almost but scary af at the same time. Sending hugs!!",False,False
