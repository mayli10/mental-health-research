It wasnt diagnosed immediately so I was very sick for 2 weeks and couldn't even eat. Lost 15 pounds. Two of my friends even wanted it so they could lose weight so I licked all over a cookie and they ate it, but neither of them got sick.   I'm just saying, it's not just you. Don't feel too weird about it. â™¡ just make sure you drink enough water.",False,False
