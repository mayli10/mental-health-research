He targeted you because you're probably empathetic, fascinating, and delightful to be around. And him, being a pitiful cretin that fears being insignificant, warped that to suit him.

Everything you wrote was accurate. He was never satisfied with anything or anyone ever. Always found some reason to be unhappy.   I have a good therapist who specializes in narcissistic abuse/emotional abuse cases and I‚Äôm working to dig myself out of this hole.

So please bear with me while I lay down some unsolicited advice.  To people like him, life is a game- a competition, to have the most presentibly perfect everything. But guess what? That is 100% unattainable and therefore he will never be happy.  And what do unhappy people do? They shit all over the people in their life in some fucked up attempt to control at least one thing: your happiness. If they can't be happy then they will ruin yours. Every. Time.  The things he has done and said to you are in no way your fault, nor are they actually a reflection of your choices around your body. They are 100% caused by him being a fuckin shitty person who attacks others. And he will do it to the next girl too, no matter her size. He will find something not to his liking and wear her down. I guarantee it.  Anyone who cannot love you as you are will never be worthy of having you love them. The love you have to give is best showered on yourself first, and then a on a deserving person later.  But please please don't hurt yourself now in hopes he will feel bad. Because he won't. He will just see it as a flaw and use it to pepper whatever hateful words he has waiting in the wings. And then you will be hurt or damaged with no justification and feel worse. And you don't deserve that. Your body does not deserve that.  Instead, please find a way to cut off contact with him. Don't give him access to keep hurting you. You already gave him your heart once and he dropped it. Don't let him keep your friendship too. Take it all back. Then once you have all the pieces again you can put yourself together and stand strong.   You have a good heart inside you, and people with good hearts can always get back up. You will get through this in the end. You're gonna look back one day and be shocked at how you were able to move on and heal. Because I'll happen slowly, unnoticeable at first. But it will happen.   You deserve love and kindness and someone to share your life with. And you will have that.   I tell this to all my friends and it has held true every time: The moment you find yourself happy being alone WHAM! Someone will come into your life that will enrich your days and fill your heart. You just gotta spend the time loving yourself. And time will keep going no matter if you do or not. So why not use it how you want to?   I hope this didn't sound too preachy.
