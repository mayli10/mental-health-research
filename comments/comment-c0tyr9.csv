Cause even when using dark humor to cope it can be hard to actually talk about your shit. Cause then it's real. So the few whom want to talk to you after hearing the jokes have been confronted with denial before, by other joker people, maybe by yourself. So talking is hard. Especially about hard subjects. In my experience if you are ready to talk to someone you should do it directly, not make them sweat it or test them with jokes (if they talk to me or do xxx then I will yyy). Lots of people used the if x then y method to negotiate with themselves if and how to speak to people, but it's a very toxic way of wanting someone else to be/act perfect in a difficult situation, setting them, and yourself /recovery up to fail.     This sounds way more angry and didactic than I ment it. I kinda wrote it cause it is what stops me from asking if someone is allright sometimes, hoped to give some perspective from that point. Not cause I don't like to joke üòÇ",False,False
