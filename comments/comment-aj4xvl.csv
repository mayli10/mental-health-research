If I can chime in with something maybe helpful on the weight side, I’ve become a big fan of Happy Scale (on iOS, though there should be similar apps on Android). They apply a smoothing algorithm on your weigh ins, referred to as your “moving average,” so that when I gain 3 lbs from constipation HA HA, it tells me that my average is still trending lower and it’s ok. Helps me not base my mood on my weigh in as much and feel that what the scale tells me is more “real.”",False,False

At my lowest BMI (18) I still thought I was fat. I have narrow bone structure, so my hips dictate that I will never have a 'gap' bc my thighs are close together. So as long as my thighs touch (forever) I will always see myself as fat.",False,False

I look in the mirror and I see far, fat, fat. Then I realize I can wear my watch at the smallest notch, I can feel my hip bones and shoulder blades protruding, see my ribcage stick out, wrap my pinky and thumb around my wrist with plenty of overlap. I see people who look like me and I think they're fine, but I can only se myself as a literal whale. I wish I could see myself how others see me and get an unbiased view of myself.",False,False

The other day I was looking at myself naked in the mirror and for 0.2 seconds I liked my stomach, and then that disappeared and I can’t find it again. But I *know* I’m smaller because of how my clothes fit. I tried on a pair of athletic shorts from my freshman year of high school last night. I’ve almost gotten rid of them so many times because they were too tight on my thighs and were visibly strained across the front from fitting my ass. To my surprise, they fit now! They’re even loose on my legs! I just ??? don’t understand because I feel big but I know I have to be smaller than I perceive. It fucks with my head",False,False
