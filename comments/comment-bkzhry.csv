So your BMR is what you would need if you were sitting/sleeping all day, your tdee is generally thought of as your BMR + calories burned through daily living/exercise.  It seems like Fitbit is putting those values together for you and listing your tdee as ""calories burned""",False,False

If you've charged it today, it may have the time it's been charging as intense exercise. It's a common bug.  2) If you don't see any weird spikes in the graph, then you've probably burnt that much. Fitbit actually tends to underestimate calories",False,False

Sorry this isn't much help but it's nice to know I'm not alone.  But more on your issue -- I've done a similar amount of exercise today and burned ~1300. It definitely depends on heart rate and weight (which, as factors of your overall fitness and metabolism, determine your TDEE). I tend to do a lot of cardio, and burn fewer calories doing the same amount of work as someone who typically exercises less. I am still however overweight.",False,False
