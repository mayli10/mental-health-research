Anyway, your bf knows you have an ED and thought it was a good idea to confiscate food from you? Dude, of course you freaked out. I start feeling panicked over people touching/taking my food for any reason, let alone something as triggering as this.   However, judging by your opening lines, he's sensitive and understanding for the most part, right? In that case, once everyone's calmed down, I would suggest going to him to have a mutually respectful conversation about what happened. And about how you both might handle these situations better in the future, such that he is not commenting on/confiscating your food, and you're not ham-throwing/cursing at him. I'm sorry you had this experience, but some good can come out of it if your bf gains a better understanding of your support needs.",False,False
