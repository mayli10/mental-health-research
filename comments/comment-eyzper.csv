You talk about things. They notice your behaviors. They understand how you understand the world. They notice things wayyy before you notice them. And then ask you things to help you realize them.   Therapy takes time. It’s not immediate. You just have to find a therapist that clicks with you.   There’s a reason why we’re doing what we’re doing. When we ALL know the facts and the logic. And what’s healthy and what isn’t. It’s a coping mechanism and most of the time you THINK you know exactly why but chances are there’s way more going on than what you realize. I really would urge you to try therapy again. Maybe the therapists that you’ve seen before have an approach that doesn’t work for you. Maybe you need talk therapy or art therapy or music therapy or CBT or DBT or one of the millions of other schools of counseling out there.  There’s so many options. I MAY be biased because I’m going to school for counseling but really, most information about therapy isn’t widely known or easily accessible.",False,False

At the end of the day I know what I'm doing, I know rationally what I should and shouldn't be doing but some times I lose control over the thoughts. What's a therapist going to tell me that I don't already know? (Genuinely asking)",False,True

I relapsed but it was only after about 2 years. I can’t imagine how devastating it is to think you’re kind of in the clear and then it comes back. And now you not only have to think about a boyfriend catching on but children learning habits as well.  Have you considered therapy? It could be helpful in your current situation.,False,False
