I use it for *everything*. And as backwards as it sounds, I would actually eat a lot less (not that I eat a super healthy amount now lol) without it because it provides me with that reassurance and security as opposed to ""well, I think I packed this cup of x loosely enough, hope I'm not over haha"" and then logging cals for the cup plus 60% of another cup 'just in case'.
