Basically: low kcal high protein, put in panini grill, eat every day.  Love chicken. High protein low calorie. â‚¬7,50 per kilo which is nice, I'll eat a kilo of it or more in a schoolweek. Can put one chicken breast in my panini grill and it will come out perfectly, squishy on the inside and crisp outside and never raw. Zero carb, very low fat. Goes well with all condiments. Goes well with all vegetables. 10/10 eat every day.",False,False

Edit to add: Iâ€™m vegan and before that was vegetarian for more than half my life except for a one month period where my eating disorder wanted me to eat chicken because it was low calorie and high protein but I couldnâ€™t stomach the texture.,False,False
