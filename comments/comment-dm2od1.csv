Ensure also has a variety of shakes ranging in different calories, vitamin and protein amounts although I don’t know how that tastes I haven’t tried it yet",False,False

I feel a bit goofy buying them (and admittedly they’re not the cheapest) but they’re delish and pretty easy to get down. For protein shakes I’m currently liking the premier protein ‘cookies and cream’ flavor. And shout out to trader joe’s butternut squash soup. Non-dairy yogurt maybe? There are tons of smoothie recipes out there too if you have a blender handy.,False,False
