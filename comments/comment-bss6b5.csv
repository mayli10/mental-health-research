If you eat sugars and do cardio, those sugars are likely to be directly part of your energy used to cardio. If you eat protein, probably not, because it has a more complex route to become energy.   But you can think of it like this, when you eat a balanced meal (not pure glucose), you are putting money in the bank. When you do cardio, you are spending from your wallet.",False,False

So let's say you've eaten nothing the whole day and do cardio and then eat those 120 cals-you'll burn fat more effectively. If you do cardio in a fed state, meaning you eat before exercising, it doesn't burn as much fat but helps build muscle I think. Don't know about the difference in calorie burning but definitely recommend fasted cardio as it targets the fat otherwise out of reach. I just log my exercise and cal intake not really paying attention to which came first if I'm not specifically exercising to eat a family dinner or smthn and even then it's kinda a conscience thing ðŸ˜…",False,False

Eating it before you exercise just means that your body used the 120 for the exercise. Eating it after means that you're replacing the 120 you just spent from other reserves. If that makes any sense lol",False,False
