It's not common, and I definetely agree that there isn't lots of funding for EDs and there's a lot of misunderstanding. However, I've seen heaps of people claiming to be better, and statistically, there's a good chance that at least one of them isn't lying. Then again, I've never been better myself, so what would I know?  ",False,False

Medical understanding of EDs is terribly inadequate. Research is scant, and the research that has been done is largely fatally biased to the point that methods don't even apply to most people suffering from EDs. I have a degree in psychology and was so disheartened when I realized how much the industry is lacking in regards to understanding EDs.  Like the commenter you quote, I too hope to see more effort put in to developing understanding and treatment of these dangerous disorders that affect so many people.",False,False

I've been through two programs: a hospital php twice and then went out of state for rez/php. Their programs all catered to people who are underweight. They were trying to make me eat 3 meals, 3 snacks and a dessert daily when I was already overweight. Eating wasn't even my issue, they graduated me from rez too early because I wasn't refusing to eat like a lot of people there. I tried to explain that food hiding and lying for approval were my base issues. They acted like those were just character flaws and not related to ed. I ended up going into massive restriction/purging cycles after each program.   Ed is not just being overweight. Fuck.",False,False
