They provide a sense of safety from the sense of safety comes a retrospective happiness of achievement. Established routines facilitate a sense of control. The sense of control provides a solution to my anxiety. Definitely allowing me to function. In the same way religious or political dogma’s give people confidence.       You can’t prove or disprove a concept which is beyond quantification. You can’t apply linear measurements to ED’s. It’s beyond conventional narratives. Sure you can measure or monitor weight gain or loss but the substance of the problem, your consciousness. Remains beyond a typical norm or dynamic. Remaining totally open to interpretation and beyond metric or imperial concepts.       For example, some recovering addicts can’t be around there former addictions. While other addicts embrace the culture of the addiction by working with other recovering addicts. This seems logical and illogical at the same time.    There’s no handbook to humanity, I believe. Though there is a book written by Buddhadasa Bhikkhu Called Handbook for Mankind. LOL.      When you say “fake safety and temporary gratification.” I would say, though hunger and thirst are temporary. They are just another human emotion like fear, love, happiness, sadness and frustration (all temporary). Each making up the building blocks in the structure that is an ED and thus another form of our human expression of fear, betrayal, isolation and grief.   If people fail to understand. It is because people have yet to experience the condition themselves.       Just the thoughts of someone who has for a long time been suffering with an ED. Sorry if I went on a tangent. Thanks for letting me share.",False,False
