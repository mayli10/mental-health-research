So means good blood test and you can have some physical activity with no issues. I have never pass the bench of 17.4 and I never got a comment about concern of low weight besides that if I get sick from an external issue I can't afford loosing weight, like extra kilos are a buffer from severe illness like hepatitis or such.",False,False

Iâ€™m pretty sure my sister was the same way, so I think it can be fine for some people as long as theyâ€™re healthy otherwise.",False,False

I think it all depends on circumstances tbh. Like my brother has no health problems and is only slightly underweight because his metabolism is super fast and he'd have to eat an almost impossible amount of calories to gain weight, but can maintain his weight by eating just a bit over what's considered the normal healthy amount. However, any time I am slightly underweight, I tend to be anaemic and low in a lot of stuff and generally quite sick because its due to not eating enough.",False,False

She just had a small appetite.  If she was only 2 lbs underweight, she felt fine, but once it started to drop more than 5 lbs underweight, her joints would hurt and she'd get sick frequently and have a hard time shaking off a cold until she overate intentionally for a few weeks and put some more weight back on.",False,False
