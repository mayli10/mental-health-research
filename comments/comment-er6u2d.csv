If you are fasting for religious reasons then yes, but if you are doing it for weight loss then it shouldn’t make a difference as it has no calories. Personally, I allow myself diet soda on a fast but others might not because of the 1-5 hidden calories. I think it just depends on your definition of a fast. I am completely uneducated on weed though so I could just be saying a bunch of nonsense right now. Take what I said with a grain of salt ‘cause I can’t guarantee how accurate it is. :’)",False,False
