I know logically (and knew before starting to try and lose weight) that my history would make it really hard - I'm just struggling to make sense of it all in my head. Most people don't think the hardest part of dieting will be making sure you eat.,False,True

Dieting is a strong predictor of eating disorders. Although most people who diet do not develop clinically significant eating disorders, most people with eating disorders have a history of dieting, if that makes sense. Calorie restriction has been shown to create obsessive and disordered behaviors even in healthy individuals (if you aren’t familiar, look up the Minnesota starvation study). And the  line between what is a healthy diet to lose weight and what is clearly disordered behavior can be unclear.  There’s no easy solution to this unfortunately, but you shouldn’t feel like a failure that you can’t “just diet.”",False,False
