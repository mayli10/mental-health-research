This is why I’m still a virgin @ 20 years old :-) Haven’t kissed anyone for real. Had a break through last semester and had a few cuddly moments with a boy but he probably thought I was the most awkward thing ever for being so still the whole time. I hardly breathed. I hate initiating contact or continuing contact with people because I don’t want them to think that I think I deserve to be touching them . Fuck these diseases ",False,False

I haven't even held hands with anyone. It's embarrassing and pathetic. And admitting that I'm in my 30's just makes me feel like the worst loser.   I'm very lonely but I'm afraid of anyone truly seeing me, let alone touching me. ",False,False

Don't feel it's fair to my boyfriend but I hate my body so much that being self conscious would distract me from what's happening and that would be worse I think. ",False,False

Now if I don’t have sex at least twice a week I feel like a disgusting pig unworthy of love. Right now, I’m waiting for my not boyfriend to come over after begging him to come over. The not boyfriend part fucks with me too, but at least he likes me when I’m naked. Way more than I do.",False,False

I’ve been with my so for over 5 years and he’s seen and loved me at all different weights, but it’s still hard. When we are hooking up I spend half the time worrying about my body and it makes me so sad that I can’t be completely present. Last night he grabbed my hips and it triggered me bc I’ve started body checking by feeling my hipbones and that completely ruined the mood ",False,False
