To be honest up until 6 years ago.  I didn't think my EDs were an issue or my drinking. I was functioning. Most people in the support groups I attended don't live the lifestyle I do. I guess I wanted to hear other people's perspective.,False,False

It's very moisturizing yet you can wet your face after it has dried off and you can use it as a gentle exfoliant. It leaves my skin really nice and smooth and leaves a bit of a glow even!  As for the oily T-zone I find that keeping my face hydrated in general keeps the oily parts of it less oily.  And I know everyone says this but I bought a 1.5litre water bottle and I was so excited to use it I ended up drinking a lot more water than I usually do(but of course be careful especially if you restrict you don't want to have too little water or too much) and my skin cleared up pretty well.
