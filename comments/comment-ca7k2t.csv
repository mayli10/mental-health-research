It's not pathetic, it's really part of the struggle with an eating disorder. I noticed that the more I binge on certain foods, the less I am satisfied by them too. Your brain just becomes numb to it.  I usually don't C/S because I think it's the most frustrating part, I would rather just have a full B/P because at least it disgusts myself enough that I don't eat anything for some time after.",False,False

It sounds like you were doing really well and one night might feel like it derailed everything, but it most definitely did not. You can wake up tomorrow and go right back to your good streak. I felt that way after the fourth but went straight back to eating regularly and in the right amount the next day and it helped a lot even though for a moment I felt like I undid everything. Just remember all the good you have accomplished and hold on to that feeling to get you through this rough day. You got this!",False,False
