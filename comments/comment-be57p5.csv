You may have simply over-extended the joint (is it 1 side or both?); be careful with how you move it over the next few days, avoid purging (if possible), avoid tough/crunchy food, take some anti-inflammatories, that sort of thing.  If in doubt or if it gets any worse, see your GP and/or your dentist to get it checked out.  Hope this helps ðŸ™‚",False,False
