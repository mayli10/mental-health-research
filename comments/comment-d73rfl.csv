And I had terrible diarrhea literally twice a day. My body had NO IDEA how to properly process ANYTHING for like 3 months. And I was so bloated all the time I looked pregnant.   I pretty much constantly slammed gas-x and drank as much water as I could handle. Also sooo many tums. When you restrict for long enough, your digestive system gets so used to rarely dealing with shit (literally) that it canâ€™t handle SO MUCH all of a sudden.   But eventually it stopped sucking. Otherwise. Goddamn the human body is stupid and anorexia *wrecks* your shit (again, literally).",False,False
