If it is, I'll attempt to figure out how to share an image or 2. As for description, it's a bit rough for certain ones. Not only because most are just over 10 years old, but because 4 of them were already ""iffy"" to begin with (I was the idiot that let her friend practice on her lol). The ones on my feet are thin script. Years of 50+ hr work weeks on my feet with socks and shoes has faded them a little in places, but they're still perfectly legible. The script on my shoulder blade is a bit harder to read, but it's always been that way. The base of the design was my husband's writing, so it's closer together with thicker/heavier line work. Script under collar bone is also harder to read, but that's a mix of heavier line work, my design for the lettering, and it being done by an amateur. The lettering on my side fared the worst tbh. It was already kind of shoddy looking because she didn't know how to navigate the rib cage bones properly and she didn't outline the letters. üôÑ. It's patchy, uneven, and incredibly hard to read (which is a shame because I love the quote). The ones on my hips stretched/faded in the same way most do in that area with pregnancy tbh. But pregnancy is a bit different than just weight gain/loss haha. If I'm being totally honest, they could all use with touchups, but that just sounds like more work than I'm willing to put in. Overall, most are just a little faded because of time.",False,False

All are from 2014 to this past year. I have gained and lost weight since getting them, but I don't think it has affected what they look like now, and it's always been within a normal/overweight range. The one that looks the worst is my very first tattoo, a word in ancient greek on my bicep. The ink spread (as it always does over time) but because the letters were small it's now just kind of blurry and I don't think there's anything to be done besides cover it up. But that was due to a poor design choice, not weight loss/gain. The one on my thigh is large though (approx 8x9 inches) and I am a bit worried about what will happen if I continue to lose weight.",False,False

I love looking at those super small / thin-lined / lettering tattoos, but they always look so good when just finished and new. But I heard that those thin lines fade really fast or when the lettering is too small, it won't be readable anymore after a few years... But I haven't seen any ""older"" small tattoos :)  &amp;#x200B;  Or maybe you could descrive the changes over time?",False,True

Got them all between the ages of 17 and 22.  2 on my feet, 2 on my left ankle, 2 on my hips/stomach area, 1 going up my right rib/side, 1 under my collar bones, 1 on the back of my neck and 1 across my left shoulder blade.  The only ones that haven't exactly ""survived"" are the ones on my hips. That has more to do with 2 kids in 2 years though. Tbh, I really just need to get the color touched up and refilled and they'll be fine ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è.  Half of them are script/lettering and the other half are small things, because that's the aesthetic I prefer. Favorites would be the one under my collar bone (LiveFast on one side DiePretty on the other) and the one on my shoulder blade (my husband has a matching one in the same spot, it was our 1 year wedding anniversary gift to each other).",False,False
