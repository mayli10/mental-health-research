I've lost substantial weight just to gain it all back and it's nothing less than completely devastating.  I would say ""you did it before, you can do it again"", or ""let this weight gain motivate you"", but when people say this to me, it makes me feel even worse and destroys me to the very depths of my soul.   So we can just sit Shiva, say nothing, and mourn our loss. And afterwards, we'll just figure out how to pick up and move on. ",False,False
