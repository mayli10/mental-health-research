There‚Äôs one doing IF, like three or four people on keto, and one girl who‚Äôs straight up shames people for what they eat and brags about not drinking sugary drinks or coffee.   I have to be very careful around my coworkers. They simultaneously drive me nuts AND intrigue me with their toxic behavior.",False,False
