I don't have much advice for you but just wanted to say you aren't alone in this one. I've cycled back and forth between compulsive overeating and anorexia/bulimia for the majority of my life. I'm now trying to lose weight in a healthy way and it's really really hard. My best advice is to avoid counting calories if it's triggering. Make decisions based on health and feeling good, not weight. I've delved headfirst into cooking and it's helped me focus less on the negative. Learn to love food and all the things it can do for you. Vegetables are awesome, healthy, and delicious if you learn different ways to cook them. It's not a perfect solution and nothing is going to fully stop those thoughts creeping in, but it's helped me a bit. If you ever need someone to talk to I'm here.",False,False
