I saw in your comments that you’ve suffered with this for five years. Five years of engaging in destructive behaviors makes them pretty ingrained into your psyche and we are all creatures of habit so engaging in your ED is “safe” because it’s what you know, all the rules and tricks to avoid uncomfortable feelings are clearly spelled out for you. All the things you do on a daily basis, on a minute to minute basis, to fight your ED, it becomes exhausting. Growth is so uncomfortable, no one can blame you for wanting a rest and falling back into the familiar. A year seems like a long time, but it’s only a fraction of the time you spent suffering.   It will take time for your new lifestyle and mindset to feel “normal” and “safe,” but it does happen. All these alternative coping skills and strategies offered in treatment and therapy aren’t magic words that make you feel better right away. It takes endless repetition for certain thoughts to become automatic.   Honestly, reading about dog training did more for my mental health than therapy. Animal cognition is not so different than our own. I learned in our day to day life, most of us are all just reacting to our emotions. I find that most of my bullshit stems from AVOIDING uncomfortable feelings and emotions. Until I made a habit of confronting, instead of relying on avoidance, destructive behaviors were tempting because it’s so much easier to make a complete mess of your life and focus on that rather than have to acknowledge what’s really going on.   Don’t be disheartened. You are at a crossroads right now, but you definitely have a choice in where you go. Tell yourself “I can relapse tomorrow” today and when tomorrow comes, put it off another day. Eventually, the relapse won’t even sound like an appealing option and you won’t have to remind yourself constantly that there’s always this safe space to fall back into. Eventually you’ll be able to stand on your own feet and you can confidently say the ED doesn’t serve you anymore. I believe you can get there.",False,False

You know it's addicting and that part is what gets me too. But I got bad with ED and when I did I brought on bad bipolar symptoms and some of the worst days of my life. Eds just make your mental health worse. It can be scary. What I'm trying to say is, in my expirence with EDs is that they can only hurt you, and make life more difficult. Eds can be negative energy, which surrounds you.",False,False
