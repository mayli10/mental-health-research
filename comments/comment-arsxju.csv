She sounds like a horrible little cow and someone who enjoys putting others down. So sorry to hear she‚Äôs been giving you shit OP ‚ù£Ô∏è,False,False

I don‚Äôt know this game so mentally I don‚Äôt know what the character looks like but to say ‚Äúobviously you pick the fattest one‚Äù is really transparent and then to next time say you look like her is so mean. It‚Äôs like she did it on purpose to hurt you. And she didn‚Äôt say it all at once, she did it over three occasions but did it in a way so you‚Äôd put two and two together.  How old is she? Maybe she‚Äôs a nice person but has body image issues and is just angry because you‚Äôre small or the same size and she‚Äôs just projecting?   Regardless, you don‚Äôt deserve to be treated that way.",False,False
