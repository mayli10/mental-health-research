I walked from 11 am to 4 pm, with one coffee break in one of the few places that weren't closed (friggin Sundays in a small town).

I have asked for help before, for a number of problems, and I have not been taken seriously. I cannot ask again, just to go through the humiliation of not possibly (likely?) not being taken seriously again. My preferences are not taken into account, my problems are minimised and I'm made to feel like I'm not ""sick enough"". I shouldn't have to fight WITH doctors tobhey help? They should be an ally. Either they'll be that, or they'll be nothing at all, and I will perish... and honestly, that's okay. I'm starting to come to terms with the fact that I'll probably lose my battle to poor mental health, and it's so frustrating to think nobody will give a fuck (if they ever do) until I'm visibly 'sick enough'. But by then it'll be too late, and I will not be interested in ""help"" from these people who allowed me to get so bad.   People say the NHS is underfunded. That is true. But it's NOT an excuse for mistreatment, or lack of treatment. It's really not. It seems for some people, they're psychologically incapable of thinking ANYTHING negative about the NHS... but no, it is NOT above criticism. If they get X amount of money, and when it comes to mental health, it never will be adequate, but if this money isn't specifically ring-fenced, and they decide to raid the budget and use these funds meant for mental health, for other things? That's a decision THEY'VE made. Likewise they *choose* not to help me. That's also a decision they've made. So I'm going to get sick. I'm going to get so sick, they fear for my life. Then when they, eventually, try to ""help"" me? I'm going to slap away their hand and fall into the abyss. I'll die, as part of me really wants to, but I'll do it with the satisfaction of knowing I denied THEM. I turned the tables on THEM. I subjected THEM to the same. I want them to feel frustrated, as I do. I'm not in any immediate danger. I don't want to worry but I feel able to vent to you... but the natural course of events? Deterioration.",False,False

Kind of just need to get it off my chest bc I've never talked about it  Info for context: my husband and I have been together for 7 years and bc he was the first bf/gf i had who i could trust, i lost my virginity to him. He lost his to his only other serious gf, he dated her 2 or 3 years before me when he was in high school. When we were younger this was upsetting for me but I'm in my mid 20s now and i know it's not a big deal. He told me about how she cheated on him with his friend after less than a year, and she also had/has mia. She has an uncommon name so i was able to eventually find her fb. I know this is unhealthy, but she is the exact size I've always wanted to be and when I start triggering myself i look at her pics. I know this is so weird and unhealthy but i cant help it.   She tried to contact him after we had been dating for 2 years, after her and the friend she left him for broke up, like she wanted to make up and get back together. He blew her off pretty rudely (lol), but it always makes me wonder, like why did she do that? Bc i was fat so there's no way he was with me out of choice? Idk yall. I'm sure that's irrational.   He used to talk like her ED was upsetting and worrying for him, and thats the only thing that keeps me from relapsing, but sometimes I wonder if us smoking weed and subsequently binging is any better. I'm still unhealthy I'm just gaining now. :/ ",False,False
