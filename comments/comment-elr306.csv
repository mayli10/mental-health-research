I think healthy is what helps you achieve goals that are good for your body and mind.   Intermittent fasting does that for some people, but for others, it doesn't. My husband thrives on OMAD because he doesn't get dizzy or foggy-headed when hungry, and then can just not think about food until the end of the day.   OMAD for me is disordered because I get fuzzy-headed and sort of high-feeling quickly, it impairs my ability to function, and I use it as a control/punishing mechanism.   What you are looking for is probably a registered dietitian.   Generally, the accepted medical advice is to not eat fewer than 1200 calories per day because that is the amount of food it takes to get all the nutrients you need along with macros and still lose some weight. There is conflicting research on macro breakdowns (fat, protein, carbs, etc.), but if you eat .5 grams of protein per pound of body weight, that's generally considered to be enough for the average person.   My (not a doctor, not a dietitian) suggestion would be to calculate the TDEE for a sedentary person at your goal weight, and then increase your intake by 100 calories per week until you reach that TDEE intake. Then, you will very gradually drift to that goal weight and maintain. You will have practiced eating at that amount, and it will be an eating pattern you can sustain the rest of your life.   Some people say you should stop counting calories forever to be ""truly recovered,"" but I think that counting calories and weighing daily/weekly might be a way for someone with an ED to manage their food anxieties while ensuring that they are a healthy weight and also not overshooting in recovery (which does sometimes happen if you follow the ""let go of control of food"" method of recover many doctors recommend).",False,False

Like Arod and Jlo talking about their fasted cardio trainer on social media along with other celebs.  Like starvation has become so mainstream it's hard to say ours is more disordered than that of the celebrities promoting it as a healthy life style.   Also, the 1200 is enough movement.  Daily recommended is around 2k, so 1200 is definitely under what the 'safe' amount is considered to be.  But because it's so accepted I don't feel like 800 is that low either because it's only 30% less, basically in the same ballpark.",False,False

Here are my opinions, which you should take with a grain of salt.  1. CICO isnt some infallible law. Some foods take more energy to digest per kcal they contain. Some people can absorb more/less of the food that passes through their system.  2. 1200 is probably enough‚Äã for some short small woman on a day where she lies in bed all day although i doubt its plenty for anyone  3. The healthiest diet is one which youre aware of what you eat but it doesnt take much of your headspace.  4. I might be wrong but reddit doesnt care about your health. If you look right it doesnt matter how you got there- people will still defend you if you still look good.   5. Fasting isnt a diet. How many healthy weight people regularly fast? They dont because when they indulge, they dont feel the need to overeat by 1000s of calories. Fasting to lose weight means that if you ever get there, you have 0 idea on how to maintain. Im willing to bet nobody on that sub would fast for the health benefits if it didnt result in weight loss.    TLDR reddit doesnt know whats healthy. Dieticians do. And if soemthing still sounds good and healthy even if it didnt change your appearance‚Äã or weight in anyway, then its probably healthy.",False,False

So to an extent, merely trying to maintain a normal weight and fitness level can look crazy to the outside world. As a kid in Indiana, people would straight up heckle me while I went for a run, or make rude comments because I wasn't binging (read eating the typical Hoosier feast) at a buffet. So yeah...it's really hard to tell when you've gone past the point of merely 'different from the rest but better' into 'this is too much and you're hurting yourself'. Especially since the moment you lose the first couple lbs ppl are already up your ass about not getting too skinny etc etc. Like bitch I'm still over weight!....until you're not.  Edit: The 1200 is plenty thing def applies to a lot of not physically active short women, esp of asian descent. If you're only 4'10"", that's truly all you need. If you are taller than about 5'1"" and somewhat active, 1500 is more realistic a goal. For a woman 5'4"" and inactive, 1600-1700 would be maintenance of a healthy weight. If you have a busy on your feet day job, 1800. The point is, you need to realistically tailor your intake to your height and activity level - not just to some arbitrary number.",False,False

I think most people struggle with diet culture because it seems that‚Äôs the only internationally resonating culture there is (as it‚Äôs forced down our throats - HA apologies - in the media, our social circles and language, fashion sizing, dating culture, food labels like ‚Äòlite‚Äô or ‚Äòdiet‚Äô, etc). Our perceptions of our worthiness and ourselves is heavily based on how others view us, because it significantly plays a huge role in how we are treated in society. If we diet *wrong*, then we are *faulty* and others will *see it* and we will be treated poorly. It‚Äôs hard not to become obsessed with this toxic formula.  There are so many different ‚Äòright‚Äô diets to bounce from - giving us the idea that one day we‚Äôll find the GOOD diet that‚Äôs RIGHT for us and we‚Äôll be fine and dandy and doing this human thing the correct way, and everyone will see it and everything will be OKAY.

Hell, researchers just discovered that the 'real paleo cavemen' ate way more carbs than what the general consensus is atmo.
