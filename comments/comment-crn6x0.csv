I feel like such a fat sack of failure shit when I can barely fast for 1 day anymore and then these grown ass men don't eat for 5 days and do that regularly",False,False

Happened a fair few times. The worst I got was a gnarly bruise from passing out and falling backwards into a shelf, but never got more hurt than that! Does your head feel sore/bruised? I bet youâ€™re 100% fine :)",False,False

I can usually feel it coming and slowly try to sit down.   People on the other subreddit promote keeping hydrated and keeping your electrolytes in balance. The subreddit also seems to be catered to those who are overweight. I think it's safer if you take the necessary precautions.",False,False

Ironically, the only times I've actually *blacked out* were when I was first relapsing and still eating an okayish amount. I made a few posts about it here lol. I think the stress played a big part though.",False,False

Something Iâ€™d be out for up to 30 min. Paramedics have told me when they came I was ghost white. I always get taken to the hospital because my potassium is low or they just want to make sure I didnâ€™t hit my head. But sometimes my blood sugar consistently drops and they wonâ€™t let me leave. ðŸ™„,False,False

I once fainted while liquid fasting and smashed my head on bottles of wine at the grocery store... According to my mother who was there with me, it was really scary seeing me laying on the ground unconscious for a few seconds.   Since, i eat before grocery shopping.",False,False

I have naturally low blood pressure so I have to be careful when fasting and restricting. Fainting in itself is not going to damage your brain, but if you're worried about how you fell, you can search symptoms of concussion and monitor yourself for the next few days.",False,False

But I've got a few health issues that make it pretty common. Even the Dr's don't blame it on my ED or restricting. They make it more likely to happen more frequently, but it'd be happening even if I ate like a normal human ðŸ™„.",False,False

I think a lot of people when they talk of fasting they mean intermittent fasting though. That is, eating for a set period and then fasting for a set period.",False,False
