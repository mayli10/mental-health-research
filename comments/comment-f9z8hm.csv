It used to bother me but now I appreciate how much privacy it gives me. I've had an ex that was overly involved with controlling with stopping the Ed and trust me, it's worse.   I like how my husband will just live and let live and brushes off my habits as ""oh she's just being chillycthulhu"".",False,False

To be honest he knows about 0.1% of my thoughts, but if you don’t look ill then you’re not ill in their eyes But it’s irritating the fact that he knows and just doesn’t care really, because he’s so great in every other aspect",False,True

My behaviors seem transparent to me but the older o get the more I realize everyone has a lot of their own shit going on and are completely in the dark about what people like us do alone. Also, I had only started to realize how much I hide from everyone, too. Without even meaning or wanting to. Hiding what I'm really like is more of a knee jerk response than a methodical plan of keeping people off my trail. They just don't know. Normies think people with eds never eat, if someone has an Ed they have to be Eugenia Cooney's size. It's why people with eds usually aren't going to get any help or noticed until we indisputably look like we have one.",False,False
