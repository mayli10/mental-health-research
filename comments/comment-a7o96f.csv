I‚Äôll include some of the things I do to help my sleep routine stay regular.   1.	Make sure your phone screen does that switch over to different lighting at night. Something about blue light causes sleep disruption apparently. My phone has the option to switch to different lighting automatically at a certain time of day.  2.	Turn off screen an hour or so before bed. It‚Äôs one thing to check your phone but try not to watch TV right up until bedtime.  3.	White noise helps me focus on something monotonous to quiet my racing rabbit brain. There are lots of apps you can download that have a variety of sounds to choose from. My daughter likes wind but I prefer flowing water.  4.	Dim your bedroom lights and have a bedtime routine like brushing your teeth and putting on dedicated pajamas. It doesn‚Äôt really matter what the routine consists of as long as you do it nightly.  5.	Your bed is now only for sleeping (other than any sexy time stuff you may get up to). The point here is to train your brain that the bed is a sleeping place. Don‚Äôt lay awake when you wake up in the morning, and try to nap or rest in other places during the day if you can.  6.	Stop drinking water an hour or so before bed to try to avoid having to get up to pee. Your mileage may vary on this one, I do this and still get up at least once per night because I had a baby this year and my bladder doesn‚Äôt realize it‚Äôs not squished up anymore.  7.	If you have nights like last night again, don‚Äôt lay in bed awake. Get up and read a chapter of a book or something and then get back in bed and try again. Or if you‚Äôre up with a racing mind, write down a list of everything you are thinking of and dump it all on the page to forget until morning.   Keep in mind that all the diligence in the world does not change that your brain is unaccustomed to the extra stimulants. It will take time to adjust, so give yourself times to rest during the day if you can until your night sleep normalizes. If you find your sleep isn‚Äôt normalizing after a set period of time, maybe discuss lowering the stimulant dosage with your doctor. Handling your BED with appetite suppression is a great tool but quality sleep is necessary for life so make sure you prioritize it.   Hopefully this helps! ",False,False

I took your water bottle tip yesterday and thank goodness I did, because I wasn't actually ""thirsty"" but normally drink 200oz water per day so my body is used to that level of hydration.  &amp;#x200B;  Can I ask if you have any tips on sleeping with this? Normally, I fall asleep with half a trazodone and am OUT. Yesterday I took the 30mg dose at 6 AM, was still pretty wired by 9ish, so I took a full trazodone plus some melatonin and still could not fall asleep til nearly 4 AM :(. ",False,True

ADHD treatment can include stimulant medications, but it can also include therapy and learning strategies to help organize your chaos more effectively. Seeking a specific treatment because of the side effect of appetite suppression is doing *yourself* a disservice in exploring all possible options.   Just my 2 cents, I‚Äôve dealt with ADHD my whole life and have been on all of the major pertinent medications at some point. Stimulants don‚Äôt fix an eating disorder and the weight loss you may experience might not be worth withdrawals if you ever discontinue the meds. I‚Äôm not discouraging medicating ADHD, just trying to highlight that it‚Äôs more complicated than ‚ÄúTake pill, get organized and skinny‚Äù. Best wishes. ",False,False

I know you weren‚Äôt trivializing ADHD or treatment thereof. I‚Äôm really happy your doctor is suggesting medication as an option to help you! I‚Äôve been on various ADHD meds for years and years, and in case you have never taken stimulants I‚Äôm going to give a few pieces of advice:   1.	Drink lots of water. Stimulants suppress your appetite but they can also cause you to forget to hydrate. I keep a water bottle with me constantly as a reminder to stay hydrated.  2.	Take a pill vacation maybe once a week to help stave off developing a tolerance for your dosage. Since you are taking it for BED, I suggest planning ahead meal-wise since you‚Äôll be hungrier than usual without the stimulants in your system. You‚Äôll feel like trash the day you take off, but it‚Äôs worth it to maybe prevent needing higher and higher doses.  3.	Check in with yourself for signs that your dose is too high. It is better to need to increase your dose than to decrease it initially. You can check with your doctor for what signs to look for that your dose is too high or too low.   I see Adderall or Vyvanse or Concerta etc etc etc pop up in posts relating to ED stuff and a lot of times there are comments from people angling to be prescribed for the appetite suppression by being dishonest with their doctors. Adderall is a controlled substance because of people like that who abuse it, so thanks to all of them for forcing me to pay for an office visit every single month to confirm that I‚Äôm not abusing it or selling it. :) I‚Äôm not angry at anyone in particular, just at how I was treated as a child and how those feelings of inadequacy led to my eating disorder. All the best to you! üíï",False,False

I‚Äôm not intending to abuse this, but I was prescribed it was for BED so yes, I do hope that it aids in weight loss. While it isn‚Äôt a weight loss drug, it is approved by the FDA as treatment for BED. Just because I have a long history of disordered eating doesn‚Äôt mean I was angling for this - my doctor actually recommended it before I had heard of it.   That being said, I totally understand and respect your concerns about how your disorder is perceived. I know so many of my peers took adderall/concerta without a prescription and it was incredibly frustrating for those around me struggling to find the right treatment plan and living with ADD/ADHD. I‚Äôm so sorry if I made you feel as though your disorder or your treatment was anything other than legitimate and I‚Äôm sorry you‚Äôve struggled with being taken seriously about this in the past üñ§.",False,True

OP I don‚Äôt mean you considering you were given a prescription, for the record. This post just reminded me of that issue is all.   Sure, stimulants suppress appetite. But I would caution anyone taking them for off-label reasons to be careful how you broadcast that because it directly affects how seriously people take my very legitimate executive functioning disorder.
