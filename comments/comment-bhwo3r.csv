Now I notice that people talk about diets.  I don't want to be a sensitive flower, but it really gets to me.  I want the word banned, lol.  &amp;#x200B;  It happened yesterday.  I was at the job centre having the interview to check that I'm still unfit for work and obviously it was centered around anorexia and how I'm finding it more difficult to recover this time.  The woman (""work coach"") said, ""You can have some of my fat"" and laughed.  Is that acceptable?  Again, I hate to think I need wrapping in cotton wool, but I can't stop thinking about that comment because I thought recovery=fat.  Meh, fuck her.",False,False
