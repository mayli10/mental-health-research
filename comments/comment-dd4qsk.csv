NYE- more fucking alcohol!  That’s about it. Can’t wait for the end of the year disaster to my body.",False,False

My usual cals are 1600 and something I like to do once a month is eat for two days in one sitting (3200 cals), fast the next day, then carry on with my regular eating after my day long fast.  Seriously helps me in preventing unplanned binges. Sounds counterintuitive and it's disordered as fuck (aren't we all) but I found it works best for me. Disclaimer tho, I love fasting and my longest has been 31 days so if you can't fast then something like this might set you up for spiralling &amp; unplanned binges.  Stay safe ❤️",False,False

I used to do one every weekend (continued losing weight etc), now I’m on more of a once-every-three-weeks cycle because it works better with my schedule.   Pros: 1) get to eat everything I crave in a controlled environment   2) never really get the guilty/shameful feeling associated with unplanned binges  3) never ruin planned social events/trips/special occasions by binging   4) my SO is pretty sure it’s the reason I haven’t died yet (I’m v underweight)  YMMV but yeah, works like a treat for me.",False,False
