When I was in the hospital I would faint any time I showered, threw up (bc my stomach could not handle food), or used the restroom because any “extreme change” to my body - which in the case of showering was temperature - was too much for my body to handle so I would faint. At my worst I couldn’t even stand immediately after lying down like a nurse would come and have me sit up for 15 minutes before I could stand (which was a real pain if I really had to pee haha).   But actually it’s pretty scary and I can’t say this experience necessarily catalyzed recovery for me bc honestly it didn’t but PLEASE be careful. You’re treading in pretty dangerous territory and you’re probably aware of that but it’s probably (definitely) not worth the damage to your body.",False,False
