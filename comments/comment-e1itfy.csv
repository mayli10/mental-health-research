When I started getting healthy again, I naturally gained some weight, and I hated it, cuz in my mind (which was still healing), I looked fat. Now I realize I just look ""normal"", not super skinny, not overweight. When u have a eating disorder your mind have a pathological perception of not only your body, but everyone's. I used to think my friends were fat, now I see how unreal it all was",False,False

She said in interviews that she used to diet to a dangerous point and that, at some point, she had to stop hating every ounce of fat on her body, besides she's turning 30. But I think she looks great, and healthier than before to be honest",False,False
