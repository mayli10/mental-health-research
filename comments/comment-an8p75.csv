If whatever it is is waterproof, you could stick it in a Tupperware filled with water (for the larabars most likely) and stick it in the freezer. You’d have to let it melt before you can get to it.

Don’t beat yourself up if you do end up enjoying any of those snacks. If I really feel like the risk of me binging and consequently suffering emotionally is too high, I give away food to coworkers and food drives/banks, so it at least goes to good use. Either way, good luck practicing your will power, gaining those much-needed nutrients, or donating to a good cause!",False,False

I just got into it like last month and I’m loving it LOL. I’ve been using green maeng da but I have some white Kratom on its way to me. ,False,False
