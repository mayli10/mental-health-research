I don’t count exercise calories into my total, so in my mind, I can drop coffee cals because I do enough walking to negate it. So I just factor it in. Counting a whole pot of coffee would just be kinda useless for me",False,False

I never count gum or coffee unless I’ve literally chewed 100 cals worth of gum in a day. If I’m gaining, I’ve got bigger problems in my diet than a piece of gum or a cup of coffee.",False,False

I’m actually not totally sure if it’s five calories if you chew it if you were to swallow it. Like sugar free gum logically shouldn’t have any calories by just chewing it. But IMO it’s essentially negative calories because I bet you burn some extra calories just by chewing it,False,False
