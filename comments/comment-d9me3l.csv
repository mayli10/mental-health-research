I think messages about body positivity hits a raw nerve for people with eating disorders because they dislike themselves and it's a fear. I don't think I could accept myself unconditionally and always love my body. It's a tall order. If anyone can do it and subscribes to HAES, I'm happy for them",False,False

A lot of the Reddit dude bros act like being opposed to fat people is due to HeAlTh while promoting starvation and unhealthy habits like extended dieting and keto( which is restrictive). One of the keto cult boys started telling me that if I wanted to lose weight( I was talking about cutting a few lbs) and he points to my apple saying I was gonna turn into the people from Wally because of theSuGaR.,False,False

We need to put less emphasis on appearance and not teach kids that being pretty should be your main aspiration. Like, not everyone is pretty.

When people ( my therapist, I love u but I guilty as charged) are trying to tell me the no one cares about looks and people only care about your soul and personality. When I was a kid, I was hella fat. People treated me horribly and I was the butt of jokes. My personality has always been very bubbly and nice and kinda dorky. I lost weight and became “conventionally attraction” and suddenly people saw me and decided I was worthy of being treated like a human. I had the Audrey Hepburn / lily Colin’s look at the height of my disorder and it came at the expense of my health and well-being. I became paranoid of gaining  the weight back and losing my humanity. Now I am not as thin as I was back then and again the way people see me has shifted. And I am not even fat. I am just regular slim.  Cut my hair off as an experiment and people do treat you differently.",False,False

Recovery is just a journey back to our original goblin skin. Someone make a meme of this I beg you,False,False

Not everyone has a beautiful body, whether it doesn't cleave to cultural ideals, or whether the person themself has issues with it. I'd much rather we be open &amp; realistic about our insecurities...or in my case (and that of many others), my spiritual and dysphoric ambivalence about occupying my body at all. Saying ""every body is beautiful!!1!"" can read as just shutting down the conversation. Like, great, sure, that's we needed: more stigma about how people are and are not allowed to discuss their bodies.   I get that the intent is usually positive, but it makes me feel resentful more than anything.",False,False
