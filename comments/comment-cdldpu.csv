We know there can be some weird/fake stuff on the internet, and caution is always useful. In our case, we are researchers at FSU, and we're really interested in mental health broadly and run a variety of studies on the topic.   If you (or anyone else) is interested, I could email from my [FSU.edu](https://FSU.edu) email account to verify, just DM me your personal email and I can email you directly.",False,True

As a part of the informed consent process of this study, we provide additional information and also ask that people reach out with additional questions. Please let us know if there is anything else we can provide!",False,True
