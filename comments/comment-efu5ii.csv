(i cut out greek yogurt a few months ago though). it's not because of the calories - i will eat the same amount of calories, to whatever i've determined as my goal or TDEE, with or without these foods. it's that they're indulgences, and i have to 'earn' them. if i think about it too much, i'll start feeling guilt over having no-calorie sweetener, because it's ""cheating"" and if it were a full calorie item i would be in excess, and thus indulging, and thus bad. i actually feel a lot of shame over consuming reduced calorie items, but i try not to think about it because... i want to have them ~~since i'm a fucking pig.~~ for halo top, i actually had my first pint last year, but i can only have it when i've earned it somehow, which used to be when i biked centuries, but then i felt like i wasn't trying hard enough or performing well enough, so i would have it if i could split it with someone. again, 360 calories of peanut butter (cheap, not high glycemic, not high volume, relatively healthy) would fly (not at once, it's still a lot of calories in a small package, but i'd do it in bits) would fly, having 2500 in a day would fly, but having that indulgent bit is difficult. it's easier for me to have 2500 calories of my ""safe"" foods that i cook myself than to have 2500 including a bowl of pasta or a nice meal out.   i guess i wish people could just jump in my head for a bit and look around and tell me what they think and rate my brain or something. i just kind of want to be understood, but i don't understand myself.   yeah i'm using this like a blog sorry lmao. there's part of me that likes getting this all down in a semi-public way with sort of the idea that someone sometime would read through all my posts and form an image of me and maybe understand and then tell me who i am / what they think.",False,False

The book 'brain over binge' really helped me by positioning bingeing as a habit that can be broken if you sit through the urges enough.
