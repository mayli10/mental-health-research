I objectively can tell I’m conventionally attractive and thin. But. I am always striving for it to be “better” even though losing weight doesn’t really achieve that. That and I really dislike my thighs at the moment since they are less in shape than what I’m used to.,False,False

Okay so same to the whole bit about feeling fine now but better when smaller. Also never been UW so maybe that'll change someday. I love my hands, always. It's maybe my favorite part of me",False,True

OTOH the less I weigh the better I feel and the more I like my body, with no lower limit so far (though I've never been UW so I imagine I'll reach that point eventually). Maybe unusual but I only really do certain body checks when I know I'll 'pass' and it'll make me happy? For example (hope the spoiler tags work) &gt;!my sternum isn't visible rn and I MISS it so hard but it doesn't upset me bc I'm working towards getting that back? and I know it'll come in time!&lt;",False,False

I relapsed because I couldn't stand being in my skin. BUT I feel good about myself otherwise. I'm proud of my accomplishments and being a pretty good mother...,False,False

It started with my bf making me list 5 things I liked about myself, big or small. He basically had to list all 5 for me the first several times but eventually I named 1/5, then 2/5 and so on.",False,True
