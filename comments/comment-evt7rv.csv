Me and my mom are very close but she has no idea about my ED too. She always cooks lunches for me and even when I feel like I'm about to lose control and go on week-long fasts, her food reminds me that there's at least one person who cares about me and I can't let her down. I hope you can be the person your mom thinks you are OP, and I'm happy that you have that type of support and love in your life &lt;3",False,False
