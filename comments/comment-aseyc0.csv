I was a bmi 24 for most of my life and I didn't think I looked that bad, I mean I hated my body but I thought I probably didn't look awful to everyone else.

My bmi is 20 now and I realize I look now how I always expected to look before, if that makes sense. I know I was never overweight but I wasn't as small as I thought.",False,False

Aside from two months of being at a BMI of 24, I never got to experience what it was like to be a healthy teen (which mind you is still fat to me). I'm now probably at an average weight for my age group, but I'm rapidly coming down and hopefully will get to experience the thin, developed body I never had.
