All gorgeous women, skinny, 10/10, and able to wear all the clothes I wish I could pull off, all while seemingly drinking and partying and eating burgers and shit, like it‚Äôs nothing. I live in a relatively gentrified neighborhood now, and I literally am a troll compared to all the tall, skinny, blond, Madewell-wearing models surrounding me. I can barely walk through Whole Foods because I‚Äôm the only one who will ever let anyone else pass or move to the side for someone to get to a shelf. I‚Äôm invisible and/or lesser to them.",False,False

Ive had the look of ED recognition from a couple of them in M&amp;S food hall.  Of course, we have poorer areas and more overweight people there, but I've definitely noticed it seems thinner here than the national average.   I also work in heritage and I find in the big cultural institutions you have to have the right look, accent (and be thin) to get on. üòï  I went to NYC in 2010 (loved it) with a group of art students and while we were people watching, one girl remarked that we hadn't really seen any fat people. At the time i thought it was down to affluence and the fact you dont really see many fat rich people, but i get its culturally contagious, too. (And I feel like most of the people going into the fast food outlets were tourists, not locals).",False,False

I literally walk outside everyday and see people so much thinner than i am.

I don‚Äôt live in a big, glamorous metropolitan area like NYC or LA, just a small college town in Texas 45 min from Austin. Everyone here is pretty average, with it being mostly college kids and poorer minorities, so it‚Äôs not like everyone‚Äôs eating $12 kale salads and doing expensive juice cleanses (sorry but that‚Äôs really what I think of when I think of LA or NYC). That being said I‚Äôm definitely on the thin side of the spectrum, and I get a LOT of attention for it.
