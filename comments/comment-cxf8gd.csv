I keep telling myself that it's simply an inanimate object that I've assigned way too much power to - my ED voice will *never, ever* be content with the number it mechanically spits out, and the cheap, fleeting thrill of losing a couple of ounces or pounds never quite lasts. The more I weigh myself, the worse I feel. Don't get me wrong - I still feel like garbage, but I'm trying to reclaim my life one day at a time by not stepping onto the scale and torturing myself each and every morning.  Congratulations on stopping smoking, by the way! Perhaps you could apply the same techniques you used to battle that addiction to your current situation?",False,False
