I asked my mom, who knows about my purging, to have people give me healthy treats as easter gifts cause I dont binge on them. Either she didnt, or she did and they ignored that. So I've got two giant bunnies and probably another basket at home, plus 2 giant meals because my parents are divorced so two families. I'm just gonna embrace the inner turmoil and start an at least two day fast (most I've done before is 24 hrs cause hypoglycemia makes it hard) but all the overeating and binging hurts my soul and I just need a good ""clean out"". I need to feel empty for the first time in like a week",False,False
