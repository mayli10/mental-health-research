I time all my nutrients, exercise schedule, hair washing schedule, and ration the last of my favorite discontinued perfume to get ready for this guy. The shit that I have to do to look good actually makes me worse in the long run (damaged hair, skin irritation from makeup and shaving).  He keeps saying he'll come over for the past 4 hours and then says he won't for another 2 hours, which is 2:30 am my time, and 5 hours before I have to be at work well-rested and dressed professionally.  Idk if he ever even had plans of actually coming over. I'm pissed. I know consent and everything but like.... I work 60 hours a week, do 3 sports, and grad school. I can't just randomly stay up. Don't play these games with me. Just say yes or no.   And then if he does hit me up tomorrow I can't do it because I can't shave twice in a row (razor bumps) and because I haven't eaten in 3 fucking days and I need to eat tomorrow so I don't literally die. And I can't have sex after eating, I just can't.",False,False
