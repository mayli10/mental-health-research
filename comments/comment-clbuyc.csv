Instead of stimulating the body to go, it actually just softens the poo. My running record is 1 1/2 weeks without reliving myself, being tube fed the whole time! Within a few days, I was able to poop and was going easily every 1-2 days.   If you have a bad feeling about trying anything though, you should listen to your gut!",False,False

If you're still having issues and are leaning toward trying a laxative 100% go for Miralax. It's the one used in eating disorder treatment programs and is a lot gentler on the body than traditional laxatives.,False,False

Once, I didn't shit for 8 days and took some overnight laxatives, and the next day made me regret ever being born. Everything came out at one time. I genuinely thought I was going to die. I yelled for my mom... It was bad lol. Haven't taken laxatives since. I will say, though, I felt so skinny afterward. XD    But for real, stool softeners are where it's at. They work gradually over about a week, and when it happens it's not painful. I like Miralax. Plus, you still get to feel skinnier ha.",False,False

It was a 24hr total body cleanse.   I'd say it was a spiritual experience but only if it's possible to channel a cthulhean realm through your small intestine.   I had to call into work and claimed I had food poisoning. I might have shat out my appendix at once point.
