You're addicted to the number getting lower and lower. You feel so in control but you actually aren't. It won't stop on its own. You have to set an end to it before it gets too powerful. I mean, it already has control over you :/ it sounds like I'm talking about some ancient evil and maybe it is because it takes so many lives and has been around for a long time.",False,False

It’s never enough. That’s why it’s so dangerous. Right now, I’m 115, and desperately wanting to be back below 105. It never ends.",False,False

I am just reaching my goal of being 120, and i started in the 155-160 range. But... already i want to get to 110... where does it stop? Will i ever be happy with it? I don’t know. I know this is a problem. But i still just feel so huge. I want to disappear. I also dread going to the doctor because they will weigh me, but my concern is that they will notice how much weight I’ve lost in such a short amount of time.   Anyway yesterday i ate like crazy and today i ate like crazy but tomorrow I’ll be back to 400 cals a day and reach my GW in no time.  All the best to you ❤️",False,False
