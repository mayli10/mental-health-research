Please be sure to maintain these connections, even if your ED decides, like mine did, that it would be an awesome idea to stop talking to anyone with an incentive to worry about you. Also: please watch your electrolytes, and stay hydrated! And considering EDs can interfere with schoolwork...go to office hours! (People never do, but if youâ€™re struggling or just enthusiastic about the class, your profs actually do want to help/talk.)   I do understand the perverse ED logic of wanting total collapse. Like sometimes I think my worst mistake was figuring out how to ride the edge of risk, to stay just healthy enough that people wouldnâ€™t force me into treatment. I credit that determination with keeping me stable, and preventing physical deterioration, but like...itâ€™s also allowed me to go on being anorexic for over half my life. It sucks, although Iâ€™ve also been sick for so long that I canâ€™t even appreciate the suckitude anymore. This is just my life. I canâ€™t recommend it, and hope you find a way to avoid it :/    Either way, please always be willing to seek care if youâ€™re in imminent danger. This disease doesnâ€™t have the highest psychiatric mortality rate for nothing...extreme situations can sneak up on you, especially if your judgment is impaired by malnutrition. (I know you know all this, but I just worry.)   Best of luck, always!",False,False

I don't have much in the way of immediate support, but I am in contact with both a therapist and a dietitian that I see weekly over video chat. My weight is being monitored but it's so easy to manipulate that that doesn't mean much. My family is a few hours away. Not insanely far, but not close.  Part of me just wants to let it happen. I've always sort of known deep down that this was inevitable. I feel like if I just let myself spiral, if I really do end up completely emaciated and hospitalized and on the brink of death, I'll never ever feel the urge to relapse again and I'll just recover forever and be done with anorexia. Lol. I know that's not how it works. But it makes sense in my mind.  Idk. At this point I don't have many options. I could (a) jUsT eAt - tried that, didn't work - (b) pause/drop out of my freshman year less than 2 weeks in to get treatment/support, or (c) hang on as long as I can until I literally can't go on, and THEN get treatment. C seems the most logical I guess. And if I time it right I might not even miss much school.  Again, thank you so much for sharing your wisdom and advice. I really do appreciate it.",False,True

I tried to talk you down once when you were going through some really rough stuff with suicidality and forced treatment. I remember thinking you reminded me a lot of myself, and judging by this post thatâ€™s still true. Iâ€™m worried about you! Iâ€™d love to see you find a different path than I did (which is chronic anorexia), and would hate to see you end up on the worst path of all (that is, extreme illness or death).   Whatever happens, you are right to think that an uncontrolled ED is not super compatible with college. Things will be difficult at best, and at worst this could lead to a medical emergency. In light of that, I think you might want to get comfortable with the following ideas: that itâ€™s okay to take medical leave from school, itâ€™s okay to transfer to another school, and itâ€™s okay to leave college altogether and come back in a few years. Your health HAS to come first.   What kind of support do you think you need most right now? Are you in contact with a current therapist? Do you live near anyone (family, friends) who is keeping an eye on you, or are you totally on your own? (The latter is really dangerous in your position...I do hope youâ€™re not at an isolated LAC or something.) Are you already in contact with your schoolâ€™s mental health services? If not, this is the time to get them involved. They are going to be slammed as midterms get closer, and it sounds to me like you really need help.  I know things seem dark right now, but keep in mind you are in the midst of an insanely stressful life moment. Moving away to college, adjusting to a new social environment and academic workload, potentially being around controlled substances for the first time, etc, etc? Dude, this nexus of change is ED central. OF COURSE youâ€™re struggling rn. You are dealing with an overload of novelty and are grasping for some sense of control. Like I do wonder if my ED would have changed somehow if I had not been subject to the challenge of freshman year - if I had been at home attending a local school instead, and then transferred somewhere after finding my feet. Instead, my ED went fucking berserk, I put myself in bad situations and was sexually assaulted, and I tried to kill myself. That is not the outcome you want here. Nor is ending up in the hospital on a feeding tube, of course.  Sorry for the novel, but like I said, Iâ€™m worried. I want you to succeed and survive, and please let us know if thereâ€™s anything this sub can do to help you through this. Much love ðŸ’›ðŸ’›ðŸ’›",False,False
