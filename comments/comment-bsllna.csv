Every reached milestone equals a binge and 2-3 days of fasting to undo the damage so that I can move forward. It's so exhausting. For what it's worth, nothing that you ate was out of the ordinary. You are not wrong or disgusting for eating food, even if your ED makes it seem that way. I know it's probably not worth much, but I find a little reality check can sometimes help in times like these. I hope you feel better soon.",False,False
