They have at least taken it seriously in the past though, when I got diagnosed. I'm sorry your family hasn't been supportive to you though. That sucks.",False,False

I really couldn’t be more obvious that I’m starving myself. I’m  used to it after all these years. I found this  a few weeks ago and even though I mostly lurk here, I actually feel understood for once. Makes me feel better about others not caring lol.",False,False

I feel like you guys are the only ones who can understand.   They don't care in a good way or a bad way? As in, they don't judge you for having an eating disorder, or they seem really disinterested in your struggles? If it's the latter, I know how that feels and I'm so sorry.",False,True

Otherwise, yeah I feel really isolated. I’m super open about my eating disorder to most people around me and they don’t care at all. They just like how I look when I’m thinner. Parents can especially suck. It’s the nature of this shitty disorder I guess.",False,False
