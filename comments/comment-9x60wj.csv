People openly sharing experiences on Proed helped me feel less alone. I could never share how I feel with real life friends for fear of triggering them or not being understood. Seeing so much content from so many liked minded people honestly helped me see each day in a better light. The knowledge that I had a place to turn to if things went wrong gave me confidence that I could try and do my best.   From proed I also learnt not to be too hard on myself if I binge. In the past I have been more disordered but right now I am wayyy more conscious of what I do that is disordered which I suppose is a good thing for when I will want to stop being this way. I also learnt that it's ok not to want to change my habits right now and that whatever keeps me sane is what counts. You'd think that more posting on subs like proed and its ilk and consciously restricting (or trying to) are signs that im becoming more disordered (perhaps because of such subs) but actually I've always been this way and having a platform has given me better control which has in turn helped me mentally.   Another thing about proed is that I learnt so much about myself and why I am the way I am from other people's posts. I've had therapy in the past which started the process but proed helped me reflect on so many experiences which probably would have taken so much longer to uncover in therapy. Also it was eye opening for me to be validated and not feel like a fat phoney but actually somebody who has issues that aren't normal and deserve to have support. All of this knowledge came from content on proed that other people had posted.,False,False
