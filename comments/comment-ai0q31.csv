First congrats on trying to recover :)  I understand how you feel and I’m also not much of a social eater either. But I find that it helps to eat in a public place. Maybe you can find a cafe or library or public soace where you can eat around other people without the pressure of friends?  That way you don’t have to deal with socializing but in a way people eating around you holds you accountable in a way!,False,False

Sometimes having someone tell you it’s ok and normal helps a lot :) totally get that! ,False,False

Think I'll just see how I go, either I'm eating enough to maintain even without or they'll figure out I'm skipping something somewhere. Thank you for responding! :)",False,True

I've tried to see if we have a counselling service but I was told that it's a load of shit, essentially, by a lecturer.  I'm not too bothered. I'll probably just keep dropping weight before the clinic I go to figures it out lmao. Thank you though! ",False,True

And I'll often skip days. The only way I'll eat is if we sit down and watch something to distract me from the fact I'm eating. You have any friends at all you could eat with to distract you?,False,False
