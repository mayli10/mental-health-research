I never took ""pro ana"" at face value, and really, I don't think most people in those spaces ever did, just as the old sub was never literally ""pro ED."" From the moment I realized I was anorexic, I knew I was dealing with a mental illness, and always preferred to follow people who were upfront about their emotional pain and physical problems. I wasn't there for tipz and trickz, I was there to know I wasn't alone.",False,False

I knew I had an eating disorder and Tumblr just made me think it was romantic, or more specifically that *anorexia* was romantic. I remember feeling alone and like I would never get to “join the club” of the girls who wrote about “binging” on a measly 200 calories a day. While Tumblr made me feel so much worse, this subreddit makes me feel so much better. My awareness of my issues remains the same, but here I feel accepted and not alone. I now know that anorexia is not the only eating disorder, and my struggles are validated through the stories I read from others.",False,False

Tbh, I didn't even know those communities were even a thing until I was older. I was a bit ""internet sheltered"" though. As in I don't think I even had an email address until 15/16 and even then it was only so I could email my parents while I was on vacation with other family.  I'm mixed about my thoughts on younger people and forums. On one hand, I think it's wonderful that they can come together, come to terms and understand/communicate about the disorder better than we could growing up. On the other hand, I feel like it could possibly be detrimental if they become too immersed or isolate themselves in the community. Especially when some of us 'olders' have stopped attempting recovery and just kind of accept it at this point and just go the 'harm reduction' route, ya know?",False,False

I wasn't on reddit back then, I think I had an account on some blog site that I couldn't remember the name of for the life of me. I was on tumblr too, but tumblr back  in 2010/2011 was *so toxic,* it was a downright mess. Nothing was really recovery based or supportive, more of a competition on who was the sickest.  I think I frequented MPA (cringe) as well. I feel like the communities nowadays are more supportive and pro-recovery, at least the ones I'm on (this subreddit and twitter) so hopefully more people are able to seek treatment earlier and recover before this illness takes over.",False,False
