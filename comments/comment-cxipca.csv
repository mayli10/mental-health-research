The reason your belly is bigger, *if* it actually is and it’s not just dysmorphia, is because there’s food in your stomach. It’s likely that the five pounds isn’t even fat but is food weight. When we eat normally (the average person eats 4lbs of food a day) and we think we gained weight, it’s actually that we’re accustomed to what the scale says when there’s little to no food in our bodies.   All that said, I’m sure you know that sometimes it’s difficult to think about our bodies rationally. The size difference may not be real, but your feelings are. It’s good that you’re recognizing and respecting them. Just also try to remember the facts, even if it doesn’t help much right now.",False,False
