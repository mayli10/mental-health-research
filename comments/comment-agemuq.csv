My body dysmorphia is pretty severe, so really the only thing that keeps me tethered to any kind of realistic view of my body is getting reassurance from the scale daily that I haven't magically packed on 10 pounds overnight. Also the knowledge that you have to eat a surplus of 3,500 calories to gain a pound has been extremely comforting to me in times where I start to freak out about phantom weight gain.  I've also realized that a lot of it is related to my progress. My vision adapts so that every time I lose 5 pounds I see myself as looking the same, and thus my idea of what a ""skinny weight"" is changes. Two ways I try to keep perspective on that is taking B/A photos in underwear (slightly depressing because it doesn't really make me realize how thin I am now, but how in denial I was about how big I used to be, but still) and journalling. I looked back in my journal from only like half a year ago and saw how I'd written about my current weight and how ""I doubt I'll ever actually make it to the double digits but that would be insane"" and it really made me look at my current self differently.",False,False

(No promises on spelling here) and her collab with boyinaband and what she has a collection of strings that she cut out without measuring of how big she though a part of her body was them actually measured that body part and marked it on the string and most of the time her idea of her body was considerably bigger the actual. And I've started that and it does help a lot.,False,False
