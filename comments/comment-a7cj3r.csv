I'm CSE and work as a software engineer.   I would definitely plan on switching to high restricting while classes are in session at least. Fasting brains don't do math well in my experience.,False,False

I bring a piece of fruit (~100 cals) or a Souper sipper (~150 cals depending on flavor). Just a little something can keep you going for a few hours.   Another thing that might be worth trying is high restricting. (?) When I high restrict, I only eat ""healthy"" foods and I exercise. So I feel like I'm building muscle/cardiovascular health and I'm functional.   Stay safe lil b. ",False,False

I went through a high restrictive phase a few months ago, had to stop due to traveling and being realistic, and am trying to get back to where I was. But my head hurting really limits how much I can restrict, especially since I need to be fully functional at work.  :/",False,False
