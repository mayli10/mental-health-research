I broke down to him before and told him I think I have an eating disorder, and he argued with me and said I'm just being paranoid and he has seen me eat so I can't possibly have an eating disorder. He even stated several things he had seen me eat recently. Regardless of losing 70 lbs in 6 months and now teetering in being underweight, having major anxiety over eating, refusing to eat anything I can't weigh and track, compulsively exercising, and having my body fat percentage measured at 11.5%, he doesn't see the issue.",False,False

At the very least, he seems to be looking out for you and your eating habits which is good and I think opening up could be beneficial to you because having someone close to you as a support outlet might make you feel safer (not the exact word I’m thinking of but I can’t think of a better word). Don’t feel like you are in a rush to open up though. It will most likely help you in the long run but do it on your own terms and when you are ready. :)",False,False
