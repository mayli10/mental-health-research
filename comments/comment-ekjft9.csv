I've found that doing weight lifting/compound weight exercises (like deadlifts, barbell squats, etc) have helped. But depending on how much weight you've lost, part of it might be loose skin like another poster said. It blows. ;\_;",False,False

I am naturally gathering weight on my lower tummy and upper thighs and the smaller they have been was when i started a regular workout circuit. I went to the gym twice a week and worked out at home once. The stomach was the biggest difference tbf,False,False

Holy shit, I think you’re describing my body. I’ve done so much research into this trying to figure out what the fuck is wrong with my body.
