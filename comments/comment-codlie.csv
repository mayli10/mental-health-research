So many people go through those machines each shift, I remember regulars faces but never what‚Äôs in their baskets. To be honest, we really don‚Äôt care. As long as you‚Äôre polite &amp; don‚Äôt steal stuff, you won‚Äôt stick in our memories. If anything, she saw your binge basket and thought ‚Äúmovie night with mates‚Äù then forgot all about the contents of your basket. Next day, she might have thought, ‚Äúshe looks familiar, ohh laxatives, we‚Äôve all been there, poor thing‚Äù then PROMPTLY FORGOT ALL ABOUT THE CONTENTS OF YOUR BASKET. Trust me, I had a 5 hour shift in self checkouts yesterday and I could not tell you ANYTHING about what my customers bought. I do remember 2 nice conversations about people‚Äôs pets, one rude ass bitch of a customer and having to clean up a jar of sauce someone dropped. Please, please don‚Äôt feel bad about it, because I promise you the checkout lady feels nothing.  (I also binged for the first time in while the other night &amp; I also took advantage of $1 Oreos üòÖ the new red velvet ones are amazing)",False,False
