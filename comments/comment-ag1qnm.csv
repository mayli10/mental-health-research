For most people they don't really look into their choices, they just assume because a fad its healthy and want to be a self claimed expert and don't want to hear critiques because that is as far as their health journey goes. I know it drives you crazy but remember its a limited perspective on their end. ",False,False

I usually don't give advice unless someone seems lost or asks for it. And even then I always ask if they tried x or y before just assuming they haven't. Or ask what they have tried to see if I've even got any other ideas. And that's just the rule on advice for anything.,False,True
