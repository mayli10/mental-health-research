The concerns associated with using BMI for adults also apply to children and adolescents. Other factors, including height and level of sexual maturation, influence the relationship between BMI and body fat among children as well. In addition, the accuracy of BMI varies substantially according to the individual child‚Äôs degree of body fatness. Among obese children (or a BMI-for-age greater than or equal to the 95th percentile), BMI is a good indicator of excess body fat. However, among overweight children (or a BMI-for-age between the 85th and 94th percentiles), elevated BMI levels can be a result of increased levels of either fat or fat-free mass. Similarly, among relatively thin children, differences in BMI are often due to differences in fat-free mass.",False,False
