Took accutane, felt pretty good about myself, fast forward to a manic episode, cut off all my hair and isolated myself again.. hair grew out, felt pretty good. And repeat. Now I'm feeling pretty good about myself so my advice is to just find a hairstyle that suits you and clothes that you like, maybe get some piercings if thats your thing. Anyways just letting you know there's hope, and I personally don't think ANYONE is ugly. I have never looked at a person and thought they were ugly. Dm me if u wanna talk",False,False
