One, your math is wrong. This seems unlikely since you’ve been doing this for so long.   Two, your food scale is broken. Change batteries, buy a new one.   Three, your scale for weighing yourself in broken. Change batteries, but a new one.   Four, your exercise increase has caused you to gain muscle and/or retain water. This is likely true, but unlikely to account for the full weight change.   Five, you have developed an allergy or sensitivity to something you’re eating often. This seems possible because you’re bloating so much after each meal. You should get this checked out by a doctor or dietician.   Six, there is something else going on medically, like with your thyroid or your digestive system or your uterus. You should get this checked out by a doctor.    These are all just possibilities but either way you should have a medical check up and also consider getting a DEXA scan to see if it’s fat gain or muscle or water or whatever. Might give you some answers and some peace of mind. ",False,False
