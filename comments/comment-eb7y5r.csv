My gym does it for members which I assume it’s to prevent people from just loaning their keytag to a friend. I hate it.   Same story dif verse - the hospital took a picture of me during an ER admission (for their patient portal). *An ER admission*. I look super great /s And my PCP is in the same network so every time I schedule an appointment or pay a bill I get to see my dumb mug.,False,False

I never look at it. They use horrible quality cameras too. Just remember that no one will be minding you! If anything they’re just going to have respect for a fellow gym goer. But that feeling is very real for everyone and you will get over it. Try going alone once and I’m sure you’ll feel more confident after that!,False,False
