It's about finding a good fit. The Recovery Dharma book is available for free on their website, too.   More free resources:  YouTube guided meditations, education, and motivation on ED recovery: [https://youtu.be/2iwOKjwCt4A](https://youtu.be/2iwOKjwCt4A)  I'd love to see you on our private, recovery-focused Facebook group at [www.facebook.com/groups/rec0veryistheway](http://www.facebook.com/groups/rec0veryistheway) where we post guided meditations, books, and articles about the process of recovery. We are building a gentler corner of the internet :)  One of your free options to augment your support and accountability is SMART Recovery, an international non-profit that offers evidence-based peer support education on the self-management of addictive behaviors. I am a volunteer facilitator (never a paid position) for SMART and would love to ""see"" you on my Wednesday night online meeting from 7:30-9PM CST with msandoval at [www.smartrecovery.org](http://www.smartrecovery.org/). If my style doesn't click there are over 40 other online meetings each week including one for EDs on Saturday.   To learn about SMART, check out The FREE Unofficial SMART Recovery Handbook for Disordered Eating, a grassroots project we are working on to make SMART more accessible for people with eating disorders: [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vPk9JbgWrGCL4LbjAmVbVW-g2fD5DFBP\_P-8ov2F4sY/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vPk9JbgWrGCL4LbjAmVbVW-g2fD5DFBP_P-8ov2F4sY/edit?usp=sharing)  I hope this helps.
