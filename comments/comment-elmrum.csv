Ugh.   I prefer going with vegetarian, even though I avoid everything except eggs, but sometimes I'll mess up for sure.   You just do the best you can :)",False,False

I try to look at it like, there are more days where I don’t eat animal byproducts than when I do, so I’m still saving more animals than killing.

I’m scared to ever eventually fully identify as veggie/vegan/plant based bc I’m worried I’ll binge on food w/animal products or won’t be “perfect” at it tbh.  But ultimately, you are already doing a lot! You are not a fake vegan, you struggle with an ED and are doing your best. You do not deserved to be attacked for that. And trying and working on it is 10000x better than doing nothing and you are making a difference even if you’re not “perfect” at it (and i guarantee there are a lot of other vegans that do the same even if they don’t/won’t admit it). Esp if it’s food you don’t buy and aren’t in control of at the house, that’s really hard. It’s ok to be forgiving and easier on yourself about this!",False,False

I wish you the absolute best bb 💖",False,True

Please don't be so hard on yourself. That's only going to send you into a shame spiral, and encourage more bingeing.   I'm vegan too, so I get how bad you must feel. But bingeing is not a rational state of mind. I've eaten garbage while bingeing. Dry rice. Patently dangerous shit like liquid Tylenol. I have eaten things no human should eat. Because bingeing is like that. It just is.   You're not a fake vegan. You're a vegan with an impairment: your eating disorder. That is 100% not the same thing as being a ""vegan"" who's eating pastry just because they felt like it. If you're not in control of what's stored in your house, then this is probably just going to be a risk for you until you're housed elsewhere.",False,False

Everyone slips and falls but the important thing is that you're trying to make a difference. Don't look at the animals you failed when you make a mistake, don't let that be the driving force. Look so the animals you've saved by being successful and let that positivity drive you to stay successful.  When you want to binge do it, but do it on vegan things. Sure, it's more work to make vegan crunch wraps then to go to taco Bell but at the end of the day you'll think about the animals you saved.",False,False

At least youre trying and doing the best you can.
