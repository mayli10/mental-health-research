I'm a twin, and my sister always decides where to go. I haven't decided on a birthday meal since junior high. Every year, it's the same bullshit of "" I want this"" despite the fact she picked last year. If I even tell her it's my turn, she refuses to talk to my mom who confirms where we're going and let's 3+ family members know which restaurant to go and have that day off. So Olive Garden it is.  I don't even want to look at cake, cookies, pies, etc.",False,False

It's still meaningful. Happy birthday and hugs to you too! &lt;3",False,False

Anyways just know you’re not alone and I’m rooting for you to get through it. &lt;3",False,False
