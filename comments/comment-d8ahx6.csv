It’s a type of protein found in connective tissues (and in your own skin and hair), and you’ve got a pretty limited capacity to produce it endogenously.  The *best* thing you could do would be to supplement with collagen capsules or eat gelatin, but if you’re not willing to do that for ethical reasons, you can also cobble together a quasi-acceptable substitute making an amino acid mixture of glycine, proline, and arginine from vegetarian foods.  It’s not *really* a collagen matrix, but it *will* get you a good chunk of the basic materials, which is better than nothing.",False,False

I fill up my stomach with leaves so I don't feel hungry and it's a habit now, will have to switch to lettuce. I drink black tea all the time too idk what to replace that with",False,True

I'm vegetarian so probably won't go for a bone broth but I'll see if theres any other ways of getting collagen. I do take iron supplements and i supplement all vitamins but it doesn't seem to be working any more. It's probably because I'm not getting enough food, i heard that hair doesn't fall out until a couple months after and 2 months ago I was eating literally nothing, so maybe it's getting better now.",False,True

For collagen bone broths are a major part of my diet.  You can make it flavorful to the point nothing is needed. It hovers at 38-50 per cup    Iron. I use hair supplements. Viviscal is expensive it works. With supplements you will not see results until after 3 months w/o an ED. So I am sure it will take longer.     Your body is lacking in vitamins. When they are consumed something else needs to be there to help with the absorption. You may not wanna hear this... You need true food to really help the absorb other wise it will be excreted in your urine.,False,False
