We're all lowkey here cause we're not happy with ourselves in some way or another. I'm just on the opposite side in regards to height.

Iâ€™m 5.11 and reached 100 and kept losing. Lowest I got was in the 90â€™s. Reaching that weight was great until I couldnâ€™t walk more than a few hundred steps without having to lay down and barely being able to push open doors. Had a health scare that spooked me into putting on enough weight to be somewhat functioning as a human.,False,False

There are most definitely ups and downs of being any height, and being tall is generally seen as a desirable trait.

I wish I was taller even just 5ft 4.  The main reason is I feel bc of my height even if I ""recover "" for me to stay slim / healthy I could only ever eat 1300 for maintence.  Even with exercise my genes naturally pack on weight (thanks past famine impacted relatives lmao glad u survives tho Ty)  I do have to follow a fairly low sugar / carb diet too as again my body is sensitive and I grow.   On most days even if I exercise I would consider maintence 1000 and don't ever reach that unless I've binged  The smaller I want to get too the less that number gets.  Sure I can be 50kg and considered healthy bmi but to ever get slim or to my goal (48-45kg)  I literally would probably maintain on 800 or something absurd meaning if I ever want to eat I will have to make up for it with restriction,  excess exercerise or in my weak moments not keep it down and how anxiety purges.    Take being taller as a gift. The number does matter but the long term eating and how your body looks carrying weight is always an envy I've had towards tall / taller people  At least,  I can wear large platforms and heels without being a skyscraper - the only benefit I've noticed about being short thus far.
