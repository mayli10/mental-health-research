Idk if it’s scientifically considered habit forming but it was for me. Basically it just worked so well that I figured what’s the harm in taking it more and more often.   I think it’s less damaging than a stimulant laxative but I do think your body gets dependent on it. And it’s super dehydrating.  I was hospitalized at a treatment center and they checked my bloodwork daily and I was using it and it def fucked with my electrolytes so be careful,False,False
