I know people the same weight and similar height to me and they all look so much better.  But I'm just mushy and flabby. I think it's because I have a higher bf% than them thanks to b/ping so dang much :').  I don't know how to help with the negative self talk, I just tend to try and avoid it as much as possible, and try to take the view that it's my body is a vehicle for my life, not my life. o kind of more of a neutral or indifferent view toward my body. Buuut that doesn't always work and I can't really sustain it, because as soon as I look in the mirror, that's it.",False,False

SERIOUSLY. My height has never really bothered me, but how come I had to be at an underweight BMI to achieve a flat stomach while other people my height can easily have one at 130 pounds ???",False,False

A video by a recovery youtuber really helped me where she talks about practicing ""body neutrality"" as opposed to body positivity because sometimes it's just best to not focus on your body at all rather than try so hard to fall in love with it.
