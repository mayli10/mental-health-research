I'm like you, I don't have the confidence to tell people how it is like that, but good on you for moving her hand away - keep doing that if she does it again. Good luck :)",False,False

I dont feel confident enough to mention it again (like usual), but she did seem really put off when I pushed her hand away, so I’m hoping she notices and fixes the closeness. If she goes back to being touchy-feely again, I will talk with her though.  Thank you for your concern, I actually never thought about sitting down and talking to her like that ❤️",False,True

I would freak out if someone touched my tummy regardless of my weight or having an ED or not.   (Unsolicited advice) are you able to have a little talk to her about it and try to get the message through to her that's she's disrespecting you? It's really inappropriate and degrading, and I hate that you are having to deal with that.",False,False

They tend to violate body boundaries.  It was nice of you to gently remove her hand. Next time do it hard and when she winces in pain use that SAME time she used with you and say “Was that too hard for you???” She knows what she’s doing. She knows. Big hugs to you. And kudos for how incredibly maturely you handled that. I don’t know if the suggestion I just gave really is mature at all. Prob not. Lol *shrug.* xoxo,False,False

AT the same time its kind of validating but also makes me self conscious af",False,False
