And I feel comfortable telling you guys but not my parents, just yet. I think I have an eating disorder. I'm not ready for recovery, just yet, but I wanted to tell you guys because I trust you all (and then explain about your attitudes and behaviors). I would just be honest with them and if you think it will help, write down what you want to say, and read it and erase things if you need to, add things if you need to, but maybe writing it down will help calm your thoughts down. You've got this and I am so proud of you :)",False,False

I won’t lie, it’s likely they’re going to push for recovery and want to help you get better.   That being said, it will give them more understanding about you. There will be a certain amount of peace knowing that they see the reason behind your-isms and weird habits.   Just know that there’s two sides to the comfort of being open. And people who love you don’t like knowing you’re destroying yourself. Honestly, if you’re thinking of telling them and already have an idea of the consequences- maybe a part of you is wanting that love and support to help you. There’s absolutely nothing wrong with that.   Do what’s actually best for you. Which is whatever you decide, in the end. You know yourself better than anyone else, and you’re very aware of how things could unfold, looking at your post.",False,False
