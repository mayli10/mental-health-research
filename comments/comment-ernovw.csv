I was committed to the 310 calories if it was good. But it was so dry and awful that I just couldn’t bare the thought of wasting calories on it. So I came home and purged like... 1/4 of it. It was only like 15 minutes and somehow that’s all that would come up. Eventually all I got was phlegm :(,False,True
