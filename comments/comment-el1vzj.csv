You could tell them all the reasons why past treatment hasn’t worked for you and in turn you could ask them what could be done differently (ie. why working with them would be different/ why they think their approach works/underlying mechanisms that drive everything). You don’t have to dive deeply into the root of your problem in the first session (possibly only session), you may just need to state the broader issue with complementary details. I really hope that things start looking up for you... remember, if you take the session, that does not necessitate/oblige you to take further action. Sending well wishes!",False,False
