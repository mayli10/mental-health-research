I’m not sure why you’re gaining, it might be your body trying to look after itself. The times I’ve gained have been when I’m less stressed and eating normally. The weight usually goes to my stomach and legs first but it starts to even put overtime.    I’m currently in recovery and also am struggling with the weight gain. What I’ve found helps is buying one size bigger in clothes and wearing loose clothing. It’s a daily battle and I have to remind myself of why I’m getting better and the goals I have, e.g. being a mum, being healthy enough to work.  Be kind to yourself, it’s a big mental battle but you can do it.",False,False
