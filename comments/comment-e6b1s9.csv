I wasn't at a super disordered point when we went (I was in a pseudo/passive first year of college recovery? who knows).   I know it's hard but definitely try and focus on fruits or vegetables with the dinners because there really are no guidelines to what you order! Too much freedom!! Ours had a buffet lunch so that was easier to arrange things/make it look like more/check things out before you put them on your plate. As far as drinks... I still have dreams about the drinks. I love sweets and they had the best slushies/shakes types of drinks. I indulged like crazy with the drinks because they were so amazing. Try and enjoy some!  Definitely take advantage of the excursions to get some active time into your day by walking or checking out the area. Also-- the ships are so huge! Walk around and check it all out.  I loved my cruise so much even though I was very hesitant. Years later, I'm not remembering the calories. And... if all else fails, do what I did-- fake seasickness!",False,False

Being worried about not getting your money's worth is a sunk cost fallacy.   Eat what you want. Don't eat what you don't want.,False,False

I'm just overthinking and have been overwhelmed with my family's recent attention on my body, but I still will try to focus on having a good trip and other things during that time. Thank u for the encouragement",False,True

I walked everywhere and I think it dod my metabolism some good. Try to have a good time with your family. Make memories with them that you can keep forever. When youre 70 youll want those memories more than the stress of trying not to eat.",False,False
