You’re not alone! I get creepy tumblr vibes from it and still can’t help but to look just so I can self indulge in my own insecurities.

I’m over 10 years- in therapy, on medication... and still struggle with this bullshit. Hopefully you don’t feel so alone now- your not. I feel you love.",False,False
