I know it's hard and it hurts but you're alright. You ate more than your usual so you may deal with some water weight but you sound like you haven't had enough to gain any. There's nothing wrong with having some fries and a salad and then having a little snack. There's a good variety of nutrients and macros your body can use that you may have not gotten while restricting.  Even fries and things like chocolate graham crackers can be useful and I know some non-disordered folks who eat like what you described and they're perfectly fine.  I don't think your dad meant any harm but I don't know your family situation so it's hard to say but sometimes dads and just parents in general can be clueless or don't think before they speak,False,False
