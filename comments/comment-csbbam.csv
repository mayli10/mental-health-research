I had plans to head to the pride street fest in my city for the first time that day I can just imagine how awful it would have been if I had gone out and had a great day and then got that call in the evening rather than in the morning. As is it's already hard to think about pride in general since he passed during pride month, but I feel it would be even harder if I had actually done anything that day. I'm sure with time these feelings will pass though. I bet by next year I'll be over it. I'm sure in your case it will be a lot harder, but I still believe that with time you'll be able to separate the two events in your head so you can enjoy your memories of the wedding without being grief-stricken. There is at least a silver lining here. Most parents dream of seeing their kids get married. Parents who are ill often hope they'll survive long enough to do so. Your step father got to live long enough to see that. I'm sure he was very happy before he passed.",False,False
