That was when I truly realized how fucked up my eating habits were that I was grossly overstating how much I ate in a day (aka doubled it) and everybody was still telling me that it wasn't enough,False,False

We had to do a food log in sixth grade for a couple weeks and suddenly I started to connect the dots between food, health, and weight. Not just knowing they were connected, but experiencing it. I was gaining weight when I used to be very skinny because of puberty and it started making me feel bad about myself (my family used to point out my body and food choices, but now I was aware of what exactly they were pointing at).  I installed MFP later that year... ugh. At least you only had to do it for a day. Food logs and other students suck",False,False
