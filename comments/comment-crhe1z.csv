I googled how to lose weight and CICO showed up.   I only lost weight so my dad would stop bullying me and nagging me about ‚Äúhow worried‚Äù he was for my health. Uuuuggghhhhh stfu!!!!! Toxic idiot fuckwad. He couldn‚Äôt physically abuse me anymore so he started to emotionally and mentally get me.    I‚Äôm glad my mom divorced him and I‚Äôm glad I got to stop seeing him. He and his stupid awful family are cut out of my life. His sister called me a whore when I was a teenager.,False,False

Foods aren't Good‚Ñ¢Ô∏è or Bad‚Ñ¢Ô∏è on itself, it is the amount you eat that matters, and how you combine them.  Last week I learned that pineapple has an enzyme that helps digest and absorb protein, so it is a good eat to eat some on the same day you eat meat or eggs for example. I wish I had a little book on things like that, because it is super interesting and useful since I restrict a lot I want to make the most of however little I eat.",False,True

I kind of learned it wasn‚Äôt my fault and started to get angry at my dad for my bad food habits. He blamed me of course (I was a freaking kid) and I stopped talking to him because he‚Äôs a toxic idiot.,False,False
