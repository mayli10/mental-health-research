This Ed thing can and will destroy you and it especially sucks when itâ€™s because of/triggered by a med that you need. This doesnâ€™t define you, your weight doesnâ€™t define you, your eating habits arenâ€™t who you are. Keep holding on. I know you said food makes you feel ill but sometimes it can actually soothe the stomach ache, especially when it comes from meds. This numbness you feel can be from your body and brain being in a bit of shock from the big deficit. If you can, increase just little by little. You may find that you feel worlds better",False,False
