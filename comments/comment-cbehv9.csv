I don’t know what to do with myself, but I am good at a few things and I decided to just pick something.  Depression is really numbing. Society does suck, but it’s what we have right now. Maybe a drastic change of environment could help? I really like the country. I’m wanting to move back to there.",False,False

I made other people more important than myself and I ended up getting raped. I’ve decided to move forward with optimism and do something I really love. Whether that is art, photography, music, just existing... make sure you have a safe space to cultivate these things in though. Like a house or apartment and enough income to survive.   For me I valued loved and friendship over my self. I was relationship starved. I tried a quick fix I guess.  I’m teaching myself some skills now on my own. Web design and computer programming and vector based art.  I can’t say I won’t be lonely again, but I have more self respect than to find myself in this situation again.  Just know that the doors get rusty the older you are and going back to school for instance seems a lot less worthwhile and even feasible. But that could be me.  I’ve always had a really hard time knowing what I want or just feeling valid at all. Do you think not feeling valid is an issue for you as well?",False,False
