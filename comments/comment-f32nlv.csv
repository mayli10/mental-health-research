Most celebrities who discuss this are likely just sharing the most shallow reasoning that the majority of people can (sadly) relate to. Maybe that means they’re bringing attention to it in a shallow way, but like above poster mentioned, there are tons of organizations devoted to actually educating the public. I know if I personally were to share my struggles with someone who doesn’t have an ED, I’d probably give a similarly “shallow”/basic response. The public might not understand the control aspect, or how the obsession differs from “diet culture”, but they probably will understand societal pressures and diet culture. Idk, I think I understand your point OP, but I don’t think it’s really fair to expect celebrities like Taylor Swift, Jameela Jamil, etc. to act as a “face” for eating disorders. In fact, I think that even just acknowledging that they were actively harming themselves in order to look a certain way is powerful and appreciable— much more so than “yes a 16 BMI is totally healthy and normal and I maintain it in a perfectly healthy way”. It’s a very nuanced topic for sure, and a very interesting discussion topic.",False,False

I think a lot of those patterns are actually disordered eating, which is obviously still very unhealthy. But it makes me feel like my eating disorder is invalidated when the constant narrative about anorexia is that it’s caused by poor body image and society’s pressure to be thin. I of course have terrible body image and being skinny fuels my restriction, but it goes SO much deeper than that.   For me personally, restriction is like my ultimate coping mechanism. I use it to numb out or distract from negative emotions that I feel, or to punish myself for feelings driven by guilt, etc. Being skinny is sort of the fixation that I use to tell myself that if I just do this one thing, everything else will be better, even if it’s just a little better.   I have definitely noticed that friends or people I open up to about my struggles can sometimes brush it off as slightly silly or shallow, because they think I’m just obsessed with being skinny for the sake of being skinny. I’ve had so many people try to “cure” me by telling me that it’s actually not attractive to be stick skinny, and that I actually don’t want that. Like fucking obviously. I’m not trying to be “attractive” so much as what I consider to be attractive, which is skeletal bony skinny.   I also get SO frustrated when people claim an eating disorder because they got a little too sucked into their spring break diet, as if you can just accidentally gain a mental illness one day and snap out of it the next. It’s frustrating to me because it feels like those people invalidate the entire OTHER side of my eating disorder that is not the “glamorous” counting calories and skipping meals like celebrities do for the sake of maintaining a figure that society pressures on them.   Anyways, that is my very long way of saying I agree with you completely on this, and thank you for letting me share some of my own feelings and experiences with this topic as well!",False,False

There are hundreds of organisations who work on this. There are official campaign partners and many who advocate personally. There is no *need* for a celebrity to reveal to the world their struggles past or present. If they choose to do so it definitely open up the conversation among regular folks about this sort of thing.   Loads of celebrities have come out about various issues in the past and they've suffered for it professionally *and* personally.  To even address something so personal, when everyone is hounded so harshly by the press + public, takes some serious bravery, before even considering becoming a spokes person of sorts.

Eating disorders aren’t about crash dieting. People go on crash diets, lose some weight, and then stop once they hit their goal or get sick of it. Eating disorders are about food/weight stress consuming your life, making you unable to function normally.  I cannot stand people saying they “were anorexic over the summer” or something along those lines because that’s just crash dieting. Eating disorders are not something you can turn on and off. People need to stop diagnosing themselves with eating disorders when they go on bad diets because it trivializes the real issue when people equate the two.",False,False

I was talking about moslty about the difference between feeling pressured and forcing yourself to lose weight and anorexia because I just think that the mindsets are different but I guess this is debatable. And yes, I do agree with what you said about the way they talk as public figures, and I never thought that what they felt wasn t validbut as I said I don t see the point in that. Just saying that you had a weird relationship with food doesn’t necessarily help you or other people in your situation.
