I've never been in a relationship with a woman, but when I've been with women sexually it's kind of revolved around a mutual fascination and appreciation of the way someone else carries womanly beauty, if that makes sense lol. Sexual body shaming with other women doesn't really enter the picture.  Platonic relationships with women, on the other hand, H O L Y shit. I read somewhere (warning slightly sexist) that women are programmed to be harshly competitive with each other's looks because we naturally want to ""compete"" for the attention of mates, even subliminally. I've had girls say some of the nastiest stuff imaginable about me out of jealousy, out of genuine dislike, or even out of sheer disdain for the amount of ""dedication"" I've put into my body (not sure how to even categorize this one, basically just girls who don't understand eating disorders ruthlessly shaming me for being thin and ""so shallow you'd throw away your health and relationships to look 'good'""). Personally I've found it really hard to maintain friendships with other women during the lowest points of my ED for these reasons, which has been one of the worst parts of ED for me. I think having a very big circle of female friends requires a certain ability to forgo looks-based criticism (both you being overly critical of your friends, and also being relatively insensitive to others' opinions of your looks), which I just don't have in me right now.   I'd love to hear your perspective on this.",False,False

I lived in a college town and in middle school guys my age couldn‚Äôt get over how disgusting I was but when i was at the grocery store or in town men in their twenties gave me gross amounts of attention that definitely fucked me up. And wouldn‚Äôt ya know it I lost my virginity to some disgusting guy way too old for me who basically preyed on me bc I was a child with a woman‚Äôs body... ugh.

I was overweight as a kid and had full on boobs by the 5th grade and the attention I got from creepy older boys fucked with me so much. Boys my own age teased me until I cried and that definitely pulled me into relationships with older men who abused the power dynamic.

You DO have a body that is worthy of respect and I firmly believe everyone has a body that can be admired somehow in a way that is non-sexual.   Curves do draw attention, yes, but the unfortunate reality is that women will be harassed no matter what we look like. There is a relatively famous thread that I believe was on r/AskReddit a couple years back where someone asked ‚ÄúWomen, do you remember the first time you were ever catcalled or sexualized?‚Äù And a lot of the answered that it had happened to them, even before puberty, no matter how they looked. That thread became so well known because, frankly, it was disturbing as hell, and it really helped a lot of men to understand what it can be like.   The feeling of wanting to be invisible and shrink yourself away from all of this is understandable, but ultimately, it will cause much more harm than good.
