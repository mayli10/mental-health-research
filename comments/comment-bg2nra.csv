When I’d bloat, my ex would poke my tummy and tell me how pudgy I am. Thanks, man. I thought I recovered from my bad relationship with food since then, but my endo is getting worse again and so are my restricting habits because of how bloaty I get. I get flashbacks of him doing that to me every time I glance down at my stomach or I get weighed at the doctor. It doesn’t help that the shorts I bought last summer are too tight now.",False,False

Soooo annoying, I don’t understand :(",False,False

He probably thought he was being complimentary most of the time, but it really fucked with me. One time he said (and I quote), ""you know, maybe your problems with food and all this eating disorder stuff is why you have such a hot body,"" and I was absolutely floored.

He’d call my thighs “ham” and didn’t see how that was super insensitive. He thought he was being cute. (???) Or he’d tell me he likes my curves and that I look like a “real woman”.  Ugh. I know he meant that last part as a compliment but it always made me cringe and want to cry.,False,False
