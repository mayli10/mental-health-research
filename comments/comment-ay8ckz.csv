I'm sure you're becoming a beautiful young woman, and you take karate? That is awesome- it sounds like you want to be a strong, independent woman. I would encourage you to tackle the demon that is an ED head on; talk to your sensei about your struggles. I was in martial arts for a number of years, and I always found my instructors to be the most accepting, caring, non-judgmental people in my life. You don't have to battle this hell alone, and if you take this on now you stand a real chance of winning. Please message me if you want to talk. ",False,False

I'm just under 5'1"" and it's a lot harder to maintain your weight because there are so many calorie dense foods out there that binging even slightly can easily make you gain 5lbs which is like ballooning to us. Gaining that small amount is like someone your height gaining 10. 5'7"" is a wonderful height and at your age you shouldn't be too worried about your weight which is already pretty low. The BMI is flawed is flawed anyways since it doesn't even measure bone density or fat percentage. Take care of yourself now before you get old enough to the point where you can't absorb vitamins as well as you used to or you're going to suffer in the long run.",False,False

As without it can cause problems later in life. I’m not trying to discount how you feel and I know that body image, especially around puberty is very difficult, but it takes me back to my IP and PHP stays and there were kids there like 13 and under. Pleas try to talk to a trusted adult or friend or therapist about how this is affecting you because you don’t want it to develop into something worse.",False,False
