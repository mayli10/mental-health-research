Make sure you buy markers or crayons instead of colored pencils because they’re not always allowed! (Sharps) I’m really happy you’re finally getting the help you both need and deserve. I’m hoping for the absolute best for you!!!,False,False

How great minds think alike, I just ordered some coloring books off amazon!   You are so sweet, I’m really hoping for the best too. I’ve been battling these demons over half my life, I’m ready to close this chapter and finally live my life.",False,True

I liked Paperweight and What I Lost because they're about a girl going through recovery, and are good at showing the shift in mindset as the characters go through recovery. The Art of Starving can be really triggering, but I loved it because it's much more diverse than other eating disorder fiction and is just a plain good read. It's about a homosexual boy with anorexia who isn't upper class, which I was really happy about because so many books are about an upperclass white heterosexual girl.",False,False

A book that I absolutely adore that would just be for a fun read is Ship of Theseus, it’s absolutely captivating and can help take your mind off of a lot.   Also in res, it’s always nice to have coloring books and sticker books, (AND a deck of cards, never forget the cards!) even if it seems a little childish. You need time for you though, to get better, and what’s better than treating yourself?   On that line of things, one last thing I’d recommend (not a book) is unscented lotion because hospitals are mf DRY.   Good luck in res, okay? I’m really hoping good things for you and I’d love it if you made it out the other side. You’ve got this. Even when it gets so fucking hard, remember that time will heal everything. If you need to, or have any res questions, I’m always open to PMs.",False,False
