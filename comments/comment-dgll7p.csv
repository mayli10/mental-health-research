I'm 24, and didn't grow up going to the dentist and have quite a fear of going to the dentist. Because of this, I hadn't had my teeth cleaned before last year. Anyway, I'm talking to the hygienist, trying in all earnest to get the information I need to try to help my teeth. I tell her that I have a stomach issue that causes me to throw up a lot and ask her what would be best for my teeth if I think I'm about to vomit. She side-eyes me and says, ""Oh, just stop throwing up."" lmao so yeah, that's how that went for me. It may be our ED minds making us hyper-aware of stuff like that... I know how you feel.",False,False

I have Aetna. I do have a dental ""discount plan"" that I pay $10 a month for, and it covers some of it, but it's still astronomically expensive. I just do what I can when I can- unfortunately, it's usually when I'm in so much pain I can't handle it.   Also, I'm extremely overweight at this point so I doubt a doctor would even believe I have an ED lmao.",False,False
