That breaks my heart to read.  You aren't being overly sensitive; this was an extremely hurtful thing for him to say. Whether he was trying to hurt your feelings or not, it shows a toxic disregard for your physical and emotional well-being.  It makes me so sad to see the behavior that people here tolerate from their partners while convinced that it would be unreasonable to expect better. I know how hard it is to let go of someone you're reliant on, and how easy it is to focus on the good while telling yourself the bad isn't a big deal, but this is not okay. I think if you were able to see your relationship as an outsider, you'd realize a lot of other behavior from him that is sabotaging your ability to feel good about yourself.  If you're going to stay with him, please at very least accept that this is NOT okay. You deserve better than this, and if you think you don't, it is your eating disorder lying to you. You deserve love and support, and I hope you can believe that and, in time, come to a place where you accept nothing less. ‚ù§Ô∏è",False,False

But also the bloat makes me feel unsexy. I told my boyfriend of this so he knows that we have to wait and that some days, after eating a lot, I might not want to have sex at all. But he would never stop me from eating or tell me something like OP's boyfriend told to her. He knows about my ED as well but he wouldn't tell that to me even if I didn't have an ED because it's just such a shitty thing to say to someone.",False,False
