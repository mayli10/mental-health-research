Basically my experience was they have two courses so an intensive program where you’re admitted to a hospital if it’s immediately dangerous for you or you get in a recovery program with group workshops and solo meetings w dieticians etc. My program focuses on assessing your ED habits and your personal relationship w food, body, exercise etc. They don’t focus on your body weight specifics since they want to work with you about your ED brain first ",False,False

The only issue I have with getting help is the waiting list.  I was sent for an assessment and they ask questions and take notes etc.  After that you usually have to wait for a place in therapy and I waited around 10 months.  When you start treatment they'll ask questions, try to pinpoint when you developed issues with eating and start working with you from then on.  I started off once every two weeks, then when a client    finished their allotted sessions I was there once a week.  You'll get to see a nutritionist too.  Sorry I can't give any experience with a GP being my first point of contact, but speaking to others with EDs, I get the impression GPs are more on the ball with eating disorders now.  Let us know how you get on.  You don't have to be massively underweight to be diagnosed, or had a rapid weight loss.   Only problem is the waiting list, but I'm really glad you want to make moves to recover.  You can do it and YES THE COLD WEATHER IS AN ABSOLUTE BITCH!  x",False,False

I was worried because I have a normal BMI but she took me seriously, referred me straight away, booked me in for bloods and an ECG (am bulimic) immediately. She’s actually called to check on me whilst I’ve been waiting for the eating disorder services and had me get another blood test today - your GP can’t do much  other than refer you to a specialist but they can monitor your physical health and will likely discuss prescribing antidepressants in the meantime.   I hope it goes well for you! If they don’t take you seriously please consider going again and seeing a different GP, the waiting list is so long for ED services so getting referred ASAP is important! EVERYONE with an ED deserves to be taken seriously, regardless of weight, regardless of whether it’s just starting or whether you’ve been sick for years ❤️",False,False

It doesn't sound like you're in a place where you'll be sent home with healthy eating leaflets and appetite suppressants! I spoke to a new GP last week due to recent restriction spiralling out of control, and she was amazing.   I would suggest writing everything out beforehand, so you can always hand over some notes if you feel you aren't able to get your point across correctly - or ask the doctor to read your notes first. The charity b-eat have a leaflet on their website designed for this, so you can print that and take it with you. If you feel comfortable taking someone with you for support, do it. It's easy to get overwhelmed when you're in the room. You can also book a double appointment to help with time pressure.   The main point is: they should immediately refer you, no other options. That's the guideline they should be following. It doesn't matter so much about your weight (though sadly due to funding it may be an issue) - it should be more about your feelings and behaviour. You should be aiming to leave that room with a referral to an appropriate service and a clear idea of exactly what happens next.   In my area the referral is through something called Talking Therapies which normally you phone yourself, but you can ask your GP to do it for you if you would prefer.   And if you don't feel you've got a good enough outcome, see a different GP.   You can totally do this. ",False,False

She took bloods and I'm going to have an ecg at some point. She was very professional and not shaming at all! Don't worry, everyone is lovely and there to help. She also recommended I take anti-depressants. You'll be fine, don't worry! ",False,False
