Plant milk is much better and honestly to me, tastes better anyway. Dairy can actually cause acne (which I struggle with a lot so I avoid it at all costs)  Plus, there's a joke about people who are lactose intolerant like to push the limits of their lactose intolerance, so if you ate dairy now, I don't think many people would question it that heavily",False,False

Well I wasn't consciously lying.    But I don't know if I was just picky about dairy as a kid and used this as an excuse or was actually intolerant all along.     Either way I might have become it as it makes me sick almost every time. And I've never liked dairy much anyway üôÅ. So it's all good.   I do sometimes ~~miss~~ regret not being able to have delicious looking ice-cream and such. But not so much. Yogurt fills in that spot for me.    Funny thing is dairy fats have no (or very little) lactose, so you can have those to your hearts content.",False,False

When I went vegan, I did end up having dairy after and I got so sick. I guess that's pretty common. Or sometimes you can just have a small amount but, like, a glass of milk would make you sick. Idk, different for everyone, but you might not completely be lying :p",False,False
