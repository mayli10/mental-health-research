I also have no friends, which is okay most of the time but some weeks are unbearably lonely. I actually relapsed into b/p again today so this post really stuck out to me. I know me saying that isn't really helpful, your post just struck me in a familiar way,  and I wanted to let you know you aren' t alone. I hope things get better for you, stay safe!
