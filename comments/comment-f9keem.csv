Finding something I was truly passionate about kind of made me realize how I was wasting the only life I will ever will have on something as trivial as reaching a goal weight that nobody else cares about and that it isn‚Äôt helping anyone or adding any true value to my life or anyone else‚Äôs. I‚Äôm by no means recovered but I definitely started taking way better care of myself. I want to help people and make a difference, and I can‚Äôt do that when I‚Äôm sick. I never had motivation to get better after 8 years with an ED I found my passion and I checked myself into residential treatment and have been trying to stay in a better place since then. My advice is to try and find a purpose outside of ED doesn‚Äôt really matter what that purpose is as long as it means something to you.",False,False
