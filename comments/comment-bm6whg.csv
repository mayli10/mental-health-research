Each individual pack of stevia is 1.5g, I use two of them in my greek yoghourt, it means it's 0.4 kcal. 2 packs are more than enough, I just have an outrageously huge sweet tooth, I could def use a single pack for more than 100g of greek yoghourt and it would still be sweet (but I won't eat more than 100g of greek yoghourt so...useless information).",False,False

You can get it in various sizes, but it lasts FOEVER.  I got 200 grams I think and it's been months and I still have some.   And I use it in everything.  I make kool aid all the time and use a spoon of sucralose instead of cups of sugar, i add to my dressings, puddings, cookies, oats, etc etc  I use it multiple times a day",False,False

As others have said it's the bulking agents in Splenda packets that contribute to the calories, since sucralose is truly zero digestible calories. Sucralose is something like 600 times sweeter than sugar so it has to be heavily cut with fillers to be marketable. Stevia and erythritol are very low cal and readily available. Saccharin and aspartame are nearly as calorie dense as sugar but they're 300 and 200 times sweeter than sugar, respectively, so you need only a tiny tiny amount.   You can buy pure sucralose, aspartame and saccharin online but you'd have to be super careful portioning it or your coffee/tea will be undrinkably sweet. In my opinion it's not worth the effort for those &lt;4 calories per packet.  |Sweetener|GI|Type|Net Carbs (Per 100g)|Calories (Per 100g)| :--|--:|:--|--:|--:| |Stevia|0|Natural|5|20| |Allulose|0|Natural|0 – 5|20 – 40| |Inulin|0|Natural|1|150| |Monk Fruit|0|Natural|0 – 25|0 – 100| |Tagatose|3|Natural|35|150| |Erythritol|0|Sugar Alcohol|5|20| |Xylitol|13|Sugar Alcohol|60|240| |Maltitol|36|Sugar Alcohol|67|270| |Sucralose|0-80|Artificial|0|0| |Aspartame|0|Artificial|85|352| |Saccharin|Variable|Artificial|94|364| |Table Sugar|63|Processed|100|387|",False,False

It appears to be the small amounts of dextrose and malodextrin that are added to splenda packets that are the source of a very small number of calories. So Splenda’s liquid drops product might genuinely be 0 cal.  Feeling blindsided by the rounding on nutrition labels definitely sucks. I usually give myself some breathing time and then talk to myself about how a couple of calories here and there is within the margin of error for my tracking and it will be ok. (Occasionally my brain even listens.)",False,False
