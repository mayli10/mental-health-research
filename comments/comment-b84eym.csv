I was legit a binge eater toward the end of my carb days. Sucking down juice boxes, granola bars, I could pack in an entire mac &amp; cheese casserole over the course of two days... Easily several hundred grams of carb, several hundred of protein and several hundred of fat, probably totaling more than 4,000 calories. And this without really having an issue with exercise. How the hell was I able to cycle with a BMI in the 40s? I'll never know. I do know now that I don't fall over as easily on ice now that I'm down to a good weight.  Come to find out if I ate low carb (not strictly keto, however I am shifting towards a higher-fat sort of diet nowadays) my appetite homeostat would come back into calibration and naturally regulate me to simply having a muffin top. It's ugly, sure, but it's not visceral fat. I don't care how I look. I'm not trying to pull any dudes. I just don't want to be in a metabolic derangement. Ah, the advantages of being a completely self hating pre-transition trans woman. I get not to care about how I look at all. I hope I'll be able to carry that attitude into transition once I get on estrogen therapy.",False,False

I cannot encourage bingeing. Even if you don't feel mentally like shit (as I don't from it) you may feel physically like shit from, say, overloading your system.  I always regret it when I frontload (as I call it). Why? It's just overstuffedness. A turkey coma without the coma or cognitive impairment.  A weird thing I find is that I'm not anti-carb, I just don't buy carbs when I do the grocery shop because of previous obesity. It's a strange relationship. Occasionally I'll have chickpeas and all I'll notice is a subtle gear shift (to carb burning). ",False,False
