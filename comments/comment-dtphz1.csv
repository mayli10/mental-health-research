I'm curious as to why because I purge 1-2 times a day and it simply doesn't work like that for me. With the areas being so close and everyone else saying it happens to them am I broken?,False,False

Vomit is really acidic and the nasal membranes are thin and delicate, so I'm pretty sure nose bleeds are a combination of the nose being irritated by the acid and the force of vomiting (increased blood pressure so you bleed more etc.)  I don't think it's any more of a concern than purging already is, but hey I'm not a scientist.",False,False
