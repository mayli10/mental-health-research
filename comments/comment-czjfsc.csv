I find my favourite food is healthy anyways, but if I tell myself I won't have this or that, I crave it even more, so I'm trying to include everything I simply like and what's available. I'm just so scared that not trying to lose weight and letting go will rather result in gaining weight and I've gained so much already you can't recognize me. All I want is to just eat and feel full and not care :(     I totally agree on the fasting! I used to do extended fasts, like 2, 3 weeks - but now I can't even do one day, not because it's physically hard but because the second I THINK about it, my body freaks out! I get into a kind of panic even if I just think about it, so just planning on fasting sends me into a binge the day before (like yesterday). I have to accept that forcing myself to do things won't work ever again..",False,True

Eat filling things like protein, healthy fats and fiber. Even if you ""fail"" and binge, dont fast. I know there isn't a weight loss guarantee but if you can manage, take a break from actively trying to lose weight and focus only on the timing and quality of your food. You might find that weight comes off more easily than it does while trying to fast, because you can do it for longer periods of time without a binge.  Also focus on mostly eating safe foods during this time and avoid your most dangerous binge foods. Once you feel like you have a strong enough handle on that, you can think about what methods you want to use for weight loss. Fasting works for some people but for us, no matter how bad we want it to, it doesnt - not for weight loss at least - so I really encourage you to just keep eating filling meals that are also low calorie.  I know its easier said than done but you can PM me any time if you need to.",False,False

Donâ€™t take money with you anywhere. Doing that for a week is enough to stop me from buying extra!!,False,False

I had to eat every 3-4 hours and not compensate for binging. I gained a little bit of weight, but I was able to mostly stop binging, which was great. Since then, I've lost the weight I gained but don't restrict as heavily as I used to, so I haven't really been getting binge urges like before. It took months to get to this point though.",False,False
