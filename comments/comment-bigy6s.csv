I swear those damn calories stick to the sides of your mouth and stomach! It's just the nature of the beast I guess. Incase no one has told you today, you are beautiful inside and out. Good luck on your journey!",False,True

No questions are dumb. You are never alone in your struggles. For every bad situation there's someone else that has come out on the other side and can't wait to help and share their experience. I usually lurk, but I'm completely comfortable posting here. Ilu2üíï",False,True

The VERY short chapter on ED's in nursing school made me stay away from laxatives thank goodness. I find it kind of sad that even with pretty good medical knowledge, I continue to abuse my body.  Journaling has helped me immensely. I only started in February after my suicide attempt. It's only been a couple months but its improved my whole outlook on life and how to cope. That and being signed into the psych hospital by the CORONER really put things into perspective.  Good luck on your journey! And thank you for sharing your struggles. It's tough love, but some of us need to hear the scary and ugly stuff to discourage bad behavior.",False,True

When I gag, I gag HARD and have to stop the vomit from coming up.   I also throw up now if I smoke and hadn't in awhile. Instead of the usual coughing fit I go straight to puke!

I have literally never heard of this before but it makes so much sense. I already have a weakened pelvic floor and I can totally see myself in the same position as you, peeing because of vomiting. Just another reason to never do it, for as long as I can. Thank you so much for your comment and for this thread, Ilu ‚ô•‚ô•",False,False

No. My stomach was normal but after many times of taking 12+ laxatives to ""get food out of me"" after a binge,  I get horrible cramps and have diarrhea more often than not.  Once food is in you it's in there. Nothing can change that. Not 8 cups of shitter tea and a pack of OTC laxatives with 2 gallons of H20. If you think shitting and stomach cramps will get rid of calories, you're gonna have a bad time...  Im trying to accept that it happened, journal about the time leading to my binge, all the stats ( time, feelings, place, food, etc.) To find a trigger instead of a handful of little orange stomach killers.",False,False
