Like I’m diagnosed with PTSD, and it can be argued my eating disorder has stemmed from it. I have to treat my primary diagnosis (PTSD) to treat the secondary diagnosis (ED).",False,False

Say that last time you were 17.8 it was bad, but that this time it’s really bad and all your habits have become much worse. You fear you will become more physically sick as time goes on. Be honest and say you don’t want it to get to the point of being so severely physically unwell that there is no debate on whether you should recieve treatment or not.",False,False

My bmi is around 19 at the moment because I had to try to recover on my own but I’m in a full blown relapse now so it’s only going to go down again.  They really should focus on preventing it rather than leaving it too late and having to treat it. It would save lives, save people so much emotional and physical torture and save so much money for the NHS. We don’t even have an eating disorder clinic in the city I live in   I’m past the point of wanting help now I just don’t care. And I don’t like to annoy people hahaha   It’s just annoying haha",False,True

The system is drained and the criteria for treatment has become much worse to meet.  I have a diagnosis of CPTSD, Major Depression and I have an underweight BMI.  The NHS eating disorder clinic near me has said only under 17.5 AND no primary diagnoses will be accepted, with the exception of pregnancy and/or T1 Diabetes. From that it’s hospitalisation for under 16.5 regardless.  I’m sorry they won’t help you :(  This sounds horrid and I’m sorry to advise but...have you tried the constant nagging at your GP? I I knew this guy in hospital last year whos sister works for the NHS and she says that mostly you need to get to the point of pissing them off by seeing them often and stating you are severely ill demanding help.",False,False

I went from borderline obese to just into underweight category in BMI within less than a year then only bothered to see a GP about it when I got back to around bmi 19/20. Doctor just looked me up and down and said ""you're at a healthy weight"" then gave me some shitty resources on mindfulness (not what I needed at all)  Meanwhile my boyfriend's sister just got diagnosed with anorexia and hospitalised within  &lt;6 months of showing ED symptoms due to being a) underage b) already naturally underweight, just making me feel like I'm not 'sick enough' because I have to high restrict due to whatever reasons and no one will give a shit until I'm on death's door.
