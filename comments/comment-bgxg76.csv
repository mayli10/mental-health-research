I think bodies are just weird like that sometimes.",False,False

It's super easy for your weight to fluctuate by 10 lbs in a day due to fluid balance, though.  An average human being eats between 3-5 lbs of food per day, and each litre of fluid you drink adds another 2 lbs.",False,False

However, I think what that post is taking about is *true* gain, which would be 7,000 cal above TDEE to have the possibility of truly gaining 2lbs. Your fluctuations are normal/expected though because of water weight and how much food is in your system. Those things will change how much the scale reads but it isnâ€™t really gaining weight, if that makes sense",False,False
