So I feel like my ed kind of developed alongside my mental health issues while I was growing up and now it‚Äôs where it is today. I‚Äôve ‚Äúfit‚Äù a lot of different diagnoses at this point so I kind of feel like my ed is one of my brains way of coping. I don‚Äôt really have a great support system for my mental health and I have a really difficult time asking for help so my coping mechanisms tend to be self destructive.

Over the years I've racked up a bunch of different diagnoses. (In some ways I think the BPD dx hits closest to the core of things, and statistically there is significant overlap between folks with BPD and folks with an ED.) As far back as I can remember I struggled to feel safe and loved, to feel 'good enough', to feel any sense of belonging. The result is a lot of anxiety, self-loathing, and overall 'emotional dysregulation'. It's like I've got an oil stain on the walls of my mind that I keep trying to paint over. Controlling food. Hurting myself. Sleeping the day away. Drinking the day away. But the oil eventually seeps through the paint and oh, yup, there it is again. I'm making real progress with the help of dialectical behavioral therapy, but sometimes it still feels a little like wack-a-mole.",False,False

I am 99% sure I have some form of anxiety because I used to have major panic attacks that i never told anyone about.  Now they are more mild thankfully.  I also cant eat in public or even around my family.  This has resulted in me many times eating in a washroom which felt defeating.  I think that the two go hand in hand for me.
