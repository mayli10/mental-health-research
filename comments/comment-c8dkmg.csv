It's hard, and people are (usually) coming from a place of love, but i'd rather have them love me a little less so i could just eat my lunch without it being a whole ordeal",False,True

If I had never gotten the idea into my head that I was fat as a child it wouldve been unlikely that I wouldve taken on such crazy diets and eventually developed BED, which made me gain soo much weight in the long term. Had I avoided all of it I would be at a perfectly normal weight now that (hopefully . . .) I would be happy with. Looking back my body was so normal/ borderline slender and Id kill for it now. Dont want to put blame on others, ultimately me who chose to diet, but it's fucked how friends and family saw as you say ""a little baby fat"" and ""a round face"" as, verbatim, being ""pretty, if she lost weight"".",False,False

I also was looking through old pictures recently and *i was not fat.*  I wasn’t thin, but I was perfectly average. This is such bullshit and it pisses me off. Kids are developing disordered thoughts and behaviors from *such* a young age and it’s fucking disgusting.",False,False

I have a 23"" waist and sometimes my belly and stuff still gets squeezed over my pants just because of the way the pants fit. Like, sometimes I just can't pull them up quite as high as they're supposed to be or whatever and the waist of the pants squeeze in at a spot that's a little wider, like right over my hips or whatever. Bodies are soft and it's completely normal for tight clothing to squeeze your soft parts. It's not your fault that a lot of clothing isn't made with your exact body shape in mind. It's almost impossible to find clothing that actually fits perfectly unless you get everything you buy altered.",False,False
