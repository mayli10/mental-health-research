He says he still loves me, but that he canâ€™t be with me right now.  He will be the last to over lay hands on my body. If he doesnâ€™t want it ever again..then oh well..Iâ€™m just gonna get fat and die.  I literally havenâ€™t experienced attraction to anyone else, despite purposely testing for it. No one will ever have my heart as strongly as he does...and because my meaning in life is to have a husband/family one day...if he doesnâ€™t magically change his mind, I will have literally nothing to live for.  There is so much pain that bingeing can barely even numb it, which is crazy to me.  I tried to cut him off last night because I couldnâ€™t handle the pain of being ignored by the one I love, butI immediately had some of the most extreme pain in my life. I immediately took it back, and thankfully he allowed me to, but the few seconds I spent in that state were Hell; I literally felt like the only escape would be death.  I feel horrible.",False,False
