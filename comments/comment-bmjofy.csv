All my shirts and dresses are XS and sometimes even then I’ll have to alter them to be smaller. I wear a 0 in pants and yet I don’t believe it. Even typing this out I feel a bit like a fraud and am afraid someone will call me out.   But I look in the mirror and I don’t match up with an XS, in my head at least. I feel like the sizing must just be stupidly random and inaccurate like how at every store clothes vary a bit.   When I calculate my BMI I also always feel like it must be super inaccurate because maybe it thinks I have a lot of muscle or something.   I think all of the things you described are part of the disorder. I do think I could be any weight and still think I am not thin enough and struggle to see how thin (or not?) I am.   The only time I ever thought I was thin was after I left my low weight I saw a picture from it and both thought “Holy cow I was way too thin” and “I can’t wait to get back.”",False,False
