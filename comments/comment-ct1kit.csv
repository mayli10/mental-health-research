I purged 2 days in a row like ALL day. I was binging all day so I purged what I didn't C/S and it was like- I got everything out for sure. But my face looked like SHIT. It was so round, and my jowls were just like huge and I looked bad. It usually goes away after like a day or 2 but honestly, one of the reasons I don't go to the dentist for fillings is cause of the nova-cane that makes your face swell up and I already have a really weird face shape, so... Yeah. Purging is just dumb- I would use it as a last resort tbh.",False,False

Fast forward through an ultrasound and two biopsies, and I was diagnosed with thyroid cancer.   My vanity let me to bulimia, which led me to a lifesaving diagnosis. I was diagnosed July 5th, 2017, and I havenâ€™t purged or restricted since.   Stay safe. Take care of yourself. Xx",False,False

I hadn't seen my sharp-ass jawline in months, but the two days I decided to stop purging (mostly because I was exhausted), I looked like myself again.
