However, I use to be overweight/obese. I was for most of my childhood and until I was 26. At this point I have only spent 3 years of my adult life in a normal BMI range. I still feel like the ""fat one"" around my friends and family. I'm not sure I will ever get over that feeling.  So when I see an ed group for ""bigger"" ed sufferers, my first thought is ""great!"" And then I have to remember that I don't fall into that category anymore. Its just a strange place to be sometimes.",False,False
