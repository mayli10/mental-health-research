Would these symptoms be considered bulimic?  &amp;#x200B;  I've been doing restriction for the past several weeks but there have been a couple of times within the past week where I just couldn't take it anymore and I binged and then used a laxative afterwards and fast the following day where I eat very little.

I'm getting off everything except Vyvanse a month from now, so I hopefully don't rebound or realize I can't function/exercise without them.
