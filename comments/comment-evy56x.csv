The motivation isn’t always there. I can’t always see the path out of the darkness, but I’m working to develop the gentle discipline to keep taking small positive actions even when I can’t see how it will take me forward. Sometimes the positive action is even to rest, assess, and regather my energies before continuing. I used to believe “try harder” was always the answer, but it turns out other approaches are sometimes much better. Try different, as it were.   Perhaps try to bear in mind that instincts examined often rebel. Often the tapes in our head seem to get louder before they get quieter. So, if tomorrow is rough, know that you’re not alone and it doesn’t mean recovery is impossible. It’s worth it pursuing the slow-and-steady process of giving the brain new messages, new inputs. Then, slowly, the brain will give new outputs, and I promise that is an experience you won’t want to miss. Zen hugs and wishing you safe travels.",False,False
