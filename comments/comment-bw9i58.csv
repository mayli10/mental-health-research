They have three levels of care - critical care/inpatient, residential, and PHP. There's a max of 12 women allowed in either three levels of care, so you get a lot of attention while you're there. If I ever needed to go back to treatment, I would go there. It's in Arizona, about an hour out of Phoenix.   I went to Timberline Knolls for 3 months last year and while it's a good program, they recently had a therapist there who is in the process of being convicted for sexual assault of several patients. I was also a victim of sexual assault there, but by a nurse. I would NOT recommend anyone ever go there. My therapist there also did not believe me when I told her I was assaulted.",False,False
