You mention sugar and carbs, well, I hope it's not chocolate, candy, breads/pastries with fillings like donuts, croissants, Ã©clairs, cause most of the meltable parts of those sweet goodness are slipping down your throat.   My advice is to stop it while you can, c/s is highly addictive, it'll fuck up your teeth, mess up your hunger cues, mess up your stomach, make you waste a LOT of money, and, at least in my personal experience, make you gain/maintain. It's overall not worth it. I understand saying ""stop it"" to someone with a problem is dumb but since you said yourself ""I'm so new"", I'm taking the liberty to do so.",False,False
