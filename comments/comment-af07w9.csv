If you explain to the doctor that any weight gain right now would worsen your ED//give you anxiety//is effecting your mood, it may be an option to find one that is weight-neutral for you! Plenty exist. :) It took me a bit of time to find a good doctor, but I eventually found one who was supportive, and understood that it wasn't feeding into my ED to avoid putting me on medications that would trigger worsening symptoms (like weight gain, the carbohydrate cravings i got from some, etc.).   &amp;#x200B;  I know it's hard, but be honest with them! Don't go in there looking for a specific medication because of other side effects (like stimulants), as it'll only decrease your chances of (1) getting that medication if you do truly need it, and (2) Most doctors get butt-hurt from such as they like to play God IME. Just go in, tell them your concerns, and if you've truly given it a chance//it's not a startup side effect, ask them what options you have if you want to change meds!   &amp;#x200B;  Much love. &lt;3",False,False
