I've only ever been medicated - been let down by ill-advised bulk-billed mental health professionals lol - and i would love a focus on behavioural training. I guess the other pitfall is i've always deflected focus away from/neglected mentioning ED. Just looked up DBT (can u believe i'd never heard of it?!) and im going to see if i can find a group workshop locally to dip my big toe in. Sounds so interesting. Thanks so much!!,False,True

So in a sense, any start is a good start! What works best for any one person varies so much that often there’s some muddling around and trial/error to find the help that helps *you*.   I’m in the US but the single biggest help for me so far has been extended exposure to Dialectical Behavioral Therapy (DBT). It clicks with my brain in a way general CBT never did. I was in a DBT group for about 6 months and continue working on developing my skills in weekly individual therapy. (I do also see someone for medication management.)   Your solution may turn out to be totally different of course. (I like to imagine it like some scene in a fantasy novel where the protagonist is selecting the sword that’s perfectly balanced for their personal fighting abilities and style.)",False,False
