Just know that you’re valid no matter what your BMI is, and you deserve help! By the way, my symptoms were heart palpitations during exercise, and an abnormal EKG just for reference, but I think an echo is the only way to tell. Stay safe! ❤️",False,False

At the time, I thought I still had a long ways to go before I did any serious damage, but 16.5 is extremely low. I know a lot of us don’t look at it that way because of comparison, but it is medically very unhealthy, and regardless of whether or not you are UW OW or NW, dying is very, very easy.",False,False
