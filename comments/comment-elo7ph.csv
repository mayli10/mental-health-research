But like, cool motive, still &gt;!art theft/shoplifting/antique fraud/knowingly being an engaged woman's paramour/indulging in an obsession with a friend who is in a relationship/abandoning your fiancee at the engagement party/murder/accepting blood money from that murder!&lt;.  Personally I'd give him a pass on everything up to and including the fraud, because he was just a kid/adolescent trying to get by. But he isn't all that remorseful (or at least not explicitly) for a lot of things that I thought he should have been, so despite liking him and relating to him and sympathizing with him...I'd also call him an asshole",False,True
