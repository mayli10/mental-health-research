He understands almost everything. My ED is a little different (he says it's worse), but regardless, I don't really have to worry about him saying accidentally triggering things since he does know the mindset.  Though several months back, during a recovery phase, I finally felt okay enough to go get sushi with him. We were both paying for ourselves. When he asked what I was getting, after I told him, he responded with a surprised, ""You're getting *two* rolls?"". Now, my boyfriend weighs 100 pounds more than me at 6'0. His TDEE can get up to 3,000 Cals/day. He does not have a small appetite by any means.  He just saw my face and said, ""I didn't mean it like that! I was only referring to the price because this place is expensive!"" Now, this part of the story, I didn't remember, but apparently I went to the bathroom right after and he says he thinks I cried. I'm not sure if I did, but I do remember knowing he was telling the truth, and believing him, but the thoughts were still there. I was already having a lot of difficultly just going, but after that comment, my ED was completely out.  ...  Another thing is that he finally admitted, after I lost like 20-40 pounds (somewhere there), that he preferred my body smaller. Of course, I was pressing him, but this was after he denied it for months. Of course, I ""knew it all along, and he just confirmed it"". I'm more upset at him for lying about it than anything (he denies it sometimes still), but he does say he just prefers being bigger than me, but I'm not so sure. It's just motivation for me to get smaller and smaller. He says that that shouldn't be my motivation because smaller doesn't always equal better, but I know there's a limit, that's not news to me. I'm sure he would not think I look better at 60 pounds. But at 90 vs 120? Um, yes.  He means no harm though, of course. He tries his best. There's always gonna be something there for an ED to find/latch onto, no matter if it's legitimate or not.",False,False
