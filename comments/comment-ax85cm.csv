I was feeling ok but then I stepped on the scale and saw it hadn‚Äôt moved. Also worried about one of the posters on here. They said they didn‚Äôt have money for food and maybe I could send some their way? Depends on how close they are? Maybe through amazon or a Tesco/Iceland delivery or something??? If they‚Äôre close enough then actually deliver some food I have lying around here?   How are you? Are you doing ok? ,False,False
