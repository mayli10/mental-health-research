Like there’s no way anybody other than you would look at you and notice a two pound difference, unless the full amount if it went to your chin or something lol. But I’m in exactly the same situation as you are right now, a couple pounds above my LW and desperate to get there by Halloween. I was happy with my weigh-in this morning but then when I logged it in my health app it just looked SO DIFFERENT to the number that represents my LW. I’m 28 and doing as much math on the daily as if I were in grade school lol.",False,False
