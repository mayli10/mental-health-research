Diarrhea itself is caused by your gut not taking the time to pull water out of your waste as it's moving through your digestive track at high speed.   The body tends to store more water web dehydrated so when you are losing most of the hydration you get from your diet out your butt your body is trying to hang on to whatever you have left. Your finger (that's where I notice it) and ankles might seem a little puffer than normal. That's a clean sign of holding on to water.   To help combat this it's best to deal with the dehydration. Get yourself some poweraid or your electrolytes of choice. ,False,False
