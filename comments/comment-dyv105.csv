Many posts about powering through the nausea and other associated physical ailments. Some about how fantastic they feel which sounds a lot like the weird high you can get starving yourself. And then any argument is brushed off with messed up pseudoscience, ‚ÄúI kNoW my BODy‚Äù or claims that modern science and medicine just haven‚Äôt researched fasting so don‚Äôt know the miraculous benefits. Ack, sorry long comment, but it‚Äôs toxic as fuck",False,False

That is the worst part of that sub I think. There are no calories in water. I'm gonna say it again for the demons in the back (of my own fucking head that is) THERE ARE NO CALORIES IN WATER.,False,False

Instead, they're all talking about how great it is for him and I am just so confused",False,True
