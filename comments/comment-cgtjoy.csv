You deserve to be treated by someone with a better handle on your condition.   That said, MANY people who work with EDs seem to hold beliefs that are not well supported by science. I mean just look at sites like Mirror Mirror and NEDA, which both bandy about ""starvation mode."" Like, if she's otherwise excellent, maybe it's worth staying? Although personally, I would've walked the second she told me to start eating meat again.",False,False
