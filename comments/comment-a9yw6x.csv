We've known each other since we were children, had 6+ hour skype calls played minecraft and portal and all sorts of online games together. I love her so much and even though now we're both adults and could easily make the trip but I keep making excuses. Worst part is she's seen my face, we've Skype called, even when I was obese. But she's always been so so thin, she went vegan when we were in HS and lost even more weight and I just am sooo jealous. When she comes to visit I want her to say ""you look so different!!"" And I want us to be able to share clothes and take aesthetic photos and me now look like a cow ughhh. ",False,False

When I flew into her state to stay over, I noticed that I wasn’t the only one who also gained weight. Then she told me last minute that our other high school friend (who was always sooo skinny) was in town for work and would meet us for brunch and when we did she ALSO gained a lot of weight.   It was kinda rare for that to happen but wow that made me feel normal for once. I told my friend that I was scared since I did gain weight and she told me she was worried too about herself.",False,False

He's skinnier than me and fitter than me, I don't want him to realise I'm not 100% as I seem.   But honestly? I think you should go for it, don't let that feeling hold you back because your friends won't see it like that and you'll regret not meeting them. ",False,False

I was terrified to start uni bc I didn't want all these new people to see me and still am scared to go back tbh.

I have a very close internet friend who’s actually quite overweight (and happy about it, good for her) who I really want to meet but I’m always postponing it because I think she’ll hate me if she sees me this way. I just feel like she’ll like me so much better if I’m skinny which is so stupid. ",False,False
