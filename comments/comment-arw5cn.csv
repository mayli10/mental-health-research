It literally does nothing for my appetite. I mean it makes it easier to stop myself from over eating, but it definitely doesn’t make me think twice about getting to that point.   And then when I don’t take my adderall I have ALL THE CRAVINGS and it’s AWFUL.   I know exactly how you feel about that dude and I’m so sorry.   But hey no one has ever shown me a straight female pornstar that looked remotely like your average girls, but that didn’t mean that they didn’t also like average girls. Just because your crush likes pornstars doesn’t mean he doesn’t like you. Most people know by now that real people don’t look like that! ",False,False

When we first met he was around 150, and even with an ED I felt like he looked a little too gaunt. Don't think that  put him at and underweight BMI, and he was a cyclist, so he was lean, but he just looked...malnourished. We went to one of my family gatherings after he gained like 30+ pounds and a lot of people kept telling me how good he looked with the extra weight. It kinda annoyed me because they always, always have to make comments about weight change and it's so unnecessary. But anyway. We also lived next to like 4 LGBT bars within a 1-3 minute walk and he was cat-called on his bike a lot after the weight gain (in a tight spandex cyclist suit). Maybe it's just where I'm from, idk, but he turned a lot more heads once he got to a higher weight. I think he looks pretty dang hot.   &amp;#x200B;  I'm sorry you're feeling all that bullshit pressure though. It makes me so sad to think of you berating yourself because you don't think you're living up to the right body ideals in your community. But I really hope that you'll be able to glance in the mirror sometime and realize that you look great at the size that you are. I know you don't believe it now. It's true though. ",False,False

It seems women want guys with as little body fat as possible and toned muscles. It's like damn even if I was really thin, then I gotta bust my ass at the gym.   However, as someone outside the gay community, I always thought it would be better if I was gay. Always see people talking about liking ""bears"" lol.

Feeling that way totally sucks. What helps me is to remember that I can't achieve two competing goals. I can't want to look effortlessly thin and also want to look like I put effort into my body; I have to pick one. Moreover, if I have to put effort into looking thin, it will never be / look effortless. It can be depressing but it helps me to know I can't have both no matter how hard I try, so I might as well just pick one and move on.",False,False

Just focus on getting better for your health and find a way to live that works for you. At your height you're really not even at a bad weight. If you want to lose weight that would be understandable because pretty much everyone here wants to lose weight, but you don't actually need to. Also, definitely relate to that last part. I'm a trans woman so I always end up comparing myself to cis women. I've tried to teach myself to not do that since it isn't a fair comparison, but then of course there are also trans women out there who actually do look even better. I'm pretty lucky already because I come from a kinda tall family, but I'm only 169cm tall. I'm only so small because I had problems as a baby that made it nearly impossible to eat which I had to have surgery to fix. It really hasn't helped that this eating disorder probably stunted my development. It was really hard to start feeling good about my body despite all the things I consider flaws, but it is possible. When I did feel the need to compare myself to other women I decided to focus on people who actually look similar to me. Turns out there are actually a lot of women I consider attractive who have bodies like mine. Sometimes I still feel dysphoric or self-conscious, but for the most part I've actually started to like my body. At this point I'm just trying to get back up to a healthy weight so I can maybe start to see my hormones working again. That's been tough because of bloating and stuff, but if I try to focus on eating healthy I should be able to get better without having to deal with that. Lowkey kind of sucks that a healthy weight for me won't look as good as it would for an average girl though.",False,False

Spoiler alert: my life still feels empty and the only thing I've acquired is a self-destructive coping mechanism. Sure, my body has changed radically and more people are attracted to me than before, but that does nothing to fill the emptiness that was the real reason behind wanting to lose weight in the first place.
