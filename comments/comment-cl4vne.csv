My fingers would turn white. I felt like I was constantly in a daze, like everything just had this thick mental fog on it. Yet it was really easy to get moody. Angry, sad, anxious. Then sometimes I'd go for so long without eating that my entire body felt weak and shaky. I once got up and felt like I would easily pass out if I moved at all. I couldn't think about anything besides my body, other people's body, my food, their food, what I was gonna eat the next day and the next day, and how I'd fix it if I fucked it all up. Then when I'd go to sleep at night or take naps, I could feel like my heart was beating at a snail's pace. I know at least one time I measured it was in the 50s. Think that was at around a BMI of 15. I don't remember any exact numbers anymore. I also don't remember being low energy.",False,False

It was actually 15yrs ago (I should have said that) and through that 15yrs I still struggle a lot with disordered eating but now I think if it more like an illness that flares up.  If it gets worse I seek help to treat it but generally it's something I have to self manage every day.,False,False

I weighed 94lbs at my lowest, my GW was 90lbs and at the time I recovered I was playing with lowering it to 80lbs. I'm sure I would have died if I didn't stop, but I did.     But anyway, at 94lbs, I was very prone to colds, tired all the damn time, always cold unless the temp was over 85 degrees, had a chronic headache, had incredibly insomnia, constantly faint (and fainted regularly), had much worse heart palpitations, always felt ""foggy"", etc. It sucked, honestly.     That phrase could also refer to the mental aspects. At that time, I was entirely consumed by my ED. Nothing else mattered.",False,False

At the end she didn't have the energy to hold he own head up and her neck had to be supported.  The hospital tried to give her nutrition but because her organs had given up nothing worked.   If your goal weight is very low it's worth remembering that your body starts to use/eat muscles for energy and muscles include muscles surrounding your heart, liver, stomach, even your bum. If it all wastes away you end up very ill. Lack of energy is just the tip of the iceberg really.   I was going the same direction as her with the same goal weight but when she died I managed to snap out of it and now my goal is still an underweight BMI but not by much.  It's TOUGH and I want to be much much smaller but I have seen what it can do.",False,False

But I imagine I definitely didn't have the same severity as someone with a lower BMI.  For me it was mostly extreme tiredness, a lot of weakness which was an issue considering I have a really active job. I had heart palpitations even on days with no EC. My immune system was pretty shot so I caught every passing cold possible. And just constantly freezing. Pretty regularly sore in my legs and arms from muscle loss vs my job. The palpitations were the reason I tried to recover though. I was terrified of a heart attack. Probably just needed to lay off the EC and get more electrolytes and vitamins though.",False,False

The effects:  1) weak, tired, low energy, always seemed like I was in a ‚Äúglum‚Äù mood even if I wasn‚Äôt.   2) pain in my muscles, constant aches around my neck, shoulders, back, hips.   3) dizzy spells, low blood sugar, physically and mentally exhausted.   4) obsessed with food. Thought about nothing else, ever.   5) trouble sleeping, would lay awake for hours feeling like time was stopped, getting more and more frustrated.    On the other hand, the positives included liking my reflection, liking how I looked in clothes, never feeling self conscious in public, confidence for days, not feeling anxious about leaving my house or going outside, feeling accomplished, loving how I looked in pictures, not feeling gross when my SO touched me, less likely to bail on socialising or taking part in my hobbies.   I always frame it as trading one form of misery for another, which can be boiled down to depression vs anorexia. I‚Äôll take anorexia a thousand times before depression. Anorexia makes me feel strong. Depression cripples me.",False,False
