Like what the actual fuck??? I even found myself trying to *save him from himself* by portioning out his food or not keeping his favorite foods in the house so he didn’t overdo it and feel guilty...  ...And then I realized he doesn’t have an eating disorder and when he’s done with his favorite food he just stops eating and puts it away. Like a normal fucking adult that feeds himself and carries on.   SO CRAZY I LITETALLY CANNOT IMAGINE WHAT THAT FEELS LIKE.,False,False

If undone dishes don't register high on your list of priorities or as a reflection of your value as a person, you aren't going to stress about them.",False,False
