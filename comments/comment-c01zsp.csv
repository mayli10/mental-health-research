That would be true if there was 1 cup of dry tapioca pearls going into your drink. That may not sound like a lot but 1 cup of tapioca in your drink would be a really disproportionate amount in a regular or small size serving (you'd be thinking ""why the hell have they given me a drink that's 50%+ bubbles??). It's much more likely that you're getting 1/2 cup (270) or even less, if there's ice. Don't worry!",False,False

This news article did a calorie analysis on chatime and found a regular milk tea with tapioca and regular sugar was 330 calories (everything all together)   I drink bubble tea a lot so I spent a day researching this LOL   Source: https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.thestar.com/amp/life/food_wine/2017/07/26/is-chatimes-milk-tea-too-sweet-for-a-regular-treat-the-dish.html,False,False
