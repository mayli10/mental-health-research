I would have the same response if someone asked me. It takes me forever to notice other people's weight changes. People would really have to be paying close attention and if they are, then they probably have their own issues. Thank you for the reassurance. These responses have made me feel a lot better. :) ",False,True

I always go to the extreme of worrying and expect the worst when I'm anxious. I just remembered that someone recently told me they had gained 15 lb over the summer and I didn't even notice much of a difference at all, even after they pointed it out. ",False,True

My insecurity and worry only applies to my weight because I'm so hyper-aware of it and afraid of gaining. But you're right, I think it absolutely takes people awhile to ""catch up"" and see any changes in other people's weight. And even then, most people probably don't even care that much, if at all. It just feels like such a big deal to me in the moment when I'm feeling super anxious and insecure about myself. Thank you for the reassurance. ",False,True

It makes sense to think about now that I'm feeling less anxious. I get so anxious when I feel full and bloated and everything seems so much worse than it really is. Thank you! ,False,True

I remember when I told my mum I'd lost like 15 pounds and she basically didn't believe me lol. And we were seeing each other every few months then so it's not like when you see someone every day and you don't notice.  I know how you feel though, if I get about 4 pounds heavier than I am currently I'm convinced I look much chubbier, but logically I know I don't (I hope). ",False,False

It took several pounds for others to notice my weight loss so I guess it's the same with weight fluctuations. 2-3 pounds is hardly noticeable, I think. In your 20s it's more common than not to slowly gain weight so those people have most likely indeed fluctuated or gained a little bit of weight too. There's also the saying ''it takes 4 weeks for you to notice your body changing, 8 weeks for your friends, 12 weeks for the rest of the world.''",False,False
