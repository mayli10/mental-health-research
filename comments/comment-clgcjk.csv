I somehow find it easier to rationalize with myself that I shouldn’t eat while I’m high, compared to when I’m not, because I just think “no!!!! You’re only hungry bc you’re high / have the munchies!! Obviously it has nothing to do with the fact that you only ate XXX calories today!!”  Also (and I understand this is a luxury I have bc weed is legal here), I have gotten good at knowing which strains from which suppliers are the most likely to give me munchies and I can just avoid those.",False,False

It doesn’t make me hungry at all anymore, it just brings my anxiety way down. It was usually helpful but when I was doing really poorly there’d be like a 50/50 shot between it being helpful and it allowing all my horrible thoughts flow *way* more easily. Once I got too high (super low t from not eating at all) and convinced myself that the lemon bar I was eating was actually my own teeth and then t turned to globs of fat in my mouth. So... yeah that doesn’t happen to me anymore though",False,False

I have ptsd also and I have a medical card for that. Hunger is a major problem with intermittent use. I don’t get the hunger anymore using it daily. But don’t want to suggest anyone pick up another daily habit.,False,False
