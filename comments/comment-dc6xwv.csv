BUT this week i started to reframe that mindset. i'm at a point where i need to actually care about myself, actually value my health, and actually make good decisions. i have no one to fall back on when i collapse, i only have myself. and thinking about it like that, i've only ever really had myself (i have an unsupportive family like you). and i wish i could go back and take care of 12 year old me!!!! i am an adult now and i am so much more powerful than i was when my ED started. i am building up the willpower to prioritize taking care of myself. i know it sounds very preach-y and obvious, but just waking up everyday and almost thinking of myself as a child reminds me ""shes hungry, she should eat something that will make her feel stronger""      Sorry this turned into more of a rambling comment than i thought, i just feel like i relate to you and i wish i could instill the desire to take care of yourself in you. in a way, transitioning is taking care of yourself too, and it sounds like you're doing great with that &lt;3 congratulations! remind yourself of how far you've come. Hope this helps &lt;3",False,False
