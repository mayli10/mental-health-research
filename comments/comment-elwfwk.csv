Bitch no one likes to inflict that mental and physical pain to their own body everyday, it's not like ""ooooh my plate of pasta was so big I'm so full now"", no it's more like ""yuh so I just took food from my trash bin bc I regretted throwing that away when I decided to stop binging one hour ago"". I've done the craziest stuff while binging and I wish people understood that it's not what we're eating, it's the way we're doing that thing. It's the method, the timing and the feeling when binging. It's fucking scary, people that never went through anything like this will NEVER understand, just because eating food it's seen like something easy and we all do everyday.   Guess what Linda, turns out that for some people, it's not THAT easy.",False,False
