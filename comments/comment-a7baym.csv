However, 105 appeals to me too; even though it’s underweight.  At 90 lbs (my lowest weight ever); I had a heart attack. Wouldn’t recommend 90 lbs being your goal; 105 is dangerous enough. I’m sorry our minds hate us and tell us we’ll only have worth at a certain size. I wouldn’t wish this on anyone. ",False,False

When I was 105, I couldn’t go out in public without people expressing concern and my doctors were VERY worried and recommended treatment. Now, I’m almost 140 and people still call me tiny and skinny, and doctors are finally happy.  It all depends on distribution, but also remember that our standard of ‘not TOO thin’ is dramatically different than the rest of the world’s. We are disordered. ",False,False

I would probably look sick at 105. But if you have a very small frame you could possibly not look sick. Google ideal weight by body frame. There's wrist measurements you can take to give you a more objective answer on your frame size. ,False,False

Bone structure and your current fat distribution matters a lot. I’m ~ 110-115 and 5’5 and people call me tiny all the time. However, *i* feel i look huge lmao. Also, heavy restricting i think makes me look sicker because I’m so tired lmao ",False,False

On some it definitely would, on others not so much. You'll probably view your body differently than the people around you anyway. When I was 105lbs people already told me how skinny I was.
