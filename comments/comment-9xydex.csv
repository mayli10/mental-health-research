I think I support shop lifting and I support free speech on the internet... so even that is pretty meh  I don't know, as I mentioned before, I'm having trouble with rapid thoughts and difficulty expressing myself about all this. It's also just hilarious that so much FILTH is agreed to/posted/agreed with on reddit and our sub was purportedly banned for 'encouraging people to harm themselves' or whatever  It would be interesting to see infographics about responses to the weekly photo thread... like common words in responses, or tone of response (affirming/positive/friendly) etc. IDK sorry I've gone totally off track.  but I totally agree with you about the personal emoji choices, they certainly provided context/character and had a personal touch/flavour.",False,True

I liked the flowers in u/daeboo because I always recognized her by those and her stats and a ton of other users Iâ€™d recognize their posts by their flairs. I miss it so much!!

Reddit doesn't take actions against users that promote or commit harassment, especially sexual harassment or threats.   Same with Facebook, Twitter, and a lot of other social media.   But then, put one community together, and they have a behaviour that is considered insufferable, and their solution is to ban it. Instead of banning specific type of content and making it mandatory to abide by certain rules, they ban it, but having people promoting MGTOW or Incels is totally ok...   I left Facebook after they banned me from a group from posting harassment and explicit pictures THAT I GOT FROM A PRIVATE CHAT WITH SOMEONE, made to warn other women on the group. But no, this guy is still out there and I'm banned from that group... makes sense. Especially when Facebook reads all the private chats too. And Reddit is becoming the same. No platform is safe now.
