Can’t eat anything solid atm and am really battling with liquid calories BUT they’re easier in terms of physically eating and not feeling the need to purge. So maybe smoothies/protein shakes? But sometimes I find texture of them too much to handle so I go for hot chocolate or apple juice? Hope you feel better soon :),False,False

It's the emotions that come with the thought that have become the trigger. I've been doing my best with calorie dense protein shakes and small meals, but it's quite difficult as soon as the feelings strike.",False,True
