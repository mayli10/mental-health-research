And I totally relate to feeling like I have to have my shit together or I‚Äôm not allowed to have issues. But I do. And I want to get better now before I need a higher level of care. Better to nip it in the bud imo while you can still do IOP after work than to have to tell HR that you need a medical leave of absence ‚ù§Ô∏è hope you find something that works for you. I‚Äôm rooting for you!!,False,False

Stress did bring some negative thoughts but I managed to put those aside time after time. But then last year of uni was full on stress and something also happened in my personal life that I couldnt quite handle the best possible way and then I slowly let myself get sick again. Blah :(,False,True

Also Im embarrassed to tell anyone about my condition because I work in a medical field and being a first year resident I feel like I shouldnt have any issues of my own. I know it‚Äôs not how it works and I should put my own health first but other side of me keeps telling me that I shouldnt tell anyone. I see the issue in my behavior and I often recognize the voice of the disorder but at the same time the disorder keeps telling me Im finally on the right track again and it‚Äôs so tempting,False,True

That‚Äôs what I‚Äôm doing right now. Had my first day last week. It‚Äôs so fucking painful and embarrassing and humbling to be needing treatment again but I‚Äôm glad I got the ball rolling before I hit the point where I don‚Äôt see an issue with my behaviors. I mean, I‚Äôve definitely hit that point but now I‚Äôve got a treatment team to remind me that this is not normal.",False,False

Once you have had a mental illness you are predisposed to developing that illness again or other similar illnesses in the future. You can focus on keeping up your mental health to reduce the odds of a relapse, but there will always be at least a margianally tiny chance it happens if you slip up. It the same thing with cancer sorta. They can treat it, but once you've had cancer you're more likely to get cancer again.

I had two lengthy periods of remission, one of them almost 10 years and it presented as recovery but since I relapsed I guess remission would be a more fitting description for it.

You'll encounter tons of setbacks.   Sometimes it'll feel like 2 steps forward, 1 step back. But just remember that if you continue that pace, you'll always be one step ahead -- one step closer to recovery.   I still struggle all the time but trust me -- and I know this sounds so cliche -- but it gets easier with time as you begin to gain more control over your thoughts and actions.   It'll take awhile but you can make it: Just keep one foot in front of the other.",False,False

They can get smaller or disappear for a time, but they will never really go away and if you don't stay on top of things you'll eventually get a storm. Alcoholism and drug addiction runs in my family as well so I've noticed they're pretty similar to an ED: you just have to keep fighting the small part of your brain that tells you to engage in those behaviors constantly so relapses are to be expected. Therapy can help make those relapses rarer, but even so no one can promise you a magical solution.",False,False
