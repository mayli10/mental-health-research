Every move for us is calculated, every calorie, every mile. Calculated. For people who donâ€™t have eating disorders, they donâ€™t know how people with eating disorders work. They think you eat and youâ€™re okay. Even if itâ€™s one apple and miracle noodles for the full day, youâ€™re okay. They see it if you eat anything youâ€™re fine, even if youâ€™re at a deficit with working out. Some people call full blown eating disorders if youâ€™re in the hospital or eating cotton balls to fill full, which is far from true. Your eating disorder is very valid, but people from the outside looking in, who donâ€™t overly focus on calories, just donâ€™t understand whatâ€™s its like.",False,False
