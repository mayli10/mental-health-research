Also MAJOR TW for the last chapter. It's essentially ""when to give up on treatment and let the person die"" and all I could think when I was reading it was ""when am I going to be sick enough for people to give up on me?"".  Good luck reading it. I hope you get more out of it than I did!",False,True

It's so easy to feel alone in this battle! I just wanted to put word out there about this book because I've seen a lot of people gave about it and the reviews are amazing... but I thought people should know that it may not be an appropriate read at all.,False,True

The reading of that book was made extra hard because it's advertised as this amazing thing that validates people with EDs of all sizes and encourages them to get help. But then it didn't really do that? Do not recommend.",False,True

The only differences detected between the diagnostic groups were higher premorbid weight and weight at admission in AAN, and in AN a lower systolic blood pressure nadir during hospitalisation. Notably, the duration of weight loss and amount of weight loss were found to be similar in the two diagnostic groups. Finally, the very important question of the contribution of weight loss compared to underweight as predictors of clinical complications is addressed. The critical finding was that weight loss, not underweight, predicted the potentially life-threatening complications of sinus bradycardia and lower pulse rate nadir.   whoever wrote that book sounds like they're still going off the old assumption that being underweight = the Cause of All Problems. but they're just wrong and the research doesn't support them.",False,False

The book has a lot of good aspects, but I’m like 3/4 of the way through and though she says ED can impact people of all sizes, most of the time she’s just talking about severely underweight or underweight people. There are a lot of people of normal and overweight with an ED and they’re often neglected in literature. I am not finished yet, and I do see an upcoming chapter about ED in “larger bodies”, so maybe that will be more revealing. Though it’s got a section with BED, so I hope it’s not just focusing on BED for larger bodied people. Restriction in normal and overweight people is so so neglected in literature and research.   The author is knowledgeable though and I do think the book is a great resource for understanding the basics of the ED mindset. Just wish is focused more on other body types part from just saying it’s a thing. But as I said, not finished yet, may eat my words soon lol.   Anyway, that’s my rant don’t lmao.",False,False
