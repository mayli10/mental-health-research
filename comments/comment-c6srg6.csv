I’ve had a few problems w joints wanting to pop out of place (mostly my hips and damn can that be a pain). Plus I don’t have any family history.   It’s just really hard. Like everyone’s like “oh you’re only 20, wait till you’re 40” and then it’s just a massive pain olympics.   And then doctors just act like I’m seeking pain pills/don’t take me seriously.",False,True

I still don't really know why, there's a couple theories that stressful life events or trauma can ""trigger"" EDS and other similar syndromes later in life when they may not have been that apparent before, so I think it's worth going to your doctor about.",False,False
