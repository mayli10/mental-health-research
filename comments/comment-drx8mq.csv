No vomiting involved unless you get into subtypes. There is bulimia, which is binging (eating a ton of food) and purging (vomiting the binge), or just straight purging (vomiting food without it requiring a binge).   In the end, you can never know unless she tells you herself. It’s her issue and hers to talk about. And some people *do* have digestive issues that’ll cause a lot of vomiting. Either way, it is a *very* personal issue, and even if the way she talks about it seems “open” to you- know that it’s a tactic some use to make it more “casual”. Like it’s no big deal if they act like it’s no big deal.   No-one here can tell you what she may or may not have, and you cannot make such a diagnosis, either. If you are concerned, do your research on this behavior and look up ways to talk to her about it. Don’t slap a label on her- don’t just walk up and say “hey, are you bulimic?” Because I guarantee that’s going to wreck any sort of discussion immediately. Invite her to open up and know she probably won’t. Again. It’s her and her life.",False,False
