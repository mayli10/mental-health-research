The cashiers at the store I usually go probably know I have an eating disorder: There's no way they don't remember me because I go there almost everyday, usually just buying coffee, diet coke or sugar free energy drink, and sometimes things like apples or rice cakes. And then comes the day I decide to binge and buy more food than during the past two weeks. I also once almost fainted in that store. I don't really care what they think as long as they don't comment my groceries",False,False

And 2) As much as I think I'm fat, I know I'm not obese. I assume any cashier is going to look at my haul, then me, and assume that there is no way I'm going to eat *all* of that myself.   But that being said, 3) it really doesn't matter. I used to get really nervous buying binge food for fear of being judged as fat. But I've done it enough times to really not give a fuck anymore. I guess I care a little more about other customers seeing all my food when I check out, but again, I still stopped caring somehow.   I suppose I would get a little more uncomfortable in your position though. I'm sorry, OP.",False,False
