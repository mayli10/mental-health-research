I feel like it’s such a big trend now but it just doesn’t work for me. I feel like I get so little food cause fat is high in calories and also I love carbs (healthy and unhealthy) it was just so hard to not eat bananas(fruit in general tbh) sweet potato and oatmeal which I love and I know they are fairly healthy. Also I don’t get how keto people don’t believe in CICO like how do you lose weight without it.,False,False

The wording comes across as condescending and chiding. Most, or a lot of us, are obsessed with food and that includes weight loss diets so it makes sense to post in an ED sub to get opinions on a certain diet. Especially when it's a diet that seems to be everywhere like keto is. Also OP has said that they found going keto helped their ED and other mental health issues.  &amp;#x200B;  I think the post is good and it's opened up an interesting discussion about the relationship between people with EDs and diets. As someone who has been living with an ED/poor body image &amp; a disordered relationship with food for nearly a decade I've tried a bunch of different diets, both popular and fad. In some ways I think having my ED for so long has been good because it's kind of taught me about the problems with the different popular diets. Obviously EDs are bad overall and I miss when I could just eat something without thinking about, or even knowing, the calorie content and worrying about how it will effect my weigh. But it's taught me a lot about what the nutrition of a balanced diet looks like and why it's important to actively pursue a balanced diet. A big lesson was that no matter how healthy the foods you choose are, if you're restricting then you're going to be deficient in pretty much all vitamins and minerals. Seems like a simple lesson but it took a long time for me to get that into my ED brain haha",False,False

The former lead clinical dietitian from Remuda Ranch is the one who said verbatim in a lecture that ""dieting is a form of disordered eating because its a disruption in a normal eating pattern."" Trust me, it shocked me too. I know this is going to be met with criticism, but the lead clinical dietitian at Rosewood Ranch said the same thing. That's just one reference I have that outlines disordered eating in a very generalized framework.   This study defines disordered eating as meeting at least one of the following classifications: Drive for Thinness score⩾15 girls and ⩾10 boys  a. Body Dissatisfaction score⩾14 girls and ⩾10 boys b. Body mass index &lt;17.9 kg/m2 girls and &lt;17.5 kg/m2 boys c. Trying to lose weight now d. Tried to lose weight before ⩾3 times e. Pathogenic weight control methods: use of diet pills, laxatives, diuretics or vomiting to reduce weight f. Self-reported menstrual dysfunction; primary amenorrhea or secondary amenorrhea  Citation: Martinsen, M., Bratland-Sanda, S., Eriksson, A. K., &amp; Sundgot-Borgen, J. (2010). Dieting to win or to be thin? A study of dieting and disordered eating among adolescent elite athletes and non-athlete controls. British Journal of Sports Medicine, 44(1), 70-76. (I can provide a PDF if you are curious and want to read it and don't have access)  This validation study states: Eating disorders can be defined as psychiatric illnesses characterized by eating and body image disturbances (American Psychiatric Association, 1994). Disordered eating behaviors and attitudes make up part of the eating disorder continuum. Abnormal eating attitudes include thinking obsessively about food and calories, becoming angry when hungry, being unable to select what to eat, seeking food to compensate for psychological problems, eating until feeling sick, and presenting unreal myths and beliefs about eating and weight (American Dietetic Association, 2006).

I understand that it can be a slippery slope to determine that dieting is a disordered eating behavior, but it is the way it is approached clinically and in a research setting. My grad research is about intuitive eating with a preceptor whose specialty is in both chronic dieting and intuitive eating, so I have a lot of references available if you'd like any.",False,False

I do think that keto can have negative side effects. People should absolutely be consulting a physician prior to trying the diet. Not everyone can digest that much fat safely/effectively.   I also just don't think keto is sustainable long term.
