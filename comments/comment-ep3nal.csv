It's only when I'm only at low weight or fasting, then the chest pain starts and shortness of breath and I wonder if my heart will give out. It can be scary, it such a shit feeling because you want to talk to someone but don't want them taking you to hospital.its a hard situation.",False,False

And because unless doctors DO think you have an ED, they seem to think only obese people have heart issues.   Just. This is going to sound super, like, ""stfu, there is no social downside to being thin,"" but I honestly worry all the time that I have health problems in general that will go unnoticed because doctors automatically think thin young people are fine. (I mean beyond being underweight itself, which they do yell at me about.)",False,False

By no means am I an athlete, but I work out enough that if I went to a real doctor they'd say it's just because I exercise. Sorry but my weekend jogs aren't enough to get my HR down to 37 at work.   Anyway, I'm female, so even if it's not ""just anxiety"" they'll tell me it's just anxiety even if I'm literally having an actual heart attack, so I'm going to save my money and not go.

Your individual situation is something only a doctor can asses though. Is there someone who can go with you to help you walk through the fear?   My GP’s office has a triage line where I can talk to a nurse about my symptoms and they’ll make a recommendation on whether/what action is indicated. When I’m stuck on ‘am I being overdramatic’, calling that line first has definitely helped me feel better about going in. Best wishes &lt;3",False,False
