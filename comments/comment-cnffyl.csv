A while back I was trying to get rid of some of my ""restricting"" clothes and then I dropped weight. I gave away these beautiful, unique, vintage denim shorts and I'll never get them back.

Every time I go to throw something out I either gain a few sizes or drop a few sizes and have to keep it. I own way too many clothes and itâ€™s terrible because itâ€™s all fast fashion stuff and thatâ€™s so bad for the environment. If I was just stable then Iâ€™d be able to buy more expensive sustainable stuff because I wouldnâ€™t be zigzagging between sizes so much.,False,False

My closet can be described as ""clothes I feel comfortable wearing bc they hide my body"" vs ""clothes that are hot that I can only wear on very specific days according to my weight, level of bloat, and anxiety"" :/ just recently had my mom buy me very expensive clothes I can't even wear until at least a month or two goes by bc I've been in a binge cycle this summer oof",False,False
