Maybe you can make it the rest of the month or add 5 days into Dec to make up for it. 5 days is better than no days. I know it probably feels like you let yourself down but slip ups are a chance to learn from your mistakes. Are you aware of what caused it? Did you exhaust all coping skills? What could you have done to prevent that b/p? Etc. I’m sorry I know how shitty it feels to b/p after doing so well. I hope you feel better soon and that you’re able to feel proud of those 5 days because they’re still an accomplishment,False,False
