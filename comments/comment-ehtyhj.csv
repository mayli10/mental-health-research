I don’t write how much or the calories I just write the type of food. If I ate too much or I feel bad about it I put a frown next to that food. Sometimes I weigh my food out &amp; count the calories in my head/use a counter app but I never actually track them. Or I haven’t started yet anyways... just the fact that I can set up my journal with spaces for food in breakfast, lunch, snack, &amp; dinner motivates me to check them off like a to do list. I only get to check each one off for the day if I skip the meal. I only consider the day successful if I check off everything except dinner.",False,False

But for sure I’ve had more of a problem with low restricting. I’ve maintained for 8 months or so, and I’m back on my low restrict bullshit again after re-downloading my calorie counter again. I go through phases mainly of maintaining and low restricting with the occasional binge. But everyone is different. If you count calories I hope you can do so healthily, it can help. I literally almost cried because I pre-logged my meal before eating at a restaurant and they didn’t have what I planned so I had to eat something with ~200 extra calories. Like my eyes watered up and I almost had to leave, which is embarrassing and ridiculous. And today I almost caused a scene on accident by nearly freaking out when my friend threw away a pizza box before I could accurately log the calories. It’s garbage lmao",False,False
