I‚Äôve never had a full blown ED (just somewhat disordered and self-destructive eating habits) but my partner is so good about stuff. Like it‚Äôs clear this is taking a toll on him, and I‚Äôm trying to be better about it, but he‚Äôs great at not pushing me to eat and just trying to encourage me to have satisfying and healthy things so that at least I‚Äôll be less hungry if I restrict. He was also surprisingly good when he found out I‚Äôd been purging. I am so grateful that he knows how to deal with this better than most.",False,False
