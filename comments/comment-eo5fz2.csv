I'm definitely interested in the oatmeal. I can just bring my own cup and heat it up with the hot water at work *right* before I get in the car.   I fucking love tuna so I'll have to stock up on those. I stayed away because they're expensive for the size, but if I gotta toss a little money at it to make this weight loss happen I'm all over it.   PS Where do you work, lol? How are you surrounded by these women?",False,True

Those Starkist pouches of tuna, chicken, or salmon come in a variety of flavors like lemon&amp;garlic, buffalo, sweet and spicy, and everyone at my old job would bring stacks of those for the week and keep spare pouches in their purses &amp; cars! They’re usually $1 a pouch and typically low calorie and high protein, great for weight loss. They’re great on their own. Also, keep a big bag of those thin pretzel crackers in your car or keep one somewhere at work for yourself I forgot the name of them but they go well with the portable pouch foods like the tuna and chicken etc - this is shockingly such a filing meal you’ll be surprised that you’re actually stuffed it’s crazy. Also you can bring a box of oatmeal or just oatmeal packets and keep them at work - oatmeal is dense and keeps you full while being very nutritious - all my coworkers did this everyday. Just use a mug, cup or bowl, mix it with water and microwave then bam. If you want to utilize the fridge, bring those hummus and cracker snacking pouches and store them for yourself. Or bring yogurts, carrot or celery sticks, fruit, etc. It’s good to keep things like that for yourself at work so you don’t starve and your imagination goes wild and starts craving bad shit. All my coworkers did this and they were all skinny and looked like legit models and at this time I was at my heaviest cause instead of bringing in this stuff like they were doing I would just always get fast food on the way to each job cause I was always either in my car or at work and now at my lowest I realize that I did it to myself! I would starve at work all day then go and give in to stupid cravings that ultimately gave me so many health issues and obesity. Takes a little pre-planning and pre-thought and going to the store to pick out portable or easy to throw together options but it’s so much healthier than doing what every other person does and getting greasy burgers every single day just cause it’s convenient.",False,False

I don't get too full on them but really what I need is just something to taste and even s little bit of food because I had a head ache and jaw tension/ache when I restrict and that little bit of sugar and yumminess really picks me back up.,False,False
