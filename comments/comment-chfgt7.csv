I think it’s more common that people admit.   My mom also had an eating disorder and kind of taught me mine. She taught me to purge when I was 7-8. She also ignored most of the bad behaviors other than a few times she yelled at he for vomiting too loudly. She also was against me getting therapy or any treatment because I’d ruin my life by getting myself pegged as a nutcase in my permanent record (I think she really thinks this is a thing). I have mommy issues lol.,False,False

I mean, EDs don't really up spring out of nowhere, and the mental disorders that feed it are a combination of genetics and environmental stressors. It sounds like your mom developed disordered eating habits too.",False,False
