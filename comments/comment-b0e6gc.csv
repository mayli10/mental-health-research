I've done my fair share of them. Hell, once I'm done binging today, this is literally my exact plan until next Wednesday. The only exception is that I'm being lenient enough on myself to do a liquid fast after a day or so with a couple hundred liquid calories.  But don't be me, man. Because chances are that *as soon* as I start this fast, I'll binge the next day. Then fast the next. Then binge again. And so on, and so on until I get stuck in the same binge/starve cycle I've been trying to get out of since New Years (seriously, holidays can go fuck themselves with a stick). Yeah, maybe that won't happen. Truth be told, that's why I'm planning a liquid fast so that the coffee with unsweetened almond milk, the tea with sugar free cream and the no sugar added hot chocolate will (hopefully) stave off my cravings and leave me satiated enough to drift back into low restriction when I'm done. But it's all russian roulette. I *may* or may not have a bit of a gambling habit but even *I* know I'm treading on very thin ice with this one.  The best thing you could do today is to aim to eat less than that of what you ate yesterday- but that doesn't mean nothing. Maybe try your hand at high restriction for a few days, maybe a week and then see how you feel. I know it's easier said than done but, you got to admit, it makes sense.  I feel like such a self contradicting hypocrite at the moment, saying all this shit lol so, I mean, if you still want to fast then I literally can't blame you because I'm doing the same thing. I wish you luck. And if you've got any left to spare then please share some so my dumbass doesn't either faint in the shower or eat everything in my fridge in a couple days lmao.",False,False
