But this time it was like she was buffering or something. Then when I told her I hadn't eaten since Saturday she laughed a little as if I was joking...",False,True

Maybe theyâ€™re just not trained well enough about ED to handle it (though if thatâ€™s the case it shouldâ€™ve been top priority for them to get you in touch with someone who does know about ED). Also are they usually very expressive? Because I have a similar issue where itâ€™s not that I donâ€™t care I just dint really show much expression idk doesnâ€™t come naturally and itâ€™s not usually worth the effort to fake it/intentionally do it,False,False
