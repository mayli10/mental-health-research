Its really hard on your body and produces a similar pain/stress response as injury. It's a habit I had to get really conscious of, and for a while I was afraid to eat ANYTHING when I was in that kind of state because I knew it would lead to purging, regardless of amount.",False,False

I found out at one point that the act of purging felt really relaxing afterward and I couldn't really explain why. I kind of ended up categorizing it with cutting/sh. I felt bad, would purge, and would feel better in the same kind of way as sh.",False,False

I’ve been dealing w all different Ed’s the last 13-14 years. I’m in therapy again, for an unrelated reason, but I’ve seen this therapist in the past and she’s well aware of my ED. I just feel like since I don’t fit any ED textbook it’s just not taken seriously",False,True

My psychiatrists never knew what to really label me as and I got stuck with the bulimia diagnosis based on the fact I purged several times a day, but like you I rarely ever binged and a binge to me was anything over my meagre daily calorie allowance. Purging disorder is as valid as any other eating disorder. Don't feel discouraged to seek help (if you're at the stage where you want help, otherwise hello welcome to hell with the rest of us!) Just because your potential ED is uncommon.",False,False
