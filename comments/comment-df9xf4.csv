I'm scared to turn to help (like telling my parents or siblings), because calorie restricting is the only surefire way I know to look the way I want and I know they are going to want me to just eat more.   Also therapy costs money that I don't have. So it seems I'm left to my own devices to overcome this on my own.",False,True

Don’t start. Don’t ever start. It fucks you up. It chips away at your teeth and &amp; ruins your voice and your throat. If you can get help, please do. Don’t be like me.",False,False
