And I don’t always check and I would NOT have checked a donut either because it’s only a donut. I would’ve assumed it was fine as well. The main reason I do it is learning to slow because I’m always on to the next task before being halfway through with the first.  Then I end up either dropping everything on the ground or dropping one important thing and breaking it. I tend to be carrying a million items. It’s weird, I’ll justify spending money on groceries but not in gym classes. And that’s crazy because I feel like you always get better results in a group because the drive to keep up is so strong. 🧡🧡",False,False

Next time I know to double check that my order is correct before leaving the store...sounds like common knowledge but post-workout me was just going through the motions, haha. And one of the reasons I love Orange Theory so much is that every class, someone next to me is absolutely KILLIN it and it inspires me to run faster, row harder, etc. We get through it together :)",False,True

I suppose you could say it’s turning you into a child, but not in my opinion. It’s your donut, smash it if you want to, right? I’d like to think that restricting gives one a shorter acceptance rate of unacceptable things. *Poor listening skills*—Did you not clearly say blueberry glazed cake donut? *Inability to perform a single task*—You asked for one donut, in a box, to-go, not something requiring a little more focus like a dozen assorted donuts with a side of thirty bagels with lox and cream cheese. *Failure to meet expectations*—we expect to be given what we paid for, not a surprise. Paying for goods and services is one of the times in life where it actually IS reasonable to have expectations and rigid standards. Donuts are one of my major important foods if I am willing to indulge and I do not accept substitutions. If I open the box and half are not what I asked for I get a refund on the whole thing. Any food actually. If I order steak nachos and you give me chicken, all the smiles in the world aren’t gonna get me out the door with those fuckin chicken nachos. Nah—you’re giving me my money for the  food that I was willing to interrupt my restricting for. I would have been pissed too, ESPECIALLY if all I ordered was one thing. Sometimes I worry that food workers will be insulted by me refusing to leave the register until I check my order but OH WELL, mistakes happen and my fuse is too short for that 😬😬😬😬🤣 Also, I live close enough to two Orange Theory places that I now feel insecure after reading your post. I think “man, If they can do it, surely I can too.” Thank you for the inspiration! 🙏😊 LOL. Seriously, sorry that happened. I would have cried too and HAVE cried over wrong orders.",False,False
