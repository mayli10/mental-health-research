I know you might just be curious about people’s experiences and didn’t even think about this as “tiPz n tRiCkz” but others might take it as that depending on people’s responses. I think this is up to your judgement and the mods’ judgement but if you think it’s fine then at the very least could you add a trigger warning because people can be very sensitive to these topics. I’m sure you want the best for everyone here as well so I’m just offering my perspective and maybe you could possibly reconsider this post. Thanks! c:,False,False
