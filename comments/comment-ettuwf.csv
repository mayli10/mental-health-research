With that being said, to be honest I think this would unfortunately be an issue regardless of his size. If he were overweight, the eating disorder would use that as """"motivation"""" to keep you in the disordered behaviour. If he were underweight, the eating disorder would want you to be MORE underweight than him. If he were a healthy weight and chubby, then the disorder would compare your curves and want you to be less curvy.  As he's a healthy weight and skinny, the eating disorder is using that to compare your sizes/bodies and it's trying to manipulate you back into losing rapid weight. THIS IS NOT YOU. THIS DOES NOT MEAN THAT HE DESERVES BETTER OR THAT YOU ARE A MONSTER. This is a disorder that THRIVES on manipulation and will do anything it can in order to get you to give yourself up to it.   Each day, remind yourself VERBALLY at least once that you deserve him. Sounds cheesy as fuck, I know, but I mean it. Say ""I deserve him"" at least once a day, especially if you notice the ED-related triggered thoughts acting up more than usual. This can help to slowly change your thinking and build resistance to the ED.",False,False
