I don’t know if that helps at all, but I think it’s important to at least try to separate what is from what others think. Whether you gain weight or lose it, you’re still the same exact person. Fuck him for saying that shit, though.  And also, I started dating my last partner at a really low weight, gained some and he was really pleased, lost it all again and he dumped my stupid ass.  Your weight isn’t the defining aspect of your relationship, and things can go well or poorly regardless.",False,False

To be devil's advocate I guess, I'm sure he regretted it right after it came out of his mouth. Maybe you guys should take a break so you can have some time away from his eyes and judgements.",False,False

If it's not too personal -- did you start seeing him at a somewhat lowish weight?  I've noticed any guys I've gotten involved with during my low weights tended to have that body type implanted in their minds as the ultimate ideal (even if you look like an unhealthy prepubescent girl. Rant.)     Anyway, I don't blame you for not trusting him -- unless he's ""matured"" over the years to have more realistic tastes (ie. finding ""womanly"" bodies more attractive than whatever underweight porn models he grew up thinking were the best).",False,False
