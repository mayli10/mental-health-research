We once did our blood pressure and heart rates in class and it was semianonymous (like anyone seeing you write it on the board would know but that’s it) and it was a bit embarrassed by my low heart rate.,False,True

Wow that’s really personal to share in class :o I had to share my height once but that was the closest thing, and it was anonymous. Were you guys doing it anonymously?",False,True

It would be cool to see if there was any glycemic index rise with that.,False,False

I hope you can still participate and enjoy yourself too.  That reminds me last year in physics class where we had to measure our energy input and output but we had to all write our weights on a sheet and tell them to the class when we shared our results.   I almost started crying and I panicked big time.,False,False

As for popcorn, I think not being able to physically eat it is rare but I’m sure if I or someone wanted to not participate we could ask but I just don’t want to bring the attention to myself. :/",False,True
