If we low ball things and say your calories needs for the day are 1800, there's no way you could've gained two pounds after having 2000 calories. It's water weight and it will go away.

Potatoes and carrots work for me very well, maybe add nuts and seeds or dried tomatoes/olives for more protein/nicer colours/interesting taste.  Alternatively try baking smaller loaves (but I am pretty sure that occurred to you already) or put half of the loaf to the freezer straight away.  Otherwise I feel you, I love bread and baking and fresh bread is so delicious. I have some recipe that gives me two big loaves, ~1500cal/each, which isn't so bad.",False,False
