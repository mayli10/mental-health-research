Thank you ❤️  I'm going to talk to my dietitian and therapist about it for sure. My OCD works like this, though: there's a list of numbers that are ""good"" and a list of numbers that are ""bad"". It's pretty complicated beyond that, but long story short I'm at (calorie number warning!) &gt;!1700!&lt; kcal a day. The next ""good"" number up is &gt;!2000!&lt; which is over my TDEE and I am definitely not ready to gain.   I'm thinking about maybe doing an ""over maintenance"" day once or twice a week where I eat that next number up and the rest of the days stick with my current number. That way I'll be eating more on average but I can still have it in numbers that don't freak me out. Obviously, this plan scares me a little bit, but upping my intake always does. Like I said, I'm going to talk to my dietitian and my therapist and see what they think.",False,True

OCD/ED brain can fuck off with that shit.   My ED got very entrenched with the numbers, too. The loophole with my asshole OCD brain though is that I'm a bit of a perfectionist people-pleaser and getting new higher numbers in gradual increments from my doctor helped push the side of my brain that wants to meet expectations and succeed at an assignment, as it were, slowly past the original number fixation. A short-term measure, but it had me much better poised for actual ED treatment when I got there.  Any possibility of gaming your way past those numbers with some outside help and telling the ED to shove it?",False,False
