But from what I do remember, we came up with a meal plan using “exchanges” (for instance, I think I was expected to aim for 9 starch “units”, 3 veg, 3 or 4 fruit, and I can’t remember how many fat/dairy/protein exchanges). Each unit was essentially a standard serving size (like a slice of bread= 1 starch, an apple= 1 fruit, etc). I think the point was to shift the focus off of calories and on to an appropriate and balanced diet.  I saw her once a week for six months or so. I’d be weighed at the start of each appointment (she let me decide whether I wanted to know my weight or not; I always chose to face the scale which was probably not a great choice tbh). Then we’d sit in her office and go over my food journal from the past week, she’d give me some suggestions for trying to meet the exchanges I was having a hard time with (I avoided fats like the plague), suggested/encouraged some variety since I basically ate the same exact things every single day. We also talked about nutrition in general, like which foods were good sources of various vitamins and minerals and why those nutrients are important. And each appointment was also like a mini therapy session— we’d discuss whatever was going on in my life and the effect on my eating.  I was required to see a physician for blood work on a regular basis and was also required to see a therapist, but my dietician was provided by my university so that may be why those requirements were in place. I know I got my blood pressure, HR, and temperature taken often as well and I think that was done by the dietician but it may have been just when I went in for lab work. Can’t quite remember for sure.",False,False
