I’m never sure if I’m looking at other women’s bodies because I’m checking them out or because I’m analyzing and comparing myself. Maybe just both.",False,False

It’s beyond gross, but I fixate on every single girl I see and try to work out their weight compared to mine.   Before I moved here the majority of people i’d see in public were overweight or straddling the line - which made it easier to not make, idk, just existing in the world into some kind of competition. Now that I’m in college town almost everybody looks to be skinnier, prettier, and in better shape than I am. And I have no fucking clue how much of it is my warped perception and how much is reality, but holy heck do I wish that I could stop caring about it either way.",False,False
