It was a rough week but I’m doing better. I’m going to look into cheaper treatment options, but it’s complicated in the US and I haven’t had good experiences trying to get help in the past....  I did open up to my boyfriend more about my ED and how I feel in general, and he’s been extremely supportive, which is a really nice change of pace lol!! I’m definitely feeling more hopeful.",False,True

You've been struggling with this for a very long time, and it's going to take time to heal.  I'm not from the US, so I don't really know much about how things work there, but would talking to a priest be an option? Where I'm from, they can offer support conversations even if you're not religious and they don't charge. Or maybe reach out to a help group and see if they can help you find some kind free or affordable treatment? You don't necessarily need to want help, I think most of us are ambivalent at best.  People do get better. It doesn't have to be like this forever. I'm really glad to hear that you have good support from your boyfriend, but does he realize just how much you're struggling at the moment?",False,False
