I've noticed a few posts of yours that ask for weight loss tips, and I'm sorry to hear you struggling but this sort of discussion is not allowed here. I've removed the other posts of yours, but this is a warning that similar posts like this in the future may warrant a ban. Thanks for understanding",True,False

A safe rate of loss is \~1 lbs a week, unless you're larger or are only cutting weight for quite a short time.   Not to mention that the faster you lose, the worse your rebound hunger will be.... even people who lose a healthy amount via healthy methods have a harder time over the first few months/year of maintaining the loss the faster they go.   Also, if you struggle with binging, the general conventional wisdom (though to be clear, I'm not a psychologist) is to address the binging first, before making deliberate weight loss attempts. Treat the problem before its symptoms.   However, good news for you: Adderal will likely help a bit with the binging/with losing weight when you are ready. Stimulant meds are known to suppress appetite.",False,False

Only real tip i have is to regularly exercise and eat relatively healthy but that’s really cliche isn’t it? And way easier said than done. I hope you overcome your binging problem healthily and take care of yourself &lt;3",False,False
