It’s so sweet to see their relationship progress. Plus It seemed like Ellen didn’t want/need a boy to “save” her either, that’s just how Luke sees himself (as the savior), and it’s somewhat understandable given that his crush is so naive and frail.",False,False

Like no, I didn't have a childhood trauma I'm just an asexual obsessive little shit with digestition troubles. Though I am a very basic white girl that drinks too much coffee. ",False,False

Although I think the acting was good, the whole relationship between Ellen and the British dude was so forced and CRINGE. He was so manipulative. Like when he forced Ellen to eat the chocolate candy in the living room (for his own fucked-up sexual pleasure) when she was clearly uncomfortable. I mean, wtf was wrong with him? I felt like I was watching some form of assault take place.  I couldn't believe he even guilt-tripped Ellen to stay at the clinic near the end of the movie. Overall, this dude Luke was a selfish and odd character.  I like the representation of characters with different types of EDs, but all of the black characters were stereotypically fat and sassy, haven't seen that before... As a black person with an ED I was kinda annoyed bc I had higher hopes for a newer movie. Not saying that everything has to be diverse, I just wanted to see one unique/individual black/asian/hispanic character.  The media said this film glamorized EDs and I somewhat agree. The way they portrayed treatment was  unrealistic. Like one character was eating spoonfuls of peanut butter for dinner. You can't just chose what and when to eat when you're in an inpatient center.   Also watching Lily Collins being so thin and beautiful (IMO) was very triggering for me.  Anyway a much better film I highly recommend is Feed. ",False,False

Just kind of fucked up and tense and weird? Surprisingly realistic lol  But on the other hand I HATED the stupid fucking cliche of the boy trying to fix her and she regains her will to live blah blah blah all she really needed was a man to love her!!1! bullshit. Or if not that then it was the handsome brilliant doctor who fixed her.  The whole movie really relied on cliches like that and anorexia stereotypes and kind of glamourized it in my opinion. It's hard to make a movie about eating disorders, I know, but dear god can we stop with this constant narrative of pretty white girl starves herself (but doesn't purge, because that's not attractive) and then someone (usually a man) comes along and miraculously fixes her.",False,False
