I know it seems like the biggest deal right now, but in the grand scheme of a good life, prom is just a tiny blip. You’re going to look amazing regardless. Focus on having fun and making memories with your friends— the things that actually matter.   My prom was a high-key disaster and I laugh about it now. It makes for a good, albeit sad story. There have been random days that were a hundred million times more special.",False,False

If it helps even if you do get a tiny bit of bloat or water weight, it'll only be a tiny bit and not something that other people are going to notice. They won't be able to pick up on a couple of pounds of difference by sight and everyone else will be too focused on having fun themselves to pay attention. It's not even just that it's temporary, it will literally only be a minute difference if it happens at all.  Try not to let this horrible illness and your abusive ex spoil your night. You're so much better off without him, and you don't deserve to spend what should be a good night worrying about him and dealing with the shits all at once.  Congratulations on finishing high school and I hope your prom goes well x",False,False
