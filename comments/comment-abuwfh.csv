To be fair I came in with baggage besides and ED that was beyond her pay grade I think and commend her for even trying to deal with me lol. But she tried to help she really did, I was just really unstable at the time and talks of a meal plan freaked me out. It didn't work out for me, by I would still give it a go. if nothing else it taught me a lot about how to go about getting help? And I learned a few useful coping methods.",False,False

Ultimately, I dropped out of school so I had to cut off contact with them immediately, which resulted in my meds getting fucked (I was seeing a psychiatrist through school too). I wouldn't rely on them for long-term support, but they're likely able to refer you out and help you in the meantime. Often they have long waiting lists though.  My school also had support groups, but I never attended them.",False,False

I went in once saying I was dealing with suicidal thoughts and they told me to come back in two months. ,False,False

Due to some ongoing issues at home it was the only place I could receive therapy without my parents finding out. They did therapy for me for three of the four years I was there. I actually went into full remission on the ED after a year or so of ED counseling and group therapy. Was in remission for the past 4 years. ,False,False

I was able to get 6 initial sessions with a great counselor before I was referred off campus. I joined a group the counseling center held for eating and body issues. They‚Äôre in close contact with the health center so I‚Äôve been able to see a dietician and get medical checkups now and again related to ED issues.  I would encourage you to reach out to your counseling center, mine helped me so much. ",False,False

Towards the end though they did provide me with a list of therapists in the area who offered reduced fee sessions for students. Only criticism was that the list wasn‚Äôt entirely up to date; I eventually managed to find someone who could see me, but it took a long time to sort through that list and I had been just about ready to give up by the time I found my future therapist.  If your university has a similar limit, I‚Äôd ask early on about options for after you max out your sessions.  Also, I don‚Äôt want to discourage you in any way from seeking help because it really is vital to talk to someone, but I would suggest looking into your university‚Äôs policies and reading all the fine print regarding students with mental illness. My university didn‚Äôt give me a hard time, and most people I know who sought counselling at various universities had good experiences, but I do know a handful of people who were forced to take medical leave despite not being ready or able to get more intensive treatment, because their universities viewed them as a liability. It‚Äôs not likely to happen, but you should be fully aware of your university‚Äôs policy going in just to be safe.  Good luck üíï",False,False
