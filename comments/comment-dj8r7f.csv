Just right out of the bag.   I do have a good kale salad recipe: 40g kale (remove any hard stems and massage the kale), 24g spinach, 14g carrots (julienned or grated), 26g onion (chopped), 34g cucumber (I use mini cucumber), 25g strawberries (I use frozen), 14g reduced fat feta, 4g sliced almonds. For the dressing: 1tbsp lemon juice, 1 1/2tsp olive oil, 3/4tsp honey, a pinch of salt and pepper. Only 176 cal. Super good. It's become my favorite salad. Can add in some baked tofu or roasted chickpeas to bulk it up even more and add a little more protein.",False,False
