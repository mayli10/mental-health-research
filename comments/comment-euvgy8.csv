EDs are sadly competitive sometimes and it sounds like her way of making herself feel better is to put you down. I would say get away from her but if she's your roommate then maybe talk to her about not dragging your recovery down??",False,False

I can't imagine someone saying those things by accident in your sitch.,False,False

But honestly she should know not to bring up size/weight stuff at ALL, much less for the purpose of talking ab me being ~sooo much bigger~  I feel like maybe she‚Äôs struggling w recovery more than she lets on, and her way of validating herself is trying to feel skinnier in comparison to others. Sucks when the other person had an ED too tho!",False,True

No reasonable person phrases things that way. Sounds like she‚Äôs just trying to dick with you.,False,False
