I've been a healthy weight the entirety of my ED too (about 6 years).  I just started therapy about 4 months ago. I was nervous as hell and wasn't sure what to say either! But thats part of the reason the therapist/counselor is there to help guide you through it. Theres often not a straight up obvious EDs develop, its a combination of genetics and environmental factors though there may be a proverbial ""straw that broke the camels back"" in some cases (but not all). I don't feel thin enough to have an ED either but I go weekly and just talk about whats been hard for me each week, ED behaviors I've engaged in, and try to come up with ways to fight behaviors better, realize what situations are triggering...ect. Its definitely helping and if nothing else its so nice to just be able to go and talk in a judgement free space each time.   For what its worth, IMO even mentally healthy people would benefit from talking to a counselor on occasion, and I don't know a single person that's gone to counseling/therapy and regretted it. Its nerve wracking and can be difficult to set up an appointment at first but so worth it!",False,False

It's always best to seek help...even if you don't feel ""sick"" enough. You are worth it. ",False,False
