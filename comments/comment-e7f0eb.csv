If it's an ED-related professional, or a a doctor assumes you're sick or assumes you're suffering from disordered eating, they'll pay closer attention to your weight and maybe ask you to take off your heavy-looking shoes, your thick sweater, etc. If a doctor is just checking your weight for a regular checkup, then they'll probably brush over it unless it's dangerously low. Since society is fucked, people often fail to realize things stuff like this unless you give them concrete hints at the fact that you're struggling.  Please be safe.",False,False

When I was in out patient treatment for my ed I was weighed in a gown.  Neither ever took the weight of water/ food I had consumed into account (hence why people will drink like 2L of water before being weighed at the doctors),False,False
