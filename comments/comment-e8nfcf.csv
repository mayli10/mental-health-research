But... I lost like 1.5 and idk how. Then I binged the next night and I had lost another 1.3. Idk how that happened. But I’m not complaining. Maybe it won’t be as bad as you think.  Sometimes if your weight loss is slowing or you’re not losing at all, a binge might help to speed your metabolism back up.",False,False
