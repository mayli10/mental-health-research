You still *deserve* food if you've eaten beforehand. Your ED is trying to tell you otherwise; quite frankly I think you should turn round and tell that little ED voice to go fuck itself for lying to you like this. You can and should eat on the 15th, regardless of your food intake on the 14th.   The best way to lose weight is through healthy intake; that means still eating. Starving yourself is not the way to go and will only make you fixate MORE on food.  Please, try to have something. Even if it's something small, you still need and deserve to eat.",False,False
