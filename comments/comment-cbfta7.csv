So I never intentionally bulked, but the binging may have fueled a lot of my workout improvements? I recently finished a cut, but it was probably the healthiest cut I've ever done and I feel like I'm recovering from bulimia. Right now, I'm just maintaining. I don't run any particular program.

I started lifting, and couldn't even bench the fucking bar.   Today, I'm a national level powerlifter, and I deadlift more than the personal trainers at my gym who were already deadlifting when I started out. Also recently looked at side by side pictures of myself since those three years. I'm 25ish pounds heavier but honestly think I look much better. You'll be amazed at how much you can accomplish and how much better you can feel if you stick with it, even though it may feel fucking terrifying.",False,False
