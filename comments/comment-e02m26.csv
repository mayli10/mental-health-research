Some of my friends also play sports so sometimes we'll have a game or two which can be really nice.   Comedy clubs and / or bars with nusic and entertainment are also good and I usually just get a diet coke / diet soft drink then or some alcohol which has relitively few calories (like vodka or gin).",False,False

Very occasionally meeting to go for a walk on one of the trails in town. I’ve considered suggesting going to a paint-your-own pottery place, but they’re kinda pricy.   But I’m also in my 30s at this point and my relationships are definitely different now than in my teens/20s. It’s like there’s less of a need to have any objective for the get-together...other than getting together. I don’t have very many friends or even good acquaintances, but having even a few is a precious addition to life.",False,False
