It does feel like a sort of vapid thing to be focused on, but you‚Äôre right, it probably comes from just wanting the people around me to like me üòÇ",False,False

When I decided to get better I didn't immediately try to gain weight. My goal was to slowly increase my calorie intake until I became comfortable with eating more. I showed myself very slowly that eating more wouldn't be terrible. I think if I had been getting some kind of professional assistance with this that it could have actually had lasting effects. Unfortunately my motivations were related to my health and I seem to have some kind of physical illness not directly related to my weight, so when I got back to a healthy weight and didn't feel completely healthy again I sort of relapsed.",False,False

You have an image of the perfect you in your head and in a lot of ways that image is somebody who could be loved by everybody. Being kind of thoughtful means that people will love you for your personality. You also believe that being thin will make people love you for your appearance. I think overall that beauty is more important to you than thinness itself, but your ED has convinced you that they're one and the same.",False,False

I feel like we need some kind of actual exposure therapy similar to what they do for people with OCD so that we don't feel immense anxiety when we see or eat food anymore because our brain finally learns it's not dangerous and won't make us fat",False,False

I struggle a lot with vanity and perfectionism. I put a lot of effort into being a kind, thoughtful person, and I feel like that‚Äôs kind of the antithesis to this stupid obsession with being and looking and acting perfect all the time, but I can‚Äôt help it. The thoughts don‚Äôt only contradict logic, they contradict the things I like about myself, and the things that I hope are really the core of who I am, but somehow, I still get more sick pleasure out of my ED than just about anything else. I look ‚Äúbetter‚Äù than anyone else in a room full of beautiful people that I love? Unequivocal happiness. It‚Äôs the worst part of me, but a part I can‚Äôt figure out how to deny.",False,False

I had a low-calorie breakfast and I'm over here staring down a Nature Valley almond butter biscuit and seeing how long I can hold out before I give in and eat it, while also wondering how many hours of the early afternoon I could potentially spend napping so I'm not tempted to snack..
