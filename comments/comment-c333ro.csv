I am like how are you not captivated that you are eating a giant meal for 395 calories? And he is like ""it's the only meal I eat in a day...you are starving me.""   So now he will be like are you sure you gave me enough calories for dinner? Since my relapse we cannot just eat the same foods anymore. Extra work for me.",False,False

I made my husband dinner and wrote a sticky note for him with the calories, protein, and carb content. He just threw it away so I dig it out to show him again. ""No look!! That chicken is only 50!

Actually I don't eat a lot of vegetables in general; I feel they don't make me full.  * I don't really have ""fear foods"" in the same way that some people do. Like, the foods I don't like to eat are the foods that I can't find the calorie count of so I guess that counts, but they're not foods that ""scare"" me since I choose not to eat them.  * I don't think I am a perfectionist in my everyday life. I used to be one but it was too stressful for me so I stopped caring about it.  * I don't weigh myself every day.  * I can't fast. Idk I could probably do it when my ED first developed but at that time I was living with my parents and couldn't because they were watching. Maybe because it has to do with how I'm at a lower weight now but I think I'd feel too dizzy too easily to do a fast now.",False,False

Well, I don't have much of an inner narrative at all, but I do have anxiety ""tapes"" that play (like just now: ""Oh God, it's cancer, I definitely have terminal pancreatic cancer, oh my God I'm dying""). No ED tapes, though. I used to have some, when I was younger and had little perspective on my situation.  But the more hard-nosed I got, the less powerful the notion of a personified ED became. Now I can see ED thoughts are just maladaptive tapes that don't help at all. They are just depressing and discouraging and make everything worse.",False,False
