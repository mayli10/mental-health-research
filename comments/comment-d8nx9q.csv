People who want to become healthier out of self-love will feel good from eating healthy and exercise almost immediately but people who want to lose weight out of self-hate like me don't because everyday, my body doesn't look like what I deem acceptable.",False,False

I blew myself away with the realization this morning.  And again. not to say ED's are all about loosing weight. This is just focused on one aspect.,False,True

Hard limit of 500 cals/day (that always ends up with a lot of binges and purging) to lose x kilos in x weeks? Recipe for disaster. 800-1000 cals/day that includes small treats, is a little more sustainable, a little slower, but shows steady results? It was daunting before, but it works a lot better for me, and I feel more in control.",False,False

For the past 2 years I kept failing to lose the weight I put on because I was very inpatient and gave up after a couple weeks, plus I was starving cold turkey right off the bat so I felt like ass.  Then I just started eating on a deficit on a schedule that worked for me and I never feel starved, even though I‚Äôve been losing weight for the past 6 weeks already. It‚Äôs working! Really, its all patience. It sucks that I still want to go down to a really underweight bmi but ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è",False,False
