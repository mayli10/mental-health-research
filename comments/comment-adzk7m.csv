I have a deal of social anxiety and trust issues I'm working over and have been scared of getting emotionally or physically intimate since I ended things with last boyfriend. Having a low sex drive from dealing with AN and BN for the majority of the past few years has not helped.  I am so ashamed of my body; everything wrong with it is completely my fault. My face and body has so many scars from scratching and picking at it. I can't look at mirrors without cringing.  I'm dating a wonderful guy now and as much as I enjoy the time we spend together, I'm absolutely baffled by the fact that another human is attracted to me physically and mentally. I can't help but think I'm only being used for my body, I'm going to get mentally/emotionally screwed over, he thinks I'm unattractive or will if I gain weight, I'm too heavy and awkward for sex, etc. Hell, I've had similar thought processes towards many of my platonic relationships and have withered them out of anxiety.  I know, or at least I think I know that I'm being completely irrational and that my ingrained negative thought patterns are showing up. I've changed so much since mostly embracing recovery but moving forward is so uncomfortable. I have days where my attitude is ""Fuck it, who cares about all these worries, life is short"" and others (usually right after) where I'm freaking out over my decisions and feel how delicate my recovery and self respect actually is.",False,False

Completely celibate for years, now terrified of this being a pipe dream (particularly because I know two of his exes and they're smart, interesting babes), of him becoming disillusioned. I have so many very obvious SH scars and while I'm technically underweight, I'm all too aware of my many blemishes. As a self-saboteur I relate so much to your avoidance strategy, and I hope that no matter what happens, you find your way through this with as little anxiety as possible. It's so scary to feel so exposed, and I felt that comforting upswelling of recognition reading your post. ‚ù§",False,False

I was scared to have someone touch me in any kind of intimate way. I'm 25 and a virgin. The thought of being with someone sends a shiver down my spine. It scares me because I feel like I'll be alone forever and my ed has not made it any better. ,False,False

I‚Äôm so grateful that there are people out here struggling with this as well! Especially since this hits home.   I can only say that I totally relate to your story. My basic instinct is avoidance. I feel like my life is the definition of this, lol.  It makes me so angry and emotional that this fucking disordered thinking results in neglecting relationships and self care.

I‚Äôm shy and have no self esteem and don‚Äôt get out much, so it‚Äôs hard for me to meet people. And I generally attract giant man children and creepy stalker types.  Now I finally have a semi normal, actually good looking guy with an IQ above 100 and even a Big Boy Job, and I keep blowing him off. It scares me that he wants to sleep with me. It scares me because I‚Äôm ugly (I‚Äôm not that insecure about my body weight wise.  I‚Äôd like to be thinner right now but I know that to other people my size/shape is close to perfect. But I have scars and blemishes and my face is hideous and there are all these little things that no one else would probably even notice but all I can see is a million little details all add up to me being even more hideous up close). He will be so disappointed when he gets a better look at me‚Äî obviously he‚Äôs managed to overlook my ugly face in favour of my boobs, but no way will he be able to overlook the sum of all my ugly parts.  It scares me because it‚Äôs been so long since I‚Äôve been with a guy that I don‚Äôt even know what to do anymore. I feel like I‚Äôm a born again virgin, which might‚Äôve been ok if I was ten years younger but not so much at this point in my life.  It scares me because sex has always freaked me out for a variety of reasons. Part of me wants it, and part of me just wants to run and hide while it‚Äôs happening.  It scares me because intimacy=vulnerability, and I can‚Äôt have that. There is so much about myself that I don‚Äôt want anyone to know. So much that I‚Äôm ashamed or scared or embarrassed by. Can‚Äôt let my walls down. Can‚Äôt let anybody know me.  And it scares me because what‚Äôs the catch? Why is this guy who is attractive and outgoing and smart and relatively successful so interested in an ugly crazy socially stunted nobody like me? I feel like I‚Äôm back in middle school when I was the new kid in town, and I got an ‚ÄúI like you‚Äù note from a kid onthe bus. Only as it turns out, it was a prank orchestrated by him and a bunch of other kids who kept the whole thing going for a week before breaking down in fits of laughter telling me it was just a joke. I feel like this must be a joke too, because what else could it be? He‚Äôs bored and wants a laugh at my expense.  And of course there‚Äôs the 1% chance that I‚Äôm wrong, in which case I am sabotaging one of the few opportunities I‚Äôve ever had and ever will have to develop a relationship with someone who actually interests me.  So my solution is to turn off all my notifications and not check Facebook for the last two weeks because that‚Äôs my answer to everything in life: avoidance.  Sorry I hijacked your post, I‚Äôm just happy (and sorry) that there actually is someone out there who kinda sorta gets it.
