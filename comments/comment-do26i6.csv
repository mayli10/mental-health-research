In the mornings I feel like I look good and I realise I'm not as fat as I think, maybe kind of skinny actually. Then I think my brain might be fooling myself. But after a shower, or in the evenings, I feel like I'm back to being way too fat and wondering what happened. Then sometimes I take pictures of my reflection in the mirror and realise I look completely different in both the reflection and the picture and I don't know what to believe; though usually I'll assume the worst and since I usually look so fat in the picture, I'll assume that is the correct perception... I'm still not sure what is the accurate one now...",False,False

I have since high school. I feel like I could literally kill myself for how much I hate myself and the way I look and then hours later I feel like I look like a different person. Kind of pretty sometimes, until I turn my head and see a different angle, start picking apart the flaws and then the dysmorphia is back.
