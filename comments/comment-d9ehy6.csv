I'm sure I'm not alone in my messed up ED brain when I say that... I've also gotten cancer patient and skeletor, all of these are supposed to be insults but I take them as huge compliments. I HATE being told I look good, healthy, sexy, etc. It just means that my body isn't as ""sick"" as I would want it to be. Do I actually look like a holocaust survivor when I'm at my UGW? No... But, it's an easy way for people to try to roast someone with anorexia and little do they know, lots of anorexics want to be told that they look starved AF.  &amp;#x200B;  Or maybe I'm just really messed up and romanticize death manifested through one's body.

I check girls out too now. I want to be their friend, but only if they're cool.
