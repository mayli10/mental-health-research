So what do I do first thing? Go to the grocery store and buy a ton of binge food, go home put on Netflix and c/s AND b/p. Then I basically went into a coma (ridiculously deep sleep) for 8 hours.  Now I'm even MORE behind on work.  ~I have such healthy coping mechanisms~",False,False

I tried to not eat the other day when I started feeling like I wanted to because I had just gotten lunch and knew I wasnt hungry. I literally could not handle it I started pacing around and feeling so anxious like I was waiting for something to happen. I started thinking about my behavior and noticing triggers and I'm trying to figure out how to cope w this in a healthier way. Then I got even more pissed off when I realized I might be thinner if I didnt start doing this IN MIDDLE SCHOOL.,False,False
