And it sucks to be obsessed with something you hate. So I use it as an excuse to sit on my ass and get fatter lol,False,False

Struggling with severe depression too, so low key my brain is telling me it doesn‚Äôt matter if I get sick and end up dying. Although, my logic side of the brain knows that if that actually did happen again, I‚Äôd be fucking terrified and fighting for my life.  I think I still have some underlying anxiety about exercising because on the rare occasion I do exercise, I‚Äôm constantly checking my breathing and heart rate and if I‚Äôm feeling faint or not, and I can never get the amount or quality of work out I want because I always stop short.",False,False

I'm very lucky to a) be alive and b) have all my limbs, but there's been a LOT of physical damage and I'm still facing the long road back to recovery with physical therapy, etc. I know that fear - after a couple miles of hiking on a cold day, that night I had a sore throat and freaked the fuck out because I was literally terrified that I was coming down with something that would lead to another medical emergency; I told myself that if I still had a sore throat in the morning I'd go to the Dr asap, and then proceeded to have nightmares all night that I was back in the ICU, dying.  It sucks. The anxiety and PTSD from medical trauma is real.   For me... I do try to stay as healthy as possible, even with ED brain constantly pecking at me and trying to sabotage that. That means lots of vitamins, lots of water, as much sleep as I can manage.  I still obsess over calories but I know to keep my immune system healthy (which is SUCH a big deal to me now) I am a bit more generous and try to focus on protein and dark green veggies... protein, protein, protein is the mantra for healing after that kind of massive health trauma (per every single surgeon/reconstructive plastic surgeon/etc that was involved in my case).  Since you did great with walking before, how about light cardio? Walking on the treadmill at a slight incline or elliptical?  Less dangerous with fainting etc if you are restricting, but will help with cardiovascular health and all those other physical benefits that can help your long-term physical recovery.  Hang in there, and truly best of luck from someone that's gone through the sepsis/near death nightmare. ",False,False
