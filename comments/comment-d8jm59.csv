Reassure your partner that it's not their fault for not noticing, should they try blaming themself. EDs are sneaky bastards and a very isolating disorder, so they often end up staying under wraps until they've become a serious health risk.   Know your goals for recovery and what you do and don't want your partner to do/say to help you achieve those goals.   Have some basic next steps outlined that they can help you with.   Express appreciation!!",False,False
