And you cant usually fix it by changing your diet alone, either.   I am jealous of anyone with hyperthyroidism... I have hypo- and am doomed to have a slow metabolism my entire life. Meds don't seem to help at all with any of the symptoms, even though my labs are normal.   I read the other day that hypo- can lower bmr by up to 40%, which would put my estimated bmr at around 750/day... Which explains why I only seem to lose weight when I heavily restrict. I cant even lose weight 'the healthy way'.",False,False

Never lost any weight from it, but had to go inpatient from the mental health side effects of it, and can barely get out of bed most days. I'm worried the medication will slow my metabolism, but I'll be on a really low dose of it - still terrified.   Thyroid issues in the family here too. All hypo though. Sorry to hear you went through this hell too. &lt;3",False,True

Kinda jealous of your hyperthyroid - that said, I did lose a good few lbs easily once I started on meds for it and I actually had some metabolism happening.  But not eating makes me tired and cold too, just like hypothyroid, so I guess I don't feel any different lmao  I'm not sure I can blame the ED for mine - lots of thyroid issues in the family.  But you never know I guess.",False,False
