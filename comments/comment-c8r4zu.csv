I've never read anything conclusive about diet soda, and I consider it to be safe in moderation (as do many other dietitians!). You don't need to be scared of it. I can link some studies if it makes you feel better!",False,False

Other studies on other sweeteners (aspartame and acesulfame K) using nondiabetic participants with a range of weights showed that they do not trigger any notable difference in normal insulin response. If you still want to avoid sucralose then as long as you don't drink the diet coke with spenda you should be fine.",False,False
