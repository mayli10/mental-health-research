Try to find something distracting to do, sip some water or tea, maybe go for a walk to put your mind at ease over the calories and clear your mind. I find taking a shower or at least washing my hands and face makes me feel a little calmer and then listening to music distracts me. Don't weigh yourself, all you will see is the poop and water weight, it'll probs scare you even tho it is definitely not fat gain, it's literally impossible. I hope youll feel a lil better soon ðŸ’›",False,False
