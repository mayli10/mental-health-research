Like, only one piece of food, but you're breaking your fast so you can get used to the idea.   If you can get practised at that then you could work in more food, since you're breaking the fast anyway, and work your way up to the calories you want to be eating.",False,False

It doesn't help me lose weight. But fasting makes me feel more in control of food. I find it nearly impossible to moderate but I can cut out all food for more than a week. Then I just go back to old habits. I don't have any real answers but keeping your electrolytes in check will keep you from feeling (physically) like shit.",False,False
