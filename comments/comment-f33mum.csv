It's one of the primary factors, in my opinion, that keeps me sick.  This 100x.   I've been in my current city for four years and I still haven't made any friends. I'm an introvert, I truly don't mind doing a lot stuff alone, but I'm human, too, and I don't know how to form lasting relationships? So loneliness and isolation feed the eating disorder, and the eating disorder keeps me isolated. Vicious cycle.",False,False

People do NOT understand how isolating EDs are. It's one of the primary factors, in my opinion, that keeps me sick.   As a note, I consider EDs and traditional substance addiction one and the same because it's the same reward pathway in the brain. True for me, supported by research, and hard AF because you can't be sober from food.   ""&lt;EDs&gt; are a disease of loneliness we try to cure with isolation""   I heard this originally applied to depression/addiction. For me, it's incredibly applicable to EDs as well. Loneliness is just one factor, and I've found it true that all these thrive in isolation and darkness, and one of the core components to recovery I've found is forcing myself to step out into the light. One if our most basic needs as humans is community.   For me, when I am able to practice this and oppose isolation and the secrecy that goes hand-in-hand, it's becomes easier after time to  challenge and change ED/addictive behaviors if I am surrounded by people, friends, and community.   Sorry this is long, hope it helps!!!  .""",False,False
