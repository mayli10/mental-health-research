I read this yesterday and, last night, in the beginnings of a binge, I remembered this post, so I tried it.   I'm the stand in front of the fridge and hoover everything type. Leftovers, cold, fruit, condiments?? Basically anything within reach.   So I was standing there and I actually said it outloud, ""I'm going to grab three more grapes, then I'm going to go to bed."" You're right! It's like a magic trick! A for real superpower.   Thank you for this post.",False,False

Thank you so much, Iâ€™m going to try this. Itâ€™s really hard to listen to the logical side of your brain when youâ€™re in that emotional â€˜bingeâ€™ mindset. This sounds like itâ€™ll really help.",False,False

If youâ€™re interested, the brain over binge podcast really helped me in a very similar (though slightly more in depth) way, and just from reading your post it seems like it might help you too so I thought I would recommend it. If not though you can totally just ignore this, great work regardless :-)",False,False

In general I've found that allowing myself a really bad binge for maybe a couple of days and just focusing on thinking about it rationally and acknowledging it's happening gets it ""out of my system"" faster than if I just try to ignore it or force myself out of it. I'll have a couple of days of out of control eating, as opposed to a few weeks of mini binge/restrict cycles. Like you, I find it easier to regain control during a binge if I acknowledge that it's happening, continue to track my calories no matter how much I eat, etc.",False,False
