I am really happy you are in recovery and I wish you the best luck with it!  I’ve had the same issue, my usual go-to explanation now is: I dislike my life, I feel like it’s my weight making me unhappy and I feel the only way I can achieve happiness is by losing weight. So that’s the reason I struggle so much with eating normally, it’s almost like I am giving up my chance of happiness. A part of me has a really hard time imagining my life going to a better place without losing weight in the process.  Not sure if that’s how other people feel, but I thought I’d try to help.",False,False
