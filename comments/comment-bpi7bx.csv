Previously it was face-to-face and that shit sent my anxiety through the roof. I objectively understand that these folks don't see/experience hunger the same way I do, but at the same time I REALLY want to shout, ""YOU'RE NOT GOING TO DIE BECAUSE YOU'RE EATING 1200kcal/DAY, KAREN. YOU'RE GONNA BE JUST FUCKING FINE.""",False,True

I sometimes even open my car windows to get the smell out as soon as possible. I luckily usually do not have enough time between orders to get any food, though, so its easy enough to forget once I am on the next order... My main job involves community classes, and some of them are weight loss classes, and reading the descriptions is hilarious. ""Lose weight with no work and no exercise if you take this class!"" Wow so magic.",False,False

Any time my body responds to good food smells with normal hunger signals, I feel a little angry at it. Angry isn't the right word... it's more of an ""I'll fucking show you! Tell me you're hungry one more time, stomach! Yeah, fuck you!"" and then will double down on not eating.     And I currently work as a weight loss coach! Yay for jobs that are goddamn triggering because capitalism and having to pay bills and shit.",False,True

Everything smells great and I always want to go back to the restaurant after delivering and order food for myself. Ive actually done that a few times and they recognized me as the delivery driver and its embarrassing to be like ""no I'm just fat and hungry this time""",False,False
