I‚Äôm surviving. Just a bit angrier than usual. Yes, you are right, it‚Äôs exhausting because you spend so much time obsessing and it‚Äôs so tied to your self esteem and with the eating disorder it‚Äôs all so much more difficult. Self compassion is so so important. Thinking that it is temporary is too. No good clinician in their right mind will sit back and allow someone with an eating disorder to stay on a drug that causes uncontrollable, indefinite weight gain if it‚Äôs bothering the person. If they do then it‚Äôs time to go shopping for a new one. I‚Äôm seeing a therapist and it helps so much. You‚Äôll be just fine. Best of luck to you!",False,False

I can‚Äôt risk it. My ED is such a pain in the ass if I gain a ton of weight I would likely end up doing something I couldn‚Äôt take back.   I‚Äôm really sorry that happened, it sucks so bad that these drugs that can help with our mind can hurt our bodies. People without ED‚Äôs don‚Äôt seem to understand how hard this especially is. Like a normal person may be willing to deal with the gain if their mind felt that much better but there‚Äôs no way I would ever be comfortable with it. I‚Äôm much happier in crazy town to be honest. I hope you‚Äôre able to get off of them!!",False,True

At this point I‚Äôd rather deal with the debilitating anxiety and OCD than feel like I‚Äôm puffy and living in the fear that its going to keep going up. I also started drinking a lot to deal with feeling so upset about it. I‚Äôm trying to taper off of the drug tonight.   But I mean there is a slight possibility you could take it and not have any weight gain. I was a steady weight for like 8 months at 128  but then it was like boom ten more pounds in 5 months. I have stretch marks all over my hips, butts, and the tops of my thighs.",False,False

I also posted in the bipolar sub and was getting a lot of the same feedback. I thought maybe it would effect ED sufferers differently but unfortunately that doesn‚Äôt seem to be the case.   I alrdy texting me dietitian that I‚Äôm not going to be taking it. I‚Äôll fill my therapist in tmrw and well as canceling psych going forward.

I started off underweight at 100 pounds (5‚Äô4) here. And in those two years I have put on 40 pounds. I‚Äôm 140 now and it keeps going up. It‚Äôs terrifying. I never thought I‚Äôd put on so much weight. I have a thyroid problem too but it‚Äôs under control with medication. I will probably try to get off of it as soon as I can.  I took 2.5 mg with Zoloft which I‚Äôve been on for 7 years. It is likely the Abilify, but I will say it could be something else.",False,False
