It really sucks because me and my husband just got married a few months ago and moved away from our home state and now we‚Äôre discovering all these beautiful places and taking pictures and i hate every single one.:/ I‚Äôm sorry you‚Äôre going through the same thing but you‚Äôre right, we aren‚Äôt our weight gain and there is so much more to us than that.

I avoid my reflection at all costs and photo taking hell no. I saw a photo of me recently I had an absolute breakdown. I ca  definitely relate somewhat.  All I can say is the the advice the people close to me has given..  you are not your body or your weight gain..your personality is what people know and think and love about you...and this is not forever. It happens and people gain weight  I am 70 lbs above my goal weight and I hate it and I avoid...mand for my upcoming milestone bday I just booked a trip to vegas to say fuck it all I deserve to have fun for once  ..since I hate going out You are worth it.  You can do this. You will lose the weight and you can still be happy,False,False
