I only wanted to eat 1200 MAX today but I’ve gone over already. And will probably have to keep going over because I’m hungry and tired and physically weak. But I’ll be okay, and so will you. I’m struggling to recover and scared of the weight gain but we’ll be okay.",False,False

(you just need reassurance, which I understand) Honestly and from my understanding of nutrition and the body:  It will just raise your metabolism to use up all of the extra energy. You’ll only gain weight if it’s an extreme excess and you do it repeatedly for days and your metabolism can’t tackle the over abundance.  I over eat all the time but it’s coupled with IF because weight (particularly fat gain)is caused by an excess of insulin throughout the day.  Conclusion: you’re going to be fine. Just don’t do it every single day. I would just eat whatever you want but limit carbohydrates because of the insulin response. Hope that helped! :D",False,False
