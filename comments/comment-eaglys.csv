The bird shelf  is a repurposed old shelf from my rat cage. The birds are happy with whatever fat balls and seeds I throw out. And a couple of quid a month on bird food is not much to me but it's a big deal to them.,False,False

A few days of relaxing the rules doesn't matter in the grand scheme of things.  And I find watching the birds eat and interact so relaxing. I love putting out different seeds and seeing what new birds appear. It's a big return for low effort (my normal level lol).,False,False

But I just laid down with my boyfriend and he had the spidey sense that I was on a mindfuck and asked me what was up. So I explained everything and he reassured me a lot. Told me I was still just a kid and didn't have the capacity to know how bad it was, that if I was truly a bad person I wouldn't care about it now, etc. For once I actually accept what he said and agree... I could have been having a meltdown the entire day sobbing and hating myself but I'm not. Idk I just feel grateful to have him and somewhat okay with myself right now. Any other day... or if I was alone... I would be on such a self destructive bent now  And also I shared probably my deepest darkest secret with someone.
