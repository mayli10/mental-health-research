I tried dating a guy that I met when I was at my LW. He did his best to convince me that he was still attracted to me when I gained back some weight. Didn’t believe him. ,False,False

I always had excuses about not eating and he didn’t see me eat for like 3 months. He kind of asked me about it first I think. He’s as supportive as he can be I think. ,False,False

And I did the same thing, honestly- I felt something I thought could be ~real~ so I took a leap of faith and told him about it. And I definitely agree with what someone above said, that it’s good to be able to explain your particular situation in your own words, rather than letting him make assumptions about whatever it is you’re struggling with. Good luck! ❤️❤️",False,False

I'm definitely getting ahead of myself at the moment, but I do feel like there's potential for things going somewhere. I agree, I think honesty would probably be the best option",False,True

I’ve been working toward some form of recovery for a long time and I wanted to make sure I started out with him from a place of honesty so he knew going in there would be good days and bad days, and that I have weird food issues. Luckily, he was incredibly understanding, went out of his way to research my disorder and how he could best support me, and now he’s like an integral part of my recovery process. Even if you’re not actively trying to recover, I’m definitely all for honesty if you feel like this could go somewhere. ",False,False

Thank you for that! I hope it goes well for you",False,True

I am dating someone new, but it looks like we're going to end up in a relationship. I ultimately concluded that either way sucks: either I bite the bullet and tell him, or he just thinks I'm really eccentric and fatigued all the time.   Well, I don't think those are the only two options, but those are the only ones I saw in my case. I decided that being able to shape the narrative of my ED and explain it to him myself was better than letting him draw whatever conclusions he might reach on his own.",False,False

I’ve gotten pretty good at avoiding eating situations and if you do go out to eat just try to stay calm and order what makes you panic the least. And then I only tell people when I’m in a place where I actually want to. Most of my friends don’t know but a few do because I thought they would understand and be able to help, and they definitely have. I think it’s best to tell him eventually, but to wait until you’re completely comfortable and trust him to be supportive ",False,False
