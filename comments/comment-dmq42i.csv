Is it emotional? Like stress or sadness?   I think pinpointing why you turn to food is the key.   Otherwise, could it just be such intense hunger that you eat everything in a blind fit?   My advice (because I've been there) would be to tackle the situation psychologically. I know easier said than done.  But, one thing that helps me is if I feel so hungry that I can only think about food, I will make something to eat, and then cut it into half and eat only that half.   It kind of satisfies my need to eat but also gives me a feeling of some self discipline.",False,False
