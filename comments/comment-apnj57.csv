It’s like I get FOMO and think I’ll never get to eat that thing again and I all of a sudden must have this thing because I can’t pass up the opportunity... it literally makes no sense. ,False,False

I had a friend who lived down the street from me and she’d just show up at my house and be like “wanna drink and order food?” And my dumbass would always cave in! I could never resist and it gave me an excuse to get drunk and binge. We stopped being friends over some dumb shit and I was lowkey glad because now I never have to worry about random “let’s get Taco Bell” texts. Which sounds horrible lmao. ,False,False

I'd rather not draw attention to not eating. They make such a big deal of it. Sometimes I tell myself that I'm projecting and making it a bigger deal than it is but I hate being confronted.,False,False
