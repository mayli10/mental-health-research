I kick myself every single time that I put up with someone's BS for too long, and it always makes me feel worse. Not only do I get rejected at the end, but I'm angry with myself for letting people treat me badly.  If he doesn't want more and you do, all this is going to do is hurt you. Take it from someone who wasted almost all of 2018 on a guy like this, you will regret it. Please cut him off.",False,False
