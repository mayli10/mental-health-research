I almost feel lucky I had hyperemesis. If I had gained as much weight as others it would have been a lot harder. But yeah, thank you. It is hard because you know that Now your number 1 priority has to change, it can’t be the number on the scale and the voice of ED that is your main thing.   I have kind of holed up at home, though, embarrassed and can’t stand the feeling knowing people are wondering about my weight. Taking her to the park or a friends house can be so stressful.

And when we started talking, this guy knew things he had read in my file. Yet when we started talking he made me clarify “when you say eating disorder, which kind are we talking about?” Does he think I’m an overeater? Omg. Well, maybe I’m an over thinker... but he should have been more delicate... ",False,True

He broke rule #1 for treating people with EDs. Sounds to be like he's either in imbecile or an asshole.
