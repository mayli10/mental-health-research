Men's legs tend to be naturally thinner and some men can be very heavy and carry a lot of weight but still have relatively slim legs. It's why it can be so hard for women to fit into men's pants even when the pants are like 230475755 sizes bigger than them, because they hit the hips and it's like ""perish"".",False,False

My boyfriend has a pair of Leviâ€™s that looks exactly like a pair that I own.
