Anorexia for me is ""I am undeserving of love, I hate myself, I must be thin to be pretty and worthy. By not eating I am both punishing myself for not being good enough and also getting myself closer to being good enough. This painful process will make me better.""   The only times I've forced myself to vomit have been ""I slipped up and ate too much/ate something I shouldn't have. How stupid/useless of me. I must make myself vomit to compensate for this mistake.""",False,False

I've got severe depression, anxiety, OCD, and possibly undiagnosed PTSD, so my head is constantly alive and livid. Starvation is a hell of an anesthetic. I can just starve away all the bad feelings, and all it costs me is the good feelings too. Sometimes the pain of starvation feels like righteous punishment for all my shortcomings, so it also helps with my guilt and self-hate that way. Damn, I use this thing to cope with pretty much everything.",False,False

I objectively understand that it's a fucked up bullshit disordered thought, but I feel SO superior when I restrict - as in superior to those without eating disorders and superior to those who utilize purging. I over-exercise as a form of purging, but that just fuels my bullshit asshole superiority complex further. Those feelings go against the ideals and beliefs that I hold dear. But it's automatic. I feel the strongest when I'm physically at my weakest.",False,False

It’s not the only aspect but definitely a strong component. That’s why it’s so easy to relapse when I feel like I lose control over other situations like dating where you in this intense situation of vulnerability and have no control how the other person will use that power. Rejection is my number one trigger cause anorexia feels like I can at least control something in my life.,False,False

I one day just thought I was too fat and in came the restriction. The first time it got bad, I remember thinking a lot like “Oh, I can eat this if I want to, but I won’t.” Although, now a days, I think for me it’s all about wanting to be very thin again and to also have some sort of control.",False,False
