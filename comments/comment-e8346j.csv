I have to be honest, in the first 20 minutes I was asking myself why am I still watching this. I'm glad I continued watching tho. It's an underrated movie, and fuck Rotten Tomatoes. This doesnt deserve an 8%. I think the story was good although it wasnt the best. It's a very unique movie and it made me count the letter of my name lmao. Jim Carrey did a terrific job playing Walter and I was so moved by the performance I needed a way to cope, so I watched Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind right after.",False,False

Spoke to both my OCD and bipolar (my canary in the coalmine for an oncoming manic episode is seeing and obsessing over meaningful patterns and connections in *everything*). It's like a smorgasbord of MI-related compulsions - can totally see the ED link.",False,False
