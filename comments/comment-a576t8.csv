Your dad's perspective is just not how it works lol. But I'm betting you probably know that logically? But sometimes words still hurt even if they're not true.   I'm sorry your dad put you through that :c but it also seems like you've taken a lot of steps by yourself to get the treatment you need.   How old are you? Is it possible to keep seeking treatment without your dad's help? Part of life is about doing better than our parents. I'm sorry you don't have his support, but you still should do what's best for you, y'know?",False,False

I’m still very restrictive with my intake and constantly thinking of ways to lower my calories and whatnot, and always planning how to exercise. To my dad I am doing better simply by eating 3 times a day. I can easily be eating 300 a day and he would think I’m “recovered”. I need professional help but now after being told I’m not “thin enough” (at BMI 16) and that if I was really sick I wouldn’t know I was and wouldn’t be seeking help, I just want to give up and go back to how it was before ",False,True

My head has been filled with anxiety and anger and guilt. I am convinced that I’m a big liar and faker because I took the initiative and decided to get help, which is apparently what people with ED’s don’t do, according to dad. It’s hard and I want to quit and starve again...I miss the control already ",False,True

I’d say most people in recovery recognize they have a problem and actively pursue treatment.  You taking initiative in your health and wellness is not indicative of how “valid” your ED is. All it suggests, is that you’re introspective, thoughtful, and brave. And those are all traits that will benefit you in recovery and in the rest of your life. ",False,False

What he's saying is the equivalent of, ""just don't hallucinate!"" To a schizophrenic. You have a REAL illness. An illness that can cause you a lot of physical consequences, and for him to not understand how serious it is just shows how uninformed about ED he is. He sounds like someone who is going to be detrimental to your recovery. The first step of recovering is admitting you have a problem, now you're in a position that you can admit your disordered thoughts and behaviors are hurting you and can find ways to change to be your best self. Please take care of yourself, let us know if you need support!",False,False
ebkeqyh,t3_a576t8,t3_a576t8,ClassicMarketing2,1,2018-12-11 09:26:31,/r/EDAnonymous/comments/a576t8/selfinitiated_recovery_valid/ebkeqyh/,"I think it's valid  When you're engaging in the disordered behavior, you're doing it because maybe it just feels like it serves some kind of purpose somehow/because it might make you feel better somehow right? (I know this might vary for everyone, many different reasons) Like when you might hit a new goal weight and such things?   Because if it makes *you* feel better in some way, then I don't see what it has to do with others including the attention of others. It's just very hard to fake all of those things, and over a period of time too... symptoms like: being obsessed with food, feeling of satisfaction when you lose weight and an inner desire to maybe lose more (though you can fear it too), maybe a feeling of satisfaction when you can stick to eating a specific amount of calories, etc.   Spending time on an ED subreddit because you want to, being diagnosed by a doctor who diagnosed you using their knowledge of medicine and possible experience seeing others that have eating disorders, seem like some other things that point to this being valid and a problem. For anyone, the first step to recovery is that they recognize they have a problem",False,False

They just don't know how to handle it, they're not really educated on it. So please take what your dad said with a grain of salt; he's applying his own perspective, and he's not being empathetic.   Your disorder is absolutely valid. I can sit here and list off a few things from your post that ""validate"" your disorder, but I feel like that kind of misses the point. If you feel like you need help, then you do. Please follow up with the appointments you made. Your well-being is the most important thing ♥️",False,False
