I don't like having a small breakfast, so i was thinking to myself, well, then i should have a snack i can enjoy now and just skip breakfast entirely tomorrow. Except, there's nothing i... want? to eat.  I haven't purposefully ate/allowed myself to eat over my caloric limit since IDK. Ever since i started tracking, I've always been on top of calories, and if social eating throws me over, i don't get upset, i just count/""roll"" the calories onto the next day or exercise it off. The last time i over-ate of my own accord, it was habitual and before i started tracking. But even before i started tracking, i didn't gain weight from overeating because my appetite the day after would naturally adjust and be smaller. Idk. After dieting (to lose weight i didn't need to and probably can't afford to keep off long-term and stay healthy cuz i already lost my period as soon as i started dropping weight) and resuming eating at maintenance, it's just weird to realize that I'm satiated and i genuinely don't *want* food.
