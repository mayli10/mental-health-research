If I'm using the matcha powder, I shake it straight in with the almond milk a shaker bottle. It doesn't stir up super well so shaking is a must if it's going in cold. If you are using matcha green tea bags, steep it in water and make it strong and then mix with cold almond milk and ice.",False,False

All my milk teas are almond milk based. (240 mL is 30 calories and that is a LOT of liquid.   **Matcha Tea (Milky):** 35 Cals  \- 240ml unsweetened almond milk  \- stevia to taste  \- serving of matcha powder (2g) I buy [this brand](https://www.amazon.com/Carrington-Farms-Matcha-Powder-Ounce/dp/B079R1HCHS/ref=sr_1_4?crid=38YXWXEZYMZ77&amp;keywords=carrington+farms+matcha+green+tea+powder&amp;qid=1582284608&amp;sprefix=carrington+farms+matcha%2Caps%2C155&amp;sr=8-4) from walmart but you can get matcha powder nearly every grocery store.  **Thai Tea (Milky):** 35 Cals  \- Brew thai tea (I use this brand [here](https://www.amazon.com/Thai-Iced-Traditional-Restaurant-Style/dp/B000UPNK9S/ref=sr_1_15?keywords=thai+tea&amp;qid=1582284514&amp;sr=8-15) from amazon in a big ass bag and it lasts you forever. It's loose leaf)   \- Mix with 240ml unsweetened almond milk  \- Stevia to taste  I drink both of these ALL day. I haven't purchased bubble tea in ages. Saves money. Saves cals.
