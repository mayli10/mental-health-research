The guys have been up since 5am preparing racks of ribs to put on the bbq and I know I‚Äôm gonna have to eat them tonight with everyone cause they are *so* excited about these fucking ribs.   I‚Äôm watching them prepare it and holy fuck. A giant rack of ribs smothered in all these glazes and THEN my fil gets a whole-ass stick of fucking butter and like half a pound of brown sugar covered the ribs in it and wraps it all up in foil and I‚Äôm just fucking watching all this BUTTER and fat and sugar all over something I‚Äôm going to be forced to eat later on. If I don‚Äôt have any they will be so offended because it‚Äôs a cultural thing in this family but holy god. I guess I can just take one and nibble on it for ages and make up some lie about having an upset stomach so they don‚Äôt take it too personally...   It‚Äôs ridiculous that I‚Äôm sitting here hyperventilating over a few sticks of fucken meat like seriously... thank god I have my valium with me so I‚Äôm just gonna take a few and try not have a complete meltdown in front of everyone. My grandparents are coming too and they were pretty much the reason I developed an ED growing up because all they ever do is comment on my food and my weight, I‚Äôm either too skinny or too fat, they are just rude shitty people but no one can ever call them out on it because ‚Äúthey‚Äôre just old‚Äù.
