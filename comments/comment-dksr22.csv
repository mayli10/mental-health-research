I either eat and then feel shitty, and want to purge and feel more shitty. Or I don't eat and feel a little less shitty because there's no purging but still pretty shit because I'm not eating.

I should preface this by saying IF (intermittent-fasting) can obviously make binge eating worse for some people, but it can also help others. For example, if you don't eat for 20 hours in a day and have 4 hours (or however you want to break up the day) of planned eating, it can make you feel like it's 'okay' to eat during that time. It will also regulate your hunger and blood sugar levels, so you don't feel physically shitty when you don't eat. During the window of eating, you can eat almost anything (within reason) and it's unlikely to make you gain weight (as long as you're trying to be healthy with some treats here and there.)  I can use myself as an example: IF + low-carb/KETO type of diet (not strictly keto all the time). I usually eat 5/6pm-9/10pm. If I'm really hungry around lunch, I might have a coffee (with some cream), or a snack (like 100 cal of peanut butter) before 5pm. I find I'm rarely hungry before 5pm these days and it's easier to have 20-21 hours of your day where you're not thinking about food that much. And when I am, I am looking forward to the meal I'll make or looking up a recipe. This also helps me to feel satisfied, because small 300 calorie (or even 500) never satisfy me and just lead me to think 'ok when is the next meal?'. When I eat, I eat a lot, I'm satisfied and full and in a calorie deficit with a full meal and snacks accounted for. Tonight I'll be having a Chipotle-style pulled pork bowl (without the rice) with tons of cheese, sour cream, and guac, and a keto chocolate chip cookie or two. This will probably leave me at around 1200 cals and I won't even want more until tomorrow. Best part is I can truly enjoy the meal without guilt, and I'll feel physically well and able to workout and enjoy other activities.   Why am I sharing this? Well I think the cycle can be broken and it can be done so by addressing your two main issues: physical weakness from lack of food and guilt about eating. It's not an easy fix, but IF fixed both for me. Eating low-carb helps with the craving/fullness aspect. It takes time to find what works for you, and it's not an easy process. But I thought I'd write this up in case it helps at least one person move in the right direction :)",False,False

No advice but I commiserate.   Friday morning I woke up feeling very physically unwell.  Heart rate and bp in the gutter, and I passed out as soon as a stood up.

Enjoyed the evening with my son, and even ate some fear foods with him (Halloween event). Just gave myself a pass for the day. Queue gaining x lbs and feeling racked with guilt the rest of the weekend and compulsively exercising, restricting and purging.
