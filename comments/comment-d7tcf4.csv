I don’t want to sound patronizing but you’ve had so little life experience yet, the world is big and open and you have plenty of time to explore it. I’m 30 and still figuring out. And what’s great is you can reinvent yourself as many times as you want!!",False,False

""god, you're not good at anything you do and you can't even lose weight, the fuck."" i relapsed so badly after my surgery (appendicitis) because i felt like a piece of shit for eating food a day later and having meals. reading this, you might not think that it is, but i can tell u that this shit is fucked.   the turning point from ed hell to recovery was like....me finally realizing that, hey. i don't want to look back on my teenage years and only remember being miserable. all of my friends can exist and be themselves, why can't i? why am i willingly making myself so fucking miserable (and i was. i didn't think that i was miserable at the time and i never wanted to say that i had an ed but i really did and that's probably what makes an ed a ed.) it's being like, dude fuck this shit i want to be okay with existing in my body and i don't want to be on this hellish rollercoaster anymore. i deserve to be okay with myself. smth that i still remember is one of my friends saying ""if you chose recovery, you would have so much more time and be so much happier."" and i thought it was bullshit at the time, but it's so fucking true dude. open up to your doctor about it. talk to your parents, if you're in the position to. let a medical professional know and know yourself that you deserve to recover from your ed.  i remember after my first appointment, i was near tears and thinking to myself ""god what the FUCK i DON'T have an ed i'm just a fatass who has no self control around food i'm a complete fake i hate myself"" and etc. but like, then there was the second and third and fourth appointment, and even though i hated going to them at first, it was like. stupidly helpful. at least for me, the entire act of going to the doctors, treating my ed as if it were a physical injury that was being fixed and healed, really helped me realize that what i thought was ""normal"" truly wasn't. it was like an out of body experience when they sat me down at a table and told me point-blank, ""you've been medically diagnosed with an eating disorder"" like huh? me? you sure? not someone else who is actually suffering? looking back on it yeah i definitely did and still do have an ed, but......yeah. ed's are the worst. you lose so much perspective without ever knowing that you are. recovery has been very effective for me, and it feels GOOD to finally talk to someone about it and have them tell you ""yeah. those thoughts running in the back of your head aren't something that everybody has to deal with, and you don't deserve to deal with them, either.""   sorry, this is definitely an essay by this point lmao but what you said really resonates with me and i definitely understand how you're feeling rn :\^( you do have friends, you do have a personality, and you are deserving of all of the good things in this world. you deserve to wake up in the morning and be at peace with yourself, and to think more highly of yourself than just starving or losing weight. i don't want to be like one of those ""wow i chose recovery and now i love life!"" kinda people, but it's a day-and-night difference between suffering and actively thinking that i should treat myself better, i deserve happiness and i'm responsible for my own. once you're not spending all of your waking hours doing mental gymnastics over food, you will feel more like yourself again, you will reconnect with your friends again, and you'll laugh a lot more (genuine laughs!), too. it's scary, it's hard, it sounds like bullshit, but sometimes the only thing you can do is to trust the process.",False,False

I'm not even close to being in the same place as I was a year ago. This time one year ago I was just settling into my first apartment, my first time living alone, coming to the end of a subpar relationship and thinking I should spare everyone else the trouble of being in a relationship with me and just stay single forever. As I type this now, my fiancé(!!) is in the kitchen of our two-bedroom apartment cooking himself lunch. A lot can change in a year!   It's okay to feel like you're not cemented in your life or your identity right now- you're going to finish high school and become someone completely different in the environment you put yourself in after high school, and even that environment will grow and change as time goes on. This isn't a bad thing!! A lot of people view it like ""well, does that mean I'm never going to get a chance to settle into myself?"" and the answer is no!! You'll find yourself buffeted along by people and interpersonal relationships, life events, career decisions, etcetera etcetera. It's like kayaking down a river- things will rush around you and push you, and sometimes you'll bemoan the fact that things don't slow down or that you're fighting against the currents at times, but you can learn to steer yourself along as you go and appreciate the journey.",False,False

Try new hobbies, new sports, painting, music, literature, science, animals. Make this exploration a time to beat the E.D. to get to know yourself and make friends in the way.
