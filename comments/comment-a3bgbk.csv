I went to therapy a few years ago, especially for dealing with my ASD, but almost everything is focused on children or low-functioning autism.   Good luck to you too, I really hope you find someone to help you :) ",False,True

The only place I found that my mom and I thought would be good for me told me that because I have Asperger's, they couldn't take me, for the same reason. It's not effective for people on the spectrum. And now I'm having an insanely hard time finding anyone who knows a goddamn thing about mood disorders in ASD, and the few I've found are for children only.",False,False

Its just that I'm also kind of realising that I haven't fully accepted that diagnosis yet. I got it four years ago, and on a daily basis I just like to ignore that I have autism. I guess I can't do that any longer, I have to face the fact that it has a lot of influence on my relationship with food.",False,True

I'm still very disappointed of course, but I don't blame the clinic for being honest about not being able to treat me. It's just another blow to the face and it doesn't make the whole process easier.   Thanks to everyone for replying by the way, your comments are heartwarming and very valuable :) I'm gonna take a few days to not think about it, and I'm gonna look into new options after the weekend.

I do know in fact that this is not BS, since I have a friend with Asperger (now just called autism spectrum disorder I believe), and she had anorexia in her teens (she is now recovered). All the methods did not work for her because she then at the same time found out that she was autistic. I don’t know the details of why programs have to be different for autistic people, but she is actually raising awareness for the connection between anorexia/bulimia and autism and how those people need a different kind of treatment. Hope that sheds some light on their rejection, and I hope you can find a clinic that has a program for you! Good luck!!",False,False

What I would recommend is contacting your insurance company because they have behavior health advocates who can help you find appropriate treatment in your area and arrange it.  Several years ago I attempted suicide and I got a personal nurse from Aetna who called me and did basic counselling and helped me find in network providers for follow up care. Call the behavioral health phone number on the back of your insurance card and they can give you some direction. ",False,False
