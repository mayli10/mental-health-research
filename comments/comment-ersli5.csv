Dental problems are a really different type of stressful. I had bulimia of a different form, and rarely had to worry about my teeth, but I've had fillings fall out, not have hundreds to spend on dental care, so I had a molar pulled when I finally got my wisdom teeth removed at 21 or 22. Another will eventually need to be pulled. It's just a matter of time.  I wish the best for you.",False,False

I always thought I was really lucky that my teeth never got bad, but I think it's mostly genetics and it's not like my teeth are fantastic. They are thinner at the top around my gums (my front two teeth), but everyone swears they don't notice.",False,False

I get urges to start up the whole purging cycle over again all the time, but I think your reply alone will help me a lot. I’m really sorry about your teeth, I’ve cried several times over the tiny holes in my teeth so I can’t even begin to imagine what you go through. I’m glad you were able to recover.",False,True

I’m still youngish and attractive, but I’m shy to even open my mouth and very very self conscious.   If I ever have a windfall or win lotto or just any spare cash my biggest dream is nothing else but to fix my teeth.  I’m happy I’m alive, I’m happy I’m healthy now, but the teeth are a huge shame.",False,False
