Recently I went through my 1st heartbreak and had a hard time eating for a little more than a week, so I probably had an intake under 1000, maybe even 800. I’d be lying if I said that getting dumped encouraged me to be happy abt it &amp; I actually started running at night to help me relieve some stress.  DAE when someone hurts them, think like “oh I’ll show them, I’ll starve myself.” ??? Idk if it’s cause I think they will feel bad for me? Or I’d be more attractive if I lost more weight, which wouldn’t necessarily be true in terms of other people’s ideal, since I’d be ‘underweight’ if I lose more than 5 lbs. but like I NEED to!",False,False

Basically I eat nothing and only drink water for as long as I can go and I did like 4.5 days not that long ago and lost about 11 lbs. I began to eat again and only gained back about 3lbs from the 11 lost so if I keep at it I should be from 175 to 125 by January 1 🤩🤩🤩,False,False
