HIPPA completely protects your medical history and there is no way the college could have access to that unless you sign off access yourself. The only reason I could see you giving access of that information to the college is if you’re working with the University health clinic (if it has one), in which it would only allow them to support you better. I go to a college in Texas and I went to treatment during a semester. My college was very accommodating, and I was also able to register with the disabilities center at my university, in which I get further help and protection when it comes to dropping classes if needed, early registration, etc. In almost all cases, the treatment from American colleges, especially well established public universities, will be opposite of what you’re fearing rn",False,False

It isn't relevant to admissions anyway unless you need to explain large absences in your schoolwork or really subpar grades; even then you don't need to disclose a reason, just that you were in a medical leave.",False,False

Also I believe all colleges have a counselor. For me, I’ve been considered as having a “disability”, so I’m able to ask for accommodations for classes. It can be really hard at first to advocate for yourself, but remember that they’re there because they want to help you succeed ❤️",False,False

Your medical records are confidential. It is your personal information and irrelevant to your applications. Colleges do not have to know about any past hospitalization (except in the case of, say, excused absences- in which case they would not know the reason for hospitalization, just that you have a medical excuse). I don’t think they would ever deny you anyway, but you would never have to disclose it unless you want to.  You know what’s best for you, take care of yourself! ❤️",False,False
