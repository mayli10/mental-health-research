I *do not* want other friends with similar disordered eating habits because, speaking from experience, 1. I will get so fucking competitive and envious and self-conscious, oh boy, and 2. we will absolutely just feed each other's worst habits (especially encouraging, intentionally or not, more restriction) as well as learning new ones from each other (I developed a whooooole bunch of new unsafe foods from him, he learned about laxative purging from me, etc.)  Like it sucked to have a friend who knew about my ED but couldn't wrap her head around the role binging played into it and therefore would encourage or even trick/guilt me into eating whenever she caught me denying myself in any way even if it wasnt restriction but rather just avoiding binging. It sucked having a friend who knew I purged and treated it like the grossest, weirdest, most baffling thing in the whole world. And of course it sucks to have friends that I have to hide my ED from, it's so isolating to be surrounded by people who don't know what I'm dealing with and who I don't feel I can tell.  But it is also objectively unhealthy to spend a lot of time with someone else who actively engages in ED behaviors. It's triggering in its own way, and it's isolating in sort of creating a codependent relationship and making social interactions with other people even *more* unbearable because I know I do have a social outlet that would allow me to restrict. Like, if I have to eat sometimes to be with my friends, then I guess I'll eat sometimes and continue to interact with many people. But if I can either eat with my friends or not eat with this one person, then it becomes me and this one other person never eating and never interacting with other people, and it's toxic as fuck.",False,False

I’d be lying if I said it wasn’t really great having someone who just gets it with no explanation needed, but I’d also be lying if I said it didn’t suck at times too.

I used to have a lot of friends and enjoyed seeing them, but over the years my anxiety has just become full throttle so I’d isolate myself and stop responding to people, so now I don’t have any friends left which is depressing lol but it’s my fault.
