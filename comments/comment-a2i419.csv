Its a partial thickness tear in your esophagus. Most commonly you will vomit a lot, have a little blood in the vomit and then the vomit will be normal colored again. For someone who gets this from drinking too much one night it's usually the end of it and heals up fine.   There is also Boerhaave syndrome which is where you can basically tear all the way through your esophagus and you can get air in the mediastinum.   But as u/rhllorbackgirl said, we can't diagnose you over the internet and you should go see a doc and get evaluated to rule out some unlikely but very serious things it could be (like esophageal varices, etc)",False,False

They aren’t usually painful, and you can bleed out without knowing it. OP, please go to the emergency room, or at least tell your mom what happened.   Sending love!",False,False

They usually resolve on their own if you stop purging, but please go to the Emergency Room if you continue bleeding, develop pain, or start feeling short of breath. ",False,False

I’ve never thrown up any blood but it’s probably not very good. Did your nose bleed? Or is your throat red at all? It could have been either of those two and if not, your stomach is struggling a bit. Try not to eat anything too harsh on your stomach for atleast a week or two, and take it easy with the purging. If you’re going to purge I’ve heard it’s easier to drink a lot of water before hand? Maybe that’ll help in the future. ",False,False
