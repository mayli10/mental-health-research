Unfortunately I have some mental knots to untangle before I start behaving and actually being nice to my body, when that happens tho, I'll definitely be doing this.",False,False

It seriously feels like that sometimes, nobody understands us except other people who have/have had an ED. It sucks major big league.",False,True

I am 32 and am in my... 3rd?... proper relapse. I've been struggling with actual ED's since 15 but had the thoughts since I can remember and have had a constant 'voice' there forever.  My most recent relapse (spoiler: it is now) has whispered to me things I no longer believe now I am a mature frikin adult. I know it's games but I still can't help but bend in to its comfort sometimes though. So many twisted lies from my own brain about how a single peanut could make me retain water or stop burning carbs or force an allergic reaction that could result in my body wanting to store fat to survive (¿)  HOWEVER! Because of the way it's taken me down this time I have spoken to a bunch of mental health professionals, been to A&amp;E, spoken to counselors etc etc and I realised that having an ED is like being fluent in a whole different language. If you speak the language you can understand it but the language is like speaking Welsh. No one understands you, everyone makes fun of you and ALL Welsh speakers also speak other, more common languages fluently.   So many people tell me stuff like ""you know, I just eat 5 portions of fruit and veg a day and I feel great"" and I'm like ""yeah! Well, in that case I can't be bothered to explain to you the amount of sodding time I have spent analysing macros, micros, water retention, gluten, allergies, cultural differences and everything bloody else that may affect my tiny day to day weight fluctuations.""   Anyway ...sorry... taking a breath.   ED's don't break us. Our trust in our own 'comfort' rational breaks us. We gotta keep questioning our own damn selves in a logical and scientific way. And DAMN do I know we're all intelligent enough to do that.   (Phewf... Probs burnt of ~300 cals with that rant)",False,False

There’s no rules of engagement and my effort to “maintain” while tracking and weighing has led to a 5 lb loss in 5 weeks. Not gonna lie- I should have gone to IP earlier this year when I had the chance.,False,False
