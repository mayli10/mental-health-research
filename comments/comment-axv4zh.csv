When I heavy restrict I am usually cool to come off it for a day to eat ""normally"" or at least not consider my calories and not go too insane because I won't be very hungry.    But he next day? NOPE.   Usually what I do is try to plan a serious workout on days like that. Because   1) I'm not at as serious of a deficit so I can push myself more   2) so I can eat a little more without being insane    3) because I tend to not eat as much when I work out? I get queasy from activity very easy (my whole life) so it helps with making better food choices.    4) preworkout tho",False,False

Itâ€™s so fucking annoying but honestly when Iâ€™m able to eat how -not- I want too, I feel so much calmer. Like I can sleep without wanting to put my head through a wall. I donâ€™t want anyone catching on, so fucking clichÃ©, and just do my own thing. This stupid fucking thing literally gives me the only control my fucking life has. And the fact I donâ€™t know how many calories it really was... omfg. No winning EVER ",False,True
