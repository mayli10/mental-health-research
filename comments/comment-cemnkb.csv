She's never pulled out the DSM for my OCD, PTSD, depression, or anxiety diagnoses. I think the idea may have been to not diagnose me with the wrong thing, cause the first thing I opened up to her about was b/p problems, and I hid the calorie counting and restricting from her. So she was thinking bulimia. But I havent b/p in a month so I guess I dont quite qualify for that anymore even tho I was doing it a few times a week up to a few times a day, just about a month ago. Idk. I'm going to bring up OSFED/USFED to her and see what she thinks about it. It's mainly for insurance purposes, like. I will never think of myself as sick enough for an actual eating disorder anyways, it was just so invalidating to hear like ""well you dont look medically underweight so technically you cant have AN""",False,True

Iâ€™ve seen several therapists in my time and there is nothing worse than a bad fit or bad therapist its triggering and infuriating. I donâ€™t play and if I donâ€™t like them I donâ€™t go back. I wouldnâ€™t go back to someone who gave me a bad haircut.,False,False
