It can be a little uncomfortable, but the most prudent course of action is usually to talk to your doctor before re-starting - if you want to re-start. (Not that I’ve always followed that advice perfectly myself.) I’ve been told it takes quite awhile for SSRIs to be effective, so if you took it for less than 6 weeks it might not have even reached full efficacy? Kinda frustrating how slow they work.",False,False

In general, concerns over any side effects you experience are really good to talk about with your doctor. They can’t help with what they don’t know about, and my experience is they would much rather help me switch meds in a careful fashion than have me secretly go cold-turkey because of a side effect. (Going cold turkey can be super no bueno with many meds.) Good luck! I hope the prozac proves helpful!",False,False
