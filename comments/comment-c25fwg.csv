I don't really have any advice but it's horrid feeling worn down and constantly on edge and I'm sorry you're having to deal with all the extra stress from the police stuff.  I know you don't want to do anything but could you maybe ask your mum or bf or a friend if they'd wanna do something nice and chill and fun or low stress with you? Maybe going somewhere pretty to admire the view or spending time grooming pet animals or going for a walk or just watching a nice film together? Something completely unrelated to stressful stuff in your life that just brings you a little peace? It's not a solution but taking a break and doing something a bit different can help me feel more like myself again sometimes.  I hope things get better soon; take it easy and be kind to yourself, you're allowed to do that. One thing at a time, is my mantra.",False,False
