Not forgivable in my book, but understandable, because significant weight changes can legitimately change whether your partner is attracted to you or not.   10-15 pounds is bullshit. Most people lose/gain 10 pounds every now and then over the course of a few months due to fluctuations in lifestyle - its totally normal.   If a main factor in him loving you is a small body with ZERO wiggle room, I would seriously rethink things. What if you break your leg, or have a child, or have to go on medication, or anything else where not gaining weight or being less athletic is virtually impossible? Would he make you feel less loved? That's really not a good foundation for a relationship. ",False,False

I was terrified of becoming fat like my partners ex. I lost tons of weight.   He adored me.  my confidence soared. I've gained it back, and still, even now, he adores it.
