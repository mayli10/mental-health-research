I've been overweight my whole life, so I've either been eating at a deficit, or at an overweight maintenance.  I just looked up what maintenance would be for me if I hit my GW... At my height it would be about 1800 cals. A day. I cannot imagine eating that and not gaining weight, even though I know I easily used to eat more than double that when I was binging. That's like... three full-size meals and one or two snacks a day and I can't comprehend it.  It almost seems unfair? Like... Now I know why so many people can do this and not struggle with it, because that's EASY. That's NORMAL.

That you HAVE to eat or else you'll unintentionally lose weight? That's like. A big ass snack. Or two moderate snacks. Or a snack and a fancy drink, or some after-work cocktails, etc. Now I get how skinny tall girls can maintain while still drinking a Starbucks frappe with whipped cream and 900 pumps of syrup etc etc. Because they're eating NORMAL ASS MEALS so they HAVE to eat 300\~ cals a day to maintain their weight.

This would've been so easy for my parents to teach me how to do, as a kid. Just to give me some basic framework of calories, to be like, you can eat whatever you like, just manage your calories so that you fit them where you want them. I wouldn't have entered into middle school already obese.  Or maybe I still would've. Because maybe knowing this wouldn't have changed anything. Maybe I still would've engaged in self-destructive or delusional behaviour and binged my way into morbid obesity. Even if I knew how calories worked maybe I still would've self-medicated with chocolate and cheeseburgers.  But wow. Maybe one day I'll hit my GW and I can try eating at maintenance.
