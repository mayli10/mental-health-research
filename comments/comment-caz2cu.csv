I've been trying to think of a method to make it look like I died accidentally just because I think that'd be less hurtful for my family... I also fear what will happen if my attempt fails  I used to stay because it felt too selfish to traumatise my family with suicide but all I know is I *cannot* cope with life much longer.,False,True

I acknowledge recovery isn’t possible for the type of brain I have. And I can’t see myself living like this well into my adulthood. I don’t have a want to have kids, a husband or wife, or a future. I am just surviving for now for the sake of those around me. I’m still trying to figure out the least hurtful way for me to go. I’m hoping I get cancer soon or some physical ailment out of my control that can take me. I wish I could just take someone else’s pain and let them live their life because I don’t even want to live my own.",False,False

I know it might sound redundant or another platitude, but please talk to someone. There are a bunch of 24/7 anonymous [hotlines](https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/wiki/hotlines) where you can talk to someone just about how you're feeling, even if you are resigned or content with leaving life behind, even if you don't think it'll change anything.   I read that you didn't gain much from online communities or therapy, but could you talk to your GP about it? Any close friends or family you trust? Even if you feel like a burden to them or worthless, if they mean something to you and vice versa, they will want to listen to you. I know how appearance is inextricably tied to happiness for us ED folks, but there is more to you than that. What do you like and dislike? I have a bunch of hobbies that I try to maintain and have helped distract me from my body when the dysmorphia and suicidal ideations start creeping up. I've taken to bumming around in bed watching TV shows that are airing now, so that I have a small (albeit ""petty"") reason to stick around.",False,False

Fear mongering in them is what made me come off my meds the first time which resulted in them being ineffective this time. I will now only deal with doctors. Have an appointment at the end of the month but if my body does not improve (which deep down I know it wont) with whatever med they give me (if they are even willing to give me a new med) I will 100% be killing myself.

If it was still working I would not be suicidal and probably be happy. The reason I was happy is because I looked so good. Now I look awful so I genuinely do not have any hope, will or desire to live. I gain nothing from therapy because all I want is my healthy body back which I cannot have.

If you’re feeling truly suicidal, please visit your nearest emergency room and stay safe.   If you have the drive to want to be better, which it seems to me that if you’re reflecting on that recovery period of your life positively, you most likely do... then keep that in mind as your goal. Listen to recovery podcasts, seek out free support groups in your area, or join a few online. I know it’s hard, and I’m calling the kettle black here, but I really do believe anyone can recover if they truly want to. As someone who was hospitalized for a very serious attempt so many years ago, I encounter moments, even if fleeting, where I reflect on the fact that I’m glad I’m still here just to experience those little moments.
