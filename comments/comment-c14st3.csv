You gotta eat, maybe less than when you were exercising regularly you don’t want to screw your body over while it’s trying to heal. I focused on building muscle tone in my arms and abs. Also I was able to still weigh myself, I just sat awkwardly on my scale and subtracted the estimated weight of my brace. I’m not sure I’d recommend that because it’s less accurate and can lead to unwarranted freak outs. Final tip: listen to your PT! Giving your ankle the space to mend now will make everything easier down the road. I re-injured myself once exercise restrictions were relaxed by going at my old ways too hard and my recovery period was as a result twice as long and my ankle is still sorta fucked. Hang in there! Use this as an excuse to read, or learn embroidery - something to take your mind off your ankle and your relative immobility.",False,False
