If I didn‚Äôt know they were genuine pills right out of the box I would have thought I got ripped off because 40mg would make me fucking nod off and wanna eat everything in sight????? Most disappointing waste of money ever. I don‚Äôt know if I actually have adhd but the meds definitely have the opposite effect on me which is annoying af,False,False

Were you formally evaluated? Because I for one don't wash my hands or check burners or anything, and for obvious reasons am super disorganized. So I don't match the classic profile. Most of my compulsions are thought-based, and therefore invisible.  But yeah, the OCD aggravates the ED for sure. Especially in relation to my obsessions with purity, contamination, and parsimony. Like, I'm not ""allowed"" to do things (including diets/weight loss) unless I do them flawlessly. I'm also constantly paranoid that foods contain pesticides or animal products, or are giving me terrible diseases.  And then in terms of parsimony, I'm always trying to minimize the resources I take, the money I spend, the space I occupy...bc I am terrified that my actions are causing irreparable harm. Harm to others, animals, the planet, my future stability, my health, etc. (When I was little I even tried to breathe slower so as to take up less of the world's oxygen.) And then to feel more secure, I overestimate whatever resources I DO take, leading to nonsense like, ""1100 cal diet? Nope, let's just round that down to 500 to be sUpER sUrE I'm in a deficit!!!""",False,False

Its pointless and I hate it. It's such a chore..I only eat when I get headaches or I'm too weak to do stuff.   I do love exercise though lol. Unfortunately the only drugs I get are prescribed. My insurance sucks and makes me take random drug tests and if I test positive for anything from weed to black tar heroine...I'm cut off. I heard that weed is a game changer though:/ That and a lot of my fellow IRL depressed buddies say that shrooms are the cure. Not sure how I feel.,False,False

I don't have enough for it to be diagnosed but it definitely has a strong presence in my family.   How does your OCD manifest? A lot of it is food/exercise related for me. There was a long bit where the food I ate had to be 'perfect', or where I couldn't get anything done unless I followed the most effective workout routine first thing in the morning. I would legit hyperventilate   Or maybe that's just called being an insufferable perfectionist with procrastination issues ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è",False,True

I mean I know I work out a lot because I'm hyperactive. In addition, I have nonexistent serotonin levels and working out gives me an adrenaline high and so I over do it. But I didn't know that it  caused those things.   I personally like my ADHD because I'm on the highest dosage of Ritalin and so I'm always never hungry lol. I'm just indifferent about everything tbh. I recently got prescribed prozac and each visit they keep increasing it but its not doing much. I'm not sducidal anymore/miserable but I'm still feeling the same mehhh indifference. I thought it would make me happy and it doesn't.   It def has its disadvantages but from an ED pov its great lol.",False,False
