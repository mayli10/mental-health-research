I seriously can't conduct normal activities when I know there's tempting food in the vicinity, whether bc I'm longing for it, or freaking out that I really will eat it. Term paper due? No, I'm thinking about the food. Important work assignment? No, I'm thinking about the food. Doing literally anything productive? No, I'm thinking about the food.   It's actually the most disruptive and impairing symptom of my ED. Fuck I just hate it",False,False
