When her friend saw a photo of herself and her mind made her believe she was bigger than she actually was, it made me realize my mind was probably playing the same game with me.   Granted I already had an eating disorder back when this aired and I didn‚Äôt recover for a few years later but I still think about that episode sometimes when I find myself obsessing over the image in the mirror or photos I find unflattering, reminds me that sometimes I‚Äôm seeing things differently than how the world sees me.",False,False

It may seem petty, but children's media shouldn't treat serious problems like eating disorders, addiction, and mental illnesses such as depression/anxiety as quickly solvable. Especially when the program suggests that the problem is divorced from the context of the sufferer's life. (By which I mean stuff like, ""Jordan has an eating disorder because they want to look attractive! We need to teach them that's not a good idea and we are all beautiful on the inside!"" as opposed to, ""Jordan has an eating disorder because they use it as a coping mechanism. Jordan, like many of us, needs therapy and probably more."")  I'm not saying kids' shows should get dark and adopt long-term narrative arcs for these subjects, but I hate the thing where it's like ""Let's give [character] an eating disorder for this episode!"" Shows can discuss serious issues without subjecting a random character to some awful problem that's then blithely dismissed. For example: Blackish, Sesame Street, etc.",False,False
