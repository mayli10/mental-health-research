What I learned is not to isolate ones self but instead to find alternative friends (in my case) as I found I'd only hang with my friends because I've known them since highschool and were all I had. Rather than isolating, still hang with your current friends less and seek new ones. I still havent found new friends yet but one step at a time.",False,False
