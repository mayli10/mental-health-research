I don't have much body hair naturally so it was a really big surprise. Tbh I don't really look at people's body hair that much so thanks for telling me!! :O It's probably super hard to tell the difference between body hair and lanugo since everyone has body hair all over the body (idk if that makes sense). For me it isn't super translucent but more like this one http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_10yYjoTIYE0/R9U2y0FHf9I/AAAAAAAAAvo/bvrfBCskAo8/s400/lanugo3.jpg that I found when Googling it. Now I don't think my arm hair is necessarily lanugo since it's darker (I have black hair) but the one on my back is finer and more like the one in the pic.,False,False

Lanugo is really fine, translucent hair so it's not really visible to other people of they aren't scrutinizing you. I don't know where you live but it definitely is normal for people of Greek, Italian, Spanish, Indian etc ancestry to have darker hairs on their backs and arms since they have more melanin than say someone from Scandinavia where you usually have much lighter hairs that are less noticeable.  Not really relevant but I just want to point it out :)",False,False

So I guess you can tell if something is lanugo or not if you notice a difference between what you looked like before and after your ED. Since otherwise it's hard to tell the difference.  I'm AFAB (assigned female at birth)/nonbinary but it does not really play into gender for me because I never see men with hair going from their neck to their upper back. I get what you mean sort of since it is considered good for women to shave? and yeah it is sort of like a morbid confirmation for me. I am sort of embarrassed by the hair on my back of the neck in case I get a haircut and people are like wtf.,False,False

To be honest I am scared to shave mine because if it's gone I don't feel as thin anymore :(  I guess I know I have lanugo because usually people don't have hair on the back of their neck/back?
