Like.. Maybe people want to help me but their help isn't helping. So instead of trying to ask for more help I have now been focused on helping myself. And I discovered this crazy thing that helps me. It's actually forgiving myself. It's not holding on and using my own 'mistakes' over my head. Like.. I made this goal to eat more. But one day I forgot to eat. I already br she'd my teeth ans started cussing myself cause I really didn't want to brush my teeth again. Then I said. Stop. Now go to sleep. Be happy about taking care of your teeth. Tomorrow take care of your body. Eat good.    I don't know if this is in clear contrast of what you are trying to implement. But for me it is a form of planning for 'what if I feel like a failure, how to plan b and avoid disaster.'     It works for me cause to me the whole ed is like an extreme form of selfpunishment. Forgiveness is a powerful antidote to something so destructive, wanted to share cause it has helped me feel better last weeks!",False,False
