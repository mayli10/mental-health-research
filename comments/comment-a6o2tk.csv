Veggie pizza is usually a lot less greasy and lower cal than meat based pizza   Pizza overall tbh is not that bad of you only have say 2 slices of a thin crust veggie pizza that‚Äôs a lot different to 2 slices of deep dish meat lovers pizza!   Thin crust is where it‚Äôs at you won‚Äôt feel as bloated or carb coma ish   Good luck try to enjoy the event ,False,False

It's also in a movie scene, I think maybe Daddy Daycare, where one guy is blotting the grease off of his pizza and the other guy tries to take the extra grease that the other guy didn't want :/ a little gross, but I would say that blotting the oil off is not considered an ED tendency and could just be seen as ""health conscious""",False,False
