I’m so ready to not eat and save some money omg (also bc I’m on a tight budget not eating is actually super cost effective and smart y’know. Totally not a self destructive behavior at all no siree). Plus my school schedule is so packed that I’m leaving my apartment every day super early and not getting back until late at night. My logical brain is dreading it but my ed brain is reveling in how little time I’ll have to actually eat,False,False
