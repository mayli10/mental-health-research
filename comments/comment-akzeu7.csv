Tesco have it next to the porridge oats - it looks like the shavings collected from porridge, if I'm honest but is apparently healthier. It's a darker colour, more burnt orange than regular porridge",False,False

Once I forgot to add oil to aunt Jemima mix and though they were fragile, they came out tasty and not bad calorie-wise either.    Itâ€™s been a while since I made it but for a recipe:  -1/3 cup oat flour -1/4 cup oat fiber OR regular flour * add the cals to total  (you can use more oat flour but the gluten helps keep them from breaking ) -1 teaspoon baking powder (I usually use reduced sodium) -1 teaspoon Truvia baking blend  -1/2 cup unsweetened cashew milk (if too thick just go ahead and add water until itâ€™s slightly thinner) ~ for extracts I used maple and imitation butter 0.5 teaspoon each  â€¢Preheat oven to 350F â€¢Mix together all the dry ingredients  â€¢Add in the wet and mix together  â€¢Lay our parchment paper on a pan and give it a quick spritz of cooking spray bc these are sticky â€¢Pour batter into however many pancakes youâ€™d like  â€¢Bake in oven at 350 until cooked through (I canâ€™t remember but I think it took like 12 minuets)  Original recipe: 132 cals; 60 carbs; 3 fat; 4 protein  With wheat flour: 232 cals; 46 carbs; 3 fat; 7 protein + 15% DRI of iron  Lol not *exactly* pancakes but with this recipe the low cal replacements make them super hard to flip without breaking so thatâ€™s why I bake em.
