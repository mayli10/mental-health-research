It was my ex's birthday yesterday and I've been stressed about it for the last two months only to really crush my own soul by stalking social medias and finding that wonderful information you're always looking for but never really want to find.     So glad you have your person, love is such a lovely thing. It's heartbreaking when you experience loss but so wholesome when it's there and shared. Congratulations",False,True

I obsessed whenever my ex’s had moved on. I would compare myself to the new girl too. Sometimes I felt better, sometimes I didn’t.   I think I found my person now and I can’t help but to be so happy that those relationships ended. I’m so happy with my person. I caused myself a lot of unnecessary pain by making the break up about the ex or the ex’s new person, rather than just focusing on myself and how I could make my life better.   My new person still held onto some baggage with his ex. She thought she was better than him and treated him like crap. When I’d hear him say those things, i felt hurt for him that he still held onto that. But neither of us would have ended up together if those relationships never ended.",False,False

Thanks for the sentiments, and I try not to be immature in my feelings. Its hard but it's a process so I'm sure it'll happen with the right efforts and passing of time.",False,True

You and your ex were just not meant to be. When you find your person, there will be many ways you’ll count of how your next guy is better and is likely won’t have anything to with looks and more about the way he treats you.   You deserve to be loved for your worst, best, and inbetween. You don’t deserve to have your weaknesses held against you. Your person will help you become the best person you are and even when you aren’t, will still love you.   That ex of yours was not deserving of you.",False,False
