And have too much free time. Part of the problem is I have that problem where I don't really love anything. It's like I only get joy from my ED.,False,True

It sucks so badly because I restrict and restrict and then binge and purge and then maintain and itâ€™s like ???   No part of that is enjoyable at all lmao,False,False

Finished school last year and then had about two months free time before I started my new job and it triggered disordered eating and depression. Maybe you just feel uncertain deep down?   And a break up is never easy, even when it was the right thing to do.  Do you have enough time to relax? Do you get enough sleep? Maybe try doing more of the things you love and make you feel at ease? There's always time!",False,False

I hear you on the pressure, it is usually like that for me, but the weird thing is there is no pressure on me! I almost feel like that's why. It's hard to explain without giving away too much, but I'm in a weird limbo where there's really no external pressure on me for several months while I finish school. I already have a job lined up. School is easy.   The restriction was triggered by a breakup, but I in no way want that guy back anymore. Other guys seem into me. I don't even want guys to want me for my body. I don't get any of it",False,True

Although I'm going more in the BED direction atm (after hitting my gw just three weeks ago and gaining back nearly half of the weight lmao), I feel you lots.  I either b/p or starve/want to and then binge. And I already had rather normal eating habits after having had disordered eating for years and now it's all to shit again because I want to go back to my gw :(  Usually for me, there's some kind of perceived outside pressure (perceived because mostly it's just stuff I pressure myself into). Try finding that and dealing with it somehow more functional?  Also, big thing for me rn is that I couldn't go to the gym this week as I got a new tattoo last saturday and because of its size and place I didn't want to risk anything.  Wish you the best!!!",False,False
