It shows anyone of any size can get an eating disorder, and that even if their body undergoes severe changes, such as recovery, the person inside can still suffer with disordered eating habits.   I love the show personally.",False,False

I felt like the ED stuff was really well described. I’ve never had a full-blown eating disorder but I’m pretty sure I had some BED tendencies for a while, and I could relate a lot to her emotions related to food (even if I want eating nearly as much).",False,False

Thats definitely what binging is for me. Its not ""I haven't eaten enough and my body is trying to make up for it"", it's actually ""I'm not hungry whatsoever but I'm stressed/sad/angry and suddenly I want to eat but that craving isn't going away.""",False,False

I find insatiable entertaining, but can see why people wouldn't like it.   Your sisters feelings are valid based on the context of her life and experiences.
