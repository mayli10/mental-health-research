Talk to him and try to understand why he did that and what drove him to do this. I'm not telling you to excuse this behaviour. If you feel bad or cheated, then it's definitely not good. But you need to express those feelings and tell him he hurt you.  He might lie if you ask him the reason behind this behaviour.

I fell in love with my ex boyfriend last year, when my eating disorder had me at my one of my worsts. He was my first relationship. The fact that he was attracted to me was a sort of validation to me— if he liked my body, then I couldn’t have been as bad as my mind was making me feel, right? I loved him a lot, even though sometimes I felt like he didn’t go out of his way for me or love me the same way. He always reassured me with his words, and I believed him.  Then one day he became super distant.  I asked him what was wrong, told him I’d be there for him if he needed it because I thought he’d gone through something sad. He told me it was nothing. One day turned into one week. He acted normally to everyone else. One week turned into one month, then one season. All that time I did everything I could to make him happy, and all the while he said nothing.  I fell into a dark hole. He became a distant stranger, ignoring me when I tried to be affectionate, responding curtly only when he had to. But I was too afraid to question him, to do anything but show him love and absolute caring.   Then one day his friend texted me, wanting me to show my boyfriend something late at night. I replied that my boyfriend had gone to bed. His friend asked me, “did he go to bed, or is he with [another girl’s name]?”  I became numb. I inquired further and everything began to make sense. My ex had started to date another girl without telling me, right around the time he became so cold. He never had the decency to acknowledge me or break it off, despite all the chances he had to do so. I poured my heart out to him in desperation while he ignored it and turned around to a prettier, skinnier girl. What’s worse is that he told everyone about the new girl, and nobody about me, ever. They were happy. They are still together.  I’m telling you this because I think I understand how you feel, at least a little bit. And I am so, so sorry, love, I am, because I know how deep the pain is that you feel. I wish I had an answer for you, but I still struggle with what my ex did to me even though it’s been nearly a year. What I can tell you with certainty, though, is that you deserve better than that piece of shit. I know what it’s like to hang on to your first relationship out of fear— you’ve never gone through a breakup before, you may be bad at confrontation, you might think you’re not worth any better. I had such low self worth that I let myself get strung along by an asshole who treated me horribly for months and months for the same reasons you’re reluctant to let go. But I need you to hear me. You deserve better. What he did is completely on him, not you, as much as it may feel like that isn’t true. You need to trust me on this one. You don’t have to believe me, but trust me.  If you want to talk, my inbox is always open.",False,False
