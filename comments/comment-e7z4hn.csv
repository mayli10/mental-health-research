When my diagnosed bulimia morphed into anorexia (so everyone around me KNEW I had and ED and had had it for 4 years) I was congratulated and praised up and down until I was comatose with a tube up my nose. And as soon as I was hospitalised suddenly everyone was concerned. My favourite saying for those of us with atypical/higher weight eating disorders: ‚ÄúWhen the thin girl gets thinner, everyone panics. When the fat girl gets thin, everyone celebrates.‚Äù  It‚Äôs utter bullshit and I don‚Äôt understand how when I eat a Diet Coke for lunch no one says anything, but if someone thin did that they‚Äôd all be in a panic. Disordered is disordered, and the fact that you‚Äôre losing weight unhealthily is horrible and sad and I wish I could find you for a hug.",False,False

Except I was at 330 lbs in August and right now I‚Äôm 251 lbs. still got a lot to lose, but I‚Äôm doing it so unhealthily via severe restriction mainly. Even my doctor praised my quick and extreme weight loss. She was shocked at how much I lost but really praised me. Obviously this just fueled me to keep going.  The only person I‚Äôve confided in who is very concerned is my therapist. Everyone else thinks I‚Äôm amazing and encouraging me to keep going. I feel like such a fraud and a loser.

Now I was like waaaaaay big when I started I‚Äôve lost 200 pounds in the last year but nobody seems to think that‚Äôs not normal and that they should be concerned in fact they continue to ask me about weight loss tips, and tell me how proud they are of me.

Also, ""atypical anorexia"" is a very annoying term, but I guess that's what they call it when you're a normal or OW bmi.

So there is only the diagnosis after the person has started to create unhealthy eating patterns. Seems like the anorexia diagnosis should be focused on the person‚Äôs beliefs about food, themselves, and their eating habits rather than their weight.  If I person is morbidly obese and loses weight, people often show positive responses and encouragement. The person could be engaging in unhealthy eating patterns and is receiving encouragement about their looks rather than if they are really becoming healthier.",False,False
