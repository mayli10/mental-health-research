When I saw a Dr. Phil episode about this girl chewing and spitting her food it was like choir bells went off in my head. That was my answer!  Luckily I have stopped in frequency over the years because I'm poor and I have a family to feed now so I can't spend all my money on binges. I do c/s food that I consider bad while restricting. Like today I did with spaghetti because I love it but too many cals.",False,False

Literally I can buy $100 of food in a go. Plus, I can do it for like, 8 hours strait. CH/SP then B/P anything I may have swallowed over and over and over.   I literally am about to install a locking door knob on my pantry and timeout lock on my fridge. I am going to put my credit and debit cards in the fridge before I lock it for the evening and be done with it.   Only grubhub and DoorDash can ruin this plan.    Much love- rotating ED symptoms sucks balls.",False,False
