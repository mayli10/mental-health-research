Even though I was a ""healthy"" weight, I ate less than 500cal a day, I passed out, my hair was falling out and was brittle, along with my nails turning purple and I was severely dehydrated. BMI seems like the only thing that can validate my eating disorder, not any friends or family telling me I am thin enough, but BMI validating whether or not I have an actual eating disorder. It's like I can't believe the possibility of me having an eating disorder unless my BMI is less than 18.5, even though I have been diagnosed with anorexia twice. It sucks, and I am sorry you have to go through this :-(",False,False

I also find it very hard not to be depressed a lot of the time, and no one wants a miserable friend.   Also friends stopped talking to me when I went into treatment for being suicidal - mental health freaks some people out.",False,False

My BMI was healthy.  Now, I’m underweight and worse.   I would go back and explain your disordered eating in detail, make them fully aware. I haven’t been to a GP since. I hardly leave the house anyway - I have no friends/family or even a job. I’m far gone.  Take my advice and go back to your GP - disordered eating can be a spiral for disaster, and it has to start somewhere - whether it’s a bmi of 50 or 20.   If they don’t listen - not sure what country you are in so if possible - find another GP.",False,False
