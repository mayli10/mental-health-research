I started losing weight for a multitude of reasons but i thought that the best part would be that i would be desired again... i also went out last night and every time someone complimented me or touched me i just knew it was because I’ve been restricting and it made me feel awful... like the amount of positive attention i get from torturing myself is so crazy to me. And then... i don’t even want anyone to touch me! What if they find my fat area! What if they think I’m crazy? What if they find out that I’m really actually overweight and disgusting under all this restriction? What if i find someone and start eating better and i gain weight and they leave me?  My brain goes everywhere hahaha and all leads back to hating myself and wanting to restrict more and just be isolated because heavens forbid anyone like the person they meet until they find out I’m the one underneath,False,False
