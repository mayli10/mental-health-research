Her mother supposedly tried to have the friend who helped arrested for kidnapping. There's was more going on, and I think Shane was manipulated into putting a bow on this dumpster fire of a sutuation.",False,False

She and her friends talk about how they had to stage an intervention to get Eugenia away from her mother who is psychotic and encourages Eugenia‚Äôs eating disorder, doesn‚Äôt allow her to leave the house, see her friends etc. While we should be celebrating the fact that Eugenia seems a lot happier, she‚Äôs got a long way to go before she‚Äôs properly on the road to recovery. Also the more attention we bring to Jaclyn‚Äôs video, the more hope there is to get Eugenia away from her mother who enables her anorexia.",False,False
