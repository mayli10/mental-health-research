I get the impression he may be trying to give you a chance to open up about your past eating disorder, since you have never discussed it with him, but he's clearly clueless as to how his comments are affecting you. I would recommend that you tell him your feelings and be firm with him. If he continues to be insensitive, you should seek love elsewhere.",False,False

Like that’s one of the first few things they teach you about bulimia in health class (after b/p, obviously) so I really don’t understand what the fucking point of their comment was",False,False

I have a friend who used to bounce in and out of ana, over and underweight, her only constant thing is her self-loathing, the hate for her body and food being an issue. Her boyfriend, that dumbass, says she's just fixated.  Sad to say but 90% of people have no clue of how to deal with ed people. I'm a bulimic but I never went seriously underweight nor overweight thanks to gym. Since I came out everyone is like ""wow are you sure? you don't look like a bulimic"". Hate that like it's just an apparel issue.",False,False

As people in our condition, we have a responsibility to ourselves to only date people who are mature, tactful, empathic, and understanding. This guy doesn’t seem to be any of those things. You are your own advocate here and you need to make healthy decisions about your life and who you choose to allow into it.   It’s also very concerning that you moved in with this guy after only a couple of months.",False,False

You need to be very clear and explicit about it. He may not know . People can be dumb.   If he then continues to do this then you need to think about leaving him. That's an unhealthy environment.,False,False

I’m really sorry you’re having to deal with this, wow. It’s just so rude and insensitive and you’re in recovery. You do NOT need this and you don’t need to be compared to his ex, no matter what reason.",False,False
