I have a feeling I’m going to break and buy a new scale. But I’m trying to hold off and see if this passes. ,False,True

I've weighed myself almost every day since June '16. I've missed a few days here and there when I go on vacation and what not. It's tough to give up because my scale's app has a streak count that I don't want to break. I'm at 164 now and had a 200+ when I went on a camping trip and I broke it (the streak).  Honestly, it's a double edged sword. The number I see every morning effects my mood the entire day. Up 3 lbs, I'm miserable. Down 3 lbs, I'm ecstatic.",False,False

It’s been four months and i have to just go by looks to figure out if I’m gaining or losing but that doesn’t work at all bc body dysmorphia makes me think I look obese and disfigured all the time. ,False,False
