I think people are generally understanding, but ngl ED is *really* unintuitive (because its stupid af and we all know it lol) -- so a lot of outsiders don't really know how to react, hence the 'force-feeding' shit (be it literally or via peer pressure). If you're not sure, I'd try just explaining that you simply don't have the appetite for snacking... but if you really trust them, admission is worth a try... It's on you, sorry :(     Good luck! :)",False,False

Like, they know I have issues even though I've never told them about it and they won't pressure me into eating anything. I'm so grateful for them.",False,False

They force her to eat now, but I seem so be able to get away from that cause I‚Äôm not skinny.  But my friend also said the reason she needed counselling was cause she‚Äôs worried about me. So idk you know your friends best just make a decision but if you regret it you can‚Äôt take it back. And I truly wish no one knew about my ed now",False,False

All my colleagues talk about is food and snacks. And there are endless snacks in the office. At least when it was Lent I had an excuse to refuse food, now I don't. Sometimes I wonder what they'd do if I just told them, then I realised they'd think I am mad cos I talk about food just as much as they do. But I bet they'd feel awkward and never offer me food again!",False,False
