It's just sort of arguing with your ED. Remind yourself of why it's worthwhile to be recovered, why you don't need to count, why the impulse to count isn't going to be healthy for you and why that matters. It would also help me to remind myself that it's on there because of the curriculum to teach you math, and it doesn't reflect how you should relate it to your life. I've been using worksheets that are supposed to help and I can send you one when I get home if it might help.",False,False

You know that it's going to be on the test, so set yourself up for success by challenging thoughts that you know will come up. Do everything you can do to walk into the test feeling calm.
