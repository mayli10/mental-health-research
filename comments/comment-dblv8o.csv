I completely get it man, it can be so hard to watch your friend go through this at times because you know they’re deep down suffering with something but they’re SO DAMN CRINGY AHHH.  My friend was just as bad except she kinda went the opposite route. She never really got with the men she was more into just being a tease. I remember on my 17th birthday, my first BF was there who was initially into her (she made out with him in front of me knowing I had the hugest thing for him, eventually he dated me). And at my bday party SHE SAT ON HIS LAP LIKE SHE WAS BEING CUTE AND INNOCENT AND MY LORD .......... UGH. She ended up skipping a ton of school and running away from home multiple times. I was worried sick for her, because you see this innocent nice friend do a complete flip in the matter of a few years. Now she’s married to a girl who is more immature than she is, doesn’t take care of her appearance at all, even enough to comb her hair most days. Hardly talks to anybody. Very strange. I still worry about her but she’s way too much to let back into my life as a normal friend again.",False,False

I had a friend almost exactly like this except she was open about her ED. She faked BPD, schizophrenia, and OCD, put on a really high baby voice for a solid two years even though we all knew she didn't sound like that, and in high school cut off all her hair, dyed it blue, and started dressing like a slutty emo. She'd make out with a new guy almost every week, and some of them would be randos in their 20s she met at concerts or just around. When she met my first serious boyfriend at my birthday dinner she started throwing herself at him, but he had no interest so it was just embarrassing for all of us.   She abruptly cut all of her irl friends out when she left high school at 16 and now she moved cross country alone, probably on her parents' dime considering she has no hs diploma, no degree, and last I saw was working retail. I IG stalk her sometimes and she's clearly gotten worse (lowkey body checks, photoshopping herself to look Asian, and obvious lip fillers), and it does make me sad thinking of the insecure 12 year old I met 8 years ago who was pretty fun when she wasn't being incredibly toxic.",False,False

I've been losing weight &amp; when it became noticeable, my friend at work asked how much I'd lost. Now it's gotten to the point that she asks me about my weight on a daily basis &amp; tells me that OMAD is unhealthy even though she does religious fasting.",False,False

We went to school together our entire lives, we were both overweight kids. As soon as around the 10th grade came along, she developed a ""fear of food"" which I think was an ED in disguise, lost A TON OF WEIGHT. Always talked about it, refused to eat. I would just always try to force her to eat. She faked lots of mental illnesses over the years, OCD being the main one. Weird fears and phobias for attention. Acted stupid/baby-like. Dressed like a slutty goth through all of highschool. Wore dog collars and had men walk her around the school. Always got massive attention from men, meanwhile I'm like the chubby side friend always getting rejected by the guys. She even stole a few of the guys I was interested in.    I stayed in touch somewhat after moving away because she was a big part of my life. She seems even more fucked up in the head now, but lowkey she was a huge reasoning for a lot of my insecurities that built up over time. RIP to the girl she once was",False,False
