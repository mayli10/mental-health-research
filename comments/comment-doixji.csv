Like I just canâ€™t control myself",False,False

Especially bc Iâ€™m vegan so itâ€™s even harder for me bc my extended family is hosting (and Iâ€™m sure as hell not asking them to make vegan dishes of everything) but I get freaked out over food really easily so Iâ€™m worried Iâ€™ll have a panic attack if I eat something non-vegan like mashed potatoes or something,False,False

I'm going to tell people I'm going somewhere to visit family and then just stay in my room for like, 4 days, smoking weed and  working out. Avoid the whole shit show. Does that sound depressing?
