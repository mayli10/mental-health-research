I know it‚Äôs easy for me to type this and another thing for you to live this but you should always remember to take strength from your victories, achievements and wins.   When you talk about it. You can step back from it all and build on your wins. Always remember though some days you may feel like your under pressure and you feel like your trapped but remember pressure is how diamonds are made and when your found you‚Äôll be a diamond, beautiful and sparking.   It‚Äôs OK to feel vulnerable, exposed or scared. It‚Äôs not OK to think just because other people made you feel this way it‚Äôs your fault.  Always remember how far you have come and how limitless tomorrow is.   So keep talking, keep typing and keep posting.",False,False

Especially the end about feeding the nurse, that made me tear up!!   I really needed to hear this. I felt so defeated yesterday but I guess when you put it that way I could see it as bravery.   I‚Äôm really thankful for this community and people who can relate. I can‚Äôt express how lonely it is irl when everyone else seems ‚Äúfine‚Äù.   Thank you again. I‚Äôll probably reread this over and over hahah. You‚Äôre wonderful!",False,True

I think you were incredibly brave to finish out your shift even though ‚Äúbarely leave my bedroom without make up on.‚Äù You are obviously dedicated to the service and well-being of others &amp; drew on this strength to finish your shift.   As a man I am not even going to be so naive as to pretend I can offer any sage advice about the makeup but as a person with anorexia. I would say you were incredibly strong today and you can be incredibly strong tomorrow. As you mentioned above you‚Äôre a nurse a care giver.   Try and take strength from that. Remember be kind to yourself. A new job brings new protocols and new personnel interactions. It can be overwhelming. Know you don‚Äôt have to be the best just do your best. Think little steps for you no else. Love yourself before anyone else and be selfish if you need to.   You not needing the ugliest, you feeding the nurse who provides care and hope. Keep talking, keep posting and keep trying.  Hope this helped.",False,False
