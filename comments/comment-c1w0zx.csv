I'm moving out in like 2 weeks, so it won't be like this forever.",False,True

Like sure, keep an eye out. But policing is not helping.",False,False

I remember my mum would stand outside the door while I took a bath to make sure I didn’t purge, and at the time I thought it was the most annoying, over the top thing in the world but honestly?? If I had a kid that was trying to destroy herself I’d probably be a little overzealous and worried as well :( try to look at it from their perspective as well",False,False
