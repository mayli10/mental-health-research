Last weekend, we planned a get-together with a few co-workers and I b/p'd in the morning. I really had to kick myself in the butt and drag myself there. I wouldn't have bothered if I didn't bail the weekend before too...  I sometimes avoid people to make sure I have enough free time for my b/p sessions, I refuse to go to restaurants that are all-you-can-eat when I feel I won't control myself. It's so tiring.",False,False
