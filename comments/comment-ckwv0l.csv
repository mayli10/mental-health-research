Yep they thought I was pregnant or had gonorrhea. My mom grilled me for a week straight to ""tell the truth"" and when I said I was a virgin I got grounded. Go figure.   That happens to me a lot. Most of my abdominal issues have come with numerous STD panels despite monogamous relationships. ""Oh are you SURE your partner isn't cheating?"" I mean the man works 50 hours a week and is home 10 minutes after clock off time each night but gee maybe during lunch?? Can you feel the eye roll?  Me too!

I don't know how much they made at the time, but it was too much. Juicy fruit gum sticks would be too much.  They thought pain in your *gut and back* was an STD? What STD did they even have in mind? Pregnancy? Syphilis of the stomach?  Glad things turned out okay in the end but still, what the hell.",False,False

I can't imagine growing up in today's society.

I didn't know what the fuck was going on when I first went to the ER, so I kinda figured it probably wasn't actually that bad, I was just a big baby about pain, and I'd mostly go home with an answer + some aspirin?  Then they threw oxy at me like free candy and started talking about surgery.  I'd lost way too much in a short time too, and b/ping at the time didn't help. Wait, weight loss isn't always automatically conducive to better health? Weird. But then we can't pretend pressuring other people to do it is for their own good. Aw, crumbum.",False,False

Even restricting beyond what any medical professional would call safe it takes me about a month to lose 10 lbs.

I listened to a celebrity interview (jameela jamil) about how when she was fat the paparazzi took every opportunity they could to catch her at the most unflattering angles, at her most frumpy and dumpy, always frowning.  The thing is during that phase of her life she was actually quite happy and absolutely excelling in her personal life and career. Media just knew that they could create a narrative around fat = sloppy/sad/let herself go. Then she lost weight through a series of depression, stress, and anxiety.  Paparazzi stopped trying to catch her off guard and actually started to ask her to strike a pose and smile for their photos. They wanted her to look beautiful in their photos.  Because she was thin, they allowed her the narrative she was living it up even though her personal life did not reflect that.  So yeah, fuck diet culture.",False,False
