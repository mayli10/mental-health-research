I felt sexiest at 120 even, but I’m still trying to reach my UGW (idk why I couldn’t just stop?). Honestly though my body type really only looks good skinny— I have narrow hips, long legs, a flat chest and my shoulders/rib cage are wider than my hips. I have the “ideal” body for ballet, but not for looking feminine and curvy. Fat doesn’t go to the right places on me, so I can’t pull off a higher bmi and have it work. I think the “ideal” weight will depend on your body type, not your height",False,False

Maybe 58 or 59. So I’d say maybe something in the low 60s if you want to look like her. 60 or 61?,False,False
