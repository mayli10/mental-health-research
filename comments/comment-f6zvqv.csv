Everyone is different but I usually eat like 5% carb 20% protein and 75% fat. I would go look at r/keto or r/zerocarb both of those ways are great and they sacrifice the least quality of life.  Honestly I’ve never felt so great or had such great body composition since I changed my macros around",False,False

But most like your friend is just restricting calories and lowering carbs. If you eat only about 30g carbs and eat normal calories you’ll lose excess weight. It’s a lot of stuff to understand and I’m not about to explain all of it lol. But it’s probably calories and macros with your friend,False,False
