Eventually things evened out and I stopped getting the urge to b/p or restrict. It's uncomfortable and often causes weight gain (at least at first) but not restricting at all is the first step. Easier said than done, of course.",False,False

That might help you slow down on the amount of binge food you are eating. Maybe try steaming some veggies and mixing your pasta with that so you end up eating more veggies but you still feel satisfied by the pasta. It's hard to consciously make the decision to binge on healthy food instead of ""bad"" food and the craving might not be satisfied but it's worth suggesting.",False,False

I know it sounds dumb, but I was able to turn binge foods into regular food by just allowing myself to eat it if I want to. The first 3 daysv I did binge, but after a while I didn't recognize it as binge foods anymore since I allowed myself to eat them and was kind to myself. Hope this helps. Just don't be hard on yourself.",False,False

Sorry I don’t really have any advice but you’re definitely not alone. That all or nothing mentality really screws us over. Best of luck to you.,False,False
