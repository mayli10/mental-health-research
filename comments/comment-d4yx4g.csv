I guess I just don't think I'm *skinny enough* which makes me *feel* fat but I know I am not.   But, when I got to a very low BMI last year, I still didn't see myself skinny enough. I saw myself as normal, but never ""fat""",False,False

Then it kind of seems like overnight I looked down and was horrified. Since then, despite needing an entirely new wardrobe I still feel like I look the exact same as I did.   I think part of it has to do with how I carry my weight. I have a very hourglass figure so I think my fat is a lot more evenly distributed. When I lose weight, I lose fat everywhere, but I still have the same body shape and obviously my features aren't going to drastically change. I can't really ""see"" myself, just the individual body parts and they all look the same to me as they did ~5 years ago despite a lot of weight loss",False,False

I think it's partially a proportions thing for me? I carry more weight in my thighs and butt, and still do at a lower weight of course, and i tend to fixate on that instead of the overall change. If it weren't for eventually needing to size down pants, I would have a hard time believing the difference is anything noteworthy.",False,False
