This answer will probably be longer cause feelings = complicated haha. I sincerely hope this helps you out so I don't mind writing this at all :)  For a few hours after our breakup yesterday (before he decided to get sleep at night) and even a little bit earlier today, he was acting a bit resentful of me and hurt by the ending of our relationship which I anticipated would be the outcome of our breakup. Especially due to the unique circumstance of my eating disorder being the main reason for our breakup. I think this was one of those situations where it was hard for the other person to understand where I was coming from. Unless they've had an eating disorder (which they said they haven't) or have had family members who've gone through it (not sure about this one with them) you can imagine how tough it would probably be for them to grasp understanding of why people with our problem are not always in the right time of their life for a relationship. He did notice my struggles because I was open about them and he probably did make the connection at one point that it complicates us dating but I don't think he views our breakup or our past relationship completely the same as I do.  He admits to still wanting me, loving me and has asked to continue our relationship which was at one time wonderful before my eating disorder got worse. Not agreeing to go back to him is taking a lot of strength from me. I genuinely feel that saying no is the right thing still and waiting until the future to say yes again if I'm ready to date is what I should do. He is acting a little different after everything especially cause the breakup is so recent but he said he cares about me and cause he loves me, he will stick around and try to be friends even though he would like us to be much more than that. At times he says he needs space and becomes distant which I think is a normal way to process the loss of something that you once had with someone. The good news is that his initial shock and reaction of us being over is ending and he is starting to act more like himself at times and is being more talkative now rather than being only distant and withdrawn from our conversation. I believe any emotions that come during the breakup or after it such as anger, sadness, disappointment, ect. are all stages of healing for him and for the person you may end things with and eventually with time, hopefully they can reach a point of acceptance.  I think a lot of how a person reacts towards just being friends again depends on your history with that person and the feelings they have for you. I was very close friends with this guy for 6 months before our relationship started and we dated for about 3 months before I ended it. We got really serious together despite the short time frame of dating. The guy you're with may not know how to react or what to do newly out of the relationship but I'm sure he will find a way to get through whatever challenges he comes across emotionally and so will you especially if you both try to be kind to each other throughout the process of the breakup. If this person has your best interest, they will at least try to stay around and be your friend despite it being difficult. If they can't do this which is understandable, hopefully they will try to leave things on an okay note with you.  Just remember that your worth isn't dependent on whether he continues talking to you or not. No matter what happens, the breakup was honestly necessary and was what was right for the both of you if things weren't improving in the relationship even if he never reaches the same conclusion. Please feel free to PM me if you need any support or someone who can relate because this is not in any way an easy situation. Stay strong, do what you believe in your heart is right and if that means ending the relationship I think you should. I am hoping the best for you with whatever you decide to do!",False,True

In the end, you do deserve happiness, and others care about you as you are, and agree.  I just also ended things with someone while I felt/said most of the sentiments you have.  It is okay to be sad or grieve now, so take some time to heal and reflect on yourself first!",False,False

Can't imagine how hard that must have been, but I really hope this gives you the push to try to get better. Relationships + EDs are really tough. This is the time to focus on yourself so that you can emerge a better you. Sometimes with eating disorders, we can be selfish. We want to have our cake and eat it too (but not really cause we're by intentionally starving) because we want to harm ourselves and expect the ones we love to just let us. It's not really fair. On the contrary, we didn't ask for this illness, it was just given. Why? We will never know but if we let destroy us and ruin relationships, it will do just that. Have faith. I know that's hard as fuck but you really have to.",False,False

I've had days when I was going trough something like this before. It's a shit feeling having this sense of inadequacy and feeling like you're not doing enough or being what you should be for them. And the guilt feeling is so crippling.  I think you did the right thing, not because I believe you were not being what he needed.    But because it's probably healthy for you to shed that weight of responsibility and fealty and so you can focus on lifting yourself first.   He will be okay, don't worry. Heal yourself.   We're here for you. And when you're happy he'll be too irrespective of your status.",False,False

This puts you in a difficult position where ultimately you have to make a decision - whether to continue dating them or end the relationship. I think the sooner you make this decision and go forward with it, the better it will be for the both of you. You seem to have already decided that ending things with him would be best. I honestly don‚Äôt know if there is any way to prevent you or the other person from feeling bad about the breakup.   What helped me break up with my boyfriend was thinking about how much worse I felt by keeping our relationship going. Because I knew deep down that I was also hurting him and that it wouldn't be right to continue dating him when my problem is like this . It‚Äôs true when people say ‚Äúusually the right thing to do is the hardest thing to do.‚Äù I approached the breakup as more of a conversation rather than a sudden ‚Äúsorry I‚Äôm breaking up with you‚Äù cause the person you‚Äôre breaking up with deserves to know why you are ending it. I just was honest with my boyfriend by explaining my situation, my feelings and why I felt ending our relationship was best.   The main thing I said to him was **‚ÄúI am noticing my mental health getting worse and I am planning on getting myself help but I feel like it's getting to the point where I shouldn't be in a relationship. It's not fair to you because I am not giving you what you deserve from a girlfriend. I am only saying all this cause I truly care about you and maybe in the future we can try dating again when I'm doing better. For now I think it's better if we just stay friends. Please know that decision to break up with you has nothing to do with you and everything to do with me. I'm really sorry and I hope we can be friends still.""**   Sorry for the long reply to your comment,  I hope this helped you though in any way and good luck.
