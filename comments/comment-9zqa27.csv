Obviously I haven’t slept since Friday thanks to worrying about it, so I’m an emotional wreck. I had a panic attack today just accepting the meeting invite.   Thank you for all the support. I’m going in with a firm line about being under the care of a GP and a couple of things to ask for if they really want to make any adjustments... if I can manage to speak at all! ",False,True

I break out in cold sweats every time I have a meeting with Boss 1 and Boss 2 because I've convinced myself that this is the time they're going to tell me they've had enough of my bulkshit.  Nah, they just want to know if they can help me make a plan to navigate the upcoming hell that is Christmas-in-the-office and the chocolate, cake, and lunchtime shenanigans that comes with that.  There's a certain accountability that comes with opening up in the office. There's also a fear of feeling like a fraud, if you have a good day or an extended period of good days, or whatever. None of this invalidates what's going on with you. Actually talk to your Director about that, explain to her how you're feeling about all this.  Hope things go OK for you",False,False

And things like today, when office conversation turned to weight and body issues, and the director gently steered it in another direction and came and sat with me for a few minutes and talked about my work.   I do trust my organisation to be OK about it, I think. In general they’re great, and due to the nature of our work deal with a lot of mental health issues (not necessarily among staff but among the people we work with).   I just wish I hadn’t started down this path. ",False,True

To add - this is directly off the back of a really stressful few months (family issues that my line manager and this director were aware of), with ongoing stress, and I had two weeks signed off work when I couldn’t function any more in October. Heightened food issues tend to be my stress reaction. This is the context in which I ended up telling the director; my line manager doesn’t know about it. The director wanted to tell her, but she’s on leave for 2 weeks and then my manager changes in January but I know yet know who to, hence getting support from HR instead.   I am in touch with my GP and waiting for whatever referral is an option but realistically the wait is a few months I think (UK). I’m happy to tell HR that.  Realistically I don’t think they’ll believe I’ve been magically cured over the weekend, but I’m aiming to have them off my back by Christmas. ",False,True

Say you are dealing with it even of you aren't. Do not bring it up at work again. Fake it for your own protection. Unfortunately you opened up a can of worms and it's never a good idea to bring up mental health issues at work unless you are already afraid they are getting in the way of your job and you are afraid you will be fired. That way in case you are fired you have legal recourse. Otherwise, if it does not interfere with your job it will only hurt you.   That being said it is a good idea to receive help through a therapist and be in touch with your gp about your ed.   Like others have said, hr is not your friend. They are they to protect the company.

I have an appointment on Monday so should firm up the diagnosis, although I'm not sure that's really that important).   I run an average of 500 kcal/day, with quite a lot of fasting so it's a health and safety thing - I've fainted in the office before. I'm also freezing cold all the time, so I have a heater at my desk. I wear fingerless gloves because my hands are often numb. I can just generally be really off some days if I'm struggling to cope with what's going on in my head. They're also really good with my sick leave because of it. Also, if my performance is a bit iffy because I'm struggling, I'm not about to get my ass handed to me - I'm more likely to get support.   Saying that, I'm a European public servant.

I actually ended up in a sort of similar situation at a previous job, where I had been made extremely stressed by working with a particular person. I had notified various people of this on multiple occasions over the course of about a year, but nothing was done.
