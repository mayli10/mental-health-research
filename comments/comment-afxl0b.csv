I know you know this, we all do, but purging is way, way, WAY worse for you than bingeing and gaining weight, or even just eating a little more and gaining slowly. It'll kill you faster than obesity, overeating is not what you really have to fear. But I know how it gets, and I know that the statistics don't matter in the moment; I've been there too.   Again, I'm really, really glad that you're okay! Idk if this helps at all but bingeing is more often than not your body's response to a huge energy deficit, and at that point it's out of your control and not your fault at all. That's biology, it's your lizard brain trying to keep you alive. Realizing this at least helped me with a little bit of the guilt sometimes. Hang in there! ðŸ’—",False,False

Was visiting family in the Philippines for 3.5 weeks.  Before I left I weighed 135 lbs (I'm really short, 4 inches below the average and 3 inches shorter than you).  When I got back, I weighed 117 and shortly after lost more weight.    &amp;#x200B;  Since I couldn't b/p and I couldn't track calories since most of the food was so obscure it wasn't in MFP, I just naturally restricted.  When I did get hungry and eat, I ate mostly vegetables and fish, occasionally I had rice or a piece of bread.  When I came back, I lost some more weight, then I gained some.  Have been between 110-123 since unfortunately.  I don't know how much I weigh now since my scale is broken lmao.    &amp;#x200B;  I'm not binging as much as I did before I went to the Philippines.  I was binging and purging an average of 3-5 times a day and would regularly eat over 5,000 calories in a sitting.  I should really go back to eating vegetables and fish daily if I want to lose weight again haha.    &amp;#x200B;  Anyways, there's my life story.  Still have bulimia, but it's not nearly as bad as it once was which is good.",False,False
