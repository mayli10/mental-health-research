I take a bit of a cocktail of vitamins, but biotin and a regular multivitamin along with fish oil always work to slow my hair loss quite a lot. I had some really thick, heavy dreadlocks I wanted to take care of and they managed to stay despite the hair loss 🤷🏻‍♀️  You can get supplements specifically targeted at hair and nails but vitamins are never a bad choice for overall health 👍🏻",False,False

It happens because the hair goes into a stage called telogen effluvium. Also it could be simultaneously caused by lack of protein and iron, but even if you get adequate amounts of the two, your body is under a state of stress and this period can last a couple of months because the hair grows in cycles. :(",False,False
