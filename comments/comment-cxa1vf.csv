It honestly makes me sad for them.   I follow a few really inspiring accounts though, one being charlotte.roars, and she keeps it real. She touches on a lot that most people dont talk about. The pictures she posts of her body make me feel better about my own.  I will add that many people get triggered by her account for sh, so just beware.",False,False

This is about your life and life is already enough struggle.

From the posts here I know for a fact that that would have *fucked up* a lot of people with eating disorders, and I’m just lucky that mine manifests the way it does.   If I did need treatment for my ED, I could probably figure out a way to see a psychologist without letting my current doctors know that I’m seeing them about ED stuff, it’s just frustrating that I have to go through the back door you know? I’m actually trying to see one now anyway since I’ve realised that psychiatry is basically pseudoscience and the only thing its good for its drugs, but idk how long I’ll have to wait since theres hardly any that 1. know what ADHD is (?) and 2. know its not just a disorder for shitty 7 year old boys.",False,True

So sorry you had to go through this. Was your psychiatrist specialised in EDs as well? Or the other mental illness?  Please remember they probably ‘try’ something here and expect you to address it when it goes wrong. Of course I realise what this nice little tryout (and this is very upsetting) does to you. I almost feel they do not fully realise this mentality can make a person give up all hope in recovery. It just pushes patients away; especially in those illnesses where someone feels ‘too much’ and just want to vanish away.,False,False

You’d think that in identifying that a patient is at a high risk of developing a serious mental illness, that you would refer them to see a specialist to work through any potential issues before they arise, but fuckin NOPE all I get is a warning that if I drop below *x* weight, I’m off my meds. Thats it. No help. Just an ultimatum. I’m too afraid to ask for a referral myself, because I feel like they’ll take me off my meds. The likelihood of me deciding to recover has absolutely fucking plummeted now that it comes with going off my meds. Its fucking ridiculous, I *know* I could work through this shit with an actual professional, but I have to choose between treating one mental illness or the other. This literally means I won’t get help until I’m *fucking dying* and I know I can’t be the only one in this situation. The entire system is backwards.",False,True

I even think it might hold some people back in going into, or their progress in recovery, because these accounts confirm once again that IT IS ABOUT LOOKS. While we are talking about mental illnesses!   There's even this weird 'gap' in some of the recovery processes and insurances; focus on restoring weight (no matter what weight you are coming from), learning new coping skills, but is not long enough to completely rewire your brain. While that part is crucial to process and beating the mental illness. Insurances stop compensating and yeah what can you do, guess I'll have to continue earning money.

My choice to recover is definitely going to stem from wanting a life that's more than food and abusing my body to get as small as possible.   I'm not there yet, but I'm starting to notice how much my ED has stolen out of my life, how much I'm missing in my life because.... I want to be skinny? And skinny to the point that I feel like shit and have no energy to do anything.   A major failing of ED treatment (I feel) is the emphasis on weight restoration. Of course some people need it to function properly, but so much of recovery (from AN) is obsessed with weight gain. I think people cling to that as evidence of recovery, when in reality the majority of the work (and worthwhile part) is mental, which is not something that you can capture visually. Like what others also said, I feel like that also invalidates the hard work so many people with other EDs do in recovery.

She put up pro-Ana posters all over her shared dorm to remind herself not to eat and would binge on her roomie’s food. On social media, you probably would think that she was a recovered Anorexic because of her posts but her ED got so bad that she eventually ending up an in-patient rehab and dropping out of uni.      I feel absolutely horrible for her because she genuinely wasn’t malicious but I hated how she was posing as a recovered girl on Instagram when she was so sick because she made recovery look so easy, especially since I’ve been suffering in silence and can barely post on Instagram out of fear that people will judge my body.

And there are many of these influencers who say they are recovered or in recovery when it actually seems like they've gone from one eating disorder/obsession to another. Sooo many of them still follow the pressure from society and switch to lifting at the gym to get muscular and get a 'booty' and obsess over macros and shit to make gains and continue to put the focus on their body and posting it all over social media. Maybe they're not dying of starvation anymore but they are still stuck in the hole of body and food obsession and still require validation from the outside world.,False,False

Diet culture is to EDs as alcohol is to alcoholism.  This is one of few things I hate the feminist theory for; eating disorders have such neuropsychological mechanisms!   I totally understand not wanting to be transparent about that though. I have a large following on IG (not huge but thousands), and I post about health/wellness sometimes. When I post about fitness I post about balance at most though, because I quite frankly, don’t feel comfortable being as transparent as I’d like because of my job.   Are you talking about girls who like, basically made their recovery accounts like bordering on lifestyle accounts and have a huge following? I can’t stand that shit. I’m glad IE and working out works for them, but if they’re already being open about their ED, it’s telling if they primarily talk about fitness now? It seems obvious to me that they’re just swapping obsessions. It happens. But it’s sad nobody else sees it, so they get congratulated for it.   I went to therapy with a girl like that. She went from AN to BN to BED, got a sleeve or some kind of surgery and lost the weight, but claims it was healthy. Gained it all back and is now trying to get me to jump on some crazy workout train with her so she can be my coach. She evidently is struggling with food while struggling with exercise as it’s ALL she posts about. But everybody is congratulating her on being so healthy - which doesn’t help.

That being said, I think it’s overly simplistic and reductionist to assume that eating disorders are all about meeting societal standards of beauty.

I have virtually never had a problem with my body weight, size, or appearance (outside of my acne, but I feel like that’s pretty normal).
