The other night I was at the bar with some friends and couldn't help but judge some of the girls that were there. A lot of them were a very average/healthy weight and wearing crop tops or tighter shirts and I remember thinking how they didn't look good and feeling disgusted with myself for thinking that way. I never used to be like this, but now that I'm on the lower end of a healthy weight it's becoming more common",False,False

I looked up 1999 crop top brittney and she looks pretty slim in some of the pics but others I wouldn’t let anyone see my stomach like that   Almost any time I see women’s bodies that would generally be considered attractive I usually think I would be sooooo unhappy if I was that big  I think my idea of what looks good is fucked up bc I have always had a really flat stomach bc I had a lot of muscle from cheerleading so anything that isn’t that looks fat to me   I feel shitty for my thoughts as well though,False,False

If we were able to be 100% logical all the time, none of us would be here. I think some people are probably ""just being nice"" in the sense that they actively try to celebrate different body types, but different things are attractive to different people also. Personally I get really excited when I see average-looking (i.e. middle- to heavier side of normal weight range) in the media because underweight/lower normal is so often held up as the standard and I think it contributes a lot to peoples' body issues.  It sounds like you might be starting to develop the early stages of body dysmorphia. Nobody here can diagnose you but it might be worth reading up on/trying to be mindful of and get rid of those thoughts before they get worse. Depending on how distressing those panicky thoughts are, you might also consider seeking counseling.",False,False
