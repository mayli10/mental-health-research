I have never been like this bc I I also have depression and just struggle to do anything like baking. But I know that others I‚Äôve spoken to with EDs love cooking for others.,False,False

I don‚Äôt have anyone to bake for, lol. They literally won‚Äôt eat fresh baked bread. Last time I made some and ended up eating 1/2 the loaf myself that day...  If I had a group of people in my life that would appreciate fresh baked goods I would do it for sure! But I‚Äôm not stick thin lol.",False,False

She was in her 60s and her legs were like toothpicks.  I wasn‚Äôt ill at the time but I remember thinking she had very weird eating habits but I didn‚Äôt know exactly what her illness was.,False,False

She was so skinny, always wore black, always drank coffee, never ate, was often sick. She taught in a fast/nervous way... Idk how to describe it but it felt like she was a huge perfectionist. These obviously could be normal behaviours but combined it was too much of a coincidence.",False,False

I work in special education but I feel like I am much more clever about keeping things private (but could definitely be wrong lol). Also I would definitely never comment on a students body, how inappropriate!  I always suspected my old boss. She was alarmingly thin and always brought food she home cooked into the office to give away, even though she had two children and a husband at home. I worked for her for 2.5 years, which included many events with food, and never saw her eat anything but Greek yogurt.",False,False

She was in her 40s, about 5‚Äô2‚Äù, and very, very small. In the middle of the class we had a break and she would make peppermint tea every day just before lunch... I remember because I idealized it at the time, lol. We regularly had food-related class activities as well.  I looked up her Facebook a couple years ago and it‚Äôs just filled with food pics and people obliviously commenting on her great baking skills. I wasn‚Äôt UW in high school so it was kind of a messed-up ‚Äúthinspo‚Äù for me... She was one of my favorite teachers, too. I think she would be sad if she saw me today because anorexia has really destroyed me as an adult.",False,False

Really making herself vulnerable and opening up to me. It‚Äôs still one of the most meaningful interactions I‚Äôve ever had with a teacher and I‚Äôll never forget her.",False,False
