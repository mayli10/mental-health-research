I'm coming from being overweight as well and it is frustrating that it can be seen as invisible in a way or conveniently ignored because we aren't skinny or underweight.  You lost a lot already and that is a big accomplishment! But please remember that you can still enjoy food and eat and reach your goals. Please make it a priority to eat healthy foods over strictly low calorie junk. Malnourishment is no joke and the ramifications can last years and even have permanent effects that can be devastating to live with long after you've lost the weight. You still deserve to eat food and enjoy life. And even if you fall off the wagon, there is still redemption and you can get back on with no major consequences as far as calories go ❤",False,False
