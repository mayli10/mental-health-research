Your inner struggle is intense and you see that and are able to step out and look at the emotional upset in a logical state and choose to shift your emotions until they align with your truth. It’s an amazing skill that few are aware of and the benefits of consistently battling that inner struggle and doing so with success though a large amount of the time it won’t be easy, this is going to give you strength and build even more resilience than you have now.
