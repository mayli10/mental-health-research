It sucks to be struggling through restriction and have a friend casually say they haven't eaten in \[X\] amount of time and they didn't even notice. Or that they have to be reminded to eat or they won't. It makes me feel even more like an uncontrollable pig for struggling when they do it effortlessly.  Being hungry when nobody else is makes me feel like absolute shit, lol.",False,False
