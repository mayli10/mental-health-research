It sounds like you need to be firm with her and tell her that this is not a topic you are willing to discus with her. And if she continues leave the conversation. I don't know how old you are or what your relationship is like but the way she is treating you is not okay. Sounds like she has some narcissism issues. That's on her not you.",False,False

It's amazing to me how many people truly believe that mental illness is a *choice* and that you just need to x, y, z and it'll just ~go away~  My grandmother was also like this. She is dead now. :) This is morbid to say but, just give it time.  Also, so sorry about your grandad. I hope he makes a good recovery!",False,False
