Great to hear most of your foods have calorie counts haha! I'm not from the US so hopefully we have portions that look approximately the same,False,True

Thatâ€™s my favourite health-food snack, theyâ€™re really good. Baked pea crisps are really good safe foods too and I love them. Quorn sausages. The Sainsburyâ€™s love your veg range is a safe go-to for me. Asda brand sugar free jelly. Idk if there will be one where youâ€™re going but I love the skinny kitchen because they have calorie counts on the menu, even if theyâ€™re not that low, so I donâ€™t stress too bad because I can at least plan around them. Enjoy your trip!",False,False

I usually live off low calorie snacks/drinks that are vegan.   I absolutely ADORE snack a jacks - they have a lot of different flavours and are extremely low on calories (50kcal) and have next to nothing fat content. I highly recommend salt and vinegar instead of crisps, and the caramel one instead of biscuits, say with a coffee.   Oh and I have almond or coconut milk (15kcal) with my coffee and sweeteners.  So my coffee with a Snack a Jack only costs me 65kcal it's always been a great short boost of energy for me. I have them several times a day :)  It completely depends on you and how you eat. But basically everything in the UK has calorie count on the back and if you're in America you'll probably see our portions as quite small so I wouldn't worry. Hope you enjoy England! :D",False,False

Snack a jacks (theyâ€™re like rice cakes, I love the salt &amp; vinegar kind) are 90-100 calories per pack.  Cadbury little bars (meant for kids I think) are under 100 per bar.  Cadbury break bars (biscuity shell with soft chocolate filling) are 136 per bar.  Nairnâ€™s biscuits I believe are about 40-50 calories each, or at least the fruit &amp; spice ones are.  Jaffa cakes are 46 cals each.  Robinsonâ€™s squashâ€™d is a variety of sugar free water enhancers, I love the Blackcurrant &amp; Apple one.  Ribena light is very low in calories.  Tea is an obvious option, thereâ€™s a lot to choose from depending on what you like. My current obsession is Sainsburyâ€™s blackberry/apple/beetroot/ginger one.  Quorn has loads of options, some will be within your comfort zone and some will not but I would def recommend taking a look. Their products are found in both the refrigerated and frozen sections. Some are ready to eat, some are microwaveable, some need to be cooked in the oven.  Potato croquettes are pretty tasty. Not exactly a super low cal food but you could fit in a small portion (you need an oven to cook them though).  Most grocery stores have lower calorie ready meals.  If you have a freezer, Vienetta is a good ice cream option. 120ish cals per portion.",False,False

Also maybe I was unclear but it's not going to be the ONLY things I eat. I want cool snacks to try and to bring home etc that fit in the safe food category.  If you mean jelly as in jam then yes, if you mean jelly as in the small cups of like zero cal things no, thanks for the reminder I'll definitely look them up.",False,True

When I go travelling I feel so deprived and sad that I canâ€™t eat any new foods which I probably wonâ€™t be able to again which triggers a binge. Safe foods are basically veg and lean protein. Maybe jelly?? All things you can have anywhere in the world. Being active and doing omad puts less pressure on yourself, you look normal and you end up losing weight. Classic British food is beige carb heavy and delicious and I think you would miss out. But to answer your question: quorn sausage rolls come to mind.",False,False
