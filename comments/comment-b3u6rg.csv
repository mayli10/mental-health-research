Most effective thing is making tea with milk which I would make anyway with a binge and a hot water bottle. Binging for me tends to be a frenzied high stress thing so literally getting into bed and focusing on my senses comforts me more. I say this but yesterday I sat on the floor with tea and a hot water bottle but ended up c/s a family pack of roast chicken crisps ya win some ya lose someü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è",False,False

Something that really helped me with out-of-control binging was planning my binges in advance. Say you decide you‚Äôre gonna eat pizza and ice cream on Sunday. Then when you‚Äôre sitting around on Friday and the anxiety hits and you feel the intense need to start binging, you can remind yourself that it‚Äôs okay, you don‚Äôt need to do that now, you‚Äôre gonna eat the pizza on Sunday so you can breathe and let it go for now.   Ymmv, obviously, different people have different triggers, but I haven‚Äôt lost control around binge food in over a year since I started doing this. Might be worth a try. ",False,False
