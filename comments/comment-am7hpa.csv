You'll just get super hungry and binge again. The best thing to do is pick a calorie goal that you know works for you, eat around that amount every day, and let the binge/restriction weight gain/loss balance out over a reasonable amount of time.",False,False

I feel kinda hesitant to say this, because overdoing this is super disordered and harmful - but if you're struggling uncontrollably with how much you eat, and controlling the type or amount isn't helping, try just focusing on slowing down?  Chew for a certain amount of time, put your food down in between, etc. Give your brain time to feel satiation more.  Idk. I'm just sorry you're dealing with this. Hope you find a doable solution that helps even things out.",False,False

Being in that situation is dangerous in nature, so your body is trying to help you by making sure you're getting enough food to sustain yourself when the next period of starvation starts. Biology cares about survival, not weight targets set by the conscious part of your brain.  The solution is simple but not easy: loosen the restriction a little bit and allow a little bit of weight gain to calm your body down. Instead of fasting for 3 days after a binge, try to eat near maintenance calories on the following days instead. I understand how hard it is, but it's unfortunately the only way to come out of a cycle that would otherwise go on forever.",False,False

There easy to consume and healthy. I can give you a good recipe for a good vegetable-shake even with a video of me making it. You just need a blender.,False,False
