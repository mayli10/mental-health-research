My husband made reservations for this Brazilian BBQ restaurant which I fucking love. It‚Äôs called Fogo De Chao. I only do the market table because I‚Äôm mostly plant based, but I still go crazy because it‚Äôs bomb. And will probably get dessert after at some fancy dessert place. Eat a slice of pecan pie or something. I take the L on my birthday and Christmas as it‚Äôs the only two days I let myself go nuts. I‚Äôll be enjoying every bite. Then maybe watch a movie with my family. I‚Äôd rather have a chill night than go out drinking these days for my birthday.",False,False

I think I‚Äôm going to go on a trip with my boyfriend as well for V day!   I‚Äôm going on a trip with him this weekend. I have a general idea of where we will be going and have picked out a few things on menus already.   I prefer to stick with soups+salads when we are together. He‚Äôs aware of my ED and never questions what I order which is nice!!   Also a huge safe food for me when I‚Äôm out is meat and cheese boards because I can eat a small amount, it‚Äôs fun to eat and it‚Äôs nutritionally dense! :) goes great with wine as well! I‚Äôm so excited!",False,False
