Eating more calories and calorie dense things is very scary but I am hoping that I somehow get the strength to do so before it is too late. I am so proud of you for hitting a borderline healthy weight that is a huge accomplishment!! I hope one day I will get the strength to do so as well.,False,True

However, I do have days where I force myself to eat closer to maintenance for energy.  Iâ€™m not sure if you have many/any fear foods, but I find eating calorically dense things help. Peanut butter, nuts, rice, bread, dairy, protein powder added to soup/oatmeal etc.  You can eat small portions and still eat healthy. Meal replacement drinks/powders are good because you can drink your calories without eating.",False,False
