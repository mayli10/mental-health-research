I've always hated having big boobs and the constant issues that come with them so I feel your pain üòì The only issue now is that having lost weight and going down 3 cup sizes, is that my boobs now look even worse because they've just deflated. I swear I could pass as an 80 year old woman. I feel like I can't win.",False,False

I constantly wear a sports bra because it‚Äôs the closest I can get to having small boobs. I dress pretty androgynous when I go out and just wear my feminine clothes inside because it‚Äôs too much to wear them outside. I‚Äôm sorry you‚Äôre going through this too though.,False,True
