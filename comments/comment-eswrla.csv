When you're chewing, your glands are producing lots of spit with enzymes in them that start breaking up your food. I wouldn't say c/s is harmless but definitely less harmful than b/p",False,False

It canalso lead to law pain. However I would consider it these evil due to the forceful nature of inducing vomiting, which also can lead to throat issues, teeth issues, and other things like busted blood vessels in the eyes or extra strain on the heart",False,False
