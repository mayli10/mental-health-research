But while I already had problematic teeth as a kid, I have spent approx. $5000 (out-of-pocket, after insurance) on my teeth in 9 years, and been to the dentist 35 times. While it was not only my purging, it definitely worsened it a lot. It was never ever worth it, and for me it never resulted in weight loss either. Be careful. I hope you feel better very soon!",False,False
