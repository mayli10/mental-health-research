First, make sure you are getting enough electrolytes and nutrients. Vitamins but DO NOT take more than one type of multivitamin, they arenâ€™t all water soluable. Deficiencies can make cravings worse.   Figure out when you are more likely to binge and what triggers are. If itâ€™s right before bed, heck, take your sleeping pill and get cozy. If itâ€™s after an argument, try to avoid those, etc.   From experience - fasting and breaking it is a rough cycle. Pick whatever number you are comfortable with, as close to 1200 and try to eat high protein/satiety foods (you can google that for a scale - potatoes actually rate as keeping you full longer!). If you need bulk food to be okay, chow down on a mound f veggies, sliced nice.   You got this. Itâ€™s super hard and awful when our bodies and minds do this shit, it is NOT your fault you feel like this. Itâ€™s a genetic linked crappy set of disorders. People (us randos here and like, professionals too) are here for you. We keep picking each other up. Iâ€™m sorry youâ€™re stuck in a binge cycle rn. Dawn will break on the horizon eventually ðŸ’•",False,False

Iâ€™ve felt like this and still do have those days. My best suggestion for when being around all the food at home is to get a pair of headphones and go for a long ass walk. Feel the sun on your skin, get some fresh air on your lungs, hear the music in your ears, and answer to no one. Itâ€™s very healing for me at least. You can go for as long and as far as you want too.   Iâ€™m at a point in my life where I basically feel stuck and itâ€™s depressing. I donâ€™t know where else to go but Iâ€™m here I guess and this sub and this community is my support rn. I hope I can be a little support to you in this moment.",False,False

I was happy at my lw, I didn't even want to lose any more weight, I felt really fucking good about myself for the first time ever and I was having the time of my life. I was beautiful. then I went home to my family started eating uncontrollably and gained 10 pounds in like two months. I totally lost the ability to restrict, I used to be able to do three day fasts and suddenly I couldn't go an hour without stuffing my face. it only escalated and got worse and worse and ultimately i ended up gaining 30 pounds above my lw.    the thing that stopped my gaining personally was medically withdrawing from uni and checking myself into residential treatment. im mostly better now (and maintaining/slowly losing), but part of me wishes that i wouldve gone earlier, to have minimized the weight gain, you know? like, i couldve arrested it earlier, i couldve learned to love myself and maintain my weight at a lower (but still healthy) weight... so that's the advice im gonna give you. i mean, if its feasible for you; it might not be. in any case I understand you completely, and you can vent to me if you think it'll help at all.    and you know, i'm sorry you're going through this. it's a wretched life to have to live, it's a goddamn waking nightmare, and i know nothing is working, and i know you're trying your hardest, and i know you're suffering, and i feel for you. i have compassion for you. and i promise you that no matter what, you will survive this. you will come out the other side, no matter where that other side ends up being, or what it looks like, or how long it takes. this will not be forever.",False,False
