But! You don't have to just throw out these clothes. The key is strategic combining. Like, don't dress head to toe in old clothes. Mix and match the mid-2010s clothes with trendier styles, and/or with visibly vintage/retro items. The pieces will blend in better that way, and can easily look nice as part of an ensemble.  &gt; buy timeless pieces  meh, overrated! What's timeless, anyway? Basic button downs, slacks in neutral shades, LBDs? First of all, screw that if it's not your style. Second, no matter how ""timeless"" an item allegedly is, it's going to be influenced by its temporal context. The cut of shirts and pants, the detailing, the whole *idea* of trench coats, etc - that stuff is cyclical. (The only style that is more immune to this stuff is trad, bc much of the whole idea is to buy items that can last you for 20 years, but a. that shit's obviously expensive, and b. I would not recommend dressing that way unless you actually want to.)  P.S. -  &gt; crop tops with the playstation logo from forever21  dude I just want you to know that this doesn't sound dated, it sounds godly",False,False

I literally bought that after being weight-restored with the intention to get skinny and look cute in it. Ended up selling it online :')  Yeah since then my fashion sense has skewed a bit classier I hope. Mostly basic looks like jeans+white tee or black circle skirt+colored tank.
