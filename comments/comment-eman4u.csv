I actually told her about eating disorders because I knew that she would not care. My mom thinks that eating disorders are in general good, until you start to ""look like a monkey"" (she calls very skinny people monkeys)  TW: diets and calories   If I told her I'm planning on eating 1200 kcal that day, she would tell me ""no don't do that, 900 should be a lot already"". Or if I'm eating chips she will say ""just 3 chips should be enough"". I've been (literally) obese almost my whole life so I understand her concerns. Any weight loss from me in any method would make her very happy. (Too bad I almost only binge or high restrict so no weight loss from me ðŸ™ƒ)  Anyways, perhaps your mom is the same way..?",False,False
