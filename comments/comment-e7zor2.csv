I mean the entire show of intervention is about that exactly. But what they don’t know is it can be so damaging, communication is always the best way to support someone.   You noticed they were slipping and you’re mad they didn’t tell you?! Well if you noticed why didn’t you reach out and say “hey i see you need help, what can I do?”   People say it’s too hard for them to watch a loved one struggle, but imagine you are the one struggling and your partner walked away? It’d feel pretty horrible right?",False,False

You obviously don't have to stay and watch that. He could still have treated OP with respect,False,False

You’re not obligated to stay with someone who is mentally ill. It’s very draining.  I say this as someone who is VERY extremely mentally ill.,False,False

He treated it like a decision. He said that she clearly didn't care enough if she can't use their relationship as motivation to be healthy. That's not how an illness works. It isn't a decision. He is refusing to understand her. OP deserves that her illness be treated with respect. He isn't obligated to stick around and watch her die if that's something he is worried will happen, but he shouldn't treat her like her problems are her fault. Nobody chooses to be mentally ill. It's just as nobody chooses to have cancer or diabetes or physical illnesses. Nobody would treat somebody so awful if they had a disease that might kill them. Eating disorders are no different. They're a deadly disease of the brain.",False,False

Mental illnesses are awful and sad and difficult and they are draining both to the person who suffers and to the loved ones. He doesn’t have to take OP’s illness personally. But he was in a relationship with OP, and that’s a lot of emotional weight that he was inevitably carrying around, and I’m sure he has his own demons to deal with let alone another person’s.  He’s not an asshole just because he doesn’t want to see someone he cares about hurt themselves while they are virtually helpless in all capacities.  You don’t know OP’s story or OP’s relationship with the ex boyfriend. You don’t know how long they dated. For all you know, the ex could have tried over and over to be there for OP, but OP’s illness is bigger than what he could handle.   OP- I am sorry for your loss and I am sorry that you have to go through this. Heartbreak is awful, I know. And I feel for you. It will get better with time. Use this as motivation to care for yourself. It’s true, that you can’t love other people wholly until you love yourself. Take care, you are stronger than you know.",False,False

It's a legitimate mental illness. If he doesn't understand that and just expects you to be over it you are better off without him &lt;3,False,False

You're better off without somebody who refuses to understand what a struggle an eating disorder is. It's a mental *illness*. You didn't choose it. He shouldn't take your health problems personally.,False,False
