Regardless of what your uncle SAYS he prefers, he’s chosen to be with her :( and it’s really not fair to her that you expect her to be shunned from the family simply because she has the body she does. Imagine if someone felt that way about you and said they didn’t want you around because they couldn’t stand looking at you? Even if she’s a horrible person, it’s not chill to let your ED affect your treatment of others so much ...   I’m incredibly triggered by someone in my family who is much much thinner than I am - but I have to set my feelings aside and treat them with love and equality because their body isn’t the way it is to specifically attack me/make me feel insecure (even though that’s how it makes me feel). Sending love to you this holidays, I know these feelings are super hard to deal with.",False,False
