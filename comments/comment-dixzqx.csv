I hope your can stop putting their ideas of self-image onto herself, and come up with her own way to feel beautiful.",False,False

They aren't helping heal the mind,  they are just replacing one neurosis with another. I get where you're coming from but that isn't recovery. She still agonizes over food, it's now just opposite. Food is now the crutch, and whenever she chooses something lower calorie/healthier, it causes stress and anxiety because ""the Emily program wouldn't approve, am I failing recovery??""   Idk I get what you're saying but you mentioned brainwashing and to me, that does sorta seem like brainwashing. Like I said, it's just replacing one neurosis with another.   Other therapy I've been involved in absolutely doesn't handle EDs like that. Even trying to be objective, it just doesnt seem like a healthy thing and doesn't scream ""recovery "" to me.",False,False

I don't even know how you could in a reasonable amount of time without some serious brainwashing. I guess most recovery clinics are ""they're either gonna be overweight and alive or underweight and dead, I guess we're going the overweight direction,"" it's faster, easier. Not sure if my idea is even accurate, since I've never been through a recovery program.",False,False

She replaced her purging and over exercising and restriction with eating her feelings, and was told ""you're overweight now and there's nothing wrong with that, embrace it!""  She is also now terrified of choosing healthier, low calorie options because the Emily program drilled it into her head that she should eat whatever whenever, and to not do it is Very Bad.   Idk man I'm all for self love but there's gotta be some kind of middle ground... I want to learn how to take care of my body by not only not punishing it the way I do, but also by giving it healthy options as much as I can. I know it's easier said than done but shouldn't recovery from an ED be about making peace with sometimes indulging, trying to make healthy decisions for your body as much as possible (but not agonizing over when you dont) and not using food as either a comfort crutch OR a weapon against yourself?",False,False
