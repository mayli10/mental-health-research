The worst part to me right now (and yes I know this is fucked up) but I switch from ana to binge lately and I KNOW it’s because of my overachieving perfectionist shit. I was falling asleep at work and falling behind. So I started eating and now I’m at such an uncontrollable place. I feel lost in an absolute spiral and just want my control back.,False,False

I think what is also worst is when you’re a perfectionist already, so you do not want to burden anyone with your disorder, but you’re just like please help I know I look like I have it all together, but alas it isn’t the case. This is just so relatable honestly!",False,False

All I could think was that nothing matters if I’m not superlatively beautiful and almost universally desired then everything is worthless.  I know people don’t like me—I can see it in their eyes.

EDs can be about anything. My eating disorder sprang from my body dysmorphia as a child in elementary school and my desire to be “different”. I had Leukemia as an infant and I was always treated differently and when I began school, I was devastated, I hated people. I’ve always wanted to be “perfect”, but I feel like I “don’t give a f—-“ about other’s opinions. It’s conflicting. I’ve just recently recovered from AN, it had taken 1 hospitalization. My depression has costed 3 hospitalizations. I now still suffer from low pulse and crackling/noisy joints. But it’s improving.  With 2020, I want to start new, I’m trying to join the US nat. Guard. And step away from this past life that’s holding me back. I’ve always worked hard in school like you said. Now it’s time that I work to be the best that I can comfortably as an individual.   It’s a darned struggle when you’re not “active”, not “normal” not “sick”.  F These Labels and do what’s best for yourself, I tell my friend with an ED that they should get better for themselves, that’s what I did and that’s why I haven’t taken my life.   Have a wonderful weekend, do whatever you want to, I’m going to read some books or something idk. But do enjoy yourself :D",False,False
