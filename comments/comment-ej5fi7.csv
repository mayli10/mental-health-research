I only developed restrictive eating as of August this year. Prior to this, I‚Äôve been morbidly obese my whole life. So my context might not be suitable for what you‚Äôre asking!   Also, I spent this year mainly focusing on my Masters, not in a classroom. I only graduated with my teaching degree in 2017, and did short-term contracts and relief teaching for 2017 and 2018, started my Masters in 2018 and finished in this year.   So, I did most of this when I was morbidly obese and struggling with overeating, and it was definitely tough in that aspect - physically and mentally. The stress of placements and teaching in general led to a lot of stress eating.   Now I do restriction and fasting, and I think I would deal with the same stress in the form of restricting hard now - that‚Äôs what I do currently with other stress.   So..sorry, I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve really answered your question! I also have other mental health issues that impact my work, studies etc. but I know there are people in this sub from all walks of life, careers and contexts. I think if you made a post asking your question, people can give some good insight.  I think a part of it relates to how much ‚Äúcontrol‚Äù you have of your eating disorder, and if you have any support in place. And just I guess how you handle this sort of thing as a person.   I don‚Äôt think having an ED and being a teacher is any different to other people with an ED in their jobs. Obviously you wouldn‚Äôt share with the children or demonstrate unhealthy behaviours in front of them, but that‚Äôs easy to not do.  Also, teaching is tiring. I would be exhausted a lot - I was obese and not healthy. Now I restrict and lack energy on that aspect. I‚Äôm not sure how I‚Äôd go in a classroom right this second. I guess I‚Äôll find out next year as I‚Äôm job hunting right now lol. My Masters specialised in Librarianship so I am also seeking out librarian jobs. But if you make sure you get your energy in other ways you should be okay.   I will say that when I started the restrictive eating, I was finishing up my Masters and final portfolio assessment. At the beginning of restriction, I didn‚Äôt feel many negative impacts and was able to easily submit the assignment. Now however, I lack concentration, energy and find it hard to focus and remember things. If I didn‚Äôt finish my Masters assignment in early September, I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôd have been able to do it now.  So if you restrict and suffer the negative impacts like lack of concentration, I think you may find assignments and studying harder than you need. However I‚Äôve been awful and not taken vitamins or anything like I should have, so there would be ways to manage this I think.  Anyway, hope any of this helped. Definitely make your own post asking though!",False,False
