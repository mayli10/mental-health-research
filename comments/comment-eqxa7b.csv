She's literally described as 5'8, 170lbs in the book.   I actually thought it was really cool for that to be in the book; because she's portrayed as this super smart, super desirable curvy girl. The main character mentions how 'rubanesqe' or 'classical' she looks, and just fawns over her and thinks she's mindblowingly hot.  I'm 5'8 and chubby,  so it actually was really encouraging for me to read a book where the ""It Girl"" was curvy, and it was...desirable?   Your boyfriend just has weirdly specific, unreasonable ideals.",False,False

All of us telling you to dump him probably isn't helpful, but I know from experience that when an SO comments on body image, it's something that sticks with you and will be in the back of your mind for a long time. If you're someone good at forgiving people and extending grace, then you're a fucking saint but he's dumb. LOL  Much love to you OP &lt;3",False,False

I cannot see any value in him if he thinks someone with a low-normal BMI is fat, says so to his girlfriend with a higher BMI, and then goes on to say his girlfriend with an eating disorder is being stupid for being hurt by that.

What the fuck??  I could not cope. Fuck that is so stupid. I don't know how anyone could call her fat in that movie. She is slim and pretty and conventionally attractive.  Also I totally know what you mean about the movie. I would have loved it save for the hamfisted romance.

So while she’s thin, the average person (unlike an ed brain like mine lol) wouldn’t really focus on her weight or think about it.
