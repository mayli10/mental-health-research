You may feel like you care about your weight, but that's not true. Sometimes people do feel better after losing weight, but the underlying cause is almost always some other thing that the ED sufferer isn't dealing with. Perhaps they don't even know what that thing is.",False,False

I honestly dont even consider losing weight from an ED as an accomplishment.  It doesn't really feel earned. I dont even know what's making me feel unhappy anymore. And I've given up on ever feeling an ounce of happiness anymore. I know that sounds depressing but this whole fucking subreddit is depressing. Also, fasting is insanely easy when you're overweight. I'm hungry all the time at the weight I'm at now and can't fast for shit. ",False,True

Is there something else in your life making you unhappy? When I get down, I find trying to connect with old (or new) friends to feel like a person again and feel like a functional human in society. Also reading books is a great way to get out of your head and into a story.         PS: A whole week fast. Wow. That's insane. I would probably be so hangry and non-functional! Well done.
