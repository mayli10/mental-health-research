When I said I'd lost a bit if weight she told me I needed to eat more, so I bought a sandwich with her, then brought it back to my dorm, and then binged and purged it lmao. Wtf I don't understand why positive feedback makes my ED worse but it does :))))",False,False

It’s like validation that all my hard work is FINALLY paying off. I am currently working toward hearing my husband say that I am small. It’s all I’ve wanted for the past few years. I had a dream where he hugged me and told me I was so small it felt like I would break, and that dream is what kicked off my relapse and current restrict/binge cycle. I still think about it to motivate myself.",False,False
