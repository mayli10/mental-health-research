Guess what I inherited??   Even when I lost a good chunk of weight I still feel sooooo big and my boobs are the worst part. I‚Äôm a fucking E cup now, officially. I hunch so my T-shirt‚Äôs don‚Äôt form a massive tent over my boobs even though I‚Äôm fairly certain I‚Äôd look better in a more form fitting shirt because I just can‚Äôt handle the world seeing my stomach and ‚Äúwaist‚Äù (if you can even call it a waist). So yeah my posture is pretty trash.",False,False

I just buy baggy clothes now because I feel like fit clothing just make my proportions and my posture look weirder. If I straighten my body, it appears like I'm trying to accentuate my boobs and my butt however it looks horrible because I got nothing there to show lmao! But at least, baggy shirt and pants make me look and feel skinnier üòÇ",False,True
