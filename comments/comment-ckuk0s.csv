And why tf does it HELP Marley? Anyone with an ED irl would just be pissed off by some guy saying “I don’t care if you throw up but I’m going to make your eating disorder about me because I don’t want to kiss a girl with puke breath” stfu.  The episode where Mercedes has an eating disorder for all of 4 hours (and is still eating a lot? Lol?) and passes out from replacing ONE meal with a SMOOTHIE pisses me off more though. And acting like all dieting is starving yourself and unhealthy and weight is unchangeble. Plus wtf is up with them acting like you see everyone as food and want to eat them?,False,False
