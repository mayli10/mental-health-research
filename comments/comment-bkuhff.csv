She doesn‚Äôt know it but she is the reason tonight will be the first night that the food I‚Äôm eating is staying in my stomach and the first night I‚Äôm not eating six pounds of food and throwing it up. This will also be the first night I don‚Äôt wake up choking because my stomach has given up and forced the half digested food back up as I sleep. I‚Äôm going to sleep without worrying that somehow the bags of vomit in the corner will spill all over the floor and expose me to everyone.  I don‚Äôt think she like me though. That‚Äôs okay‚Äîmost people don‚Äôt.   Tonight I will challenge my body dysmorphia and say ‚ÄúI am thin. I‚Äôm not as thin as I‚Äôd like to be, but I AM thin. I do not need to purge.‚Äù",False,False

I'm anxious all the time and can't even enjoy the weekend because I just keep thinking about how I have to go back to work on Monday.
