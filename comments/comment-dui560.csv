The Goodwill dressing room mirrors are bomb tho i use them to take progress pics of me in my undies every week so i can make sure i'm not getting fat since i don't have a full length mirror in my room at home. And the ones at Marshall's are good too. It's weird how different mirrors can distort your body,False,False
