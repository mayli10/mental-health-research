I find that sweaters that gather at the bottoms and sleeves make you look worse and they’re less comfortable and you have to stress over whether it’s gathering at the right spot throughout the day. Alternatively slightly form fitting t-shirt and pants + a loose jacket that hits just below the hips (windbreaker, varsity jacket etc.) is also an a++ choice for hiding the weight gain",False,False

I find that form fitting black clothing (NOT necessarily tight) always makes people think I look “good” compared to colorful  clothing that may not smooth over my fat. Sometimes I’ll wear the black jeans with a black turtleneck and it looks both sleek and slimming.  Also scarves. Big shawl-like scarves you can drape around your upper body and hide away some insecurities.,False,False
