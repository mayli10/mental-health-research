Maybe every time you don’t binge, take that money you were going to spend on it and put it away and save for something you really want! I super cute dress, shoes, makeup, a game, literally anything.  And this state of mind used to really help me get through things too. I see a plate of food or a snack in front of me. In about 30 seconds, the food is gonna be gone and I’m gonna be stuck with 300+ calories or whatever. If I have the willpower to not eat it for only 30 seconds, then I just saved those calories! Instead I drink water or tea, go on a random YouTube video spree, or literally just do anything to distract me from eating.  Purging was just the worst and I would always be crying after (most of the time involuntarily). There are also these lollipops called Yum Earth or something like that that are superrrr low cal, taste amazing, and give your mouth something to do!  Good luck xx",False,False
