We’d been dating for 4.5 years at that point, and something in my head just switched and I got disordered af.  We’re long distance too, which I think made it both harder and easier to tell him.  We were Skyping, and I couldn’t say it out loud, so I just typed it in the chat.    There’s never a good time to bring it up.  If you guys video chat often, I’d suggest bringing it up about a third of the way through the time of a normal session.  That gives you some time to chat and relax into talking with him, time to prepare yourself, and then enough time afterwards to talk about it and answer any of his questions.    It does seem like he probably has some inkling that something is wrong, but it sounds like he’s nothing like your ex.  I doubt you’ll have the same issues, and if you do, that will give you a heads up that maybe he’s not for you.  Either way, only good can come out of telling him.",False,False

I think it would be hard to bring up such a heavy topic when you're on the other side of it (the outsider to the disorder).   When I've had to tell my SO something heavy I've written him a letter so I can get everything I want out and in a way I control (face to face is too unpredictable for me around some topics). Maybe you could write a him a note about it? ,False,False
