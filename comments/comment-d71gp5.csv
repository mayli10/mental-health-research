It’s because eating disorders are egosyntonic, meaning the disordered thoughts align with a person’s core beliefs about themselves. You see this very clearly in anorexics who are in denial, scary thin and insisting they feel awesome and everyone is just jealous while their loved ones are begging them to seek treatment. So if you truly believe “I’m better when I’m thinner” or “I deserve to live like this” or “I’m not worth anything if I’m above x weight” why would you disagree when the disorder is not only reinforcing these beliefs but offering you a means to achieve what you want? If you truly believe that your eating disorder is what makes you special and allows you to feel accomplished, why would you want anyone to take that away from you? Part of overcoming the ambivalence is deciding that these beliefs are not longer part of your core and replacing them with something healthier. I would bring up your ambivalence with your therapist. I’m sure they see this all the time. You should figure out which parts of the eating disorder agrees with your worldview and think real hard about if these beliefs are conductive to your growth and ability to thrive. You’re at a crossroads right now but you’ll be okay. You’re not horrible, or messed up for being reluctant to let go. We all cling to something until it doesn’t serve us anymore. I really hope you decide the ED isn’t serving you.",False,False
