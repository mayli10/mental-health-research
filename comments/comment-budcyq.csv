My two closest friends used to make fun of me in high school for being the fat one. Now that we’re in uni, they’ve both gained so much weight that they’re definitely in the obese range at this point. I love my friends so much and I want them to be healthy, but I can’t help but feel like I’m winning now, even though I’m pretty heavy myself. Especially since they STILL make fun of my weight when they’re so much bigger now...",False,False

I have a friend who has an ED and she fasts everyday and once I found out she fasts, I won’t eat until I see her eat. If she lets me know her longest fast, I will make my fast 3 hours longer just to make sure she doesn’t beat me. BUT ITS NOT EVEN A RACE",False,False
