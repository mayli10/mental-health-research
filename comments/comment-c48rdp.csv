I usually aim for a German-pancake consistency batter, so I guess like a thick cake batter but not as thick as brownie batter.   Heat coconut oil in a nonstick pan, pour in a little glob of batter (want pancakes to be just smaller than my spatula). Watch while cooking to see the edges begin to brown or until I smell a little burning/over caramelizarion, then CAREFULLY slide a spatula under and gently flip and cook until same.   When done stack and pour maple syrup over, sprinkle with cinnamon, and if I’m feeling REALLY indulgent, a spoonful of coconut yogurt.",False,False
