I have a phobia of heart problems tho so it sort of works in my case. People should be more mindful of the fact that something that helps someone might make someone else feel worse. ðŸ’•,False,False

Someone somewhere is telling me Iâ€™m going to die like let me breathe. Stop choking me. If thatâ€™s all you have to say, then honestly donâ€™t comment. Iâ€™m anorexic but continuously telling me Iâ€™m going to die isnâ€™t helping me.",False,True

Whether or not you choose recovery does not effect the lives of people online, but they want to encourage you to save your own life. Eating disorders do start as coping mechanisms and then branch out to hinder your life instead of help it, if a person is aware of the fact that they are using maladaptive coping strategies to get by in life and aware that they are doing it for that reason it becomes a bit ignorant. I speak for myself in saying that, itâ€™s not a strength to hold on to something thatâ€™s maladaptive and harmful, itâ€™s fear, and itâ€™s your ED that makes you irritated that anyone may possibly provide logical, rational and helpful information that frightens it.",False,False
