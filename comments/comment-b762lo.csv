I drink a lot of water and take vitamins (including a multivitamin, calcium iron magnesium and fish oil supplements).   Also i time meals so that they occur 2-3 hours before any energy drains (like a workout). ",False,False

I’m anaemic and my iron levels are actually 6 μg/L, when they should be 110 μg/L in a woman. Needless to say, I am exhausted, all of the time. I get up, drag myself to the coffee machine and make a latte, after I drink it, I head straight to the gym, and do either a 45 minute cardio workout, or a 20 minute cardio workout and then 30 minutes of weights. Ironically, the workouts help me focus on my studies.  I’m doing a law degree, so I’m expected to be very high functioning. But I’m struggling to get things done. I’m pushing myself to finish readings and prepare for assignments. I’m actually dropping a unit, but I’m still going to doing a study load that’s about 30 hours a week instead of 45 hours a week.  The answer for me is just forcing myself to do what I can. I’m getting a fast acting injection next week, which will help. But it’s still struggle town.",False,False

It seems to help with my focus otherwise I zone out a ton.  Also sleep, I sleep 9 to 10 hours a night. ",False,False

And hyper-healthy foods when I can. Lots of veggies, some protein (usually a boiled chicken drumstick w/o skin), a couple nuts for fat, and a tiny amount of fruit for carbs. Orthorexic restriction is always easier than normal restriction for me. It's still hard, but my body still feels slightly better than vs when I try to get my nutrition from processed things. They give me more energy, and they cut my appetite down, so win-win.",False,False
