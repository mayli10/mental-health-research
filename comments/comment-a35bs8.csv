I thought Iâ€™d go to therapy biweekly for a month or two and Iâ€™d be cured of *all* my problems. Nope. 6 years later and Iâ€™m still working on some of them. Good luck in therapy!,False,False

She had *no* idea why I wasn't better after talking to my therapist once. Like, after one session you've barely even covered the issues you wanna work on! I guess maybe healthier people think of it more like a doctor's appointment- you go, they tell you what's wrong, you immediately do whatever remedy they suggest to fix it, and BAM, you're cured!  I wish it were that easy tbh. ",False,False
