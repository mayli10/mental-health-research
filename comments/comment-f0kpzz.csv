Like we ate healthy food for all meals and didn't snack daily, but like if I asked for a twix or something they'd buy me one next time they went to the grocery store, so I never really developed strong cravings? Even now its more like there are things I want to eat but not anything that's like urgent if that makes sense lmao",False,False
