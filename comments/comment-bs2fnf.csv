I’ll think I look okay in a mirror, but then when I see my reflection in a shop window or something I’ve suddenly transformed into a completely different person?? it’s really distressing and of course my brain is like “wELl ObVIouSLy tHE BiGgER ONe iS ThE REal ONe” bc my brain is an asshole",False,True

I'd get to the bottom, start getting these moments, bring binging back, gain, hate myself and welcome back the dysmorphia 24/7, restrict, get to the bottom.....   I have no idea if I'm mentally better or worse right now, but this is changing. I am in the middle of the 20 right now on the way down. I've been getting muscular so I look much smaller at the same weights... I am getting these moments constantly and it's not ruining my progress! I am liking how I look and I can't wait to see how I look once I get to the bottom of the 20 or even lower! Also I'm eating a little more a day (after the gym), and by taking more a day I haven't been binging!   I'm not super skinny (BMI ~21-22) so my advice may not track for you, but it's been kinda bliss restricting while loving the changes/how I'm looking",False,False
