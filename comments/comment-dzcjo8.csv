I grew up with my mum complaining about her 'fat' legs...and I'm the same shape as her. I don't see too much disordered behaviour from her but her attitude to weight and her appearance and her low self esteem has been a looming black cloud all my life. I wish she could be as confident as she deserves to be. She tries to counter my ED but tbh her actions speak a lot louder than her words. I don't blame her for my ED at all but sometimes it's hard to recover when she's going on about her latest diet book or how to dress to look thinner.",False,False

She claims she recovered cause she had to eat for the baby (me!). And from what I've seen, she has. Like people have said before, recovery isn't a one way street, and I can still see some ED tendencies/behaviors, but maybe im just projecting.  She was never intentionally mean, and never forced me into some weird diet. It was just those off hand comments that sort of snowballed into something bigger. I remember the first instance when I wore a tank top and she said ""what happened to your stomach?!"" Or joking about how I should be good at swimming cuz I was all fat. LMAO. I really don't think she meant any harm, though. Shes never made any negative comment about herself or her body around me, (besides grey hair lol), and she's never mentioned how I look again. (I think she knows). But she does still make offhand comments on food, like ""this makes me feel less guilty (when eating)"" and she often uses the exercise bike/treadmill after a heavy eating day. I'm sure these behaviours have influenced me somehow but not in a direct way at all, and definitely not with any ill intentions. Sorry if this isn't relevant for your term paper.",False,False

She was worried about me. I didn't believe it was genuine. How could it be when she was the one telling me to lose weight. Shouldn't she be proud that I was finally skinny? She wouldn't let me leave the table unless I had finished my meal. It would take me hours. I relapsed awhile back and she told me she was worried. That a relapse would be hard to beat. I won't lie there was a point in my life were I hated my mother but I tell myself I can't fully blame her. If I wasn't weak minded I wouldn't have developed an ED. That sounds awful. Sorry you had to go through that. People think all mothers are nice and loving but sometimes they're the ones hurting you the most.,False,False

She would call herself fat even though she was very muscular/in-shape and did yoga regularly, as well at taught classes for it. She ate very healthy, too, and raised me on healthy foods, no fast food, no added sugars, that kind of stuff. But still she would always tear down her appearance and make comments towards mine as well.  One specific memory I have is the first time I went bra shopping with her. We went to Victoria‚Äôs Secret and I got measured and they told me I was a 30A but that they didn‚Äôt carry any 30‚Äôs so how about I try a 32A and just buckle it closed on the tightest clasp. Well, I did that, and my mom looked at me from behind and squeezed that part of my back right above the band and said ‚Äúoh you‚Äôre getting a little chubby aren‚Äôt you?‚Äù  I had been aware of my body before then, but that was the spark that made me so hyper-aware of my body that I regularly hated it.",False,False

When I was 4 she was admitted to the hospital I think she was like 70 lbs or something. But I don‚Äôt remember it I just remember her bragging about it growing up. She also would tell us she had dreams at night of being that skinny again.. Uhm so yeah both me and my older sister became bulimic so she really did influence us a lot. She would make family dinner but never eat with us and if she did she would cut everything a million times and eat super super slow. Like she never ate. I do remember wondering why she never ate when I was like 7 maybe. She would fat shame other people all the time and even give them dirty looks. But on the flip side when I became bulimic and started exercising  a lot and became ‚Äúskinny‚Äù she turned ice cold towards me. Like pretty much ignored me from the time I was 15-22. She had a ton of self hatred and just growing up she was really distant because she was preoccupied with her body image. I get a little upset over it cause when I was 16 my brother caught me throwing up and told my mom on me. She forced me to tell my dad and I did hoping I would get help but he just yelled at me saying it was phase and to knock that shit off and she just sat there and didn‚Äôt say anything. I will say she had a big influence on me getting help when I was able to myself because I didn‚Äôt want to be miserable and hate myself my whole life like that.,False,False
