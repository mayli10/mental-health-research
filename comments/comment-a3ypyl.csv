Itâ€™s sucks because I know Iâ€™ll never achieve a tiny waist. (Doesnâ€™t stop me from trying ðŸ¤ª)  Anyway I cope by looking at a bunch of fashion blogs who have rectangular builds and try to copy their looks. A lot of people have complimented my style so that helps me fight the ed voice telling me Iâ€™m an alien. ðŸ˜‚,False,False

Have you tried wearing high-waisted pants with a shorter top (not a crop top, but something that hits just below the waist of the pants). I honestly don't have much of waist (short-waisted like you) but whenever I wear outfits like I just described, people are like, ""WOW your waist is so tiny!""  My waist is not tiny. I don't want to post my measurements because I understand this sub is trying to get away from triggering stuff like that, but I think accentuating my waist works for me because, paired with my very broad shoulders and hips, it can make me look like I have an hourglass figure.

I have really wide shoulders (and wide hips), and anything vaguely loose fitting makes me look like a huge box.
