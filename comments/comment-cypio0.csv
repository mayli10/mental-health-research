Mostly Meredith. Didnâ€™t help that I was in nursing school so I would compare how I looked in scrubs to them.   Honestly itâ€™s just super annoying how tv/movies make being SUPER skinny look totally normal and like everyone just naturally looks that way. Meanwhile theyâ€™re drinking a bottle of tequila every night and eating meals from vending machines? Yeah fucking right.,False,False
