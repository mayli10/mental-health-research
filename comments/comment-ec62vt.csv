I do think thrusting has helped me. Another thing that’s helped is I will limit myself to one item each time so that way I can get something like every week but it’s still cheaper than if I went less and got more and for me it’s mostly a high of the initial unpacking at home I think.   You’re probably right! I mean I even found it in the shirts section but the problem is that it’s super super tight along my abdomen and torso. It actually goes over my butt okay and I think it’s cute because it’s really short and I actually like my legs a lot. If I don’t naturally end up fitting into it eventually I’ll get resonate it i think.",False,True

I will still head back to impulse territory but thrifting definitely helped, as I realized sometimes its about the hunt more than the actual purchase. I also use a budgeting app and i set a limit for clothes every month and if i dont use it i roll it over to the next! Its helped curve my shopping to more of a necessity/long term clothing rather than buying random, hard to match pieces here and there.   Perhaps the dress is intended for juniors? Junior sizing can definitely run a little less accommodating for a typical adult body. But yes that was actually a problem i had with the skirt, if my torso was longer it would have fit snugly at my waist but the shape seems more like its for a tall teen. I think the store was intended for older teenagers so im not surprised.",False,False

I’m glad I’m not alone in this, but I’m also sorry that sounds really stressful since it was an expensive skirt too! I feel lucky mine was so cheap I could theoretically even through it away if I need to.   I have a bit of a shopping addiction at the moment but I’m trying to detach my value from clothes. I think I also have the same problem with the sizing, this dress wouldn’t even probably fit me if I was very very thin... it just seems built for a tinier and smaller boned person overall. Like genuinely someone 2 inches taller or a child maybe? I’m actually wondering if it might be for a kid because it’s just so tiny.",False,True

Idk i was stupid that day and really wanted it but they didnt have the next size up which wouldve been tight but not leave-my-skin-red tight, haha. Occasionally ill fit into it but i have come to the rationality to realize that the band cuts into my ribs slightly and no matter what it will be slightly uncomfortable as i legitimately think my body type is keeping me from being smaller in that area. Feelsbadman  (but also try not to be too hard on yourself if it doesnt end up fitting!)",False,False

Aha, I’m sorry you didn’t get to ever! What did it look like?   And awe thank you :) best of luck to you too",False,True

I put it on over the weekend thinking maybe i finally fit in it!  And now it’s too big.  Good luck to both of us!,False,False
