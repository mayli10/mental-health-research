I think 1,200 calories/day is the generally accepted healthy minimum for dieting. So your therapist definitely shouldn’t be suggesting &lt;800. Your struggles are valid!",False,False

There are *way* more empathetic and helpful ways to express the same idea.    And honestly the idea comes down to the fact that the DSM5 diagnostic criteria are sometimes very silly. Humans observed other humans and then tried to put the latter into discrete boxes, each with specific diagnostic criteria. (Spoiler - we don’t fit that well into arbitrary boxes.) Some criteria are lists and you need to match at least some number out of the total. Some criteria are ‘you gotta have this one to be assigned this diagnosis’. Which is what happens with the AN dx. (Weight is built into the criteria iirc) So someone can have all the experiences, thoughts, and feelings that are part of anorexia, but they’ll be put into a separate diagnostic box until a semi-arbitrary threshold is crossed.    The human experience is far more complex and amorphous than the diagnostic checklist captures. And regardless of what box my doctor checks on their forms, what matters most is getting help that is effective for me. I hope you are finding help that works for you &lt;3",False,False
