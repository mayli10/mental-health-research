But if that‚Äôs NOT what you want, and you have no religious objection towards it, maybe you should consider having an abortion? It will be easier to make that decision than to carry/birth/raise or adopt out a child that you do not want to have. And I hope no one thinks I‚Äôm saying this out of ED-encouraging shite. I just believe it‚Äôs a good choice for a gal who‚Äôs not at a point in her life where she wants to give her body, time, and emotions to have a kid.  Don‚Äôt feel like your life is ruined, it doesn‚Äôt have to be either way. My DM‚Äôs are open for you no matter your situation or choices!! If you need any support or an objective ear to lend, let me know! üíñ",False,False

But, I realized that it was no longer about just me. I quit smoking the moment I got a positive test, cold turkey. And I made sure to eat anything and everything I craved despite dealing with the insecurity because not only was my body used to restricting and NEEDING food as it was, I was also growing a life in me and my body needed to be well nourished in order to nourish them. Again, it was difficult, but I beg you to please eat. Please be sure to take your prenatals, and stay off the scale.   I actually ended up miscarrying my twins at 10 weeks(unrelated to my eating disorder), and there is nothing I regret more than feeling insecure about my body and freaking the fuck out sometimes because I was forcing myself to eat. I would do anything to have them back, including my little pooch. And when I decide to have a baby, I will be so great full to have a such a strong, womanly body and embrace every change it goes through. Stretch marks big nipples big beautiful tummy and all.   Last thing, your body isn‚Äôt doomed forever. You‚Äôre not ‚Äúruined‚Äù after a baby. It‚Äôll be different, but you will be able to loose the weight after. For now, just focus on nourishing yourself and the little baby you have growing inside of you.   Best of luck mama ‚ù§Ô∏è",False,False
