I am literally incapable of shopping for groceries in the normal way, and when I'm just shopping for myself, I go to the store every single day instead. It's a horrific waste of time, but like, if I have substantial amounts of food available at home, I FREAK OUT. Mostly because I'm scared I'll binge, which makes me binge-eat all the food so I can stop being scared (LoGiC).   It legit sucks. The only thing I can buy in large quantities and not binge on is lettuce. Bell peppers sometimes, also. It's so sad and I feel so ashamed that I can't shop/store food normally, but yeah. I get you.",False,False
