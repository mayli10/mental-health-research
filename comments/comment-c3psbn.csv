Your ED took control for a bit but no mistake in this world is unfixable.   You can give her the 50$ you wanted when you get your next paycheque and apologize if you feel the need. I'm sure your sister will understand.  I know it sounds preachy but you can learn from this and maybe next time it'll be easier to control your impulses.  Stay strong! ❤,False,False
