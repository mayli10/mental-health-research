And I absolutely agree because I have this since 12, now over 16 years, most of my life, (fuck).

Everyone should feel save and welcome here. ",False,False

I developed my ED when I was 12 and was sufficiently malnourished for some time until I went into recovery for a few years. I'm 5'3 now and it makes me wonder if I've stunted my growth or something of the sort.

It is a tricky thing to be over 18 and engage with teens who are doing dangerous things.  You don’t want to condone it or give them advice but I feel people flip too far into thinking “children can’t have problems” or isolating them out of support.  I had a lot of serious mental health problems as a teen and I felt like I had to keep them bottled up because the feeling I always got from adults was either overwhelming anxiety or anger at me.  It really pushed me further in and isolated me in the end.  It wasn’t until I turned 18 that I could talk to even professionals about suicidal thoughts without being made to share it with dangerous adults in my life or told to just not.  ,False,False
