I hate it and it makes me not want to eat anything. I wake up drenched and feel like I have to wash all my bed stuff otherwise it smells like food.  I even sleep on the sofa and wear things I can wash instead of using a duvet if I have eaten anything I think will make me sweat.   Thanks, body, for additional stupid triggers",False,False

I read that a low amount of vitamin b12 can cause night sweats and they did kind of go away once I started taking them. Also hot baths before bed always help me with night sweats for some reason. Or a hot shower helps too.  Good luck! Nothing ruins my sleep like night sweats,False,False
