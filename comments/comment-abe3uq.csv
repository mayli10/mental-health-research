Is it really bad? Looks like calories donâ€™t max out really beyond 2500. Iâ€™m going to start investigating now...       I mean, I inherently hate any energy restoration program because you donâ€™t need a program for that in our modern world. But. I like that itâ€™s supposedly what they consider maintenance for your future life? Is that horse shit? Haha. Thatâ€™s what they say! ðŸ˜‚",False,False

But I did want things that werenâ€™t commensurate with extreme restriction or being extremely underweight. Ultimately I decided I wanted those things more than I wanted to not eat.  Thereâ€™s a huge space between being underweight and being overweight, between extreme restriction and gluttony. Itâ€™s a space thatâ€™s worth exploring.  Iâ€™m a little hypocritical because Iâ€™m back to playing with restriction myself right now. But I hope youâ€™ll look into the possibility of middle ground.",False,False

Straight-up refusing to eat with no explanation probably isn't the best idea, but you are not legally obligated to do as your parents say. Would it be possible to sit down and sternly let them know that you'll handle your own body, and that they have no grounds to intervene?  I'm sorry you're in that situation. Minnie Maud is literal hell. I hope you don't get roped into that. Good luck OP &lt;3",False,False
