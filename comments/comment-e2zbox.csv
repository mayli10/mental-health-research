I've had to have conversations with her and tell her I just need her to listen and try to understand, not fix the problem.",False,False

I think we will maintain a good relationship and I've been trying to get myself to speak up and tactfully tell him when I feel like he's invalidating me, but it's definitely a work in progress.",False,True

It’s a place you can’t fully comprehend until you’ve been there, but accepting that they can’t understand (especially when what we’re doing or feeling frightens them) is really hard for most people. Most especially for the people who love us...which somewhat ironically makes it harder for them to help.   One thing I thought about from what you wrote is that I tend to fall into black-and-white thinking. Like...I’m perfect or I’m broken. I’m thin or I’m fat. When there’s really a pretty generous neutral zone in between those extremes. It’s just that I just have a hard time finding and living in the grey. It’s harder still when my emotions are shouting (screaming) down my logic, but I think it’s good for me to try to remember that a middle path is out there.",False,False
