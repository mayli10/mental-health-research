I'm glad to know I'm not alone in that. I also feel like I have so much emotional love to give but I don't want to express it in a physical way and I often feel uncomfortable expressing my emotions to them face to face I'd rather do it in writing if that makes sense?? like over text message, in letters, in small gestures, etc.",False,True

The only person I’m ever okay with touching me is my best friend, who is also my favorite person in the whole world, and even then there are still times when I don’t want to be hugged or held because I feel like I’m gross lmfao. Luckily they’re extremely understanding and don’t pressure me to be more physically affectionate",False,False

I was never a touchy feely person even in my pre-ED days but after struggling with ED for years I just can't stand physical contact. It feels repulsive and just not right :(,False,False

My night didn't go great due to the fact that it is halloween and I feel like I'm the only person in the world not going out and having fun. I didn't crave candy as much as I was expecting which helped out a bit but it still made me feel a bit lonely for a moment. How about you?,False,True

I feel terrible that I’m not all YAY HUGS! He is super close with his family and it is impossible for me to understand any relationships like that.   How is your night going??,False,False

I'm sorry he forces you to hug him, I know that probably makes you extremely uncomfortable.

I wish we taught them that as well. This is something fairly new I'm dealing with because of the depth of my ED currently. I've never been someone who has been 100% comfortable with receiving physical affection (even as a child) but I have never completely denied it until lately. I appreciate the fact that I'm not alone in this!,False,True

I did not have a family with feelings. My husband forces me to hug him and I’m all “OK BUT I’M DOING DISHES/ANY EXCUSE POSSIBLE!” Doesn’t work.,False,False

From age 8 onward I really did not want people to touch me. It made family gatherings sooo stressful. There was also a period where I *did* want physical connection/comfort but had a major “nonono” about actually receiving it, if that makes any sense. I still don’t really like hugs (except from a very small number of specific people) but I can be ok with quick social-nicety hugs.   I wish we taught children that if they don’t want to give or receive a hug they don’t have to. It’s their body and their choice. There are all sorts of ways to express affection and they don’t ‘owe’ anyone a hug!",False,False
