My mom is also controlling, therapy-resistant, defensive, and all that good stuff.  &gt; i can, t disobey my mom or else she'll stop caring  imo, this is actually very unlikely. Your mom may use this as an implicit threat, but it's just a control tactic. She's not going to stop caring. She might pretend to stop for a bit, but I guarantee she'll snap and come rolling back in (whether or not you want her to is another story). Controlling people don't do well when their supply gets taken away.   Really, the only answer here is that you NEED to stand up to your mom. Draw boundaries, and if she won't accept them, refuse to discuss your treatment/medical care with her altogether. Trust me: *this problem will only get worse and worse*. As impossible as it sounds to disobey your mom, or even be frank with her about her behavior, it's only going to seem more impossible with time.",False,False
