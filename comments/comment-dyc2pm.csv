I think it might actually be because I feel accomplished when I steal something and my friends who are next to me while I do it, don't get what I did.  I feel like it's my secret,  not only to the store but also to my friends. It's something I can prove myself. That I'm good at hiding stuff (like this fukin ed I guess) .  I kinda wish I could stop too,  but I always feel so good about myself the moment I do it",False,False
