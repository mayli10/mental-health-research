While my eating disorder didn't start until I was 15, I've been depressed as a child for about as long as I can remember. I have severe anxiety in social situations, and I feel threatened by other women. I am especially afraid of becoming emotionally vulnerable to others. This results in my pushing everyone away. My only close friend, the only really true friend I've ever had, is my bf. We've been together for almost three years now (I have no idea how he can stand me) but when we first started dating, I became so afraid of losing him that I held on so tightly. White knuckles. Loving him has been a process of letting go, of releasing that grip and learning to trust him and his love for me. It's one of the hardest things I've ever had to do and I feel horribly about the way I've treated him. I know I don't deserve him, but I hope that maybe one day I'll become someone who will.",False,False

Maybe reach out to your friends and say ""hey I dont want you worrying too much about me but I just wanted to let you know I'm going through a rough time lately so that's why I've been flaky. I'm really sorry about that""  And if its warm, maybe suggest an outing that doesnt have to do with food? Ask to go on a hike or to a nature center or a beach or a specific store or two in a mall.   Your disorder WANTS you alone because it doesnt want you to feel like you have a support network. The best thing you can do is fight at least that part of the disorder   Again, I'm sorry you're struggling so much. Good luck, we're here for you",False,False
