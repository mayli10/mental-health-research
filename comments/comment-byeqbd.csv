I always thought to myself wow he is strict with food it's almost a problem. It's because he had health issues as a kid and wants to stay healthy forever. But he has a rocky relationship with food. My fave episode is when he and Ron do a challenge on who can make the best burger and Ron just puts a burger between two buns and Chris just eats it. I was happy he gave himself a break rather than worrying so much. Also uhm Rob Lowe is a whole ass snacc.,False,False
