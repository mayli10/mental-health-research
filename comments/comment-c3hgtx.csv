Oh &amp; make sure to follow up w moisturizer &amp; sunscreen!  At night just remove any makeup beforehand, and you can use a heavier moisturizer and even eye cream (no sunscreen needed, lol). You can also add in other serums and essences before moisturizer   I‚Äôd limit the scrubs to abt 2x a week max, although my skin may be more reactive than yours so maybe you can handle it better. At the end of the day, you know your skin better than anyone else really.   Also for rosacea you can probably incorporate something with azelaic acid or, if possible, antibiotics  The key is not to overwhelm your skin, so definitely introduce things slowly. That way if something helps or hurts you know the culprit right away. Patch-testing products before you use them is important too",False,False

I know how hard that is so message me if you need support. Im wondering if your 2 scrubs might be creating micro tears along with potential burst capillaries and other redness from purging. If your face scrubs or even one of them says it is a physical exfoliator, or does not say it is a chemical exfoliant, you should get rid of it. Like I said, physical exfoliants create microtears in your skin and that would definitely cause redness and dryness (which would make more redness).   Also, if you WANT makeup *(you do not need it, I can guarantee your brain is making your face feel more red and obvious than it really is)* until the redness starts to naturally decrease, I would recommend getting the wet n wild cushion foundation. It will even your skin tone without it feeling and looking like you're wearing a full coverage cake face. It wont eliminate the redness but it will damp it down and make you feel a lot better.  Hope that helps!",False,False
