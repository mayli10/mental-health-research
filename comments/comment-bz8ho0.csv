eqs2vut,t3_bz8ho0,t3_bz8ho0,usernameblahhhhh,1,2019-06-11 12:51:20,/r/EDAnonymous/comments/bz8ho0/too_afraid_to_ask_how_can_you_have_anorexia_for/eqs2vut/,"So Iâ€™ve been 34-39 kg my entire adult life (was 50-53 kg as a teen so I wasnâ€™t always small) at 5â€™. After dropping into the underweight category, Iâ€™ve only ever eaten at tiny deficits of 25-200 kcal a day. This means Iâ€™m basically eating at maintenance but still lose weight very, very slowly (a few lbs every couple months â€” barely noticeable). Then at a certain point I start overeating for a few weeks/months and put on 5-10 lbs while remaining underweight. Later, this phases out and I go back to eating just barely below maintenance and go down again. So my weight fluctuates a little but I stay underweight and eat around 16-1700 calories on average. It does take a toll and Iâ€™m far from the picture of health, but itâ€™s surprisingly sustainable. I have some digestive/nerve and circulatory issues and havenâ€™t had a period since I was a teen, but Iâ€™ve also never fainted, been hospitalized, have really long/thick hair, etc. itâ€™s weird but it works (until it doesnâ€™t lol).",False,False

All of them lasted at least 20 months. I guess I consumed enough calories and nutrients to maintain a super low weight but remain above the death threshold.

At some point I would lose 3 lbs per week. In less than a year I went from overweight to underweight. Another year I did the opposite. I keep on going back and forth. 60 lbs is the max my weight has fluctuated between my LW and my HW. I manage to avoid going over that number with bulimic episodes in the middle when I purge with overexercising which keeps me pretty much at the same weight. My skin and body in general hate me for those extreme weight changes but I can't help it.  How fast does your weight change?,False,False

Even the anorexic knows that their diet is not sustainable. So they eat just enough to live.'  The other thing about anorexia is that at some point, either due to physical starvation or mental exhaustion, every anorexic must eat at maintenance or above or they will die. Career anorexics like myself tend to cycle behaviors (orthorexia and binge eating disorder are common), which allows the body to recomp before relapsing into starvation again. For me, this cycle has been repeating itself for more than a decade.",False,False
