Once you learn how to do it every meal you ever eat will become something you can throw up.  I remember when I used to just binge and be unhappy and comfortable with the food. Purging turned that into so much worse.  You will never be able to cry the tears will be dust in your dry eyes from purging the night before.   The emotion pours of me and into the sink, I’ll stare into nothing and my friends will say hey man you good, and I’ll say yes I’m fine.  It might sound like a good idea in the moment but it truly destroys your life",False,False
