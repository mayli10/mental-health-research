I don‚Äôt have forbidden foods anymore so eating like a small bowl of chips or two small pieces of chocolate is something I can do without guilt now but like it‚Äôs just all mundane   Though maybe this is what a relationship with food is like if healthier than sitting there crying about carbs in a baby orange,False,False

CONSTANTLY. but ‚Äúnormal‚Äù ppl don‚Äôt, food is a necessity, fuel, and enjoyable with friends and family. it can be a comfort sometimes but to them it‚Äôs boring. but boring can be beautiful! there‚Äôs something amazing when food isn‚Äôt put on this weird pedestal anymore, when it doesn‚Äôt have control of your life. so embrace with it and just keep going ü§© but idk just my two cents",False,False
