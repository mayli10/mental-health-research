Especially since having disordered eating often causes us to go between the two extremes of being overweight and underweight.   Restricting that much while exercising as much as you are seems like it might be too much to start with. If I were in your situation I would definitely talk to a health professional to find out the best method to lose weight without falling into the disordered mindset, which will do more harm than good.

It's hellish to not only feel pressure to lose weight fast, but then struggle with ""oh btw don't lose weight TOO fast either"". It's like....uh, hello, can I win here?  Nothing you've said sounds dumb. Your questions were valid and your post explained the situation really well. You and your husband both come off as especially kind, caring people.  Losing weight for health and managing your disordered habits/thoughts might just end up being two separate problems that're especially tricky to balance. Having to do #1 doesn't negate #2, and I hope success with #1 comes along with success with #2, not at the expense of it.  Your GP probably won't be much help with either struggle, but if you ask them for referrals, your new insurance might cover therapists or nutritionists who can be more use?  I admire your commitment, it sounds like your head's in the right place, and I hope it goes as easily and well for you as it can! You got this!",False,False

I know it’s probably sounds dumb like I was just on here seeking validation or justification but I just don’t know   This is all good perspective for me to be serious and try to be more moderate in my weight loss goals  And the point about exercise was great ty ,False,True

Your husband's right to worry. Your body isn't getting the protein it needs, and when you lose weight like this, you're going to lose muscle, not just fat. Your body composition is more complex than the number on the scale. Overexercising at a high weight can be ruthless on your joints, too - I'd rec something low-impact and full-body like swimming, over shit with repetitive focused impacts on your knees like jogging. Starting out at a higher weight doesn't make disordered eating normal and harmless...it just means it'll have more camouflage and more time to become entrenched until your weight changes and health struggles makes it obvious what's happening.  Good on your husband for not waiting for this to get worse before he worries, tbh.  ""I'm too fat to have an eating disorder/disordered eating"" is something that people of virtually *any* weight have said and fully believed. Denial is a bitch.  It's worth mentioning that disorders can even ""switch"" over time and circumstances. Someone struggling with BED after anorexia, or vice versa, isn't uncommon.  &gt; Hearing the doctor say I’m obese will send me into a spiral and make me end my life  Honestly? Nondisordered, healthy people don't tend to empathize with ""I am willing to kill myself if I feel fat"" and meaning it. This one single line sticks out more than anything else, if you're even half-serious about it.",False,False

We don’t judge based on weight, age, type of ED, or whether it’s an ED at all. It definitely sounds like you have disordered eating at the very least, and regardless of where you fall, you are valid.

I have been 150 lbs overweight and I have been 25 lbs underweight, and I’ve been equally miserable at all points, because I have an eating disorder.
