I've always been that person who finds it easier to just eat a couple of large meals or one big one rather than constantly feeding myself throughout the day (hello binges!).  It's definitely not a cure for the binge mentality, but it really helps me a lot.",False,False

They get to binge once a day, and it appears to be easier for them to stay within a reasonable calorie limit that way. Maybe calling it OMAD and IF instead of binging and restriction reduces the feeling of shame, which might be mentally healthier for them. There's also support for choosing healthy foods.  I also know someone who did OMAD out of necessity. He didn't have a kitchen, so he had to eat out every day, but he was too poor to afford multiple meals, so he did a huge OMAD at a buffet every day.",False,False
