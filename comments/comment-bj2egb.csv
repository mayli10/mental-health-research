I had this random excuse to do it. He obliged. He weighs like 30 pounds more than me. He looks thin and my legs look bigger than his. ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯,False,False

My bf is really thin and I have weirdly muscular calves for someone who never exercises (I do walk everywhere though but I think it's more genetics). I was always a bit sensitive about them especially cause no other part of my body is really notably muscular like my calves and my bf having twig legs definitely brought back that insecurity - I guess all I can do is try and find some humour in it.........,False,False
