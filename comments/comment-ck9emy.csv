My kitty is UTI prone (not her fault, it's just that some cats are) so I KNOW what a UTI looks like.  She's had several since I got her so this snobby vet lady keep pushing and pushing a urine sample to ""just to check for infection.""  So alright, I drag my poor stressed out cat to the vet to get a needle in her bladder for a sample and we wait.  Three days later I call and ask and the vet said the lab is ""still processing it.""  A full WEEK later with my poor kitty still in pain I call back furious and ask what the literal fuck is going on.  Apparently at the vet's office someone screwed up the paperwork and the sample sat at the lab for a week before it went bad and was thrown out and could I please bring my cat into the vet's office again so they could get another sample???  So I dragged my poor sick kitty in AGAIN and politely told the woman to call me with the results because we were NOT returning and I was not about to pay for the return visit because they screwed up.    Side note, my kitty did get chicken for being such a good girl through all of this.  She didn't even bite the vet tech the second round; I was ready to though!",False,False
