I think she wanted an EKG, and I also had a couple of spine MRIs that she wanted results for. I’ve been on it before, and I can tell you that it’s rough. It made my anxiety way worse, and I accidentally drank coffee after taking it once and spent the whole day dissociating as a result.",False,False

Dont take it unless you're prescribed it by a doctor and get monthly check ins on how you're doing on it.  Drug addiction isnt worth the weightloss.,False,False
