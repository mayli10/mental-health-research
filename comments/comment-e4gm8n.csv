Thought this might be the case (by intuition), but good to ""know"".  &gt; Honestly the solution is going to be not being in an energy deficit,...  Hah! right... lol.",False,False

I get that.  Was a surprise to me at first.   Am hoping the fibre overload and water and staying away from meat I did last time keeps working. (It was still difficult and took a few days to work)  It's good that you're keeping limits on use. I'd say don't give in to the urge to use more. It sucks while it's happening, but I think our bodies sort it out eventually.  [IAmNotADoctor, this is not medical advice]",False,False

I know if some people take 70-80 in one go. Shits scary.   One of my best victories this year is being able to slow down laxatives.
