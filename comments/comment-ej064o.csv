I always tell myself if I just figure out WHY, then I’ll be fine. Find the problem so you can fix it; right??  One thing I can say is... you can only be at your lowest for so long. It sucks. But, you will get better. You will be out of this slump one day.",False,False

A distraction. Life can be so overwhelming; keeping up friendships is overwhelming and full of unknowns, so is dating. But the behaviors are simple. The numbers are sensical. And if you spend enough time obsessing over them you forget about the pressure of real life. Even if you feel like shit it’s a known feeling.",False,False

Maybe inside my soul, or my heart.  I don’t know.  I can’t figure it out, either.  I think the cause is more complex than we can ever figure out.  Some days it grows, some days it shrinks.  Some days it consumes me, other days I don’t notice it as much, but I can always feel it.  It’s like a nagging in the very back of my mind.  It used to be in the front, some strange “thing” I could never grasp, but it controlled me.    I’ve learned about it, what makes it grow, what makes it shrink.  It grows when I’m mentally and physically isolated.  It grows when I weigh myself compulsively.  It thrives when I hate myself.  It shrinks when I’m trying to do things that are good for me, mentally.   It shrinks when I talk back to it in a rational voice.   I’ve been dealing with this for 2 years now.  It’s something I’ve surrendered to, and stopped trying to get rid of.  This hole, or whatever, is inside me, and always will be.",False,False
