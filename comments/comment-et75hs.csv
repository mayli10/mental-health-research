It’s like, I already knew, but now *knowing* is so different. I’ll never watch the 1989 tour the same way. It already triggered me for a multitude of reasons but now I’ll be thinking of this and even sadder for her. Imagine doing that show night after night while you’re starving yourself. I can barely live my boring, simple life. I have so much love for this woman and am so proud of her for becoming healthier and for speaking out so honestly. I’ve cried a lot since reading about this yesterday, there are a lot of emotions to seeing how candid my favourite star is being about her struggles that I relate to.",False,False

POC EDs are a whole ass trip.  I've been thinking about it a little more - I can be empathetic to her struggles while still being critical or her music/lifestyle. Because I'm so sad for her but I still don't like certain things she chose to do. But IDC - I understand why she was the way she was and I respect her integrity now. I feel a lot calmer about it. And I certainly don't feel the need to impose opinions of her onto others the way I used to when I was younger.",False,False

Taylor Swift triggered the hell out of me back in the day, and my best friend was obsessed with her. But I just hated myself (disproportionately more than other triggers) because I ALWAYS saw her in the context of a super shallow pop song or VS runway models like OMG she is sooo coool and has model friends and gives gifts to her fans.  I wanted to be so jealous and hateful because seeing her beauty made me hate myself. I'm brown, I have blemishes. I'm fat. I had no social life. I'm short. She was just so long, skinny, golden, glowing, lean. She presented that way.  It's so sad, I can't be mad at her reading this. She was a victim of it just as much. So now I have all this unresolved anger about all my past pain, because she said and did and engaged in things that made me feel awful but it wasn't her fault.  Fuck celebrity culture and fuck the male gaze that is unabashedly subscribed to, and is internalized by some women who propagate that shit even worse.  This is heartbreaking and I'm happy she's speaking up about it. It's hard to be a role model about this stuff if you haven't resolved it yourself. It takes so much courage to be in your own body and accept it regardless of what people say.",False,False

It was really apparent in the 1989 days that she was dangerously underweight, but I remember everyone chalking it up to cocaine. I’m glad that she’s in a better place now, and I’m really proud of her for saying what she would actually do instead of the vague “I’ve had body image issues” that most celebrities opt for.

They were whatever about it until it got time to go backstage and meet Taylor and while they were all talking to her, this tag along girl blurted out ""Taylor! How'd you get so thicc!"" And I guess Taylor just looked at her like :\ and got pretty embarrassed and kinda upset looking. The rest of the group was mortified and tried to apologize to her and she was like ""aha it's okay, I'm happy now that's how""   And in any case the girls ended up saying it was so awkward and upsetting and they were mad they let that extra girl tag along in the first place when no one really knew her.
