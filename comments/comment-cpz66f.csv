For the most part, I really need food to be broken down into its components. Partly it‚Äôs just irrational weirdness that has been with me my entire life...like I don‚Äôt remember ever not eating this way. I hate eating ‚Äúmixed‚Äù bites for the most part (like cake + frosting), and I also hate switching from one item to another (like going between a main dish and a side, or going between eating and drinking).   With mixed bites I feel like...idk, like I can‚Äôt fully taste it if I‚Äôm eating it all at once? It just tastes different and blander and usually not in a good way. And I feel like the ED made it worse in that I need to recognize exactly what‚Äôs going in my mouth, and eating different foods put together somehow makes me feel like I‚Äôm not accurately noting what I‚Äôm consuming. (This is one of the many reasons I am terrified of smoothies.)  Relatedly, god, the bane of my life is stuff like pasta that‚Äôs cooked in the sauce, instead of having a pile of sauce on top. Yeah it‚Äôs more aUtHEntIC, but it also turns a food item of pasta + tomatoes into just weird orangeish pasta and my ED ain‚Äôt dealin with that kind of categorical weirdness. Plus I just literally can‚Äôt taste the sauce when it‚Äôs like that.",False,False
