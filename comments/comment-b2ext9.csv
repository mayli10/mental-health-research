The tests all give that disclaimer as well, but I just don't feel comfortable with it. There are plenty available through Google though, and I wish you the best.",False,True

However, my psychiatrist and I still fight constantly and I no longer have the energy to care. What I do know is that the old definition for anorexia focused a lot on bmi and on body image concerns specifically. So that may have been why I was diagnosed with anorexia and not BDD, but I know it is not the only disorder.",False,True

I too scored very strongly for BDD on these online tests.  So then I was like, wait, is BDD an actual psychiatric disorder or is it something people just use as lingo (like orthorexia for instance)? Looked it up, it was part of the DSM-V.  So then I was like, ""Okay, I've talked about this many times at therapy and stuff, so how am I not formally diagnosed with it?"" Then I read the criteria for BDD, and...we can't be diagnosed with BDD if we have a diagnosed eating disorder. Now, it says technically it is possible, but if a lot of our preoccupations are about our size, weight, shape, etc., then the eating disorder diagnosis overrides the BDD one. A lot of people with BDD *do* have illusions about their size and shape, but if they don't have an eating disorder to go along with that, it's part of the BDD diagnosis for them.  A lot of this is just formalities, but I still think it's interesting. It explains why most of us here don't have BDD diagnoses despite all of us having BDD symptoms.",False,False
