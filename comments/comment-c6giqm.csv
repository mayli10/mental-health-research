I've been having awful internal battles about trying for perfection in everything I do vs reality and it's screwing with me. My mental health is so bad that I really should be prioritising that above everything else for the moment rather than being crippled by guilt and self judgement. Thanks for commenting - it was a much need d dose of reality and kindness  &lt;3,False,False

I didn't eat before I left, I had 3 fruit snack packets throughout the event, and while happily eating garlic fries and a chocolate milkshake one of them asked if this was the first thing I was eating today. I panicked and brought up my shredded chicken which I had a small amount of last night. I feel really bad now for lying.",False,False

I was on a ride along with the local police department for one of my criminal justice classes, and like many of us I have trouble eating in front of people. Especially people that I don‚Äôt know.

Because we‚Äôre going to lunch for a colleague that‚Äôs leaving the department. I‚Äôm like oh I just ate (lie) but that‚Äôs OK!

You'd think it would be the opposite. I'm vegetarian, and I think veganism is the right thing to do for the animals and environment but I'm struggling. I keep forgetting to look at labels on low calorie foods. I get so obsessed with the calories that I forget about the ingredients. Mostly I eat vegetables but the times I want treats that fit into my calorie budget my starving ass only cares about calories. Everything else is white noise in my head. I bought fibre one bars which are 90 calories each and when I get home saw that they had milk in them. A vegetarian microwave meal had egg in it etc. It's just so demoralising. I don't know if I can become vegan right now because I'm constantly fucking it up because in the moment I don't care about anything else but calories. I'm honestly lucky that meat is disgusting to me, otherwise I'd probably eat it when I was in that obsessive mindset.       It's really playing on my conscience.

It‚Äôs been my goal for the longest time. My whole ED for years revolved around losing the weight before these two operations. My face objectively looks better. A lot less masculine; I‚Äôve recurved a lot of compliments. I can honestly say my nose looks more or less perfect for my face now. I had braces as a child, and before the rhinoplasty, I would say my teeth were the only ‚Äúperfect‚Äù thing about me. But now..I honestly would have to say my nose probably is too. I can still nitpick it, the same way I can nitpick my teeth for not being ‚Äúwhite enough‚Äù, but I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs rational anymore.   And my breast reduction...my boobs have been the epitome of my whole ED since it started. At my HW, my chest measured 40‚Äù around. Now my chest is like 32.5‚Äù around and still dropping with swelling. I went from like 36DDD boobs to what I think are gonna be 30C‚Äôs. Maybe less depending on swelling. I asked for B‚Äôs but this is honestly life-altering. I don‚Äôt have old grandma boobs anymore and maybe I‚Äôll actually be able to run and jump without pain. And, guess what? I can actually wear women‚Äôs clothing now. I would always have to buy XL‚Äôs or men‚Äôs clothing because of my chest, but now my little sisters‚Äô size small, skimpy tank tops for me. My nipples don‚Äôt chafe on my belly button when I sit down, and they feel firm as a 20 year old‚Äôs pair of tits should (my boyfriend agreed).  I still hate my fat cheeks, non existent upper lip, broad shoulders and narrow hips/flat ass. But I‚Äôve essentially jumped from a 3/10 to a 4/10 post-weight loss to a 5/10 post-plastic surgery. I am now physically average. I can‚Äôt rag on myself for being deformed anymore. I‚Äôm going to get lip injections soon, but other than that, I have nothing planned for my physical appearance for the future. I want to get my cheeks done maybe, but I need to lose body fat first.  I thought the surgery would end my ED for some reason. I would always say ‚ÄúI need to lose weight ASAP for surgery‚Äù. I even pushed back my surgery my 6 months because I wasn‚Äôt physically ready and hadn‚Äôt lost all the weight yet. I was still unhappy with my weight last week because I had gained five pounds the previous month instead of losing, but I said, ‚Äúfuck it, I‚Äôm close enough and just skinny fat‚Äù.  The issue is, I‚Äôm still bingeing. I‚Äôve binged almost every day for the past week. I think part of it is due to physical hunger for bingeing and purging for months before the surgery and starving myself as much as I could the past year..and maybe I finally feel relief that I can finally breathe now that it‚Äôs over. But I know the other part of it is because I underwent surgery in the middle of an ED psychological crisis. I was literally going insane. I couldn‚Äôt ever sleep, and I was too week to get out of bed for weeks. I happened to binge a couple days before my surgery, so I had enough energy to look normal to my surgeon because of it, but I‚Äôm gaining weight now because I can‚Äôt stop bingeing, and I‚Äôm petrified of ruining my new boobs because of this.   I tried to recover for once. I don‚Äôt *need* to lose weight anymore. I‚Äôve been anti-recovery for months now, but I gave it an earnest attempt this week and still failed. There‚Äôs no reason for it to keep going, but it is.  Thankfully, my boyfriend got me a bottle of phentermine pills a while back that I never took, so I‚Äôm gonna go through another course of those for now to hopefully reset everything. But I need to establish healthy habits, because if I don‚Äôt, as soon as I become too tolerant or I run out of pills, I‚Äôll eventually end up back where I started, bingeing again.  It‚Äôs too soon in the breast recovery for me to move much, which really sucks too.  I just don‚Äôt know what to do anymore. I have a normal body now, want to quit, have no reason to keep my ED, and can‚Äôt stop it.  ...At least I no longer need Snapchat filters to tweak my nose anymore though..",False,False
