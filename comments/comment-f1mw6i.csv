It's ruining my relationship and my self esteem and even sex drive cause I hate the idea of him seeing me with my clothes off. It's terrible. It's torture and every time I try to get my eating back on track I start to binge eat again. It's the worst especially because last year i was at my best weight I was dressing up cute everyday and this year it's been pretty bad everyday. It's monday though so I can only hope for the best this week.",False,False
