The impetus was a cholesterol diagnosis. I got nothing but kudos for losing weight by just fasting and taking diet pills. But I had been on diet pills for a long time. Iâ€™m not thin though.,False,False

I'm going to fight. Thank you so much and yes, I will update you as soon as I'm confident to say that I have fully recovered.  You're all going to be ok â™¡ Lots of love xx  PS: I screenshotted your message and works now as background of my phone, your words really cheered me up and give me hope. Thank you.",False,False

Girls like you I've seen recover and thrive and be healthy. I've been in inpatient enough time, as a 15 yo and as a grown ass woman, girls who really want OUT, like you, they recover. I have this overwhelming feeling that you're going to be good. Strive baby girl, do it, get your dreams, ED will just keep you back, and the longer you stay with it the easier it is to actually cope with it. Do it queen, update us when you can, because knowing that a young queen like you wants to recover, gives US hope, in some way, that we can be ok too.",False,False

This honestly gives me hope. I definitely dont want to live in like this because I'm wasting my precious lifetime and energy into something so meaningless, and I so want to achieve more than that in my life. At the moment it feels as if it was something clinging to my leg, not wanting me to become what I should become and to strive for my real dreams. (Wow I'm getting poetic here)   So yeah, it's something I want to heal as soon as possible, but I know recovery is a long an bumpy way because I'm actually already on a better path right now, just that I do have relapses sometimes which suck.  I wish you all the best. And I hope that you can also find your happiness, be it with recovery or with learning how to deal with the ED in the best possible way ðŸ’•",False,False

Recovery is absolutely possible, especially with this frame of mind!! = ""I don't want this disorder to follow me for the rest of my time on Earth"".

I somehow find it extremely distressing to know that grown up women in their 30s, 40s struggle with ED's too, since most of the time we talk about ""teenies"" struggling with it.  May I ask you for how long you're already battling it? I'm 20 and I will freak out if this disorder follows me for the rest of the time on earth",False,False
