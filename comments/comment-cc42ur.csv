And how is your protein intake?  I've 2C/3A/3B hair and so I don't wash or (finger)comb through it often and you can imagine how much hair I'd lose after a few days. It was especially bad in late May/early June (and the heat didn't help) but supplements really did wonders! (Iron, Zinc, Vit Bcomplex+C) I drink a lot of coffee and that affects absorption (by a huge%) but it still helped. And my protein intake is still barely above the minimum.  Also I've noticed peppermint oil (for scalp stimulation) and aloe vera gel on the scalp have really helped too. (I expect to lose a lot of hair after 3-5 days but I don't when I use this).",False,False
