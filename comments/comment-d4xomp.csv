(It throws your insulin off or you'll feel like you can swallow once or twice etc).   Eating volumous food ie large salads helps to combat this behaviour. I have been struggling with this and am petrified of gaining weight. So I have started drinking low cal protein shakes.   I still get the urge to chew and spit. But thats not because I'm hungry. Its a strange embarrassing learned behaviour that arises when Im stressed or feel bad about myself",False,False

I’ve seen some stats that say 10%, but it depends on how efficiently you c/s. So in short, the answer is no, the calories you could have potentially absorbed are probably negligible, you’re good.
