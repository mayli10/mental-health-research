I know a huge part of it is just seeking validation and trying to make sure I'm not gaining, but like, why keep so many cute outfits without wearing them out?   Oh, right, because *you're still a fucking fat ass, me*. Ugh. /edventsolidarity",False,False

Iâ€™d previously never buy myself clothes before, especially after having my son. But after losing weight last May, I decided to treat myself and buy some trendier summer clothes, most of which I hardly ever (or never) actually wore in public. And I frustratingly *keep* doing it, telling myself itâ€™s ~different~ this time, with it being fall/winter  clothes...  Yet I still gravitate towards my same boring hoodies and legging almost every day. ðŸ™„",False,False

I can imagine it would be very freeing.   I really hope to be there one day. I just canâ€™t bring myself to do it right now. Iâ€™ve always just worn plain, dark, oversized mundane clothes - but I have so many different ones in my wardrobe Iâ€™d love to wear but never have. Iâ€™m worried about how I look and worried how people will react given Iâ€™ve never worn this sort of stuff.   One day!",False,True
