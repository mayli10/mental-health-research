Basically a friend realized I had an ED (because she did too and I did a lot of shit she did lol) and eventually got me to tell her about it. We talked about it over time and basically she said she only * really * started to get better once she started to go to therapy and between knowing thats what helped her most and her support is what pushed me to go and it was def weird at first (and still is sometimes) but Im getting more comfortable with it. Its helping me process and work through a lot of things and not bottle things up to the point where there unbearable and I inevitably turn to unhealthy coping mechanisms lol. Its not like a wowthanksImcured immediate difference but its helpful. I don't know anyone who's gone to therapy that regrets it and I think theres a lot less social stigma around it nowadays too. But even if you're not ready to go yet, play around with the idea and think about it some! Theres some online therapists too if you're not super comfortable with going in somewhere, so id suggest at the least look at the options. No pressure to make a decision and you know what you're comfortable with!",False,False

Iâ€™m debating messaging a friend of mine later.  I think Iâ€™m still in that stage where Iâ€™m hella against therapy for me ðŸ˜… Iâ€™m not a very open or social person, and spilling my soul to a stranger has never appealed to me. ",False,True

Didn't tell my parents anything, didn't want to tell my friends anything. And I still haven't told my most of my friends a lot of things. But they're your friends because they care about you. If one of them was going through a rough time you'd def be ok with them coming to you to talk or vent, right? It goes both ways, I promise. Again you don't have to tell them ~everything~ if you don't want to, but even if you're like ""hey I'm hella stressed this week and I just feel like shit can we hang out and just talk for a bit"" I'm 100% sure at least one friend will totally be down with that.   Also, does your university have a counseling center/mental health resources? You could always make an appointment with them. You can tell them as much or as little as you want but its so nice to be able to vent to a therapist removed from your personal life. It took me til late last year to realize that lol and I was so against it (for me personally, not in general) until I actually bit the bullet and did it. ",False,False
