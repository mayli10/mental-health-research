Its really good when youre actually walking bc its always updating but my steps skyrockets when i take the bus or drive i think its inaccurate in that way. It does track miles pretty well. And its helped me figure out my actual TDEE so i can know what i need to work to eating at maintenance. But honestly if you obsess over calories like most of us id stay away if you can. Its completely drained me.,False,True
