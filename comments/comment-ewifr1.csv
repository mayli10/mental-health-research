Cuz she was visiting the city. To get away from her bf. And I wasn’t told this, I found out about it. A week later. I did happen to leave him immediately after reading the texts. I think maybe it’s underrated to leave these imbeciles. But you probably should. I’m sorry. There’s so much better out there. Even if it’s harder to get to. I learned the hard way and got the best person imaginable out of it.",False,False

I understand being insecure (lord knows I've been in many of my past relationships) but you need be open with your bf that texting his ex is inappropriate unless they are actually business partners. Open communication is fucking everything.  That whole best friend after bf/gf concept works for some but few and, for people like us (not to generalize but most of us actively compare ourselves to others and have major insecurities we need to identify and work on - if we're in relationships, we need to let our partners know we need a little extra TLC as we work on getting better), I don't think it's healthy to be in a relationship like that without discussing with him how shitty it makes you feel. If he's worth his weight, he'll back off the convos with her and perhaps even cut contact. If he starts trying to pick a fight with you when you bring it up, showing his own insecurities (and likely the fact that he's doing more than just ""talking business"") it's time to move the fuck on to someone better worth your time.",False,False

That he didn't do this indicates he wouldn't have been happy with anyone at any weight.   ~~Also, I bet *even if* you were a shitty girlfriend, that would be why this happened, and only if he communicated his problems with how you were. Not your weight.~~ I bet you weren't one though. And once again, if he cheats on you because of it, then it's him. He didn't communicate his problems with you. He just went and talked to another person.   It's him, no matter what way you looked at it.   Regardless, I hope you get through this smoothly. Relationships are a royal pain.  edit: sorry I started projecting there. you didn't ever claim it was bc of your weight, that's just something I think about myself. the rest still applies",False,False
