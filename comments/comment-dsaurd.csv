My understanding is some of the water stays because water gets bound up in the replenishing glycogen stores (which were depleted when eating a ketogenic diet). But the bloated feeling went away relatively quickly for me. If you ate keto for a long time Iâ€™ve heard (totally anecdotally) that it can take the body awhile to readjust to processing carbs...something about the gut microbiome changing?,False,False
