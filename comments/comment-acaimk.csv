I’ve always been the ugly friend and I just tried to convince myself that I wasn’t interested in dating when I was younger. Still hurts. Now I’m the ugly coworker and my other coworkers get compliments and tips every day and I literally get nothing. It hurts. I hate it so much. I hate being reminded that I’m the ugly one.   Sorry to talk about myself so much. You’re not alone in feeling and being treated like this. ",False,False

It's just my face, honestly, even at my lowest folks didn't treat me much differently. Their disdain is a little more open but I still sensed it back then.",False,True

I lost a bit of weight since coming to college and found better friends and it's like a light switch--guys talk to me, treat me better, DON'T hit me up just for the purposes of getting with one of my close friends...  I don't want to say losing weight is the answer but I also can't say it's a coincidence that I look better in my clothes and suddenly people want to talk to me for me. ",False,False
