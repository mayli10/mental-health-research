But I know those aren't always feasible for everyone.  If you can bring yourself to do so, cut out exercise for a week or so. Exercise retains water in the muscles, particularly in you're strength training or HIIT training, but can also have that effect with cardio, particularly if you're doing long runs or ellipticals.",False,False

Metabolic adaptation can also occur as a result of severe restriction, but unless you weigh significantly less and are severely underweight, it doesn't tend to affect BMR that significantly. Rather, the body will expend less energy to keep your warm (which is why people who are dieting tend to be cold all the time), and you'll likely decrease your non exercise activity levels and you'll be more tired. If you are severely underweight, other processes may start to shut down (e.g. immune function, normal menstruation, etc.) in order for the body to preserve only the most vital processes. This can definitely happen in people who aren't severely underweight, but is seen most often in athletes or people who are underweight or normal weight people who are severely calorie restricted.",False,False
