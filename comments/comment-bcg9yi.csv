Thank you so much. Luckily I‚Äôm just going with my fianc√©e &amp; a good friend, both of whom are more than used to my crazy food antics üòÇ they won‚Äôt blink twice at me ordering sashimi &amp; a side salad without dressing. Would you say tuna would be the lowest calorie raw fish option?",False,True

Miso soup is also great.  In terms of sushi sushi, cucumber rolls are pretty low calorie but they still look ‚Äúnormal‚Äù.",False,False

Tuna is typically low calorie, but you can look up the lower cal fish options and see what fits in your budget. Octopus, squid, and shrimp should all be relatively low calorie. Salmon is higher as well as other ‚Äòfatty‚Äô fish options. I typically order a chirashi bowl which is an assortment of raw fish on top of sushi rice. Usually I make my boyfriend eat the rice but if you think you might be too tempted I‚Äôd skip this.   If you‚Äôre with someone that might think it‚Äôs weird not to order something with rice / you want to eat some rice and have portion control you could always get a cucumber maki, which is a small roll with cucumber and a little rice.",False,False
