Sometimes getting more fluids and electrolytes helps that symptom for me (I’ll get it in my hands and lower legs too, especially after exercise). Overall nutrition and micronutrients are possible factors too. I’ve started taking a multi-vitamin to get more B-12 - I figure it’s not going to hurt and they’re not very expensive.",False,False
