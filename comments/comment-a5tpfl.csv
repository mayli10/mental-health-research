I'm really sorry she said something so crude. It would be different if she suggested going to the gym with you or helping you learn healthy cooking meals as a parent instead of making a remark that doesn't help you out. ,False,False

This makes me think of Kate in ""This is Us."" My mom has been clueless and at times insensitive, and absolutely there have been times when she continued to my ED, but I can't imagine if she'd been this kind of mom. Is there anything you enjoy doing that you could do to help yourself feel better when she acts this way? Not because she said these things, but for YOU, to take care of YOU, rather than make yourself more angry with yourself later. Art (so many possibilities here), or photography, or video games, or some sort of building/construction activity (puzzles, 3d puzzles, models...)? Just some thoughts on things that might help you work on taking care of YOU, particularly at times when your mom is actively contributing to your self-harming behaviors. HUGS.",False,False
