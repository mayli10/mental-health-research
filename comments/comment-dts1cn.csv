I struggled a lot with my overall mental health this week and was reminded what a powerful tool music can be to shape my mood. Sometimes the effect only lasts and hour, but that can totally change my day :) Behold my “Inspirational Girl Music” playlist (Meaning music that inspires me which happens to be written and/or performed by women. To be enjoyed by everyone!)   **Broken Glass**, Rachel Platten   *”So I bet on me and my own heartbeat / when all the odds are piling / like bricks around my feet”*   **Try Everything**, Shakira (from Zootopia which is an *awesome* animated movie!)   *”I won’t give up / no I won’t give in until I reach the end and then I’ll start again / I want to try even though I could fail”*   **Unstoppable**, Sia   *”I put my armor on, show you how strong I am / I’ll show you that I am / Unstoppable”*   **Afterlife**, Ingrid Michaelson   *”We are, we’re gonna be alright / We got, we always got the fight in us”*   **I am Moana**, Auli'i Cravalho   *Sometimes the world seems against you*   *The journey may leave a scar*   *But scars can heal and reveal, just where you are*   *The people you love will change you*   *The things you have learned will guide you*   *And nothing on Earth can silence*   *That quiet voice still inside you*",False,False

Fucking amazing band. Shake it out and dog days are over, especially. Those are their most basic songs but so powerful and really make me feel like I could be on top of the world haha",False,False
