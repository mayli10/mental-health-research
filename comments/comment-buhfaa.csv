The soy protein powder is still has a better mineral composition than the whey protein powder and it's still slightly cheaper, but I would have to order it online. The store near my apartment does probably sell soy protein isolate, but I checked out the best value one on the company's website and it only had a quarter of the potassium which means I wouldn't be able to reduce the other stuff in my meal plan. I guess the soy protein from the website I'm looking at will only be a good idea if I can get free shipping. I might have to place a big order for free shipping though, and I don't have cupboard space for more than one container. I mean, I could probably find somewhere to put extra containers, it would just likely be a hassle. I guess that was something I should have considered in the first place though.",False,False

I was kind of bummed out by how expensive whey protein powder is, but I noticed soy protein isolate right at the top so I looked into it and it's only 64% of the cost of the whey protein powder I was going to use. With the nutritional composition of the soy protein isolate I was even able to make other reductions to different things in my meal plan. I went down from 3/8 teaspoons of potassium citrate powder to 1/4 teaspoon and from 20 almonds to just 10. That will definitely help me save money because supplements and nuts are expensive. It should also be easier on my stomach because I don't need to use as much and it's not a dairy product. The whey powder I was looking into was a whey isolate, so it would be pretty clean itself, but it is still a dairy product so even though I'm not lactose intolerant avoiding lactose when I can is probably for the best considering the health problems I have. This has been really helpful :)",False,False

The millions of pounds of feed and gallons of water slaughterhouses use daily is absolutely staggering vs the products used to farm produce.   &gt; The demand for livestock pasture is a major driver of deforestation. The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations has estimated that 70 percent of land formerly supporting Amazon rainforests has been turned over to grazing.  &gt; Between watering the crops that farm animals eat, providing drinking water for billions of animals each year, and cleaning away the filth in factory farms, transport trucks, and slaughterhouses, the animal agriculture industry has a huge impact on the water supply.
