There is a girl who likes me who I like back but we're not dating because she doesn't feel up to the responsibilities of a relationship right now due to life circumstances. But if you're already in a relationship you can't just end it and start it back up when you feel better. It's a complicated situation. But you agreed to be partners and so when things get tough that is when you have to be there for each other more than ever.,False,False

Polyamory is REALLY REALLY about communication, like I have multiple books on communication and ethical polyamory that Iâ€™ve read multiple times and we all know how to do this just fine. Iâ€™ve been partners with one of the people Iâ€™m living with for almost 5 years now, and we arenâ€™t new to this. But life circumstances for all of us have been super shitty lately and none of us are in good places mentally, so Iâ€™m really hoping that things will settle down and weâ€™ll be able to work back to being in a better place. Iâ€™m a bit too optimistic sometimes, Iâ€™ll be honest. But I do have a deadline set in mind, that I will be bailing out if things arenâ€™t better. Iâ€™m patient but I wonâ€™t do this forever",False,True

Communication is way too important. I don't want people playing games with my feelings, so I wouldn't put up with it.",False,False

I spent the first month and a half of recovery not gaining any weight and just feeling nauseated a lot, but then my body sort of figured out that it was supposed to be gaining weight and thatâ€™s when the quick increase happened. I was hesitant to use actual numbers in my post (as I know that can be triggering for many), but itâ€™s not all that muchâ€”I went from 85 to 95 lbs in that time period.   Thank you though! Youâ€™d think weâ€™d be able to act like adults at this point, considering that weâ€™re in our mid-20s, but that clearly doesnâ€™t seem to be the case. Iâ€™m really about direct communication so this has been super annoying to me, to just be completely shut out like that",False,True

I'm not sure what you can do, but I hope they realize how awful they are treating you soon enough.  Gaining 10% of your body weight in under a month is a bit concerning. I have heard that gaining weight too quickly can cause digestive problems. Are you doing this under the supervision of a certified nutritionist? You should be very careful if you are not.",False,False

I tried messaging them but hopefully a note will look more serious than a text if we canâ€™t make an in-person conversation happen",False,True

I hope you're okay and will feel A LOT better soon. Maybe try leaving a note for them to read since they won't talk to you?",False,False
