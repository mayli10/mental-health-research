Step 2 is much easier even though it doesn't always feel that way. You know your thoughts are distorted, now ignore them. They don't matter. They're specks of dust in space. Let them float away.   This happens in recovery. Sometimes a lot. It may happen again. What's important is how you react: do you stay here with the progress you've already made, as far as you've come, or do you go backwards, maybe to never return again?   That said, a lapse doesn't always trigger a relapse. Lapses are okay, relapses are dangerous and may keep you from peace forever. Depending on how far you are in your recovery, a lapse may or may not mean that a relapse is coming; if you're still in the early stages, fight this with everything in you. You deserve to *not* relapse. You deserve to recover *fully*.  Remember that your brother's actions have nothing to do with you and everything to do with him, and his partner. You did not make him leave and you did not make him fight with his partner. *They* did that, completely independently of you.   Hang in there, babe. I'm here if you want or need to talk some more. I believe in you ðŸ’—",False,False

From what you say happened, I donâ€™t understand how you were even involved?  Eating disorders can become a way of coping with emotions. It sounds like some strong emotions have been in play for you today so in some ways it makes sense that your brain would fall back on what it knows. The emotions that triggered this will pass. I hope youâ€™ll be gentle with yourself in the meantime.",False,False
