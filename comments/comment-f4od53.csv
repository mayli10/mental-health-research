I lost my best friend 4 years ago - an accident during a hike, right after a big argument.  Take your time to grieve.  Don't push yourself.  You're allowed to struggle.   I hope you'll be okay physically. If you can eat that's good.  If not, you aren't failing.  And if a hospital stay has to happen you'll be in safe hands.",False,False
