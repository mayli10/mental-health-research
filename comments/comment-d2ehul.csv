My fullness / hunger no longer has correlation to how much I will eat. I will fast for a week whilst being unstoppable hungry and I will eat 6-7k calories when I’m not even peckish.,False,False

I notice your comment history is entirely about judging other people about their appearance and it seems you've been devoting a lot of time and energy to doing that. How are you currently feeling?

Peanut butter on toast? Fruit? It’s all good and will give your body vitamins to help it stay healthy. There is definitely a way that you can eat without becoming a huge blimp and without gaining any weight at all.   What is your ideal body type out of curiosity?
