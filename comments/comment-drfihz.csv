I’d definitely suppose the same thing.   I’m sure all those years of morbid obesity had some kind of impact on his lifespan and don’t mean to imply that they didn’t, just that his gigantic fast didn’t give him superpowers or something—and that he likely would have been better off if he hadn’t effectively jumped from one extreme to the other there, you know?

Do you remember that one girl   (big trigger warning you guys if people supporting ED habits triggers you)   where she was doing a 7 day fast to get from a normal BMI of like 20 to an underweight BMI and said yeah I ate nothing but white monster and pickles and people were saying wow you look great way to go and talking about how fasting is super safe and it was fine she was doing that because she was ""skinny fat"" before and using ""well I think she looks great now"" as a reason why it was totally safe and not at all disordered for her to have done a 7 day fast to become UNDERWEIGHT   It makes me so angry because seriously fasting is not meant for people who do not have significant fat stores to burn through and it is just so gross to try to equate someone being 450 pounds and working with a team of doctors to fast to his goal weight since he had severe medical issues related to being obese and someone who is like, 130 pounds and perfectly healthy doing extended fasts because they think they're skinny fat and are unhappy with their body because society has told them the thinner the better",False,False

But he had a team of researchers and doctors monitoring him near constantly and they learned so much from this experiment. Not to mention he was supplemented up to his ears with vitamins and shit.
