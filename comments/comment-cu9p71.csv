When I first started struggling with my ED I lost around 30 lbs in under a season. If I hadn't forced myself to start eating again I would have a weight so wildly different that were it listed on my ID it wouldn't reflect me at all. Weight on ID makes no sense. Especially since most people don't really know what a person of a certain height and weight would look like,False,False
