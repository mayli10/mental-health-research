So my weight has fluctuated a *lot.*  My boobs are wrecked and saggy with extra skin, I have hella stretch marks, and I have droopy bingo wings at any weight and BF% because I have extra skin there, too. Most of that came from the 110-215-95 bit, because that whole process took place over like, 2.5 years.   So my body doesn't look quite the same. But my fat distribution is exactly the same. My general shape and bust:waist:hip ratio is the same. I still gain and lose the same way. Face and arms gain first, followed by butt and legs. Stomach and face lose first, followed by butt and legs, arms last. ",False,False

My weight was low for 3 months and yes I lost my period and my parents sent me to outpatient recovery. The first gain happened over 11 months. The settling down took about 3 or 4 months. I stayed healthy for about a year or a little more. The second loss happened over about six months. My weight stayed low for about 4 or 5 years because I was over 18 for most of it and wasnt ready for recovery. I wasnâ€™t having periods but I was on birth control by then and I used to take it without breaks. When I gained again it took maybe a year or two years? Not sure exactly bc I threw out the scale. ,False,False

I used to have huge boobs and a huge butt, and now my tits (even with BC that made them bigger) are tiny with the weight in my stomach and hips! I think itâ€™s partially due to my ed, and partially due to my hormones changing a bit. ",False,False

My natural weight was 50kg, i went down to 37, then up to 57 in recovery, then it settled back down to 53. Next relapse back down to 36/37, then back up to 53.

I think how QUICKLY i gain/lose weight has an impact on my body but largely i gain and lose the same way. there is a chance that the psychological side effects of rapid weight gain/loss may be distorting my view of my body.  but yes. i would say at least 80%, my weight is distributed in the same way.",False,False

My belly button looks slightly droopy but I think it might clear up over time as I just lost a lot of weight. I think the biggest factor in how much your body can recover is age. I was pushing it being obese at 32 and if I screw up again I probably won't look normal again without surgery.,False,False

I feel like the same weight has always looked about the same on me. It also seems to me like this would only potentially be an issue if you gained back the weight extremely quickly or something.,False,False
