I really do. But so many of these people are so firmly entrenched in denial that I feel that even gently approaching them about it will just make them get extremely defensive and buckle down harder.  For example, if you check out my post history, recently there was a post on r/relationships where OP said she didn't have an ED, but she was consuming 1,150 to 1,200 kcal/day while engaging in aerobic activity regularly. People were normalising this and one of my comments (which I think was entirely reasonable) has been consistently downvoted for pointing out that this isn't an optimal diet for someone at a healthy BMI.",False,False

This is probably also in age, but what I really mean is young and inexperienced in having an ED voice.   It seems unlikely that someone who asks for tips in this sort of way has enough experience to know what the ED voice really does. Having breakdowns in the supermarket because after years of reading every label, the one yogurt you felt ok eating is out of stock. Not going out with friends.  Of course, I could be wrong about this. But this sounds like a ""new member.""   To be clear : Quite sure the OP is hurting. And looking for help. It will be hard to know how to turn them down gently and explain this is not the place. Simply deleting the post with no explanation is confusing. Telling them automatically ""this is against the rules here !"" can come across as cold, and very harsh, especially for someone who is 'young' and hurting.   Recently I heard a theory that people with AN are more sensitive to negative feedback, and particularly social negative feedback. I'm not sure this is true. But I am pretty convinced that a very gentle ""stock"" response would be needed so that the message that our community is not about this can get across in a compassionate way.   The commenter is confusing. Like many of us, it sounds like intense, long-term pain. And a ""cat-scratch"" response of a hurting animal. And that the comment wasn't well thought out. Because I don't think anyone of us who truly 'experienced' in having an ED voice, or any of the pain associated with this, would wish it for anyone.   Both of these people are hurting, and requesting help, although not both may be able to receive it.  But it is our duty as humans, and as people who know about the ED hurt, to help those in need. But I think the vast majority of us know this. We are loving and gentle in general. 💕  The genuinely scary thing is, OP could get a direct answer to what they asked in another subreddit like r/fasting, and very easily get 'some tips' with a slightly rephrased post in something like r/1200 ...",False,False
