We hang out maybe twice a week and have our own lives, hobbies and friends. We still support each other when we can. I catch myself feeling like if he says no to hanging out that he doesn’t “like me” but I remind myself that I’m being crazy and everything is okay and that’s the old bad thought.   Both of us don’t really know what the future holds. We both want to move eventually to the same city but don’t have a set time line and work in the same industry. We don’t talk about doing this together though. I would totally be down to do that.  I feel like I’m thinking more in the moment and really happy that this is so different but at the same time do wish that things were like this before. Although it’s helped me see what we did wrong as a couple and how unhealthy our behaviors (especially mine) were. I now know how to be independent and my own person while being in a relationship with someone else.   I’m thinking I’ll mention something when I see him this weekend!!  Wish me luck!!!",False,True

You’re different and he is different, so it’s entirely possible that your dynamic DID change) Really take the time to step back out of the situation and think. Once you’ve thought it through, (you don’t even need a definitive answer, just take time alone to assess) talk to him and get his take. From there you can both decide what’s best",False,False
