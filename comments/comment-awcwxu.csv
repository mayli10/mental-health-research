I‚Äôd go for sorbet or froyo instead or even just normal ice cream and measure it out. Or I cut up a banana, freeze it and put it in a blender with a shot of espresso and have that. However, If it was a planned binge food then I‚Äôd probably get breyers coffee cupcake, or the cookie dough halo top.",False,False

Some of them aren‚Äôt awesome because it is sweetened with stevia which has a very specific artificially-sweetened flavor. I always felt that Birthday Cake was the best pairing with it.
