I feel like I need to be at a bmi 18-20 to have any chance of having a bf.. but it’s probably to do with body composition how much you can get away with",False,False

After 35 all pregnancies are considered high risk. I'm also on so many meds that cause birth defects or spontaneous abortion. I'd need to not only find a man who isn't repulsed by me but also stop being so fucked up. I don't want to wait 40 more years until my.life is bearable. I just expect things to get worse honestly.,False,True

Everyone goes at their own pace and people change courses so often.   I don't go on here too much anymore since I started eating at maintenance  (REAL maintenance; 2160 cal a day being 5'11""; haven't gained anything in that limit, just recomped) and just lifting weights and pushing myself harder in the gym. But that feeling is relatable. You say you've peaked but I feel like everyone's life trajectory looks different with different timelines, highs and lows. Hope you get out of this spot where you've been feeling low soon.",False,False

My parents don’t seem to want to become grandparents though, they never mentioned it and all their actions goes against it. I’m scared of being alone in the future, and my only solution so far has been restricting and becoming a health freak to to lose weight. It’s not working out very well, I always lose, gain, lose... and no matter what weight I’m at I am too scared to go on dates these days. I feel like hitting goal weight would honestly help though, so I’ll continue trying. There is no alternative for me at this point anyway",False,False
