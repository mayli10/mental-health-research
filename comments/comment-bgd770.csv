I think back to literally just December / January and how even though I still wanted to make more ‘progress,’ I WAS finally considered skinny- by random people, guys, girls, parents, everyone. And even myself. I loved it, I actually went to a sale rack at the mall a couple times a week just to try on the clothes and get super excited at fitting into sizes into stores I never could. I bought new stuff all the time. I wore heels and edgy, runway type outfits. Did my makeup and walked with my head up.  Like you, I sort of let myself go and gained about 10-15lbs and my entire physical being is just .. different. Even my eyes are different. My forearms are so much more different. I go through phrases where I don’t even want to shower / wash my hair. I’m back to restricting and have reached a mindset where I basically just want out of this current body. I figure, yes, restricting and exercising as much as I was is definitely unhealthy but binging and not moving a muscle is equally as unhealthy. I guess I’d rather feel kinda hot rather than wanna crawl in a hole.",False,False

I’m also so much happier when I’m skinnier. It’s sad, but it’s true. I don’t break into tears at dressing rooms or when I’m getting ready to go out.",False,False

No wonder you were happier restricting. I mean, I am too.  On top of that, you're still bingeing/restricting. Of course someone with an active ED is going to prefer being at a lower weight.  I tend to think of restricting as harder on my body, but bingeing harder on my mind",False,False

I also lost the bulk of my weight ""high restricting"" over a long period of time and developed a nasty binge (and purge) habit when the months and years started to drag on, but at the end of the day I'm happiest when I'm smallest too. Since I'm dipping to weights I haven't touched since childhood, I haven't ever seen my adult body at my LWs, and every new ""stage"" of thinness is new discovery for me. I feel a little shaky, but it feels freeing, light, fresh, and beautiful. I feel as if I'm morphing into a new version of myself as I dive deeper and deeper into restriction and I love it. I love *myself*, *for once.*  Anyway, this is all an illusion. It's a very very convincing one because it's a mental disorder unfortunately, but that's kind of what I've come to understand is reality via therapy. There *is* a way for you and I to be happy without being skinny, it's just that ED isn't allowing us to see it. The mindset feels like being stuck under a frozen lake to me, and not being able to find a crack in the ice (yet). But I hope that eventually we all will, and that will be real (*mental)* recovery.",False,False

I honestly have times where I feel like I was happiest at my lowest too. I was functional, balancing work and study, and doing well at both. However, my world was very small and I had my set routines, I was not spontaneous at all, could only eat set things and had lost a lot of joy in life. And to be honest, sometimes recovery absolutely seems worse than those times, because recovery is sucky and messy.  &amp;#x200B;  I guess one way of looking at it though, my psychologist would say you weren't happier because of your weight, you were happier because of the things you were doing. We tend to put our value on weight, but you still have the same wonderful traits regardless of what your weight is, and maybe we need to shift our value onto other things.",False,False
