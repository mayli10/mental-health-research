A good protein shake should only be about 100-150 calories and about 25g+ of protein per serve. I use Bulk Nutrients but idk if they deliver outside of Australia.,False,False

Tbh I just try to eat at maintenance on the days I'm doing weight lifting or at least make sure I eat high protein foods on those days. Then the other days I restrict and either do 30 mins of cardio (like HIIT) or a more aerobic session with lighter weights. If I'm feeling really low energy I just do less intense cardio. My trainer said that because I'm already thin doing stuff like bicycle crunches and other core work will lead to some increased definition, whereas on someone with a higher body fat % it wouldn't be noticeable.  I also just accept that my weight will fluctuate with about 1kg (2.2lbs) of water weight throughout the week. Weight lifting causes muscles to hold onto water so that's probably what the 3lbs was. Tbh probably one of the best things I ever did was accept that I won't have a perfectly flat and defined stomach 24/7, nobody does. Models restrict and don't drink water right before a photo shoot and runway shows to look that perfect. So as long as my overall weight is going down (or maintaining in your case) I don't mind if I look puffier on days where I'm not going anywhere to impress anyone anyway. I've found that as long as I keep a regular exercise routine and decent diet I will look good for social and special events. Hope that helps?",False,False

I do a mix of cardio and low weight stuff but kinda shittily rn because I don't have gym access.  &amp;#x200B;  A few things tho...1) you aren't going to gain 3lb of muscle in one session lol but muscles do get plumped with exercise and become heavier from blood in the muscle and water retention. It passes with rest, drinking plenty and water etc and will even out as your body gets used to regular exercise. 2) Generally...you won't gain much muscle if you are in a calorie deficit. If you are eating maintenance and have a decent amount of protein, you'll gain a bit, if you are in a deficit even if you are eating a decent amount of protein you will at best reduce the amount of lean tissue lost and encourage fat loss. Any muscle you do build is gonna be...smol. Like you will not gain a shit lot of muscle on a calorie deficit. That's why fitness people go through phases of bulking at cutting - you at least have to be eating maintenance to build muscle, when you lift in a deficit you burn fat.  &amp;#x200B;  Honestly, your best bet might be to go on a higher restriction model. You can still be in a calorie deficit if you are exercising and doing weight training, but you'll have more energy to actually do the training. You'll still lose weight, though you might need to put up with an adjustment period. If you do low weight high rep and stretch after workouts you'll get lean muscle and nice definition, high weight low rep is typically to bulk. Also, make sure you are getting enough salts! Sports drinks/electrolyte replacements will help a lot for muscle recovery. Stretching and massaging the muscles can help a lot too.  &amp;#x200B;  that's my understanding anyway. Feel free to correct if I got anything wrong.",False,False

If you want muscle definition (I know nothing crazy) but your going to have to eat for muscle gain. ( you don’t need heaps of protein, too much can cause damage, )but after cutting when you bulk you have to eat in a surplus and go hard at the gym,",False,False

What I’ve started doing is lifting weights at lower weight but higher reps because I’ve found that this actually helps to increase muscle definition and lets me look toned without getting too big. If I’m feeling especially weak or hungry that day, I’ll drink a protein shake while working out so that I have the strength to lift! A serving of protein shake is usually around 100 calories (more or less depending on the brand you’re taking) so it won’t impact your daily calories by too much. Plus it keeps you full and satisfied for quite long :) ",False,False

Just remember that when you work out your body is going to retain more water weight. On those lifting days allow yourself to eat extra if possible(which can be extremely difficult without triggering a binge) but try to up your protien!! (you can't build muscle without it or on a deficit), also extra electro lights /salt/potassium.   Soreness? Idk yet, DMS is a fucking bitch but it should get better with time. Sorry that was so ramblerly. It's a bunch of advice I've heard over time. Someone else will probably post something more informative &amp; less incoherent.",False,False
