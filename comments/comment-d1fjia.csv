I worked out 2-4 hours every day of course though. Turns out depriving my body to that level was definitely still starving myself.,False,False

I honestly don't think I could function with no food and have no idea how people do it.,False,False

What is a high amount to one person calorie wise might be low for another depending on their height,activity,sex, etc. Someone who loses the weight the “healthy way” but refuses to stop and goes well into the unhealthy BMI territory would still be disordered.",False,False

I usually eat 800-1400, more often around 1200 these days. I'm trying to maintain at the moment though because I've lost enough weight that I'm starting to get scared",False,False

From what I’ve seen from this sub, people who restrict “higher” (800-1200 cal) binge a lot less than the people who low restrict and fast.  Eating disorders are so much more complex than the amount you eat. It’s all about the obsession, fixation, and guilt surrounding food. You are real, valid, and deserve help just as much as people who eat less than you &lt;3",False,False

People who eat even lower might have more periods of semi-regular eating, ""binging"", whatever.  Eating ""high"" restriction amounts, unchangingly, will make you just as sick as eating horrendously ""low"" amounts regularly.  My perception's also skewed to the wall and back, but I don't think 800 is even a ""high"" amount - especially for people who have a higher TDEE for any number of reasons (activity level, low bodyfat%, tall person, ...).  I could be completely wrong tho. It's just my general impression.  At any rate - you aren't other people, all of this shit varies in a thousand ways between individuals, and you definitely aren't a fraud.",False,False
