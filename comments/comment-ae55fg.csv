This guy may have some fucked up version of love for you but he's going around getting with SEVERAL women that too while you were PREGNANT? He has zero respect for you, your relationship or your family and that is not what you should be surrounding your children with. You deserve better than that and better can mean being without a man.",False,False

Heâ€™s cheated on you *multiple* times over the course of your relationship. He doesnâ€™t respect you or your struggles with an ED, you deserve better. If one of your friends came to you telling you everything you described in this post, would you tell her to stay?? No! Youâ€™d tell her to get the hell out of there. You deserve someone who respects you and only wants YOU. Sending love ðŸ’ž",False,False
