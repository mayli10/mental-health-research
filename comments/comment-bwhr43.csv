I think it's both a mixture of loss of sensitivity of your gag reflex, and also just a loss of strength of your response to it. Either you just won't gag at all, or your stomach muscles and diaphragm have a much weaker reaction to that stimulation, so you'll retch but not strongly enough to actually vomit anything up.",False,False
