I had to look that up because I'm taking Japanese, lol.  The extent of my Spanish knowledge is counting up to 5, hola, audios, gracias, espanol, Despacito.  But if you want something bad enough...  As much as I like my thigh gap (my mom also had one before she started exercising, it's probably hereditary and automatically there, and the only way to make it go away is to become overweight), I feel like I'd much rather have a flat stomach so I don't have to get XL everything so my stomach doesn't stick out.  It's not like anyone is paying attention to my thighs, nor can they see a gap if I'm wearing black school slacks, but the stomach is the center, where people will notice.    I'd probably be a lot safer long-term, health-wise, if I had a flat stomach.",False,False

(and an unfortunately nonexistent ass, too) I rarely find jeans that fit; the calves and ankles are always way too small. Jeans that fit my thighs properly are too big on the waist.  But one day last summer, a coworker said, ""I wish my legs weren't so thin and weird. I wish I had nice thighs like yours."" I was shocked. Hearing her say that really helped me understand that the grass is always greener on the other side. Everyone had different ideas of beauty and what they want their body to be. And maybe I can be a little more flexible about how I want my body to look! (although it's hard as hell sometimes)",False,False
