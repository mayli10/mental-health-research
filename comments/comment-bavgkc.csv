I didn't lose the weight on purpose, but I had an undiagnosed disease (celiac) so I literally couldn't put weight on.  However, it made me terrified to eat anything for fear of....GI problems *ahem* which was never classic restriction.  But even after being diagnosed and getting my diet right and regaining my normal GI funcitoning, I was still under 17.5 for 3 years.    I guess I just got used to how I felt.  I also felt A LOT better after I stopped eating gluten, even though I didn't put weight on for several years.  All I really remember is beign constantly cold, getting injuries a lot (I was a runner and had nearly constant stress fractures), and having to sleep with a pillow between my knees because I was so bony.",False,False

It helps that I'm tall for sure, which actually made it harder for me to gain weight before my ED set in. Mainly though, I eat in a ""new normal"" way. I'm over the restrict till I die mindset and approach eating with a laissez-faire attitude. Some days I only have a normal dinner, others I'll have lunch and dinner and a snack. I don't exercise anymore really, which kind of sucks, but that's been what little weight I've gained has come from since I am not restricting as hard. No counting calories, way less fear of getting bigger or not being in control, and I'm not going to break down because I got drunk and ate a shitty meal once or twice a week. My stomach is smaller now, and I think my body has determined this to be the new normal. Which works for me, since that means I can eat more and still not gain weight (as proven since last December when I chose to intuitively eat proactively). It's weird, I'd thought I would have gained more, but I'm sitting at roughly 8 pounds heavier eating basically what I want when I want (including sweets). Maybe my portion size is just fucked, but I'm filling my plates up and feeling full. I'm glad that some of it came back too. My clothes fit a bit better, my boobs are half a cup bigger, my waist is still trim, my thighs are a bit more supple, my butt looks pretty good now. It's nice not being in the danger zone anymore, and the gaunt look just made strangers worry and caused people to make welfare checks on my behalf. Which sucked. The only thing I can complain about is my grocery bill every week.  I'd like to gain more to be honest. Just like 5 or 6 more pounds to round me out. It wasn't easy getting to a bad bmi - until it was, but eventually your brain shifts, maybe permanently if you're young. Can't say I don't struggle now, but it's not the eating, it's how my brain functions. I feel mentally slower, a lot of the ""brightness"" many teachers or professors thought I had is gone, I feel ditzier and literally dumber because I can't focus as hard anymore. Being extremely underweight has consequences, and now I'm just hoping it's not permanent.",False,False

I've never been somebody who could eat a lot of food. It started with being unable to eat without choking as a baby. It took way too long for me to get in for surgery and even as I got bigger and started eating more it was never as much as I should have been eating. Eventually in high school I did start eating as much as my twin brother, but I was exercising daily and he wasn't. I was still eating less than I should have. When I stopped having a reason to exercise every day after high school I started eating less again because I wasn't burning as much. (*I did break my foot in my first week of college and I was too young to sign myself up for the gym, so I couldn't exercise even if I wanted to.*) I did gain some weight in college because I lived in student residence and the healthy options were way overpriced plus there was a mandatory meal plan, so that meant I was eating a lot of greasy, calorie-dense food, but I only ever reached a BMI of around 20. When my ED first started getting really bad I was eating only about 500 calories per day and that didn't even seem too bad to me because I was used to eating small amounts anyway. At that point I was moved out of residence and eating less calorie-dense foods though. I did get pretty sick eventually which motivated to make my way back up to maintenance calories, but that basically meant eating the same amount of food I used to before my ED and just eating home-cooked meals. I should also mention that even now that I have gotten better and tried to gain weight so I wouldn't be underweight anymore that lead me to discover that I can't digest food properly anymore which means it's impossible to gain weight. Eating more than I need just makes me feel really sick. I think it would also be best for me to avoid eating solid foods. I'm planning to switch to mostly liquids when I get the chance to see if that helps me.",False,False

I never fast and hardly ever have a day with a caloric deficit greater than 600 because I am a long distance runner and find it practically impossible to be able to run (or really function at all) with much more than that.

My AN diagnosis was almost 25 years ago and the first 10-15 years or so was the more ‚Äúclassic‚Äù merry-go-round of hardcore restrict relapse episodes and rebound hunger recovery episodes, but after that it seemed to settle into what in hindsight seems like a more insidious hardwiring or something, I‚Äôm not sure, but I think I‚Äôm conditioned now to perceive high restriction as maintenance, so it‚Äôs really difficult to get those last few kilos on.

Fainting, shaking, and extreme bodily discomfort are easier to deal with mentally than eating more than a self-imposed limit, much less binging. Restricting is ""easy"" but it's kind of misleading to call it that because there's such enormous distress around not restricting.  I say this partly because I've been really frustrated by overrepresentation of ""perfect"" restriction in movies and TV, but a family friend's mother just died at 5'5"", 65 pounds.
