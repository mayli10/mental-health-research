This is largely to do with the hospital I went to though which has since lost its status as an ED clinic because it was just... The worst.   I've had just... so much therapy lol. For a number of issues. Bitches be crazy! (I'm bitches) (sorry I'm really tired so that might be funnier in my head). The therapy helped but mostly in the way of giving me the tools to direct this recovery myself. It's true what they say, you have to be ready to recover, and I was ready. That's not to say it was easy but it was largely under my own steam. I've been going to therapy throughout the last two years but it hasn't been a driving force in my recovery, it's been more about my own choices and the support of my amazing husband who has been very patient and understanding.",False,True

I really had to practice stopping and asking myself if I would say something like that to someone I love. If I wouldn't then I also had to practice correcting myself with a kinder sentiment. I'm not going to lie, it took a long time and I'm still not perfect at it but that's okay. You're allowed to be a work in progress.",False,True
