So, you’re ‘dating a guy who’s kind of an asshole’. What are you asking us? You’re right, he’s an asshole. You’re still dating him though it seems. Your choice what you wanna do, I doubt anything we can type will change your mind - you seem to have figured it all out yourself",False,False

You could find at least 10 men, *much* better than him, who would appreciate you for who you are.   I used to do the same and was dating this guy who was a total waste of space and made me feel shit about myself and made me want to work harder...but at the end of the day, it *never* ends well.
