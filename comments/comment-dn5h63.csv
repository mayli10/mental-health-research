The reason she cops so much hate is because she is a known liar and manipulator. She lied (and confessed after being busted) about rape, she manipulates and gaslights her subscribers and the people around her. Treats her current girlfriend like shit (though the gf isn’t wholly innocent in this either) and blatantly flirts with her ex in front of her. She tried to make her subscribers feel bad and dropped hints at being suicidal to then carry on eating massive amounts of food on camera and shopping up a storm and trying to deny that she manipulated people like that.   TLDR; Ambers a shitty person who isn’t getting hate unfairly, most of her “haters” had once been supporters. I supported her once too.",False,False
