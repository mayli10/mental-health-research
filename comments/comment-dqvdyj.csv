I already lost 100lbs in 13months from my ED.     Iâ€™m just trying to get this surgery to help me boost it faster. I have the control, besides my question wasnâ€™t about my surgery. I know 6ppl in my family and friends.    2 who gained it back, and 4 who are still going at it after about 5-10yrs.     My question was about me being Inpatient about my Bulimia.. would someone my size, get IP?? Or am I just gonna be laughed at??",False,True

Also imho with a sample size of 3 people at my work who where all very overweight and had the same surgery, all three of them dropped an f load of weight and then put most/all/more of it back on. The stomach can be stretched again, itâ€™s a huge surgery and not a magic cure all of you donâ€™t get the mental aspect of eating under control, and I mean that in the most loving caring way possible.",False,False
