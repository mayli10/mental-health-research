Also a lot of servers won‚Äôt even bother typing in the modification into the ticket for the chef.

I added all of it up and it was 720kcal. I didn't finish that biscuit. I tried eating breakfast for once and I literally just can't do it anymore. When I got home I cried. I never, ever eat breakfast and the one time I do I'm horribly betrayed. It fucked my entire day up. How do regular people eat breakfast?! Where were the calories?!

Or you‚Äôre at the grocery store check out and you decide to get that bag of m&amp;ms which is like what 140 cals per serving???? As a snack!   Even an average dinner! A serving of pasta is 200 calories and no one eats just one serving. At least a serving and a half. Plus the sauce and ground beef if it‚Äôs spaghetti and meat sauce. Maybe a side salad with some kind of dressing. It adds up so quickly but it‚Äôs the norm.   And don‚Äôt forget you eat breakfast which is a cup of coffee with creamer some fruit maybe? A bowl of cereal? A granola bar?   Lunch...a regular sandwich with an actual normal amount of deli meat and full fat mayo and whatever other condiments and side of chips.  And from my understanding it‚Äôs pretty typical to order out maybe once a week for families as a treat on the weekends? Like pizza.   I just don‚Äôt understand.,False,False
