That's also way more sustainable, otherwise you'll find yourself in the Jojo-effect, so your weight will go rapidly up after eating normal again (when restricting)  But please stay safe and don't exaggerate.

I'm 5""4 and weighed 85lbs at my lowest...then came a time where I binged and purged a lot, ate WAY worse than what you describe (I would down 12 ice cream cones in 10 min) and so I gained to about 120.  I was addicted to food. And I think it's because I've restricted so much the years before.  Now I still struggle with purging, but I'm rather addicted to purging than to the food. Food doesn't really bother me anymore, because I am not restricting anymore. I'm watching my calories but not heavily restricting and yes, I did lose weight. (105 currently again, and it's alright)  So please, my advice is: try to set yourself a healthy calorie limit (let's say 1500-1600?) I know this might sound a lot but it's still WAY better  than bingeing on 3000. Many of us struggle with this ""all or nothing"" mentality but that doesn't help, trust me. So try to eat a healthy amount of calories with healthy and filling food, nourish your body, and you will see that eventually those urges will go away and if you are concerned about your weight, I'm sure you will also lose a few pounds (Not saying that you have to!)  Lots of love, stay strong, you got this!",False,False
