There’s certain little tells when she weighs food and the way she speaks about it. I get the vibe that there’s at least a bit of disordered behaviour around it.,False,False

Speaking of TWs, is it worth marking this post as such? I included some weight numbers, which I could see being upsetting to some. Please advise!

I’m not familiar with her but 100lbs at 5’5” is definitely too small. It’s hard to look at somebody and know what they’re going through when they don’t talk about it but it def sounds sus, so thank you for the bit of a tw! Things like food weighing is a big trigger for me",False,False
