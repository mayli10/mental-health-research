But honestly a lot of people w EDs have a pattern of codependent and/or abusive relationships. A loooot of the people posting about their relationships are doing it bc they’re not in a healthy one. So yeah we jump to conclusions here but a decent amount of the time, I don’t think people are wrong about that specifically",False,False

ED related and otherwise. Sometimes I  feel resilient and don't care. Sometimes I'm a beta af white knight and I'm like, ""you right, you right"". I've lost my cool and commented and ranted back...  I think it's really interesting to experience all of it. It sucks, it can trigger me into a self loathing spiral or make me rage.  I also realize that I've said these things so many times, it's not a specific attack, it's insensitive and unaware, but the generalization is a short cut to connecting with others. I think it's appropriate to call people on it if they're jumping on a man hating bandwagon.  As much as the road is for both old and young people. The mall is for Hispanic and Nordic. This sub is for you and me so we can join together and say food is not for us!",False,False

The closest thing I can see to what OP talks about is users commenting on how men perpetuate some of the standards that lead to ED in some people, but thats not disparaging him, and the people making those comments aren't false. Plus there are tons of posts where people where people discuss comments made to them ""by other women"" or express that they receive the brunt of comments on their weight by women. This doesn't mean that the posters believe women to be the only perpetrators of ED. I am male and while I hear comments on my ""weakness"" from men, I hear different comments on my ""malnourishment"" from women. Different genders often make different weight related comments.   &amp;#x200B;  TLDR: Different genders perpetuate EDs in different ways. Commenting on how we only hear a certain comment from a certain gender is not invalidating you.",False,False

It's kind of tricky to call out though because this sub is supposed to be a safe space to vent and you don't wanna antagonize the commentors/posters  People are already disagreeing with your sentiments in the comments. This is reactionary/individuals your observations don't apply to take the post personally. Doesn't nullify the existence of toxic attitudes within this sub though  The community turns me off a lot, but I compartmentalize it. While this is a support subreddit, often threads turn to antagonizing the subject of an OP's post rather than supporting the OP (the line of which is often blurred). Don't get me wrong, sometimes it's warranted, some people are awful, but boyfriends, for example, are antagonized almost as default treatment (I've seen other posts complaining about this as well). It's super weird to post something innocuous and then have someone call your partner a piece of shit or an asshole-- reminder that not everyone struggles with an eating disorder, and that ignorance does not equal asshole. Antagonizing those in our personal lives doesn't help anyone, nor is it a healthy way to vent your frustrations.  But yeah, this sub can get catty, self-absorbed at times. Compartmentalize it is my advice to anyone reading this who also takes issue with the community. There are shitty parents, shitty cancer patients, and there are shitty users on the subreddit. Unlikable people exist. You don't have to give unconditional positive regard to every poster in the sub. I know compartmentalizing doesn't help or change anything, but I think this acknowledgment of the community helps because no one wants to address its flaws",False,False

Probably a few “men are scum” type people on here, but probably understandably so because of their past experiences with them. I’m a psych major, and ~40-60% of men and women that are diagnosed with eating disorders have some sort of sexual trauma. I mean if I was abused by men my whole life I’d probably hate them too. Just trying to offer some new perspective to help you come at it more compassionately. And again, I don’t feel the majority of this community is at all discriminatory or unaccepting of males, but there are going to be the few here that are, just like any community (especially under these aforementioned circumstances!). Hope this helps bro.",False,False

We talk shit about each other, about our partners, spouses, boyfriends, brothers, sisters, parents, teachers, aunts, whatever. And I think that is a special thing. We are an incredibly empathetic and forgiving group, a safe space for all our dirty and  forbidden feelings.   I understand how the hostility may feel pinpointed at one group or another but it’s simply not. With that being said everyone deserves a place where they can feel understood, accepted and safe. Wishing you the best on your journey. Don’t be a stranger if you change your mind, forgive us for our problems, it’s why we’re here.",False,False
