Be careful or you could pass out and hit your head. When I feel the edges of my vision going black, I immediately sit down with my head between my knees until it goes away. That only happens during my restriction cycles so it's definitely ED related.",False,False

Even if you take away the ED, my chronic low blood pressure, anemia, hypoglycemia, vertigo and accelerated /uneven heartbeat so a pretty good job of teaming up and making me kiss the floor more often than I'd like. But I do feel like it's pretty common in the restrictive Ed types. Not exactly normal by normal standards, but normal for us ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è.",False,False

Low blood pressure when you stand up can cause the dizziness and dark/blurry vision, plus falling. A restricted intake can easily cause that. It's very common among people who restrict their intake or purge. I get it a lot too -- I wouldn't call it ""normal"" in the general population but it's common with people who have eating disorders.",False,False
