Yeah I'm absolutely the same I have desserts quite rarely (way less than them) and prefer sweeteners to actual sugar but that doesn't stop them. Thank you for replying hope you have a good day!,False,True

She is probably just worried that you might develop it too since you share her DNA and probably a predisposition for it. Still, a little sugar is fine. As long as you overall eat very healthy your body can handle a few teaspoons a day. If you were eating candy and desserts every day that would be different. That would be equivalent to just shoving spoonfuls of sugar in your mouth constantly. It's fine in moderation though.   Personally I cut most sugar out of diet because I am concerned about the ramifications for my health it may have, but I also don't avoid it. I just try to practice consuming less added sugar when possible, so like using sweetener instead of sugar in drinks and not eating sweets too often. I have actually found that once I did this I stopped liking sugar. Things that are sweet still taste good, but things that are basically just flavoured sugar are too much for me. I guess it's because sugar can be sort of addictive? I mostly only get sugar from natural sources like fruits and vegetables now. Every once in a while I have dessert for a special occasion or because it's been a while and I feel like treating myself. I think it's definitely possible to work on being less afraid of food, including sugary foods, without incorporating sugar into your daily diet. Everyone is different though so if you feel like this is a helpful step toward recovery for you than don't listen to your parents and just consume whatever you want.",False,False
