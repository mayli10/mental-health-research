The chicken &amp; fries that I ate and so desperately wanted out of my system, no where to be seen, but That 1 blueberry that I had for breakfast, now that came up easily (keep in mind that the blueberry was eaten 12 hours prior to purging) Nothing like having your safe foods all purged instead of what you actually wanted to purge.",False,False

Lemme see if i can find the article. Also food comes up not in the order eaten but from density and fun fact: bread and other starches like that clump together cause of our saliva so they become heavier and sink vs say protein and vegetables. Idk if this is a damage reduction comment or not, if this is triggering or against the rules please let me know lol. And I'm sorry this wasn't of much direct help but I hope knowing the science behind it makes you feel a little better oof :(",False,False
