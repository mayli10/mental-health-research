I think it has to do with being bipolar for me. When I start something new hobby or activity I go full force until something new comes around. Last year I started doing yoga everyday and would beat myself up if I didn’t. I got a yoga mat and cute yoga clothes.  That lasted for three months.   In March I started meal prepping my ed foods, especially soup because that’s all I would eat. I would also make a batch of hard boiled eggs and only eat a cup of 200 cal soup and an egg everyday at work with a Diet Coke. That was for about 2 months and I dropped 20lbs.  Then when I got a new job in a restaurant I started obsessing over eating “healthy”. Only salads, homemade stuff, no dairy, basically vegan.   Now it’s a mix of healthy and box frozen dinners that I just add more vegetables too so that’s it’s a larger portion.   Within the last two weeks I’m obsessed with walking. I’ll walk an hour to Walmart with my back pack and reusable bags to shop and then come home. Or just go on a 1:30 walk after work.",False,False

Since I have OSDD myself. but not sure how much the drastic changes in ED behaviour are related since I'm not really very self aware and they seem to last for ages, even after switching to someone else. It's confusing. Thanks for your response!",False,True
