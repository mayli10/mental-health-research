When I was 13, in really needed media that made me feel normal. I went through so many stages of feeling subhuman because of all the things I did to protect my anorexia. You know, the little things like rejecting your grandma’s home cooked food or not eating anything in your aunt’s wedding and getting looks around the table for refusing everything. When I looked for books about my experiences, I found only a small few that helped, but most of them were glamorizing and triggering. In a sick way, I wanted to be the deep, mysterious, and ethereal sad girl that was alluring and untouchable. I realize how ridiculous that sounds but I went through that “I am different” stage as a teenager like most of us do before we mature. Not many of the books explained the ridiculous things Ike hiding rocks in your pocket when your mom weighed you or the gallons of water I would frantically  drink before my weight in at the hospital so I would gain lbs in water weight and not be commuted for the 3rd time in a year. I am past that and healing now but somewhere, some young girl or boy is going through this and much worse.  I want the book I write to accomplish two things:   1. Show them how unhealthy and ridiculous an Ed truly is. It’s not pretty or glamorous. It sucks you dry in the most unromantic way possible  2. Make them feel human and not so alone.  I really hope I can do it in a non triggering way with a lot of consideration of what I am doing will truly benefit the Ed community. I feel no greater tie to anything in my life because it really defines me for so long and a lot of people with Eds know how frustrating it is to live like this. An alcoholic can avoid drinking forever. An addict can avoid drugs. But no matter how hard you try, you have to confront the tough reality that food is necessary and you can’t escape it.   Sorry if this got too long. I am procrastinating sleep",False,True

I hate all the glamour-ED that I've seen forever, I think the thing we fear most is triggering others, but portraying your REALITY, with all the real gross human things is deeply moving and healing",False,False

But yeah I think it's a great idea to write something realistic about EDs, I feel like so much media that is produced about it is either made by people who have never had an ED and just think that they're neat or something or people who have had an ED but don't want to be too honest about it(which is understandable)",False,False

I have been looking for a good book that mimics my experience. I really want to write a book like the one you say. I wanna really portray Eds as the harsh reality they are and not something an ethereal moon girl. I am sick of Ed books portray the characters as these sad core manic pixies.,False,True

I want to make a character that is real and not romanticized. I want it to be really hard hitting and that mirrors reality perfectly. I want to make a book that makes people with EDs feel heard and understood and people that are oblivious to EDs open their eyes to the true realities without getting their sad girl/boi porn.
