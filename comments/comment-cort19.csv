Exact the same way. I'm so goddamn sick of this constant back and forth cycle and I want to be normal and happy so damn much. I don't know what I can say to help you, but know that you're not alone. I hope that we all can get better and live a happier life one day. Sending you lots of hugs!",False,False

If you're a loser with zero self control, then I'm right besides you in that category. So please, don't call yourself such dehumanizing terms you wouldn't call another person a loser, would you?    We all have good and bad days, and then those really bad days. What has helped me in the past before I relapsed was not weighting myself several times a day especially after binges. Please, drink a lot of water and try to eat healthy for the next several days, and if you absolutely need to weight yourself in a weeks time, which is what has helped me - doing weekly weight-ins and not daily ones.  Remember it takes a big person to admit to themselves when they have failed and a weak one to lie. So I commend you for being so open with your imperfections and wish you the best!  Remember one bad day, does not make you worth any less then you did the day before.",False,False
