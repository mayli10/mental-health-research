I get no emotional or financial support. Cant eat, cant sleep, cant feel, cant make a living wage.   Its hard to go through life, and not let the pain effect your children. Sometimes I just stare off into space when they talk. And I dont want to be the emotionally distant mom. but that is my coping mechanism. Breakups are hard, but they do heal with time. I always give severe emotional distress 28 days to see if it feels better. Because I feel like hormones have a huge impact on that healing process..  When it comes to the purging, you might use some NLP therapy? If there was a woman that looked like you, lived like you, and she could eat during the day and keep it down, what would that look like? What would that feel like? How would she walk? How would she talk? You must adopt those attributes. And you will see there is someone inside you capable of doing these things.   At least that was my takaway from watching Richard Bandler 1989 lectures on youtube. Highly recommend.",False,False
