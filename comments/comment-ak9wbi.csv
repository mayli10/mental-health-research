I'm not a trans and have always strongly identified as a guy, so the hatred I feel towards having boobs is not the mild hatred that I have towards having love handles or a protruding stomach. I guess it's the same kind of dysphoria that FtM trans guys feel towards their chest. There's something there that just doesn't belong and it feels weird, because it's not a part of who I identify as a person.  There's only thee options for me at this point. Either finding balance and maintaining a slightly underweight BMI in the long term, starting to eat without restrictions and feeling intense hatred &amp; dysphoria towards a part of my body after weight gain, or getting liposuction to have them removed surgically. At this moment the first option seems the easiest.",False,False
