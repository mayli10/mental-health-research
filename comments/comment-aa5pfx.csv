The caps are not attractive but if it’s in the back it shouldn’t be too bad I had quite a few in my time. They’d usually try to crown it but they’re more expensive than sealing it with a cap.  Be safe. ,False,False

If you’re malnourished it could be because of that. Silly advice but maybe try taking vitamins? Or call your dentist’s office and tell them you’re experiencing weak, brittle teeth and want to know what you can do to remedy it on your own! Good luck. ",False,False
