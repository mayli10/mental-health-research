I know it did for me. My mom used to be chubby in her teens, lost a ton of weight and wasn't as self conscious about her body anymore, even until today.  An ideal body *can* make someone happy/ satisfied as long as we aren't too unreasonable. It's definitely NOT everything, but don't feel bad for wanting a nice body.  If you want to lose weight, go for it. :) We are all here to support you as long as you do it in a healthy and sustainable way of course.",False,False
