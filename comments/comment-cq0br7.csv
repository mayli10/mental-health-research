I kind of realized how skinny my legs are, even at a healthier weight. Sure my stomach isn't as sunken now but my hair isn't falling off either. I feel kind of bad for being so obsessed with weight during spring, I was no more than 40kg at 5'4. Not the skinniest but still. My legs were just bone and skin, even at 43kg. I still have trouble acceptibg my stomach but I'm getting there, hopefully. I guess I'll still ""diet"" in the future but not as obsessively. I used the word diet because I feel like I don't meet the criteria for AN anymore.",False,False

I love those glimpses of acceptance and clarity - I think it's a nod to a genuine possibility for recovery. I hope they happen more and more for you (and finally a mosquito did something positive lol) üíï,False,False
