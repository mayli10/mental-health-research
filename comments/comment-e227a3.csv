It is so unfair your grandma put you in this situation and shamed you on your birthday. Birthdays are a day of fun and treats. Unfortunately it can be hard being around family who do not respect you on this special occasion.   Three slices of cheesecake do not affect your body in the long run, but those words have stuck around and hurt you. But it is not too late, you can still enjoy this new chapter.  I find when people comment on my eating it is because they are going through issues of their own. Although I may never understand it, coming into it with this mindset helps me let it go a bit more.   I grew up with grandparents who constantly critiqued my body and told me I was destined to be obese. I was compared to my very skinny sister and it messed with my head. It used to get me down so hard and I got constant mixed messages as they would offer me all kinds of sweets and then shame me if I ate them. In my early twenties I was stuck in such a messed up cycle of emotions with food that I began binge eating and went from normal weight to overweight.  Six years later,  I am at normal weight and restricting and I feel like the negative voices are still in my head. Nowadays my grandparents just tell me I look skinny, but words from years ago are in my mind.   I have learned to stand up for myself better. If they make fun of me for eating sweets I go along with it and laugh it off, saying I am only having a treat. If they make fun of me for refusing the food I say I am trying to eat healthy. Then I eat how I WANT, whether it is restricting or my treats. I still love my grandparents but I am the one living in this body, and they will never understand my body image struggles.  I know many of us on this sub have shared this kind of pain you are in. I hope you can find peace and know that we are all here for you.",False,False

I’m sorry you’re feeling this way, but please know that you DID deserve that cake on your birthday and look forward to 23 being a good one. Xoxxxoooxox",False,False

People just really dont make sense, i know its painful and hard, but dont listen to them. They are either trying to hurt your feelings on purpose, not thinking about what they are saying or are in a bad mood and decide to snap at you in order to let it out.
