I picture myself at a given weight to be ""healthy,"" but in reality I see it as a max weight and then why not leave some cushion space, just in case ya know?   So I get within 5 lbs of the weight and alarm sounds start going off. I don't actually want to get there because what if I keep going? What if I shoot past that weight and go to a new hw?  So now I'm trying a fast to reverse the weight gain and feel like I have control of my eating again. I wish I could just eat maintenance, but that's too close to overeating.",False,False

But, it's also kind of on purpose because I want people to get off my back about my weight. It's a battle because every time I see a higher number on the scale I just want to cry.",False,False
