For me, when I go over my calories I just tell myself “Okay, maybe this was 1,750 calories over my daily limit. Well my daily limit is already 800 under maintenance so that means only 950 calories of this is gain. If everyday I’m having a deficit of 800 then 950 only puts me one day behind.” It’s a little obsessive but it helps me, and remember it’s only one day. :) have a beautiful 18th birthday, you won’t forget that one it’s a great age!",False,False
