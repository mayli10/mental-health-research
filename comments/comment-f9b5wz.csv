firz1ou,t3_f9b5wz,t3_f9b5wz,SweatshirtHoe,2,2020-02-25 17:41:01,/r/EDAnonymous/comments/f9b5wz/whats_something_you_can_eat_a_lot_of_without/firz1ou/,"Goldfish are surprisingly low cal, 55 for 140cals  There's these things I've found called popcorners. They're puffed corn chips. My favorite varieties are bbq (3cals a chip) and white cheddar (6 cals a chip)  I like freezing some light whipped cream until it's SUPER cold then mixing some sugar free Hershey's syrup and some pb2 in there. I put a little more chocolate sauce than I like so I eat it slower (~50 cals for how much I usually eat)  Carrots and some low cal salad dressing is delicious  Strawberries dipped in a 3/1 mix of sugar free Hershey's syrup to normal syrup (to make it more palatable. Sweetener doesn't do it. I've tried) is like a low-cal fondue  Corn good thins are 3 cals a chip and taste exactly like Fritos  An apple cubed into bite sized pieces are good for low-cal snacking. They're also really good dipped into the chocolate syrup mix  A bowl of thick-ish pb2 eaten with an espresso spoon can last a while  Pixy Stix (sugar in a tube, essentially) is only 8.5 cals a stick. It's a new safe snack of mine. They're at the dollar store too. So cheap, so good",False,False

I usually have it with a sauce that adds about 100 extra calories, but even then it adds up to just over 400, and its tasty and filling. You could cut the calories even more by replacing the broccoli with spiralised courgette... but broccoli is tastier.",False,False

Or i will chop up an onion and cook it in water and spices and eat it like that. Veggies are crazy low cal so i like to roast brussel sprouts and ill break off the leaves so you get lots of crunchy chips from roasting them. Sometimes ill slice up apples really really thin and lay them out so they cover a huge plate and sprinkle them with cinnamon. I like to chop up rice cakes and will spread sugar free preserves on them too. And cucumber slices with hummus i could eat that for every meal.
