So many experiences as a young adult missed because I was too fat, too ugly, oh I cant fit into those cute clothes, oh I'll look like a beached whale if I try that dance class....

Lucky for me, yesterday doesn’t have to define all the tomorrows, and so long as we’re on this side of the ground there’s still time to do things we love. &lt;3  I watched a TED talk called “How to Stop Screwing Yourself Over” that really got me thinking about how often I shut myself down. I’m so good at coming up with reasons for “no”. So good at letting my fear and doubt run my show. Maybe life is about learning to say “yes” to yourself.  (So now I’m learning to play the cello as an adult. I’ll never play Carnegie Hall and I chuckle over my level being that of a 7-year-old, but it’s also been an incredibly fun experience. It has made the living of my life immeasurably better.)",False,False
