It also completely eliminates my appetite. As in, I'd heard some medications can do that and I kind of scoffed to myself because my appetite is SO STRONG, but honestly I take this in the morning and will go through till like 5pm before I realise I completely forgot to eat the whole day (which I never thought I'd say lol). Anyway, it's pretty easy to find online and it's totally legal, just wouldn't be through a 'real' prescription. Obviously be careful, it does make my heart go quite fast and can trigger my anxiety, but as far as I understand EC stacking is pretty bad for that too. Be safe!",False,False

The market is filled with so many dodgy supplements claiming to do one thing or promising ideal results and delivering ill health and sometimes death. (Not an exaggeration, there's a lot of reports and documentaries I've come by about it.)  I'd suggest sorting out binge eating by developing healthier habits. Relying on supplements isn't sustainable. It doesn't provide long lasting results because you don't know how to deal with your binge episodes when you're not taking the supplements.  However, if you're absolutely adamant that you have to use supplements, I would suggest healthier alternatives like glucomannan, choline/inositol, chromium. Chromium and glucomannan might help.",False,False
