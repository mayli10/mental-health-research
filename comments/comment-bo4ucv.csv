I feel fine now! That ED that developed to deal with dysmorphia, or emotional distress, or what have you, wow it’s just gone!”  Telling someone who’s struggling to “get over it” is pretty clearly unhelpful, so it seems to me that the lovely internet denizens spouting that trash are getting their twisted jollies by being judgmental of others. Reading messages like that still hurts though, which is a big part of why lately I stick to this sub and a couple Discord servers. Don’t need the bile of strangers in my life.
