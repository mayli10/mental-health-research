I just talked to her and told her that she was triggering me a bit and she told me that it was okay and that she’s stop mentioning it! I don’t know why I didn’t just talk to her in the first place (I guess I was scared to offend her), but thanks for your encouragement— it helped quite a bit! ",False,True

If her talking about food or body issues is jeopardizing your current stability you might consider expressing this to her or asking to put those topics on hold for the time being. My SO has asked me not to talk about my self-harm thoughts with him and that’s totally ok. We don’t have to be all things to each other. I can utilize other sources of support.  Your worry about her developing an eating disorder may be reasonable, but something I observe in myself is that because of my own history I overreact to any small signs of potentially disordered behavior in others. I’ll be on red alert when in actuality everything is fine. Admittedly, for me a little bit of it stems from “how dare you weigh less than me” or “oh, if she’s not hungry I guess I’m a pig.” It’s complicated.",False,False
