Any suffering you experience is real and valid and you have every right to ask for help.  And anyone who tells you otherwise can fuck right the hell off because they aren’t you and they don’t have to live with your suffering.",False,False

I found that the old anorexia diagnosis was bullshit because by the point most people are the specified BMI (whatever that is at this point), they’re already neck deep in the disordered eating and have been that way for at the very least several months if not years or decades.  Technically, OSFED is the most current version of EDNOS, but your doctor should have also given you a subclass diagnosis, since OSFED covers everything from abnormal anorexia to binge eating.  Im not officially diagnosed because I’ve chosen to avoid insurance complications, but I oscillate between OSFED abnormal anorexia and OSFED bulimia.  Basically, it’s not just you, the whole system is super confusing because more people with eating disorders actually fall under the “catch-all” of OSFED than any other diagnosis.  The DSM is always trying to improve classifications though, because the real purpose of diagnoses is so patients can be treated more effectively and specifically for the issues they have.  So that is probably why they removed the BMI requirement for anorexia.  Its also confusing when not everyone is on the same page, and it sounds like your current doctor may still be using the DSM-IV, since he used the term EDNOS. So basically if you go to a different doctor who is using the current system, you may get a different diagnosis.  Fucking psychology man.",False,False

The DSM says “Weight that is less than minimally normal” ie underweight. There are classifications within anorexia and a BMI 17.0+ is “mild”. Atypical anorexia is a subtype of OSFED where AN criteria are met except that the person isn’t underweight.",False,False
