I‚Äôm going just wear these for now and see if things last, ya know?   I‚Äôm also a HUGE fan of L-XL shirts tucked in. High waist with French or full tuck is my go to if I‚Äôm not wearing a crop that day. Or oversized men‚Äôs button downs tied up in the front.   I‚Äôve never had a booty before.

And yay, I'm so glad you found those teensy Wranglers!  I just wish I wasn't (an I'm assuming so are you)  so obsessed with tucking in everything into my jeans + high waisted everything, that'd make all the ill fitting clothes a bit more wearable üò≠  And forget about having anything even resembling a booty in anything üò≠  How do you feel about chunky dark belts and tight at the waist jeans that are slightly wrinkly (like a chill early-mid 90s vibe)?",False,False

I can‚Äôt exactly replace the pieces due to cost alone. IDFK how much my BF spent on my Holy Grail ‚Ñ¢Ô∏è 1970s selvedge Levi‚Äôs he got me for my birthday.   I‚Äôm also hesitant to get any of them altered bc what if I gain? I‚Äôve been roughly my size for several years and don‚Äôt want to alter and potentially ruin my denim.

Belts suck + don't help and I can't afford or find the same pairs of / similar jeans it's the worst. And I still don't even have a flat tummy like *wtf is the point*.
