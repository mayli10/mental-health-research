Back in high school, I'd go to the salon once every two months to get something different done: different cut, different style, different color. But for the last 6 years \[reminder, class of 2009: you old now\], I've told my hairdresser to do the same thing every time: just freshen up the ends and renew the layers.  Today I told her to just cut off the split ends and cut a little frame around my face where it's a bit shorter.   I am so blown away. No, I don't magically all of a sudden love myself, but I do feel a lot more ""like myself."" If that's a thing.  I have never seen such a small pile of hair on the floor afterwards. My boyfriend got his hair cut right before I did (we met the hairdresser through one of his past jobs, so he actually gets this girl to do his hair way more often than mine) and I'm sure he had more hair cut off than I did, volume-wise.   I just couldn't believe that such a small material change (that is, she didn't actually cut off THAT MUCH hair) would cause such a big change in my mentality. I just feel a lot more like myself, if that makes sense. I feel like cleaning up the ends of my hair also cleaned up the edges of my*self*, as lame as that sounds.   Thanks for reading. This is the only place I know I can let my thoughts out without being judged so hard.
