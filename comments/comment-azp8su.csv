It‚Äôs a mental illness, not a hobby. You don‚Äôt age out of body image issues and disordered eating. You don‚Äôt choose it and you can‚Äôt choose to stop it. But you can choose to recover, reduce harm, live your life. Every year or two, I congratulate myself on my recovery only to realize that I‚Äôve moved into another disorder. ",False,False

I feel like I missed my chance to get help when I was younger and had doctors on my ass left and right trying to take care of me. Now I know I have a problem and...I just have to deal with it.

I feel like completely the wrong demographic for having an ED, which is why when I was diagnosed I refused to believe it for ages.

I started having food issues when I was 10, was at the height of my disorder in high school, recovered and then some in college, and now I‚Äôm relapsing hard... for me it‚Äôs just like an unending cycle, and I worry I‚Äôll never be free?  I‚Äôm terrified it‚Äôs either be disordered or be fat. My treatment never helped me gain a normal relationship or any semblance of such with food. Idk I find growing older weird and strange and maybe for me engaging in disordered behaviour is an attempt to reconnect with my youth..which was swallowed up by disorder....
