It can happen to the best of us (if this seems to be the case of what happened.) I won't even lie right now, I'm not sure what student advocacy is as I'm not in college at the moment but it might be best to go to this professor directly, if you're comfortable with that, OP, if other means may get her in trouble. I say that only because of varying circumstances and so on. But if you aren't comfortable doing so then you *should* go to someone about it, student advocacy or whatever would work for you.   By the way, I just want to throw out there that I'm not the one that downvoted you in case this comes off as aggressive lol.",False,False
