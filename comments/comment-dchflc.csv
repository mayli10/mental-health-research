If you taste it on your tongue it‚Äôs gonna hit your teeth no matter what.   I always drink a sip of water after taking a sip of soda. It helps flush it out and keep the pH as high as possible so the acid from the soda doesn‚Äôt get a chance to sit on your teeth.   Also aspartame doesn‚Äôt ferment like sugar does in your mouth so arguably if you drink lots of water with your soda it‚Äôs healthier for your teeth than any drink or food with sugar in it (which is p much every food lol),False,True
