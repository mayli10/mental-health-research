I haven’t had sex w my bf in a long time because I hate my body and I don’t want anyone else to see it but I would never tell him that cause it’s embarrassing unless he asked and we had a serious convo about it.",False,False

Whenever my fiance is stressed out he doesn't want to have sex and it has nothing to do with me. It took me a long time to understand this and I still have trouble sometimes... good luck❤,False,False

Honestly something my boyfriend has drilled into my head is - if a guy says something to his SO or does something and it can be interpreted in different ways - bad or good, they mean the good way. Guys just don't really think about the consequences of their actions and words, or the other ways to interpret them that they don't mean. i.e - he once told me he loves how soft I am, which I heard as ""fat"" but what he meant was apparently that I have a nice butt.   The only way I've found to deal with it is just always clarify ""why did you say that/do that"" ""what do you mean by that"" etc etc.   But still - sorry he made you feel like that :(  Hope this made sense, English isn't my first language.",False,False
