Her video posted December 6 2019 titled reading your assumptions about me.. time stamp 1:10 to 1:13 shows her chest bones.. and time stamp 1:20 to like 1:25 shows her arms. you have to pause at the right time. this makes me really sad, like super sad to watch her deteriorate again. she has to want the help, and it’s so hard when you have an ED. let’s just pray for her and hope she realizes it’s a problem soon..",False,False

A professional did an assessment with Eugenia alone to determine whether she needed care, and said that she needed to be taken in. The mother tried to stop that process, even calling the police on the friends for kidnapping.  This was all a very traumatic experience and they feel that Eugenia wont get better around her mother. They also wanted to clear their names because people are referring to them as bullies etc. The most powerful line for their video is ""I'd rather have her alive and hate me"". I highly recommend the video.  They worked with a lawyer and a psychologist to try everything they could before the 5150, however the mother stopped it. They couldnt do the 5150 in Eugenia's home because the mother denied all law enforcement in the past.",False,False

I dont like to say that because it's likely an insecurity of hers but that's just an observation I've made,False,False

Also her voice is going higher again since her video with Shane and I've heard that's like a coping thing she does.  If the 5150 story is real it makes sense shes relapsing in that environment. If the 5150 story isnt real is makes sense that after all the structure of IP it's harder to keep pushing when you're on your own.  Either way, I hope she can turn it around before she gets back to where she was because shes such a sweet person.",False,False
