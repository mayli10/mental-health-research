He‚Äôs muscular skinny himself and simply doesn‚Äôt understand the whole b/p, fat loss/gain cycle. He has always been understanding so yea idk I think my ed really makes me see the worst in people/make situations rather dark. Losing all perspective. Also I think ur right about being more muscular. That‚Äôs why I fit in a smaller size but look different than before. However as I‚Äôm ageing I‚Äôm starting to want to end this endless cycle. I‚Äôm somewhere in an age range the idea of children is no longer impossible and seems attainable. It would kill me to pass these problems with food onto my children. I like how bodybuilders can treat their body as a vessel, bending it to their command. Whereas for me it‚Äôs a rather emotional thing. And I agree about the male/female thing. We can‚Äôt out run years of evolution. I even think it‚Äôs ok for woman to be fluffy, just not on me lol. But when I think of what bodybuilders do, I‚Äôm like get over yourself with your ‚Äúslow metabolism‚Äù.  And in the same light I‚Äôm trying the accept the state my body is in and not let it influence my day. I mean I just finished a master in a year - I deserve a break and I‚Äôm gonna take it. The gym will still be there in a few months.  I do recognise the feeling of not wanting food inside you. Making you feel dirty. I feel best when I wake up empty that‚Äôs the best feeling of the day lol and than I f it up lol. I hope you find your way in controlling the b/p. I think only doing it once a week is a huge effort and you should be proud!!! I‚Äôm sure you will succeed in quitting completely. For me it‚Äôs all about distracting myself whenever I want to purge. A good way for me is too walk the dog and really get into another setting. After a while the feeling is passed...   How‚Äôs the job thing going? I feel like time is passing really fast as I‚Äôm having multiple interviews but than I look back and I‚Äôm like oh... only been at home for like a month....... so prob ur still in the same situation :)  No dressing up here but I like your costume! Seems like fun hahaha sad Halloween is only once a year. I‚Äôd love to have an excuse for a nice dress up going all out.",False,False

I guess I want to move from greed to charity. Give rather than take.   I wouldn‚Äôt comment on your SO or your relationship. I don‚Äôt know you both to say but from experience I would say comments like ‚Äúoh god your arm is really fat like this‚Äù &amp; ‚Äúthere is plenty to thrive on.‚Äù I know he is trying to be helpful but it‚Äôs hard for someone without an ED to understand. He may think he is being constructive &amp; positive, but those comments are a whole different thing all together. Are your arms fat or is that your triceps and bicep flexing? You walk a lot and cycle a lot. I don‚Äôt think calories are the problem.  See I think you‚Äôre looking at muscle and thinking. Aagh fat. I know food for me isn‚Äôt a problem. I hate food. I eat because I have to but naturally, I lean towards the anorexic spectrum. When I was stressed, I would binge/purge. I didn‚Äôt want the food to stay in me. I would purge four times a week. Now just once a week. Hopefully no times a week in the future. I eat to increase my numbers when I am lifting weights but naturally, I will offset with cardio or restricting its weird guess.  You could have naturally slowed your metabolism but at 1200kcal it could be you retaining water. My two friends are body builds (both in a relationship with each other) and its amazing the lengths they must go to manipulate their bodies. Think about it. Men naturally pool fat around there bellies and women in the hips, ass and thighs. I know it sounds really sexiest, but that is how it has been explained to me as  Men naturally collect fat around the abdomen.  Cause prehistorically they were hunter gathers and need to store energy for long journeys (gathering and hunting).  Women naturally collect fat around the gluteal-femoral region. This is due the birthing and acting as primary career givers.   The problem we see now, roles have totally changed but the effect of restricting still effect men and women in the same way. Men and Women are equal but unfortunately our bodies work on different operating systems.   After a period of long restricting the body will start to lower it‚Äôs metabolism to maintain muscle and tissue levels. The body wants a certain amount of fat to store toxins and protect organs. It fights fat loss at a certain weight.    You have a lot going on. A Masters is a massive commitment. That‚Äôs coming to end now &amp; your trying to balance a new lifestyle and your diet and your exercise on past habits.   I think you need to stop. Don‚Äôt work off past behaviour as a blueprint for future actions. I think you need to say OK. Where am I now, Eating, Weight, Lifestyle (work, OS, family, exercise). Now is transition. What is the short term and long-term goals?   Eating, Weight, Lifestyle (work, OS, family, exercise). You‚Äôre in a cycle day to day. Eat ‚Äì weight ‚Äì restrict - exercise. You need to think months and weeks. Monday up 450g Thursday down 850g. Take the daily reactions away. Look at what you‚Äôre eating proteins vs carbs vs fats vs minerals vs vitamins.  Halloween I am dressing up as the old man Connor McGregor hit and my friend is dressing up as Conor McGregor. Are you dressing up Lynn.",False,False

I‚Äôm glad you made the decision to change directions. It will be worth the wait. In the Netherlands we say ‚Äúhet siert je‚Äù which would translate to something like ‚Äúits really nice of you to wait a bit until your colleagues are all settled in‚Äù.   Yes, I agree with you. We are always striving for something we are not e.g. the grass is greener on the other side.   I think you are right about my length. I‚Äôve witnessed lady gaga at different weights and yea... I‚Äôm not that small. I really like to exercise! Used to lift weight 4 times a week, but then the ‚Äúmaster‚Äù happened. Right now I‚Äôm just tired. Not motivated for anything, but need to look for a job because rent needs to be payed. Sucks to be an adult right. I walk 10k steps a day and bicycle whenever I need to go somewhere. I eat around 1200kcal a day and I‚Äôm not losing weight. Sometimes I‚Äôm afraid I ducked up my metabolism as a young adult (restricting than falling into a b/p cycle). Not b/p‚Äôing means a lo to me but at the same time... god I feel so gross. And my SO is too unapologetic honest saying: oh god your arm is really fat like this (when wearing a tanktop) when I replied I know no need to point it out he said: well it‚Äôs not like it‚Äôs unseeable damn, I need to look at it too.   ^ regarding this I‚Äôm really proud that I understand now that comments like this make eat more to cope with the negative feelings they arouse. Realising this made me able to something about it. On the other hand he said; you‚Äôre that fat you could just stop eating for 2 days a week - look at you, there is plenty to thrive on. I just feel fat, tired and an idiot for not going to the gym and at the same time I cannot stop eating.  And have lost zero weight the last year - losing and gaining the same all over. The times I‚Äôve lost weight in the past was because I only ate dinner or skipped several days of eating. Which is not sustainable!!!!! But I‚Äôm lost man???? Tf I need to do. I‚Äôd be so blessed just to be at 55kg. To just loose the extra fluff. And not feel fat continuously uuuuuggghhhh!!!!!!!!!!!!! Now I‚Äôm struggling at 1200 a day, continuously weighing and considering what to eat..   Lol @ what you say about the clothes. THE outfit can totally make your day. As can feeling it getting loose on you (or does it need to be washed lol). I agree, clothes are more casual nowadays and I kind of like to hide myself in my working attire, like it‚Äôs a costume. Talking about costumes, what‚Äôs yours during Halloween??",False,False

Don‚Äôt be afraid to rant. I don‚Äôt mind listening and if I can help I will.   Yep time for a new job. I just want to finish training the new people and let them settle in. Plus I want to enjoy Halloween. It‚Äôs a big thing in Ireland.   I want my next job to be working with a charity or an NGO. So I am taking my time. I spent over fourteen years working in the construction industry working on projects in Africa, the UK, Europe and after making other people rich. It‚Äôs time to give back and finish my story Arc. It‚Äôs Something I have wanted to do for a while. It just took me time to trust myself after the highs and lows of my anorexia.  Wow that‚Äôs a big chapter in your life completed (Your Masters). Now time to find your first grown up job. A Little scary and a little intimidating but it can be a great little adventure.   Sorry I am so late replying you probably attended both interviews but I have a feeling you did good. I can sense these things.   I think no one really has the ability to love themselves. I think naturally we are always tearing ourselves down. That kind of fight and flight mechanism.  That self-loathing, the under estimating your value, compromising for others and the desire to feel safe cause you never risked anything. When you‚Äôre a kid you can‚Äôt wait to be an adult. When you become an adult. You spend most of your time wishing you were a kid again.   I know you think at 157cm you appear small but you would be in the average height bracket. Lady Gaga and Ellen Page are 157cm in height or lower both have small frames. I know it‚Äôs harder to balance a small body but with a light restriction, Walking, yoga, fitness classes you can without exhausting yourself. Do like to exercise, would you call yourself sporty?   Don‚Äôt be so hard on yourself. You have a lot going on. You need a little serenity in this sea of chaos but don‚Äôt be so hard on yourself. I think if you asked someone, truthfully they wouldn‚Äôt say your puffy. What your seeing as fat could be natural muscle or a little water weight. Be kind to self. Things are changing and you can become a little bit self-critical, blinded and exhausted by it all.  Employment has become more image conscious I understand. Linkedin for employees and for companies social media accounts. Thankfully Fashions have become a lot more informal. A lot more relaxed. Especially for women. Gone is the stereotypical pencil skirt or business suite, high heels for a more casual relaxed image, flat shoes and a kind of softer image. If you know what I mean. The more khakis, dress shirt or blouse, open-collar or polo shirt looser fit.   I know clothes can be so reassuring for someone with an ED. I love my slim fit shirts and click canvas belt. It gives me so much security and reassurance. I know most times people don‚Äôt notice but its more for me than them.",False,False

Yes, it's a very common phenomenon in psychology that people remember the first and last part of an event :) forgot the term for it. Anyway, isn't it time for a new job? I finished my masters this Monday, or well, received the final grade and am also in the position of looking for a job :). I'm sure you did completely fine, I'm sure it's such a struggle.   Thank you, thank you. I think it's sort of always there that I don't like myself as much. I have two interviews next week and I'm stressing out about what to wear and how fat I look in it. These are clothes I used to wear at my internship so fitting in them is also reconfirming if I did or did not gain weight... I'm about 10kg above the weight I like myself at. As I'm rather short (157) and very small framed I look puffy and fat even at what are okay weights for everybody else. I gain at 1500kcal a day. I maintain at 1200 a day. It just fucking sucks. But I'm ready to change it. To find some sort of new way, to get rid of this excess fat and be happy. So yea it's awful I don't like myself. I know I'm not an ugly duckling. But the fat is just everywhere and clothes really do hide it....  So sorry about the rumble. Had to get it of my chest. Being in a vulnerable position of searching for a job kinda me retrograde to a state of being insecure and less of ""let's fix what bugging me"". Anyhow, nice to meet ya neighbor. I live across the ocean in the Netherlands :)",False,False

I don‚Äôt really remember a lot. I just remember fixing my posture and cadence for the first two minutes or ten minutes HaHa.   Then getting lost in the adrenaline of it all. Amazing you remember the build-up and the aftermath but not the event. I got good feedback and positive reviews. Anyway I wouldn‚Äôt be able to judge realistically. My ED eroded my ability to be objective when it comes to self-reflection. I am not impartial on that subject.     I don‚Äôt love what I do anymore. Looking back I am sure it was my job that fuel my ED and downward spiral. C'est la vie. Its Autumn here in Ireland. Time for pause.  Hate is a strong word. Especially to use when describing yourself.

Just saw your post.   Take it from someone with a few more years on you and someone who grew up in the Kodak and Fuji Film era. I feel for you. Every time I saw a home movie or a photo it felt like I was watching insidious.   I would recoil in horror. It didn‚Äôt help that my brother and sister were the athletic types and very photogenic. I would just lose my confidence and pull away every time a camera was pointed at me. Which didn‚Äôt make me anymore photogenic.   It‚Äôs tough now but you will find your place in the photos as time passes and you will become more comfortable as you get older. If Instagram and Facebook posts are not for you.
