To a certain extent not being diagnosed makes me feel invalid and like a fraud but I also know that if I were to get a diagnosis my mindset would not change except maybe it would change from ""wow, I'm faking an eating disorder"" to ""wow, I'm so good at faking an eating disorder that I've even fooled the professionals!!"" When I was talking to my friend about it she said that if I was really faking then I would be 100% sure that I am faking which is something I constantly try to remind myself. We aren't in the exact same situation but I know where you're coming from and your struggles are definitely valid and don't let anyone tell you otherwise.",False,False

I feel the same way about wanting a diagnoses bc I feel like if what I’m going through has a name maybe I’ll be able to overcome it :/ I’m sorry you’re going through this but please know that you are valid and your experience is valid❤️,False,False
