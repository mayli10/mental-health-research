Whatever problems you may have with food, you are welcome in OA and at our meetings.  OA members come in all different sizes and have a variety of different problems with food, diet, exercise, and body image.    Speaking as a member who has a larger body size, I actually find that it is easy for me to relate to people with a smaller body size - I choose to focus on our similarities and somehow it is easier for me to understand eating disorders from this perspective.  For me personally, what I get from OA is the knowledge that I'm not alone and the hope that recovery is possible.  There is an OA sub if you'd like to learn more.  Blessings, Libby.  ðŸŒˆ",False,False

The people there are there to share their experiences, and have all sorts of body types. (In my experience, primarily normal-overweight as we have lots of binge eaters recovering in our group.)",False,False
