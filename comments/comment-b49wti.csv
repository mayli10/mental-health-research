The longest relationship you will ever have in your life---is YOURSELF. You have to be nice to yourself. Other people's disgusting comments and questions to you---- 90% of them are curious, bored, and looking for entertainment. 10% of them actually care what happens to you. You don't owe anybody an explanation.   Read that again. You don't owe ANYBODY an explanation of what's going on with you. You don't owe anybody a list of foods you eat, you dont5owe anybody shit. What did they do to deserve that information? Seriously. What did they do to make you feel they are trustworthy? What actions did they take to show you that you can feel safe around them?  Most of them are probably just acquaintances that don't know any better. You should come up with one phrase that you repeat to everybody. And if, and only IF, somebody proves to you that they deserve your trust and for you ro open your heart... then you can consider talking to them about it.   90%/10% mix. There are people out there that don't really care for your well being. They just want to be told a story. It's not your job to tell people your story. You can keep whatever you want to yourself!",False,False

I really fucking needed to hear this today!   Things are even more intense than they were when I made this post.   I really needed this advice because the comments have been getting more frequent and more annoying. I always try to be accommodating for these asshole strangers but that obviously isn’t helped me or creating positive change!",False,True

You're making me uncomfortable."" Honestly you are ALLOWED to set boundaries with people. And if they ask why, tell them ""this is exactly the kind of conversation I do not want to have. I do not consent to this conversation. "" like I say stuff like this to people, to my mom. And like sometimes people will tell me ""that's harsh"" or maybe they think I'm being severe.   The whole point, however, is that everyone has different things they dislike. And if you tell someone about something you prefer not to do or discuss, and they continue, just know that they are the assholes in the situation and you are entitled to being angry they don't respect your boundaries.   I have been the sweet accommodating girl for the first 25 years of my life, and I am finally breaking that bad habit and telling people outright when they're making me uncomfortable and when they should stop doing whatever they're doing.   And people usually immediately stop! They go, ""oh okay sorry, didn't mean to offend you"" And I go, ""it's okay, you just don't know me very well, and that's just something that always bothered me."" And it's a nonevent.   If its someone you're close with, just tell them ""I'm trying to be more honest with how I feel about everything in general. I'm trying to tell you something and be a good communicator because I'm sure you don't want me to ever feel uncomfortable."" Theys should respond well to that.   For me, becoming an adult is about making a commitment to treating myself well. And supporting myself means I can't let myself stay in situations and circumstances that I don't want to be in.",False,False

I struggled with bulimia and EDNOS for about 6 years then I gained like 20kgs in such a short time because of bingeing. I was out of control. Once I gained the weight I felt like I couldn’t need help because I was chubby now and everyone will probably look at me and think I need to lose weight. I think this has been the hardest hurdle in my recovery. ,False,False
