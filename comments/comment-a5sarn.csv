They're usually doctor recommended and heavily supervised for morbidly obese people. My goal was to just eat 800-900 Calories a day, and do my usual weekly workouts. I lost 19 lbs in 3 weeks.  I remember about 2 weeks in, I went over 900 calories. I felt awful. I hated myself. It ruined the rest of my day. How could I have failed like that? What kind of monster commits to 900 max and then eats 950? What's wrong with me? I'm just a failure.  Then at about 3 weeks in, I was invited to an office Christmas party and thought sure, I'll just have some coffee and nothing more. I still have the last 200 Calories of my day booked for a can of soup when I get home. But that plan didn't play out, I had my first binge at the Christmas party. I mean an actual binge. None of this ""I ate at maintenance and it felt like a binge"" bull shit. I felt completely out of control. I ate anything and everything I could. I kept internally screaming at myself to stop but I just kept going. The night got worse but I'll stop there. I found r/proED the next day.  Two years later, I am still here. I love this community and they make the best of a horrible situation. But that's just what it is, OP, a horrible situation. Don't make this place your home. There's so much more to life outside of this place. Please, if my situation two years ago is at all like you, seek out the help you need.",False,False
