Being a mom with an ED, married to a guy who has never had any weight issues and barely understands nutrition has left me feeling so confused and adrift about how to talk to my daughter about food.  I'll probably never have a normal healthy relationship with food, but I'm trying my best not to cause her problems in the future.  I love the format and positive perspective on an issue that causes me so much stress.  So thank you again!",False,False

It's so hard juggling parenting, and even moreso when you're a step-parent, because you're entering into an established dynamic. Sounds like your finace has been parenting your stepson alone for a while? That's even harder, so it makes sense that he would have difficulty letting go of something that's finally worked.  I know neither of us feel like we can speak as parents (though I'd say you have a lot more cred there than me, lol), we CAN speak from the perspective of people who grew up with/developed disordered eating, and so our perspective about healthy/detrimental food-talk and behaviours is valuable. People who don't have experience with disordered eating (or don't recognise that their behaviours are disordered) won't recognise that they could be reinforcing said behaviours in their children unless we say something.  Don't be too hard on yourself over this whole thing! It's good to encourage delayed gratification in kids, but on the other hand, their brains literally aren't capable of comprehending the concept until a certain point in their development. So don't beat yourself up if it seems like it's not ""clicking"" with him yet.  And yes, I totally hear you. You want to strike a good balance between setting boundaries with kids but also allowing them to express autonomy and control over their lives. It's sooo hard lmao, especially when all they WANT to do is stuff that you KNOW is bad for them but they don't understand yet...   A really good takeaway I've had (and that I've seen success from even in my limited experience as a babysitter) is offering kids a choice rather than simply telling them what to do. So instead of something like, ""we're having fruit for dessert, and that's all,"" it (sometimes lol) works better to say ""would you like strawberries, or peaches for dessert?"" etc. They still get to express autonomy but you're still setting boundaries. Theoretically anyway lol...  Hang in there! You're doing good for this kid IMO.",False,False

My oldest has refused to eat meat for most of his life so we do vanilla protein powder with spinach, carrots, blue berries, flax seed, and another berry or banana if it will fit everyday when I get home. It is such a gift to have his dad here to evaluate my decisions with and bounce my thoughts off of, but it’s also still really difficult sometimes.

I give my fiance, my stepson's dad, advice on occasion (he's very sensitive), but I have to remember, the bulk of the weight is not on me, so it's way easier to give advice than to take it. My fiance often offers sweets to console him if he's in an emotional state. I have mentioned that to SO, but the 4yo doesn't want my comforting, so SO's on his own which makes it that much harder...  I am trying so hard to instill delayed gratification! I took one semester of childhood development in college and that was my takeaway, lmao.  I like your thoughts regarding the matter, but it's challenging when you're trying to balance um... (been drinking) compliance (no, that's not it) with personal freedom and autonomy.",False,False

Right now, he will accept a marshmallow as a treat, or whatever his dad gives him, but fruit does not pass the test. He eat yogurt pretty regularly because it's an easy way to get him calories when he refuses normal meals.

Luckily my (step) kid shares zero percent of my genetic makeup but I would like to birth one myself.   I honestly feel as though my mom did a stellar job in the food arena, but I still ended up with an ED. She was bulimic too, so she was super careful about it.

For every post like the ones in this thread detailing how parents restricting junk food led to binging behavior, I've seen an equivalent post from someone whose parents only fed them unhealthy food or left binge food out on demand and they swear that's why they have an eating disorder. I see posters here blaming their mom/guardians for dieting in front of them or modeling ""disordered behavior"", and then I see posters blaming their parents for doing the polar opposite and being obese their whole life and making them afraid of food/weight gain that way. I think it's a much bigger societal problem and I think it's more mental and even genetic than many of us give it credit for.   I'm not sure there's any foolproof parenting method proven to reduce, much less PREVENT, development of eds. It's tricky stuff man.",False,False

But, on the other hand, you also can't stigmatize food or make it ""rare"" or ""elusive"", because my parents ALSO did that (lol) and like some other commenters have said, that made me go HOG WILD when I did actually have access to it, e.g. at other people's houses, at parties, or when I got old enough to buy things on my own. I would eat as much as I could, as poorly as I could, because I never knew when I would have access to those foods again.  Maybe she's allowed to have a ""treat"" after dinner, but one, it's not called a treat, it's just called after-dinner-snack or dessert or something, and sometimes it IS fruit and cheese and sometimes it's chocolate. Once she gets old enough to learn higher reasoning skills you can also plan together what foods are going to be when; like, on a Sunday you can plan out what you're all going to have for dessert every day that week, out of a list of options.   And if your kid gets upset (which I know, is always hard to deal with) at not having a certain kind of treat for dessert then firstly, tell them that they don't have to eat the dessert they've been given that day, but that they won't get anything else, and two, keep reassuring her that she can look forward to the treat she wants on another day. So maybe even making a chart to put on the wall that says what dessert is going to be served for every day that week could help her start to learn delayed gratification.  Maybe have certain treats fixed to certain days of the week? It depends on whether your kid does better with rigidity/structure/predictability or flexibility/unpredictability, but if they prefer the former, then maybe if they knew that she got fruit on mondays, wednesdays, and fridays, and cake or chocolates or ice cream etc. on tuesdays and thursdays, she'd handle those expectations better than always hoping for a 'treat' every day and getting disappointed each time.  Sorry, I'm not a parent so I know a lot of this is easy for me to say and not do, but I do spend a lot of time with my nieces and nephews and I've been able to observe how different kids respond to different kinds of structure.",False,False
