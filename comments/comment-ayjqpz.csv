I could drive anywhere on the continent right now, if I really wanted to, and spend a week just traveling and browsing the food there.  I'm young, cute, and married to a gorgeous wife who thinks I'm hot and funny. I actually *like* how my body looks at an average weight. My industry as a whole doesn't give a fuck how I look, as long as I do good work. It's not like I'm a single model with pressure from shitty dates and shitty workplaces to stay thin.  I have a car, a phone, 50 grand in the bank, and literally no concrete obstacle besides time and space between me and whatever food I could possibly want.  And I still can't eat like a normal fucking person. Incredible.",False,False
