I think it’s fantastic she opened up to you about it- that’s a level of trust that most people will never get from someone unless they know they’re truly loved. And you clearly love her a lot. Which is amazing, but also makes things difficult- the ED is painful for you both, and so is recovery.   I do not know her personally or know where she is, mentally- but in my experience, mostly personal, so take it with a grain of salt; generally if someone opens up to you about an ED, it’s a way of also opening up that it’s getting to be too hard on them and that they’re wanting- or at least seriously considering- help.   Which is where things get difficult. There’s a fine line to walk between helping and leading her to recovery and pushing her to the point she snaps. I personally suggest sitting her down and having a serious discussion with her- the fact that she has gotten to the point of also cutting is *not* safe and *not* a good sign. That’s where alarm bells sound in my head when reading your post- if her struggle with her disorder has progressed to that level of self-harm, it could mean she could process further which is a very, very dangerous road to be going down.   So stay calm, think through what you’d want to communicate to her. You’re worried, you love her, you want what’s best for her and you want to live a long, happy life with her. Remind her how much you care about her. That you think highly of her. That she’s beautiful and lovely and does not deserve to treat herself so negatively. And she really doesn’t. She deserves to love herself. And you’d like to help her. Ask what she needs you to do. You’re there for her, by her side, no matter what. But- and you will have to be firm, which is the absolute hardest part because it’s likely she’ll fight it or lie about it- she **has** to stop self-harming. She **has** to start taking care of herself. You are more than willing to help in any way, shape, or form- but she *cannot* continue with this. It’s beyond not healthy- it’s dangerous, and if escalating to cutting means anything- it could be life-threatening. Tell her you want- *need*- her to see a professional (if it’s financially feasible, of course), whether it means just therapy or finding a medication. She *needs* that help, along with your support. Because I hate to say it- but it’s most likely that your help and support alone will not be enough.   And if she doesn’t respond to this, if she continues to spiral... I’d seriously consider pushing to have her sent to inpatient. Willingly or not. Because if she’s having suicidal thoughts on top of all of this- that’s where it could end up if she doesn’t get the help she needs and takes those steps. And sometimes, force does have to be involved.   Anyway. I think it’s amazing how much love you have for her, and I wish you so, so much luck and that you both can find happiness and health despite all of this. It’s a struggle- hell, life is a struggle- but with every fight, you become stronger and find ways to experience joys you never would’ve before.",False,False
