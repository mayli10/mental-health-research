Using it as an excuse to diet even though I'm sure I could easily find a way to not starve. I went along with co workers to get food and ate about 15% of it while they are guys and ate all of it and felt very dainty and feminine about it. I tried taking it home cause I should probably have food for the next 2 days but then it spilt a little bit so I just threw it away and felt even better.   It doesn't really make sense at all to spend like your last 10 dollars on food to not eat it yet it makes perfect sense. Then I feel bad occasionally when I go up to 1500+  and feel like I am just a fat person who only eats salad in front of other people and then eats an extra large pizza for dinner. And that they are just looking at me like you don't even eat food yet how are you so big. I'm not even big. I'm probably at 19 bmi or something (don't have a scale but I take my measurements) but I won't feel perfect until it's 18-18.5, there is no extra chub and I can fit into my smallest size 0 clothes easily.
