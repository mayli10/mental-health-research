I would tell your friend about this and ask her to not have the scale where you can see it when she knows you’re going to be over.  You gained that much quickly because your body is healing. Your bones and muscles are regaining density. You need this weight. I would suggest asking a friend to help you go through your clothes and donating anything that feels tight or uncomfortable. No use torturing yourself with clothes you shouldn’t fit in anymore. If you’re in the northern hemisphere, summer is here so you can stick to loose dresses, flowy skirts and shirts. Focus on comfort above all else. Nothing should pinch or constrict you in any way. If you feel stuff tightly, it will be impossible to quiet the voice in your head that’s screaming right now.   Recovery is difficult and I wish you the best of luck. Stay strong, lovely one",False,False
