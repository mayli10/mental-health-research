He just has bad diarrhea the next day haha. Sometimes takes lactaid if he knows he’s gonna be eating it but not often. I think there are different levels of tolerance, maybe you could say yours is somewhat mild or as you are introducing more dairy your stomach is able to handle it better? Like adjusting to it maybe. People shouldn’t be nosy enough to pry that much into someone’s dietary habits anyways but we all know that’s not always how it goes!",False,False

I’m lactose intolerant but I still eat dairy if I **really** want it lol. I just try to avoid it but I will have it now and then and just suffer the consequences later.   Lying isn’t good but you can always just say that certain types don’t bother. For instance I can eat yogurt pretty easily but full on heavy cream really bothers me. But honestly if I wanna treat myself to some fucking dairy ice cream then I’m gunna eat the damn ice cream....because let’s be real dairy free halo top sucks ass.,False,False
