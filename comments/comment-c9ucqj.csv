I don't recommend supplementing anything except a USP certified multivitamin. You can pick one that's gender specific because men and women have different nutrient needs. I don't recommend biotin supplementation. Obviously fodo is the most nutritious option, but I know you might not be there yet.",False,False

First off you wanna take a biotin supplement. It's really important for hair/nail strength. You can also find it in legumes, cauliflower, eggs and a few other foods. The other thing would be try to get some protein if you aren't already-if you eat salmon that's what I'd recommend. It's fairly low calorie and has omega 3, which can also helo with the issue. Other than that, try and stay hydrated if possible.  Hope this helps :)",False,False
