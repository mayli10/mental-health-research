But this is definitely not ‘real’ weight gain in my mind. Just water fluctuation. And for small amounts of carbs or for someone eating lower total calories, the glycogen storing process may not even happen because the body is probably going to immediately utilize that energy rather than storing it.  Carbs can be a great source of energy for both brain and body! Pop culture’s periodic vilification of entire food groups is kinda frustrating. I guess the simpler “everything in moderation and try to choose mostly good quality carbs” must sell fewer books ;)",False,False
