I’ve done holding ice, or holding frozen zested oranges. Splashing my face in cold water (activates the dive response). Wrapping up tight in a blanket (tells the limbic system to chill the eff out). I also keep a list of simple distraction activities I like. I just set a timer for X minutes and chain a few activities together. The free Calm Harm app has a zillion suggestion too.   It’s also been important for me to work in therapy to understand what emotional need is behind the SH so that I can start to meet that need in healthier ways. The paragraph above gets me through acute distress, while working in therapy slowly helps reduce my experience of distress and my urge to SH in the first place.",False,False
