Once I start eating in the morning, I binge all day. If I start with a bronkaid and black or bulletproof coffee, give it 30-60 minutes, and I have zero hunger for hoursssss and sometimes even skip it completely.

Fasting has been a definite thing for me but the first day was *always* the hardest!!!! ESPECIALLY right after a binge, or even just right after a higher carb day of eating. :/   A lot of people on the fasting sub talk about day 3 being the hardest, but that was never my experience at all! It was always the first day. That first fucking day. I was just talking about this in therapy actually, so it‚Äôs fresh in my mind lmao.   That‚Äôs always how it was for me. That‚Äôs always how it was and how it still is, though I‚Äôm fasting much less often! Like if I could just get past that first day with no food, then I wouldn‚Äôt want it at all by the second day. Then it would be easy, a relief! A secret source of Power.  But then the next big thing would be attempting to figure out how and when to fucking break the fast without immediately binging again...but at least plain herbal tea would start to taste like gourmet dessert to my cold malnourished ass by that point.   Compensation through fasting is literally how I fell HARD into my current binge cycle...which ultimately led me towards relapsing into puking also, heh, 0/10 would not recommend.   I can‚Äôt even look at that sub for very long anymore tbh because everyone there just refuses to accept that fasting is legitimately a bad idea for binge eaters in the long run...but it really is.",False,False

Although I've been overweight, I'm currently normal weight, and heading towards under weight but it's been severely slowed by restrict/binge cycles. Recently I've broken the cycle due to the security of playing and exciting one meal daily. Even through I'm eating, my calories are too low to gain or maintain, and I can sit with the hunger knowing I'm for sure making a sandwich at 4pm!    Plus I feel like eating daily keeps your salts and hydration up, preventing some of the acute side effects of this bullshit disease!",False,False

You can get bronkaid in the us if you are over 18 and show ID at the pharmacy. You have to show id because it's a controlled substance or something, but I've never had to buy nearly enough for that limit to kick in.

Instead I ec stack to start off a fast. I've done a handful 4 day fasts this way. Usually take 100mg caffeine 12.5 ephedrine on day 1 and 3, sometimes day 2. By day 4 I'm over the keto flu and feel ok. I definitely could have gone longer on all three fasts, I cut each of them off because of social / work obligations. Oh also I was having electrolytes, that helps with dizziness   for comparison I did 48 hours without ec stack and...I did it...but the whole time I was really lethargic and could barely sleep because I was so ravenously hungry",False,False
