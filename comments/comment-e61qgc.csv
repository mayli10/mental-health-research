Told me he wasn't mentally ready and that's why he left. Told him that it was okay, that I should've just accepted that everyone handles things differently and then it hit me. While my new ex (j) hates himself, he can't handle the relationship. And I should've just accepted that instead of being so paranoid.   Told ex S my new realization, told me he was proud of me. I told him I wasn't, since it shows I haven't changed.   Gonna work on that now.    Two people asked me out, including ex S. Not gonna date yet, because I have big plans for next year, but I feel better. I ate yesterday and today.    And thank you for taking the time to make sure I understood that I am worthy. I hope you know that you are very worthy of everything ‚ù§",False,True
