If you do as she suggests and things donâ€™t get better, maybe you should consider going to the hospital.  Anorexia is the deadliest of all mental illnesses because your muscles waste away after thereâ€™s no body fat to be burned, and that includes your heart and your brain.  Itâ€™s the weakness of your heart that really does you in.  Please be careful ðŸ§¡",False,False

Unfortunately all you can really do is eat some more - I know itâ€™s probably not what you want to hear. If you are able, try taking your orthostatic pulse (measure your pulse lying at rest; stand up for thirty seconds and measure it again). If there is a big difference between the numbers that is another sign that your heart is not in great shape. Same if your heart rate is very low (below 50) or very high (over 120). If your chest feels funny or you have any pain, you should see a doctor even if it doesnâ€™t fall into one of those danger zones. It can be hard to accept that something might be really wrong, but the kind of changes you describe definitely suggest your heart may be struggling. Take care &lt;3",False,False
