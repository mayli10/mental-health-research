A healthy weight (or BMI range 18.5-25) for someone 5'1"" is 94lbs - 127lbs. To be 30lbs overweight (over BMI 25) would put you at 157. Both 87 and 90lbs put you in the underweight category.  Overweight has a meaning. It means being over a BMI of 25.  I'm not trying to come across as argumentitive. I just want to make it clear that your eating dissorder is clouding your perception of reality, Dont let it do that to you.  I also want to comment on calling this a ""diet."" Being underweight is not a diet. Anorexia or any eating dissorder is not a diet. Don't let your dissorder trick you, being underweight is very rarely ok for anyone, and a desire to be that underweight is a big sign that you do not have a good relationship with your body\food.",False,False
