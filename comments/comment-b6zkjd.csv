On a couple occasions I have nearly passed out from cutting myself (both intentionally and accidentally) and seeing the blood; happens to my grandfather when he sees blood too. ,False,False

I also don't want anything I'm about to say misconstrued as medical advice or diagnosis. The only person that can give you solid medical advice is a Doctor. This is all based on my own experience with my mental illness.  My first thought is it could have been a physical reaction to all the anxiety you described. Anxiety can have verried physical effects and fainting/feeling dizzy/nausea  are fairly common during a panic or anxiety attack.   The other thought is maybe it was a reaction to your attempt to purge. It could have effected your blood pressure causing your symptoms.  My other thought is about the actual sight of blood. Is cutting something you have done in the past? Do you ever find you get this feeling if at the doctor's when they draw blood? I normally don't have any sort of reaction to the sight of blood/wounds  but last summer I basically shaved the tip of my pinky off and had a very bizarre feeling when I looked at it. I had to lie down and focus on my breathing because I was starting to hyperventilate. My husband has this type of reaction at the sight of needles.  Again, I really hope you are feeling better nowüíó",False,False
