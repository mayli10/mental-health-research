It’s not even fat shaming necessarily but I get so happy when one of my friends gains weight, even if they openly express being unhappy about it.   I have one friend that I thought had an eating disorder in high school but, now that I know her better, realize that she was just spending all the food money her parents gave her on her nails, clothes and makeup before she got a job. She now has a job and a long-term boyfriend that takes her out to eat all the time and she’s put on probably 40 or so pounds over the last few years. She’s still a healthy weight and looks objectively better than she did in high school (her boobs are AMAZING now) but I get a sick satisfaction whenever I realize that she’s no longer the tiny one. I was chubby in high school and have gone down to a lower, but still ‘average’ weight but I get such a thrill out of being smaller than her now.",False,False

I feel horrible, and then correct myself.  Or sometimes my friends and I goof around in class and take silly pictures of each other, and I take bad photos/angles of my friend where she looks bigger and send them to her because the fucked up part of my brain says ""she thinks shes skinnier than you, show her that she isnt"".  Funny thing is she literally doesnt care, and is the most food positive friend.",False,False

My BFF was always the skinny tiny short one with a nice butt and pretty hair and always got the attention from boys as we aged from 7-22. It's just how it was, and it certainly wasn't anything new as most of my female friends were beautiful and confident so they would get a lot more attention before I would even be given a second thought.  &amp;#x200B;  Anyway, fast forward to last year and she confides in me that she's starting to gain weight and she hates it. For a very brief moment in time, I was almost as skinny as her, about 4 years earlier and only for about a year. We weren't really talking a lot at that point because of college and relationships and distance but I'd scour her Instagram and social media posts and just *revel* in the fact that I had finally gained enough self control to be comparable to her body shape-- the height, of course, was a lost cause. So, skipping ahead to last year she confides in me and I hadn't actually noticed beforehand but then it was all I could see when she mentioned it, and I have since gained most of the weight **I'd** lost back but I'm relapsing like nobody's business rn which is why I'm so goddamn active on this sub, and I couldn't help but kind of secretly hope that she would continue to gain weight??? Initially of course... then I felt absolutely horrible and told her how no she still has time to get it back under control and part of it probably had to do with her diet which even she can admit is TERRIBLE and of course aging slows your metabolism down dramatically, etc etc. Well, she hasn't lost any weight or made any moves to change her diet or exercise since then and I haven't seen her since August and she's coming to visit me in a week for Thxgiving break and I can't help  &amp;#x200B;  but hope  &amp;#x200B;  she's gained more weight.  &amp;#x200B;  ~~WHICH IS SO FUCKING TERRIBLE AND I HATE MYSELF FOR IT AND I IMMEDIATELY WISH I NEVER EVEN THOUGH IT GOD WHY AM I LIKE THIS~~  &amp;#x200B;  So yeah I get it man. All you can do is tell yourself that it's not YOU having these selfish mean-spirited thoughts, it's the same voice that tells you to restrict and self harm and that you're not worthy.... it's just another things we have to try and combat in our lives. :(",False,False

Sometimes I’ll see people eating a large fry and I just think I would never eat those that’s why I look the way I do. It’s super f up haha I don’t actually like hate fat people I only do it to justify my ed. I have a best friend who’s much heavier than me and if I say anything like “ I’m just not where I want to be” or like “I feel huge” she will be like that’s rude to me what do you think of me ? Like I love you your my best friend and personally that’s kinda rude of her to stay because she knows I have an ed literally my thoughts are distorted I feel like I can’t help it but I feel bad if I make her feel bad I don’t mean to.,False,False
