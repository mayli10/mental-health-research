Another helpful thing is to get a fluoride varnish applied at your appointment,  and a high fluoride toothpaste like Clinpro or Prevident. These are prescription only,  so you'll have to ask for them. Even if your insurance won't cover it, it helps significantly with sensitivity and will remineralize areas that are decalcified. I have BED/ b&amp;p, so I try to apply varnish regularly, and luckily haven't seen a ton of erosion.  I'm sure my time will come though. :/",False,False

If you want, you can say you drink diet pop all day. Trust me, no matter what you have going on, we've seen worse. I actually like cleaning tartar off teeth and havent met a hygienist who doesnt. Similarly, dentists enjoy restoring teeth, not just the results but the actual process. Say as much as you feel comfortable saying.  After purging, rinse with an acid neutralizing rinse like therabreath or Tom's of Maine baking soda rinse. Wait 30 minutes before you brush (but feel free to brush your tongue right away). Get an rx strength toothpaste. Brush with an electric toothbrush. ",False,False
