Case dismissed. They're certainly ""enjoying"" life all right. Enjoying diabetes. Enjoying high blood pressure. Enjoying metabolic syndrome. No, Greed is not a virtue. And we may be obsessed, but I think it's better that than to be completely uninterested, uniformed and obese. Fat people tend to be completely informed about food, not all of them, but *a lot* of them.  I didn't enjoy life pre-ED. Literally the only thing I've ""lost to this"" (the ED) is weight. I didn't have friends to lose, or any happiness to lose. I look better, and my depression has actually lifted as I've lost weight. While losing weight will never make me ""happy"", it has and does make me *happier*. I look and feel better, but that's just me personally. For some people, their ED is all bad and nothing good. That's not a universal truth, however.   My approach is this: ""If you want to recover, good luck; I wish you well. It's your life, so your decision. If you choose not to recover? Okay, I won't condemn you for that. You are not a bad person or pro-ana merely for not wanting to recover."" I actually do enjoy food, I'm just obsessed with it. I think my ED is rooted in my Autism, personally. They're definitely connected. We're not all meant to be ""normal"". I'm not, in any other way. I like being obsessed by food, nutrition and weight. I do not intend to ""recover"", and I don't need ""help"".",False,False
