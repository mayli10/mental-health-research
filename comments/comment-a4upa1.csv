I checked that I need around 1500 calories to maintain this weight but I don't know how accurate that is though. Also that's a lot of food, I rarely get to 1000 a day. But I'll try, I know I have to.

I saw a doctor last month for a check-up for uni and we talked about my weight a little bit but at that time I wasn't comfortable with telling the whole truth even though I knew that it would be for the best. I know who to be in contact with if I so choose, I just have to take the first step. ",False,True
