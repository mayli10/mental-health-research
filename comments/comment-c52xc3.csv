Up until last summer I was quite underweight and struggling on and off for years with my ED. Well last summer I went through a painful death in the family and turned to alcohol (because healthy) to try cope and sleep at night. Well alcohol isn't exactly wonderful for the waistline and after some time I put on a few pounds.   It's quite  noticeable to me and I hate when people try to say I haven't put on weight or I look the exact same because I know I don't?? It feels like I'm being made the fool of sometimes because I'd much rather the honesty regardless? Anyway I've reduced my intake of alcohol drastically and I'm fasting and restricting again because cutting my calories while drinking didn't have a huge impact. I feel like the very same people would comment in the past on how much weight I lost but pretend like I haven't gained weight and in a way it's sort of upsetting because it reinforces a lot of messed up ideas I struggle with regarding weight. I know it's usually very well intended but it's just my mind being messed up. Lol,False,False

My husband didn't notice that I've lost over 20lbs recently (&amp; I don't plan on pointing it out) and I try to remember it's because we live together and he sees me every day so he's probably not going to notice unless I lose a drastic amount.",False,False
