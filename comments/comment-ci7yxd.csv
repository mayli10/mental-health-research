It's not perfect, but I like it enough to pay for premium, so here's my opinion:  * Weight is easy to update and in general the app does not comment on it. I think I have seen it once or twice tell me not to give up after a small gain, but it's a motivating/nice comment.  * Calories can be put in without actual food entries. It is kind of hidden -- when you go to add a food, the three ""..."" at the top will let you add plain calories.  * The premium version will sync with Fitbit, Google Fit, Garmin... probably more. But for free I'm pretty sure it doesn't. There is a section that will track your steps too.  * You can add exercise by activity type  Why I use it:  * You can log any calories and it WON'T yell at you, unlike MFP. You can complete a day with 0 calories.  * You have to actually ""check"" a day as done. I like this because it keeps me more accountable to a logging streak than MFP, which counts when you log in (iirc).  * The food database (I know it's not your thing) is really easy to customize and has a lot in it. I like it more than MFP's. Seems less messed up sometimes too.  I'm sure there are other good or better apps but I wanted to give a shoutout for my favorite, hahaha.",False,False
