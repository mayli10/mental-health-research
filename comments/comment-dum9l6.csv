You’re certainly not alone in the experience of an injury creating a resurgence of ED thoughts.   For me, running was helping me focus on nurturing my body and appreciating what it does for me (plus helping with depression). When I got injured a month ago it totally threw off my equilibrium and I fell back into all my old thoughts/behaviors. Fortunately I’ve been able to talk to my therapist about it so it’s a work-in-progress.   With your doctor’s permission you might also look into types of exercise that would be ok for your ankle in small amounts? I used “chair cardio” youtube videos during a foot injury because even 20 min of cardio hugely improves my mood. I also used the arm ergometer at my gym (didn’t love it but it’s something). Best of luck! I hope your ankle heals up nicely.",False,False
