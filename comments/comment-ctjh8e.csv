There's a huge spectrum of eating disorders. Also, a big majority of them are initially caused by the physiological effects of dieting. Long-term calorie restriction will mess up a lot of peoples' relationship to food even if it started out well-intentioned and with a healthy mindset, because it puts your body in a stressful state and messes up your internal 'thermostat' (normal and heathy hunger and fullness cues-- that's why so many people on diets/anorexia eventually binge). From what you're describing it seems like you probably still aren't eating enough to maintain your weight and health. The body dysmorphia can definitely be worked on with a therapist, but a nutritionist may also be able to help you understand how much you need to be healthy and satisfied. It's probably much more than you think (dieting messes up our idea of ""normal""). If you're truly eating enough, you aren't going to be thinking about food all day or feel the urge to overeat. It may take time but after weeks/months of consistently giving your body the energy it needs you may be surprised at how much less you think about food.",False,False
