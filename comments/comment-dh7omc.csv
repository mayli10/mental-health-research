I've been living on my own now for like 5 years and not once during that time have I had normal amounts of food in my apartment because I know I'll binge on all of it rather than eating normal meals. My cupboards are literally empty and my fridge just has a couple white claws and old empty pizza boxes from binges ages ago.  I don't know how to grocery shop. I can go out with friends and have a normal meal and feel ok as long as I restrict later, but I don't fucking know how to stock my kitchen like a normal human being!! It just seems like SO much food. I look at my friend's kitchens and it looks insane to me.",False,False
