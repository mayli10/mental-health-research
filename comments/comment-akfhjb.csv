Although if they ask you to hang out or something in the future explain to them at least so they know. Hopefully they  won‚Äôt do it to someone else. I‚Äôve had the same thing happen to me when a new girl came into our group she was toxic as fuck and she didn‚Äôt like me cause I called her out on her shitty behaviour! So they started excluding me obviously that played out poorly for them but when they were practically begging me to hang out I calmly explained why I would in fact not be hanging out with them again. They learned there lesson by loosing an awesome friend ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è . If you give in and throw a fit it only adds justification for excluding you in the first place. ,False,False
