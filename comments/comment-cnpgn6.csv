Nobody gives a shit wherever you want children or not, but it's unhealthy to become infertile due to low body fat - it means your body has decreased systemic estrogen levels. Low estrogen not only impacts your bone density, therefore increasing the risk of stress fractures and osteoporosis, it also impairs endothelial function and causes inflammation - which contributes to potential problems like atherosclerosis, hypertension, and heart failure, even at a young age.",False,False
