They don't think it's a problem because it's how they view overweight people. ""FaT pEoPlE bInGe AnD sKiNnY PeOpLe StArVe!!"" so SO much deeper than that.",False,False

Honestly I don’t really like her because her personality can be abrasive and she doesn’t really have the best social skills, but she means well so I’m nice to her. She has a lot of emotional issues and anxiety and she cries a lot so me and my roommates are always there for her. And I really do sympathize with her pain and care about her problems. But I haven’t known her for that long and it really wouldn’t be my place to bring it up to her",False,True

Depends on the frequency and severity but 2000 calories is hardly even a binge, if she's overweight that's probably within her TDEE. I wouldn't mention it unless you've seen it happen multiple times, as severity of BED is determined by frequency per week",False,False

Some people just have a really messed relationship with food but they don't obsess over it and they don't obsess over their weight. Of course that doesn't mean it isn't still a problem.  &amp;#x200B;  Idk about this girl obvi but I hope she's ok. I don't think you were wrong for talking to your roommates about her, you did so out of genuine concern.",False,False

Being over weight or growing up overweight makes this even harder to judge with in yourself. Seeing as pizza is super caloric and people often eat 3-4 peices plus soda, over eating it is super easy.  Going out for a fast food meal shouldn't equate to a binge. Burger, fries, coke 1500 calories right there. Now normalize eating out everyday and watch your weight climb.  Live around people who side eye you for getting a salad and you might even feel weird about making the ""healthy"" choice. I grew up in the midwest....meat &amp; potato people. It wasn't until I was 17 that I ate more than canned green beans for veggies.  Personally when I binge eat I prefer to do it alone. When I was overweight and binging I hated even eating infront of people, but I would rarely turn down food if offered.   I actually don't think eating your feelings is always a ""bad"" action. Sometimes you just have to eat the ice cream to feel better and that is ok. Sometimes, but sometimes can spiral pretty fast if every inconvenience becomes a catastrophe in your head. I think if you can catch yourself eating emotionally and become mindful about it you are a step a head. The hardest step is accepting that the way you eat or use food is not healthy (even if it is normalized by the people around you)   It is hard for me to pass judgement on your friend/situation. I tried to talk to a friend in hs about losing weight once and it destroyed the friendship. We were both overweight and she was upset about her weight and made it clear. One day I just asked if she liked diet pepsi instead of regular because I lost 15lbs when I started drinking diet. Boom. Friendships over. Sometimes are good intentions are no good. My only thought would be to talk to her about what has her upset if she us willing. Having a friend willing to listen without judgement. ",False,False

It’s super normalized to exhibit alarming disordered eating behaviors, esp. emotional binge eating and forgetting to eat- which makes it super difficult for people who don’t suffer from ED’s to recognize the behavior. how well do you know the girl with whom you are concerned? i hope she is okay ",False,False
