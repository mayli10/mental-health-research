I was 23,24 or 25 when I had my first serious relationship. Years of focusing my attention on calories consumed or burned. I have kind of lost touch of time and memories lived between my 20â€™s &amp; 30â€™s. I wasnâ€™t living my life back then I was just existing to control my weight. Eat and exercise on my terms. Not dangerously unhealthy or underweight (before the relationship ended) but living a very Spartan diet and doing what I called pretend eating. While exercising in public and in secret. Definitely not as open now about my E.D.   I loved that person with unconditional and unconventional love. To this day she remains the only person for whom I broke my periods of fasting and exercise. For anyone who calorie counts and exerciseâ€™s after leaving the gym. I think you understand what a powerful commitment that is.   I canâ€™t speak for anyone else only myself. I donâ€™t want to get anyone distracted with my layered issues around this relationship. I just want to explain how this links to this post.   When the strain of my behavior became too much she agreed to see other people because our relationship was irreconcilable.  After the relationship I struggled. In Ireland alcohol is the norm, binge drinking is the norm. Dealing with difficult problems through alcohol is the norm but for me it didnâ€™t help. All I ever thought about was the alcoholic calorific value of the drink.   So to heal I spent longer periods fasting and exercising. The hypertension and adrenaline was my coping mechanism but thatâ€™s what I became a mechanism, a machine. I lost a sense of me and never found my closure at 8 stone 10 pounds (I am 6ft 1.) Looking back at it now. Of what I can remember. I know now in the long term talking whether group, family and friends or professional brings the closest I have come to closure.  Sorry if I was a bit wordy.",False,False
