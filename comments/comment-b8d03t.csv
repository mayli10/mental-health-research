My boyfriend thinks I am a size 8 in women's clothes and 125 lbs (I'm a 4 and 115). He was asking me about women's clothes sizes the other day and why there are so many üòÇüòÇ he wanted to know the difference between a 10 and an 11 and a 29 and a medium and didn't understand what misses or petite meant or the 4L vs 4R sizes.    Don't trust the perceptions of men. ,False,False

Men would guess 90 pounds when I was 115 and then a girl would immediately guess correctly. They're actually idiots.,False,False

Most boys just don't know better. There's so many factors that make women with similar figures much different weights and boys wouldn't be aware of that because pretty much all that matters for them is how fat and muscle a person has and a person's height.,False,False

Another skinny girl (who was taller) probably weighed that so it stuck with him as thin. Or he doesn‚Äôt think you‚Äôre under 100 bc that‚Äôs unattractive or a child/short person weight to a clueless guy. I‚Äôve had that same 120 comment before and I wonder where they get it from too. He most definitely meant it as a compliment. Especially with so many women lying about weight guys can‚Äôt visually weigh us like we can. You are definitely skinny and that BMI is my goal üòç.,False,False
