He's trying to be supportive but honestly, if I were him I'd be a lot harder on me. I should know better. But he's afraid to come across as a jerk, so it makes it easy for me to get away with my behaviors and then just say ""I'll do better."" He even knows when I purge; I don't hide it. But he just says he's concerned. I'm trying to get back to my recovery (today, anyway), but my resolved wavers, especially knowing I can get away with it. If I were him, I'd tell me to knock it off or I'm out. But he's too nice to do that. I almost wish he were less nice.",False,False

He's supportive and does understand that me being OW doesn't mean I don't need to eat, he never shames me for anything and he obviously fancies the hole off of me.  What really doesn't help is that he's about a foot taller than me, so can eat loads and loads more than me, and loves food but can forget to eat as well. But then he can also eat an entire chicken and chase it with a tub of B&amp;J. I think he just can't comprehend that my relationship with food is not just different from his, but is also unhealthy. And I think that that's because I'm OW.",False,False

I would tell him about the thoughts that led to my restricting and he would be like “just go on a f*cking diet then”. He wouldn’t say things like “You aren’t fat” or “you are good the way you are” he would be like “lose weight but don’t be anorexic”. I was at a healthy weight still, low, but healthy. Having someone tell you to diet (even though he said it because he didn’t want me to die) made me feel like shit. We’ve since stopped being friends and i’m seeing a guy, we’ve been on like 3 dates, and i haven’t told him. I’m not sure if i will. But i think if i was in a healthy, serious relationship i would be comfortable with them knowing, as long as they weren’t engaging in enabling behaviors. (even if they didn’t know they were enabling) idk if this makes sense but thanks for listening",False,False

Hes very supportive tho in that he gets that nagging me to eat doesnt help but he encourages me to indulge when I mention “i want cake” or something.

He’s one of the few people in my life supportive of me recovering (my family thinks I should keep at it bc I’m not at a sick weight yet) and it’s been super helpful.

I just don't want him to stop me??? Which sounds horrible, but I know he would and he's asked me to tell him if I'm feeling like I need to fall back into those habits-- but I mostly think he's concerned with the purging and self harm/ hatred.

We have an agreement that he's not going to freak out about anything as long as I don't lie to him about it or try to hide it. It helps me to be able to say out loud ""I had a really hard time with food today"" and know that he'll just hug me and let me cry and ask if I want him to heat me up some soup. It's really freeing to have someone there who's okay with you blurting out the messed-up shit in your head.
