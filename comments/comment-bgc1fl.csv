I never have, but I was thinking about how horrible it would be.",False,False

I get them really badly and my sister never does and I figured I was just unlucky but I wonder if my ED has also contributed. It wouldn’t surprise me tbh.   Similarly I’m genetically prone to bad circulation (family history of varicose veins) and having an ED has definitely made that problem worse than it would be otherwise.,False,False
