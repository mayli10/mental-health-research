Like if I get stressed about not being able to eat more I just try and remind/reassure myself that I can eat whatever I'm craving tomorrow without it being a binge or putting me over my cals. I'll even plan elaborate menus and calorie-check everything in MFP to put myself to sleep like a bedtime story......,False,False
