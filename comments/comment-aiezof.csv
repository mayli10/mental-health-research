Itâ€™ll be interesting to see if it happens the other way around, currently voluntarily weight restoring for the first time ever and I have GWs and an UGW, and the UGW is still slightly UW. I wonder if Iâ€™ll be able to get comfortable with setting another one thatâ€™s over the UW borderline... weâ€™ll see...",False,False

I'm usually a trustworthy friend who keeps promises, but I'm breaking my promise to my parents of not going below 86 (whoops).  But when it comes to my weight, it's just me and the numbers, and nothing's gonna get in the way of that (except maybe recovery).  The fact that I was trying to get underweight made me realize how warped and disordered I am, if I'm going to risk my health to ""get better,"" when I could just not get there in the first place...",False,False

Then I discovered the new BMI calculator, then I was like, hey, why not lower it to 80, it's still healthy right?    My parents, therapist, and friends were like, ""Don't you want to recover some day?""  So I decided to lower it to 70 lbs, after hearing some of your horror stories of not getting admitted for help because you ""weighed too much"".  Because at a 15-ish BMI, the hospital will see that I totally need help!  Lol, I'm probably gonna relapse if they try to get my weight up to 90 lbs (which I haven't even reached yet, I'm still 106, started at 110, ugh).  I don't know why I keep lowering it if I haven't even reached the original, smh.",False,False
