But i definitely agree my perception is skewed and you make a great point. i def don‚Äôt think she hasn‚Äôt gotten smaller. But just to me, she not skinny. On a somewhat related note, it‚Äôs funny because I know Kim lost a bunch of weight too after her baby. IMO she has more tits and ass than Cardi but the fact you could see her ribs in some of her photos I was like: she‚Äôs skinny SKINNY. ",False,True

For me, what you're describing as skinny sounds extreme but I am naturally very busty and have relatively wide hips as well, so looking at someone like Cardi B who also has those qualities I think she does look skinny when you consider those factors.   I am thin but I still have my boobs and my butt so I don't really factor those in when I assess how skinny someone is because I know a lot of the time you still keep those. You can tell from the rest of their body and I just looked at recent photos and she does look thin to me. Not like alarmingly so or anything though and personally I wouldn't find it notable, but yeah if it came up I would agree she is thin. ",False,False

She looks average but amaaazing for that to be her post-baby body. I'd be scared I'd never have a flat stomach again after having a baby. If you look up post-partum videos on youtube it's seriously scary.   But yeah I agree my thought of ""skinny"" is at least visible ribs, mostly visible ribs and protruding hip bones with no curves on the legs/thigh area. ",False,False

I do not believe any one of those descriptors is better than any other. I only care about my own weight. I think ""fat"" can be just as gorgeous as ""skinny"" and I don't think ""fat"" should be a bad word because there is abso-fucking-lutely nothing wrong with being fat (unless it's to a degree that causes health problems, but that applies to skinniness too).
