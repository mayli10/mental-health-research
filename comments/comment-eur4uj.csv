Make tea 3. Listen to a podcast (spooked is soo good) or watch some youtube vids (buzzfeed unsolved or kendall rae conspiracies/true crime) or a movie/tv show (AHS, YOU) ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ thats just my taste but oh well 4. Stay off of reddit to avoid thinking about it 5. Light some candles, incense, or do whatever makes you zen. (weed is hella nice bro but idk ur opinion but just putting it out there). 6. Do your skincare 7. Read a book 8. Draw, paint, knit, listen to music, whatever is distracting. Make playlists, day dream, write/journal, try to preoccupy your mind. 9. Keep hydrated. 10. Whenever you get stressed out look up quotes and write them down in pretty handwriting on/in notebooks or notecards and put then up in your room. 11. Clean your room 12. Do homework, catch up on your studies or work. 13. Take a walk 14. Paint your nails, do your hair, makeup 15. Watch or read something funny  These are just things I do whenever I need to distract myself or Iâ€™m upset. Maybe try to ear something healthy in a while after you feel better so you can start feeling normal again. I suffer from diagnosed depression and anxiety so I know how intense and horrifying stress and not being in control feels. Try to focus whenever you get upset and get back to the moment. Focus on the things around you and get completely immersed in your surroundings. Realize that that period if time is over and nothing right now is threatening you. You DO have control. Much love ðŸ’“ðŸ’“",False,False
