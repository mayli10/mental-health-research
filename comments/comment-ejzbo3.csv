I put the chia seeds in the bottom of a blender bottle or water bottle, pour in the Crystal Light then shake it up, and put it in the fridge. The blender bottle breaks up any clumps better. After a few hours the seeds plump up and aren't unpleasant at all to drink. It really encourages me to drink more water knowing that it is also helping keep me full",False,False
