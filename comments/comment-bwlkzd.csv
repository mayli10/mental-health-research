I was constipated for 8 days the first few days of ED treatment, and let's just say that I didn't become unconstipated until I ate double of what I did before treatment [800-1000cal]. I didn't have to take a laxative, thank god, but I knew that I was really messing up my digestive system. Miralax is a subtle laxative that might work, and milk of magnesia helped a lot, but has an awful taste and texture. Use these as a last resort if you are unable to have a BM in a day or two.",False,False

This isn't that uncommon, even for 'nORmAL' people. If it's 5+ days, then... shit hits the fan, dude. Freak out. Lax away. It won't work, but... you can do it anyway! :D",False,False
