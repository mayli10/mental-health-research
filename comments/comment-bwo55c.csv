I always wondered how my friends could push back their lunch or dinner for an hour or two if they got busy or wanted to do something else, while I’m here like *need food now* every. few. hours. My dietician once told me it was because my glycogen stories were depleted. So while my friends could run on their “reserves” if needs be, I didn’t have any—I would just completely tank.   I managed to fix my balance of proteins, fats etc so that my mental hunger is better, but I still wonder if I’ll ever truly feel full again...",False,False

They may seem to be lower in calories, but again it will not satisfy you, causes your blood sugar spike, which causes you to eat more (Terrible chain reaction).  Eating foods with more HEALTHY fats and protein is so much better.    I like eating a lot too, but one comfort food I found which I feel like I'm eating a ton but keeping it low in calories and not over eating (due to high fat/ protein) is lunch meat! Having 2oz of that stuff (which is like 3-4 slices, depends on how you get it cut) is only 60 Cal! So When you have double the serving, throw some cheese in there too, it really makes me full and I don't feel the need to snack or fight my hunger.  It comes naturally then to not over eat, and yet I'm still getting good nutrients.  &amp;#x200B;  Just make sure when you're buying lunch meat that it doesn't have any MSG's or Nitrates (Bad bad bad).  Good brand I love is Boars Head.",False,False

Cereal, bananas and junk food *will* make you hungry if you base your diet on them.    If you want to be comfortable while eating less frequently, choose foods that have a lower proportion of carbohydrate and higher proportions of lipids and protein.",False,False
