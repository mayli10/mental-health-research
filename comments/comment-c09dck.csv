You can also just tell them you'd rather not be weighed.   Doctor's office scales are terrifying because you have random clothes of unknown weight on (sometimes even shoes), plus for virtually everyone it's later in the day than their normal weigh-in time. In other words, I wouldn't take the reading too seriously.",False,False

I either refuse a weigh in, or tell them to not tell me my weight.   My old dietician used to tell me dr scales are so off because they aren’t calibrated regularly.
