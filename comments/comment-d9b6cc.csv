Vegas is a desert and you need to stay hydrated. Please drink water when you‚Äôre not drinking alcohol.   Currently live in Vegas and this heat sneaks up on you, even today I nearly fainted at work.",False,False

I didnt even have a hangover‚Äî i just blacked the fuck out. What did I do during pride? Sat in a West Village chipotle before ordering sweetgreen and almost passing out in Union Squre...based on my friend‚Äôs IG story. I literally dont know. My recommendation is just dont do it.  We all want our rhetorical cake and we wanna eat it too but youre already putting ur body thru so much w the ED.  If i can‚Äôt stop you can i recommend sticking to really dry and tannic red wine or dry champagne because it is rather hard to drink quickly so its hard to fuck yourself up too bad?  hope that was helpful and not just sad lol,False,False
