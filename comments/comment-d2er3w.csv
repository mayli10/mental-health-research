They ask a lot of questions about history, symptoms, health, duration, mental health generally, etc. then they make a recommendation for care and tell you why your insurance covers. It’s a lot of personal questions but that least in my assessment I didn’t feel like anything I said shocked then or was “too crazy”— it seemed like that he heard it all before and they knew the right questions to ask about things I hadn’t even considered disordered. My experience of the assessment was that they know what they’re doing. I just didn’t like what they had to say XD (my ass is still in treatment)",False,False

Time with a nurse who weighed me and took my height, got orthostatic vitals, and then we went over my medical history and she asked lots of questions. I personally think it's important to be so honest during this part.  Finally time with the intake therapist who agreed with my prior diagnosis and suggested my level of needed care. That felt like a first therapy visit or like a ""get to know you"" type visit.  Then in order to receive treatment I had to be medically cleared, which was an EKG and bloodwork with my normal doctor plus vitals.",False,False
