I often wish her whole channel was a staged performance-art-exhibition piece ... but its definitely not.   The most infuriating thing about her is her lack of self respect and lack of motivation to do anything that is difficult. I wish she spoke more about her mental process when choosing to ditch another diet or health regime... I'd love to know her mental dialogue and her rationalization for what she does. She clearly is bothered by her state/size and its implications, but doesnt try very hard to better it, nor does she totally embrace it either-- why not get yourself a mobility scooter so that you can get around &amp; leave the house? Invest in clothing that actually fits, get more supportive footwear, or hire an aid to help you around the house? ... On the other side, why not get yourself a life or diet/fittness coach to come to the house and get you on the right track?   End rant.",False,False

The comments make me a little sad because clearly something is not clicking for AL but also make me feel like I‚Äôm doing okay. But honestly I can‚Äôt physically have more than 600-800 calories in one sitting before I feel like I‚Äôm going to puke but I also don‚Äôt have 4 calories dense meals a day so I feel a little better about it.

I literally want to gouge my eyes out when I see a video of her ""calorie counting"" but somehow she continues to gain weight on a body that requires 4,500 calories/day to maintain. It genuinely weirds me out so much. How has she not figured it out by now??? It's been years! For *fucks* sake she could still eat pizza and mcdonalds and candy every single day and lose a massive amount of weight weight, it's extremely confusing how she still gains!  Also, though, the comments trigger me. Usually in a good way because it's just everyone venting about how ridiculous it is to continue to gorge yourself when you *know* exactly how you could *easily* be losing weight, but for example the (infamous) Subway mukbang commends kind of grinded my gears. Her sandwich was 800 calories and people made so much fun. When I'm casually losing but not super stressed about it (full on ana-mode where I'll just have liquids and laxatives) I'll have a 700 calorie subway footlong for OMAD dinner! And I'm an underweight recovering bulimic who's still losing with restriction. I get that it was probably because it's clear that AL probably ate more than 5x that amount of food that day (800\*5=4,000 so actually even more) but people who were saying you can't eat something that's 800 calories under any circumstance sounded very fat-logic-y to me. Pls gimme your opinion OP I need someone to discuss this with lol.",False,False
