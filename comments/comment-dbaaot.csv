It does feel validating in a perverse way, but it's also so...dehumanizing. You really do feel like you're forcing yourself to become something other than a full person, that you're turning into a total biological mess. That's how I felt anyway. Plus it's just hard to hide, so that's annoying.",False,False

Face, arms, boobs. I hate it but it’s also one of those things that (shittily enough) made me feel super valid that I really am suffering from an Ed. Same with being freezing constantly  (Yo be clear that initial weight drop was 3 years ago to the month that it started and I dropped ~100lbs so it happened Very Fast and I didn’t realize I had these symptoms (lanugo and cold) until about 3 months after the drop )",False,False

Like after all my years of hanging out in ED communities, lanugo comes up only once in a while. When I have seen discussions about it, it mostly affected people who were well into the ""extreme"" BMI range, and should have been hospitalized yesterday.   I had it once for a brief period in middle school, but I was at a shockingly low weight at the time. hashtag not fuckin recommended. If you get lanugo, that's the real shit, and it's scary. It means you're suffering severe malnutrition and/or have horrifically little body fat (usually both).",False,False

I actually think it might be muscle? I remember feeling even more overheated when I worked out all the time. Now I've back a bit but the furnace is still burning.   Maybe I'll cool off in hell.,False,False

I was wr up until a few weeks ago when I started slipping backward. I'm just gaining the last 10 pounds back, and almost immediately (when I lost the weight) started feeling cold all the time and growing lanugo. Wtf man",False,False
