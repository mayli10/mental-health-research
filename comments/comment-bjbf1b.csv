Itâ€™s going to decrease in size either way, but Iâ€™m trying to hold onto whatever I can lol.",False,False

Fell victim to bingeing all winter. Now I am gross but have boobs and he loves them. Wore a low cut shirt last night on a date and he couldnâ€™t stop commenting. Genuinely donâ€™t know whether he likes me more at this weight (ie gross but curvy) or thin.,False,False

I have a really tiny waist, a little bit of a tummy Iâ€™m trying to lose, and a fat ass. Iâ€™m actually legitimately worried that while Iâ€™m trying to lose the tummy, Iâ€™m going to lose my ass and my bf will stop being attracted to me. ðŸ˜© I do squats compulsively.",False,False

He finds you attractive. He likes your body.  My boyfriend sends me memes about loving a thick body and itâ€™s offensive in my mind but I know he means well and thatâ€™s whatâ€™s important. Eating disorders are awful and incredibly hard to overcome, but our loved ones donâ€™t always know, they may think they are being helpful.",False,False
