The bag has ""about 5"" servings, and the bag is 198 grams. So a serving is about 40 grams. According to google, 100 g prunes has 240 calories. So 40g prunes have about 96 calories, and the bag says 100.  I'm still confused about how many PLUMS makes 5-6 prunes, as one prune really looks like one plum (just dried) and 5-6 plums have GOT to be more than 100 calories.   Now I need some plums to weigh LOL. ",False,True
