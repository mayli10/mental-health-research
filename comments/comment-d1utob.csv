I totally get what you mean by hating people’s comments or being sexualised. The truth is that the only way to move on is to not care. Be fully accepting the moment! Compliments can be uncomfortable because it puts on you on spot.  As hard as it sounds you have to try to stop pleasing others and start to care more about what you think. Regardless of they say, do your own thing! (By accepting the moment I meant regardless what anyone says or do you should be aware that you can’t change what they say but you can change your reaction to it. This is a perfect time to shrug it off and build some confidence!)  Please don’t be hard on yourself, if you get compliments own it! Because why not?  Hope you the best! :)",False,False
