I clean and do homework and am not hungry at all. However, my heart races and I can feel it beating in my chest. It is much more manageable of a feeling than Adderall, so you can do it daily.  I used to use Adderall. Adderall will be like Bronkaid x100, but for me, I only got about 10 highs from Adderall before it lost effectiveness entirely. I stayed up for 3 days, did 5 days worth of work in that time, and didn't eat at all. Drank a fuckton of water though. Super talkative. Gave me mad anxiety after day 2 though, that may have been the lack of sleep though. If you can, get your hands on the XR, it prolongs the effects for longer fasts.",False,False
