Even before I had an ED (still hated myself, my body and my lack of will power+control though) I was always snacky, even after big meals. I had to eat until I was nauseous and/or the packet/pot was empty.  I'd be hungry (or bored) minutes after lunch or dinner.  I was always between being thin and fat and not unhealthy.  But I love restricting and fasting now because while I'm still hungry atleast I'm in control and losing weight and not a slave to my moronic taste buds.",False,False
