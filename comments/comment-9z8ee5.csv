The girl who invited me was becoming a bully and I started to dread going. I think theres definitely a lot more pressure in regards to weight with that genre of dance. I mean you have to wear a leotard and stare at your body the whole session so its kinda a given. Stay safe friend, hope today will be better.",False,False
