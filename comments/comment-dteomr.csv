While you recover your body is trying to get all the nutrients it was missing out on.  Im currently dealing with this. It will go away but for now its best to eat when your body tells you but not too little or too much.,False,False

Then it just snaps and realises how hungry you actually are, enter; binge mode.  And I appreciate it! I know this won't last forever and I'm just taking each day as it comes, trying to not feel shitty about my body even if I'm a few pounds heavier than I was.",False,True

If I binge, in the morning I am in pain from hunger. Maybe those hunter cues are finally able to get through.   In any case, your body is definitely hungry and you deserve to eat! I hope you feel better soon!",False,False
