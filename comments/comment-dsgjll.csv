But because my immune system overreacted that area is inflamed.   Oh I don‚Äôt want you to be worried! I would say if your lung area is excruciatingly painful and it persists for hours on and off maybe do a test of breathing in super deeply and see if that hurts more than when you normal breathe. I hadn‚Äôt thought to take a deep breath and the moment I did at his request at the office (and I said, wow yeah that‚Äôs hurting) he immediately was like, ‚ÄúOoooh okay it is not your heart it is respiratory related probably.‚Äù  I think if I wasn‚Äôt taking any medication it would probably pass on its own but I was given some antibiotics and Naproxen (for inflammation) and they said to take them for 10 days. Just to be safe. I think you shouldn‚Äôt worry :) I have had really minor versions of this before in the past and it felt a lot worse than anything I‚Äôve experienced before. If you decide to see a doctor  and you think it could be this tell them that straight up and you can avoid some of the test probably and it‚Äôll be cheaper. :)",False,True

I'm sorry it was something more serious than heartburn, but I'm really happy you got medical attention. Since my inpatient stays, I've avoided doctors like the plague and it hasn't always worked out well for me, so it's a really good thing you trusted your gut. Hope you feel better soon!",False,False

I‚Äôm so grateful that I had support to go. I normally just feel like I‚Äôm being over dramatic. I‚Äôm so glad the problem wasn‚Äôt my heart either!

You don't want chronic heartburn, especially when you're young because it will tear up your esophagus.  Plus it hurts like a motherfucker.  Hopefully the doctor can give you some advice on lifestyle changes that might help (for example I can't eat raw vegetables on an empty stomach and I know what foods to avoid during a flair-up). There's also medications if this becomes a chronic issue. And just in case it's something else, probably a good thing to see a doctor.  Good luck!!!",False,False

I have GERD/chronic reflux and have similar experiences, especially when I have an empty stomach.  It sucks, but get yourself some Tums and they should help.  Having some food in your stomach would help too - just don't go for raw veggies since they can make indigestion worse.  That being said, heart attacks in women can present similarly to heartburn. So if antacids don't help at all, try urgent care - they're much less expensive than an emergency department.",False,False
