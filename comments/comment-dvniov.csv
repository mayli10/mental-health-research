It is so so so strange to see yourself in another person and to KNOW what you want for them, and yet be entirely unable to reflect those wishes back onto yourself. My wife has asked me ‚Äúhow would you feel if it was someone else doing this?‚Äù and it‚Äôs so clear how gut-wrenching it would be to watch someone do this. I was worried about you when I would see your posts and catch a glimpse of your arcs and just wish the best for you. And for myself I find myself shocked when negative health consequences manifest, it‚Äôs crazy.   I thought about your reply for a while and I wondered what it WOULD take to snap out of this. And being told I‚Äôm killing myself by my irl thinspo wasn‚Äôt it, and being validated as being ENOUGH wasn‚Äôt it. So, it just be something inside of me. My guilt about loving this man, about the terrible way I‚Äôve fallen in love with him, not told him I‚Äôm married, wouldn‚Äôt even want to tell him my feelings because if he doesn‚Äôt reciprocate he is a coworker and I would make him feel so uncomfortable. My pressure and fear of a new job, of being perfect, of always going above and beyond. All of THAT is APPARENTLY what I would ACTUALLY need to address in order to even think about how to stop.   And I just don‚Äôt know that I‚Äôm strong enough to face all of this and to do that. I don‚Äôt know.   That hug was so so hugely appreciated. I know we are down here in the darkness amongst the roots, but there are good souls here. Thank you so much for still caring even when you are hurting so badly.",False,True

It's interesting that we've both relapsed at about the same time with about the same intensity.. I almost feel like I am talking to myself and it's...confusing. I want to help you feel better. I want to say something so powerfully potent that you just snap out of this and go on to lead a happy and healthy life. I want to so badly... But I don't have the words. I am right here in the mud with you, wriggling and writhing and exhausted. I'm giving you the longest, warmest hug of your life right now.",False,False

This post of yours felt like a nice hug and I didn‚Äôt even know I needed one.   It‚Äôs funny... he said those things and I felt nothing. Nothing at all. And I had imagined savior scenarios so many times but in real life I was just hollow. Which I suppose IS (or at least should be) alarming.   I‚Äôll try to do as you suggest and treat myself kinder.   His phrasing of it comes from not having a cultural understanding of these disorders. He told me of a colleague of his from his home country who was vegetarian and also restricted her intake until she was ill and hospitalized. So he didn‚Äôt know it in our context but I suppose even still he recognized the same thing in me. Which IS ummm validating? Scary? And later he was kind and replied to an apology email of mine by saying meditation can be good not just for physical issues but also in how we think of and treat ourselves. And honestly? I‚Äôm willing to try it.   I‚Äôm rambling now, but this relapse, since the beginning of September, has been just as bad as when I first got ill. And I‚Äôm at a point where someone who I idealize as triggeringly slim couldn‚Äôt understand why I would do this to myself and like ...??? I keep waiting and waiting to FEEL something and I just DON‚ÄôT. I‚Äôm just watching myself scare the people I care about, and every validating scenario I could ever wish for has come true and I can‚Äôt even say why I‚Äôm doing this still.   You don‚Äôt have to reply, but typing this out was really cathartic and I always appreciate your kindness üíï",False,True

The word masochism is thrown around so casually these days and yeah, I agree, we all have a touch of it. But...*it's so much more*. Your friend/coworker/interest has shown concern for you, and that's love, but don't just summarize what you're experiencing as masochism and being ""crazy"". You aren't. You are a complex being and so is your disorder. That being said, I hope you find his concern alarming and maybe as motivation to eat an extra bite when you can. You are kind and funny and lovely to read. üíì",False,False
