I mean, maybe Im not drinking enough water but I try for at least 1900ml - 2600ml a day and under 900mg sodium. And the only other thing is for the last week I've been eating more potatoes I guess :/ I just feel like I can't understand anything anymore . Thank you for the reassurance and kind words",False,True

You can't possibly gain fat while eating 1200 calories (or even more). I can assure you it's water weight. Did you do some sport yesterday, ate later than usual, something different than usual ? Then that's it. Water weight isn't influenced only by sodium, it's just a bitch doing whatever it wants.  And if it's not water weight, it's poop weight lol.   I know it's scary to not know exactly what's going on in your body but CICO is a good science that you can trust. It's gonna be okay. I promise.",False,False
