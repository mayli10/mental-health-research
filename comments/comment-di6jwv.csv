You literally would have no other option unless you can find some woodsy area? But I still don‚Äôt know if that‚Äôs what either of you meant lol.,False,False

I just feel like it‚Äôs a sign of INCREDIBLE privilege to believe that you have to right to shit on a public place (or even worse in someone else‚Äôs yard). That is literally saying that your unwillingness to plan is more important than other people‚Äôs desire for clean, feces-free public spaces... ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è",False,False

There are portapotties at most runs I‚Äôve ever done. There really isn‚Äôt any excuse for this. And literally what? Check your privilege about what? I‚Äôm all about white people being called out for racist/shirts things they say but this is literally not it.,False,False
