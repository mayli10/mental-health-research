You‚Äôre so right. Relapsing is NOT the same as the first time. It‚Äôs not as fun or exciting. It‚Äôs more of solving a need and getting your ‚Äúfix‚Äù than being excited to not know what you‚Äôre getting yourself into.,False,False

I fantasize about my old ED days. I effortlessly restricted, and lost heaps of weight. Even when i was restricting, i would think ""wow this is so easy, why do people struggle with losing weight?"".

The first year or two were pretty dope and it‚Äôs amazing how strong I was and fasted so much.

Denying a basic human need is in fact very difficult for the probable majority of us. I mean you can think what you want but to say that directly to someone else is rude. This is the equivalent of a normie saying 'it's not hard to just eat'.,False,False
