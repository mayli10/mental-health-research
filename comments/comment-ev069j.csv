I've had some really useless therapists. Not just the ones who discus their own weight problems and diets (uh...ok. what am I supposed to say to that?) But the one I always remember was ""Well, I dont think you'll get fat...anorexics never seem to get fat.""   Oh great. Of course my ED brain took that to mean you better not get fat! Or not only will you be fat, you'll be an anomalous anorexic, and a disappointment to this loony therapist, too! So...best stop eating just in case.   Why do they not understand anything they say about weight WILL be twisted to serve the ED?  And my mum, bless her, came out with the classic: ""If you think *you're* fat, what do you think I am?! I must be morbidly obese?!""",False,False

Yeah, I just looked at her like, really? It was one of many dismissive things she has said over the years that I am just now coming to terms with.
