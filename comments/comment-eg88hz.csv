I work as a server and play Pokemon Go as a hobby, so I typically walk 5-7 miles a day and I'm still losing weight despite high restricting. I also may not be eating as much as I think I am. YMMV. If you like Pokemon, give PoGo a try. It rewards your walking by extra candy for your buddy pokemon + thats how you hatch eggs, so its an integral part of the game and may make walking feel less like a chore.",False,False

So if your thryoid is fine and you are restricting anyways this should work. idk wishing u luck,False,False
