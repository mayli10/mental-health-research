She told me after that she's concerned how I barely ate anything.  Each slice of pizza was like 300 calories!  I had already eaten oatmeal, 2 bananas, and some baby goldfish earlier in the day!  I feel like I ate more than what I *actually* wanted just because she kept insisting, and now here I am frustrated at the entire situation.

People really shouldn't comment on eating habits.  I half wish I just paid for an AirBnB for 6 weeks rather than do the free option.
