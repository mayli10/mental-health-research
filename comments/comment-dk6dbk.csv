Yeah I definitely see it as more of negligence on their side, rather than anything to do with me. Even though the issue lies with me, I dont have any idea how to treat myself. I've kind of given up now. Ive got no idea how to find a therapist who specializes in ED as I use the NHS. I doubt I'd have the money to look into one privately.",False,True

At the age that you developed an ed, you don't tend to store memories in autobiographical form, especially traumatic events. It sounds like you really need someone who specialises in EDs to work with.",False,False

I'm sorry you haven't been able to find anyone to help you with this. Just know that is a reflection on them and their lack of training/knowledge, which is not your fault. Can you search for a therapist that specializes in treating eating disorders?",False,False

Though I can understand as I feel the same. It's horrible because I would like to overcome it, but it seems that I'm the only one interested in doing that.",False,True

I've had arfid since I was... 5? Maybe and I've been going from therapist to therapist since I was 8. I have made a lot of progress! But I also feel kind of stuck with this forever even if I get a little bit better I will always have it,False,False
