I didn't have the knowledge or self-awareness to regulate my eating habits and my parents did nothing to help. So I grew up fat, was bullied, hated myself and my body etc but didn't know how to change.  Later, I was diagnosed with Type 1 Diabetes (NOT type 2, for those unaware of the difference. Nothing to do with my eating habits, it's an autoimmune disorder and I was just dealt a shitty hand). With this condition, your survival is dependent on your ability to count the carbs in your food and regulate your blood sugar via insulin. I micromanaged my diet, started exercising a ton, and I became addicted to the resulting weight loss. Being obsessive about my diet out of necessity lent itself to disordered eating habits, and here I am today, fluctuating from binging to restriction ad nauseum :)",False,False

So I guess I kind of learned to have anxiety in a way cause I never learned to talk to people and go meet friends and stuff like that. Everyone in my family is also overweight and eat very unhealthily. When I went up to secondary school I never made any proper friends and as a former fat kid I just assumed everyone hated me anyway. As I was basically mute at school and getting social media was a no go cause even the thought gave me anxiety attacks people thought I was weird. So I got bullied a fair amount. I got really depressed and and anxious so I stopped eating cause I didn't have the energy. I lost lots of weight down to an attractive size and everyone loved it so I tried to look prettier and stuff. One Christmas I gained loads of weight back cause the food was there and I didn't need to get it myself so I just ate and ate. I gained about a stone. From there I've been up and down since even tho I've worked on my anxiety so much so I can say say it barely effects anymore. The eating disorder is still here. I think I've always been weird with food tho like when I was little I went through fussy phases of only eating blueberries and apple juice and refusing anything else. And I was very underweight until I was 8 and started eating what my parents ate. Dunno I've been in a limbo of recovering and being bulimic for a year or so now. ,False,False

I kind of ""worked through it"" as I grew up but I was sexually abused when I was 13. Since then, i had been restricting on and off. It was always as a way to control how my body looked. If i was in a cross country or track season I'd eat enough to maintain and just cut myself all the time. If no sport was going on, I'd eat a lot less, sometimes fasting. It's been like that for a long time. I would sometimes try to purge but not be able to figure out how. Now in college I just go through b/p/ restrict cycles. I either eat everything, throw up, and workout for hours, or eat like 30% of the calories I burn in a day. I have terrible depression and PTSD which love to fuck with the ED and OCD.

It sounds awful, but it's really, really funny to watch us all eat together at family gatherings. (Well, funny in a dark sort of way. My SO finds it disturbing.) My grandmother and I have very similar eating rituals and rules about what is safe/unsafe, so we'll neurotically pick at our food in mirror image. My aunt is always on some new diet pill or medicine to help with her tendency to binge, so she eats a normal amount but feels really full and makes jokes about needing a good purge. My mom, who is the heaviest of the four of us, is bothered by/jealous of all this, so she drinks and gets increasingly nasty, and will, 100% guaranteed, binge as soon as she gets home.  Like, it's kinda funny in a fucked up sort of way. It feels like a really dark SNL skit or something. ",False,False

She didn't call it an eating disorder, exactly. But she talks about how, in her teens and twenties, she never ate. How her father would force her to sit at a table until she ate and she'd cry because she didn't want to get fat. How, when her first husband was deployed, she was both really sad and really happy because it meant she didn't have to cook for him and didn't have to eat, and how excited she was to be super thin when he came home. How, when she was stationed with him somewhere before his deployment, she ate exclusively saltwater taffy and nothing else. In pictures from her youth, she was very, very thin - probably a 16.5-17 BMI. ",False,False

I have always had a low self esteem. I have BPD and have dealt with depression since middle school. I grew up pretty chubby, often bullied and ridiculed for my weight by my brothers and their friends. Depression lead to disordered eating, namely just not eating a lot due to not wanting to (also a combo of being poor and not having a lot of food) and I lost over 40 lbs by 7th or 8th grade. I began attending a school that had a buffet dining hall, and I think having access to a lot of food for the first time in my life threw me off. I also started using Nexplanon birth control. I gained 35 lbs likely due to both of these factors, and it tore me apart. I guess I never really got over the bullying from grade school, because it was always eating me up inside. After about a year, I was becoming increasingly at risk of being bulimic and attempted several times to throw up after eating. After realizing it wasn't gonna work out, I started extreme restricting instead.   And now I'm here. I'm sure it'll be okay, despite things feeling scary right now. I'll recover one day, just not today. I'm just not ready yet. And maybe that's the curse of having an eating disorder--maybe nothing is enough, and maybe you'll never want to recover. I don't really know. I'm staying optimistic, though, that's the least I can do. ",False,True

Once she even asked in front my hairdresser who came to our home why I was eating so much when I kept going to the fridge for snacks.. then yeah i started restricting. She means well but this wasnt really well thought out. Eventually my dad who is a psychiatrist that works with eating disorder patients got her to stop making the comments about me (and my brothers) weight, but it was too late by then. My mum is quite overweight, having had 5 kids at a late age and never having really lost it, despite going on lots of diets. However, I see in her younger photos in her late 20s she was very slim. I wonder if theres a genetic component to eating disorder thought patterns or it just went through the generations through the comments of perhaps her mother and then herself. Just the other day we were commenting about this girls' school's new uniform and I brought up how their old white stockings looked pretty bad and she was like yeah, it just makes their fat legs look even later. And another time a girl was confidently crossing the road in front of us at a red light with some short shorts horts on and a lot of her leg showing, and my mum made some comment about her fat legs. Now that I'm past puberty, at 21, and I have quite intense studies to focus on, she's stopped making the comments, although I'm sure she'd prefer if I was slimmer. I keep eating over my calorie limit though due to stress..",False,False

I would starve myself regularly. Then in middle school I learned how to binge and purge from a friend. High school I spiraled out of control and reached my lowest weight probably ever possible my senior year. I spent 5 months in resi. Gained all the weight they wanted and then some. Got out of treatment and binged like crazy without purging. Ballooned up my weight. Got to college then started restricting like I’d always promised myself I would once I was finished living with my parents.   Things got worse. So bad. Worse than I ever could’ve thought possible. Then I was trapped in an endless b/p cycle that also involved some really horrified drug use. Like I would literally do cocaine and adderall and then go work out. My Fitbit would sometimes clock my heart rate at 200+.   Stopped b/p finally in January 2016. Started restricting like crazy. Got to another LW that March. Then started binging because nothing makes me eat like reaching a goal weight.   Then spent July to two days short of Christmas in resi. Got out and swore I’d never go to treatment again. Dropped out of college. Met the love of my life. And definitely fuckin developed BED.   Spent most of 2017-2018 living in a cycle of self loathing and constant eating. I was so scared to start restricting again but I was also getting sick of the fact I’d gained 95 pounds in 6 years.   January 1st this year I said screw it. I gotta lose weight. Now I’ve been on a high restriction plan for myself with really intense calorie counting and food/macro restrictions imposed on myself. I’ve lost 42 pounds to date. I work out again which feels nice. Haven’t binging once in 2019. Gotta keep that streak going.   This is a life long battle. Sometimes it sucks worse than others. My life is actually great right now and I don’t even mind the fact I’m constantly thinking about food/weight/shape. ,False,False
