The worst they'll say is no. They'll probably do it. You're roommates, which means there's going to be compromise and house-sharing and cooperation.",False,False

I see it every time I come and go from my room. Plus I work nights and he works days so when I have the house to myself, I can't resist the temptation :(",False,True

Itâ€™s been about 5 years since I even had ED-related thoughts, but this year has been incredibly stressful and lonely and here I am again. I am worried about myself and feel very torn - do I really want to throw away how strong and healthy I am now? But the answer is of course yes, especially after someone complimented me on how slim I look the other day...  If you need someone to vent to or just a friend who understands feel free to message me anytimeðŸ’–thanks for letting me comment here tooðŸ’•",False,False

I bet if you just casually said ""hey, that scale kind of stresses me out. Would you mind keeping it in your bedroom closet instead of the shared bathroom?"" your roommate would probably move it with minimal or no issues",False,False

I wasn't really expecting anyone to reply; it was just nice to share anonymously instead of writing in a journal like I normally do so I feel like I got it off my chest... I like my crutch, but I know how debilitating it can be too and I know deep down I don't want to lose everything I've worked so hard to get back these last 8 years. I scheduled an appointment with my therapist in 11 days so I guess I'm doing the right thing, I'm just not sure I want to give it up just yet. Torn between what's right and what I want",False,True

I wanted to write a response to you but am not sure what to say. I feel for you. I have relapsed after about the same recovery time as you. Sucks. Am still figuring out myself what to do, how to overcome the shame in talking to my therapist. Finding the words to explain. Finding the will. (and not constantly switch between telling, getting help, and keeping it a secret)     Hope you find something that works for you. :)",False,False
