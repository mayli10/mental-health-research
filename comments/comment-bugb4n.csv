They are these very thin packets of gel, no bigger than the size of an index card, and I use them for test taking and studying all the time. They’re 80 calories per pouch, super convenient, and personally, I find just taking in the 80 cal and 20 g of carbohydrates through the gel makes me less guilty about eating/drinking it. I can pm you the amazon link if you want to check it out.",False,False
