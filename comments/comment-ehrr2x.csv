When you’re hungry your brain gets all creative like oh I bet a KitKat would taste good rn.  Then I remember last time I binged on KitKats and puked and got so sick of the taste of chocolate it makes me nauseous. Veggies give me this full but CLEAN feeling. A full tummy stuffed with salad and chicken is like please god no more food not even if it’s the worlds best cake I’ll puke from how stuffed I am! On my period rn and this always works for me. Oh and sparkling water for some reason! The bubbles keep me so full to the point I’m sick and can’t bare to eat anything else. I drink a can of sparkling water after my meal and you get that “post-binge completely full to the point of being sick” feeling which is great after you just had a low cal salad cause it prevents you from eating more👌🏻,False,False
