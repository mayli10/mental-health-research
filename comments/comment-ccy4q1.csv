Then last year I lived in an apartment near campus and ordered groceries roughly every two weeks. The delivery fee caused it to cost more, but the convenience (I don't have a car) was worth it. However, my family also bought me food when they went to Costco and I would get free food on campus, so I was really only buying perishables through the delivery service. When I move again next month it will be the first time I'll be mostly on my own for groceries, hence my trying to minimize the cost. I haven't actually tried to live on a grocery budget of $90 yet lol, it's just technically possible.",False,False

(if you don't mind sharing)",False,True

(There's probably a way to spend even less but I don't really cook so nothing I buy is in bulk.)  Are you not going to have access to a dinning hall?",False,False
