When I was working as a cashier I'd glance at the nutrition facts of the items I was scanning for any low calorie/safe foods to buy, or note cheap binge food options. If I was stocking I'd get caught up in looking at labels. When I clocked out I'd buy I bunch of food, binge and purge for the rest of the day, go back the next day and do it all again. Fucking terrible environment for any recovery effort I had hoped to make at the time. Landed myself in treatment twice during my time working there. ",False,False

Even before any of these problems. I'm cheap and don't want to pay for it and I've seen it 1000 times. I also tend to eat before work since serving goes late.

Its a super handy place to work but I can help my self to the buffet we have and its an absolute curse. I think I gained a fair bit after I first started there. When I was first dealing with ED stuff my lunch would be three little pieces of black bean chicken with a tiny scoop of rice and even that made me freak out. Now that I've relapsed I eat similarly, except vegan this time. I always want to skip lunch but I honestly think there must be some sort of psychological thing where being around nice smelling food for hours will make you really hungry. It's frustrating. The urge to take home lots of food to binge on is a pain. I am good to customers but I also have that inside voice in my head that's lowkey judging them for getting so much high calorie food..

I worked at an Olive Garden when my ED stuff started, and it was great because you could get salad and soup for $1 before/after your shift. It was perfect. This was during college too, so all of the stress of a college-aged young adult was present.   Now that Iâ€™ve grown enough to be in a serious position the stress has gotten more intense. My ED went from anorexia to bulimia and itâ€™s seriously the hardest thing for me to not eat scraps from the kitchen. We also get a shift drink as managers at the end of the night, which can be beer, wine, champagne, whatever.   I canâ€™t slip away to the single toilet bathroom to purge, I canâ€™t binge eat without people seeing me, I canâ€™t control myself around all of the exquisite desserts... which means I canâ€™t miss a day at the gym, I canâ€™t attend social events with my coworkers to bond, and I canâ€™t be bothered to purchase anything from the grocery store that isnâ€™t a protein bar.

Like, I'll try the things I make, but when we taste test things we cut them up for everybody to try, so its only like a one inch piece of a cookie or whatever else, so it's not that bad.

But I cover a shift every now and then these days. It does help that I know what goes in everything so I can at least be aware of things I'll let myself eat. I feel like any judgment I have about customer orders is usually less about the food and more like envy/fascination at how people can drop so much money on a meal, seemingly without guilt. There are couples who come in and spend upwards of 50 dollars on a whole arrangement of different items.  On the other hand, the girl who took over my job (a relative of the owner) has the biggest sweet tooth I've ever seen and it strikes both fear and awe in me. She takes her milk tea after her shift with ""extra, extra, extra sugar."" Last week we had a ton of leftover boba so she took home a 32oz container full (about a liter). And then very casually said, ""This will probably get me through about two days."" And when pressed by me, who was shocked, explained, ""Sometimes I don't feel like eating real food so I'll just have boba.""
