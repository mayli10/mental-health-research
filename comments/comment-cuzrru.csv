But for a second, can we get back to how you define ‚Äúbulky‚Äù or ‚Äúswole‚Äù? Like, your partner can deadlift 375 freaking lbs, how is that not the definition of swole?    Do you have to have been mr. Olympia 7 times, governed the state of California, last name Schwarzenegger before you‚Äôre like ‚Äúokay, maybe that dude is swole.‚Äù",False,False
