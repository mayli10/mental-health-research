Luckily, I was able to overcome that and haven’t had a binge that severe in years.  But now, I consider even just 700 calories a binge. My brain just did a total 180.  It’s crazy what the ED can make you believe. You’ve just got to remember that it’s simply not true.",False,False

I thought that that because I'd eaten a yogurt AND an apple (because I was hungry and I wanted an apple, y'know) it was a binge.  Confirmed: not a binge.  Absolutely definitely not a binge and she suggested if I fancy increasing to two yogurts and an apple and or yogurt, cereal bar, apple - or whatever the fuck I fancied eating, it wasn't a binge,  NOT AT ALL.  Yeah, I'm calling the bitch out a lot more these days.  It's liberating.",False,False
