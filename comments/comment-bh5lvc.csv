I was supposed to plan a binge/purge for tomorrow morning because I'll be home alone before school, and I usually don't get much opportunity to be home alone now, but I was super triggered on Monday night to the point of insomnia, so I binge/purged at 3 a.m. then, but because of that, my gag reflex is completely shot, so now I can't b/p until Tuesday at the very least (I need to fake my weight for my psych appointment on Monday).  I have no advice &gt;.&lt; just..we can get through thisüíï just try to hold on a bit longer",False,False
