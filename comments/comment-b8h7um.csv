It depends on what you're deficient in, which you can only establish properly with bloodwork. And even a full blood panel doesn't quantify everything.  If you can afford it go nuts, take a multivitamin. Anything your body doesn't need supplemented will just be excreted. Aim for something with biotin, or one that says ""hair/skin/nails"". Consider an omega 3/6/9 too, if you avoid fats in your food.  If you track your food, try using Cronometer. It has better micro tracking and a more reliable database than mfp or the other crowd sourced ones that are basically ads for running shoes lol. I love it, and it might highlight something you can easily even out with a few dietary changes (eg: spinach instead of iceberg lettuce, or something simple like that).  Hair/skin/nails issues are easily visible signs of vitamin/mineral deficiencies, so your two options if you're going to be undereating are to go broad spectrum, or track down the specific problem. Depending on how long-term/severe your deficiencies are, the multivitamin approach might be sensible to help with deficiencies in your diet that don't have such immediate/visible consequences as thinning hair.  Take care of yourself as best you can, I know how hard it is I promise. Remember that if you're eating &lt;1000, or up to ~1200 (adjust those #s if you're taller or shorter than average) without trying to hit your micros, you're likely going to be deficient in something. That's an inescapable part of restricting, and all you can do is take it in hand and try to mitigate it to the best of your ability.   I don't even know what normal hair loss is because mine does what you're describing and has for as long as I can remember lol. Best of luck, friend! ",False,False

It's kind of super frustrating that my meal plan provides only 97.7g because that means in Cronometer it says 100% but it's still yellow. I get 101% of both carbs and lipids in that plan, so I guess they're both slightly high with protein being slightly low. It's basically perfect though, so I'm not going to try to change it and throw other things off for the extra 0.3g of protein.",False,False
