Also just seeing her have a snack whenever she feels hungry and carry on with her life makes me feel like it's okay for me to do the same. She's such a gem ⭐,False,False

I have the exact same issue. I’ve detached myself from my senses of hunger and fullness, I used to eat a specific amount that I’d worked out was enough to allow me to maintain my weight but this year I decided I wanted to start “eating intuitively” and guess what I started eating massive amounts of food, which altho I may not have a good framework of whats the “normal” food intake Ik for a fact was way too much cos I gained a ton of weight and most ppl I interact with it (not necessarily eat with) don’t really put on weight that often and that fast.   Exactly! Notice how I always put the word “normal” in quotes because we’re assuming here that the normal, as in the most common, is to eat this healthy intuitive amount, and unfortunately I personally would say nowadays the number of ppl who have disordered eating is bigger than those who don’t.",False,False

But things with ice cream IDK how people sit down and eat just one cup or even the serving size of 1/2 cup. Like a pint is the perfect size but I've been told that is So Much ice cream. Hmm.  I've always had disordered eating to different extremes, but I've been trying to break the cycle recently, it's just so hard because when I eat ""intuitively"" it always feels like far too much or far too little. And so many people today, like your friends, have some level of disordered eating because of societal pressures to be thin, or fit, or eat ""clean"". I can count the normal-weight friends I have doing keto or if or some other diet craze on two hands. It's depressing. Whenever I do hang out with someone we either just don't eat because it's so late, get cheap fast food, or buy a small snack from a gas station, and usually I just get what they get or something similar bc I'm scared my choice would be eyebrow-raisingly big.

Whenever I eat over my TDEE I feel so guilty because it seems like normal people never do that? Which is dumb because obviously average people don't eat the exact amount of calories a day, but it's good to know thst the fluctuation can be pretty big or small, sometimes, and that's normal.   Weirdly enough whenever I bake I don't usually binge on them, which is comforting because I was always so scared of baking when I was in HS. I struggled with binge-eating &amp; definitely would have eaten whole batches of things. Then I got really into restricting and baking scared me bc of the high calories of sweets. I'm slowly overcoming a lot of ED fears right now. I usually eat 1-2/day of the cookies/rolls/muffins depending, 4 just seemed like a lot and I wondered if average people wouldn't even bat an eye. But it's good to know that maybe they would! Obviously not every day but if they were pretty hungry like I was, then it's okay.   Thank you so much!! This has settled my nerves a bit, if I have any other questions, I'll let you know!",False,True

I exercise about 2 hours a day plus walking for about over an hour. Usually, if I am trying to eat at maintenance, that would equate to 2500 calories. But the point, most people, if they have a normal relationship with food, eat near their TDEE. However, it is absolutely normal for people to overeat one day! Maybe they were on vacation and eating out for most meals. Or maybe they tried a new recipe that was so delicious that they wanted to eat all of it, even though all of it was their TDEE in calories. And if that happens one day, many people will naturally eatless the next day, because they'll find their appetite a little dulled, because their body's energy needs are lower because of the day before's surplus.  Also, when my mom made cinnamon rolls, we would often eat 3-4 in a day. Usually we'd each eat 2 for breakfast and it become a race later in the day- there were 5 kids so 2 pans of 8 =16 and 2 rolls at breakfast =10 eaten and 6 left. It was kind of; eat another one or two after school or risk not having another cinnamon roll until the next time she makes them.   If you struggle with not eating all of a batch of baked goods, perhaps you could try before putting them in the oven, something like, ""I can have a maximum of 3 cookies or 2 cinnamon rolls etc a day. I'm not depriving myself but if I have more than that in one day I may feel physically yucky"" and if you still struggle, try putting some aside in some Tupperware to take to a friend, or work. Etc.  Hope that helps! If you'd like, you can PM me for some ideas of what recovery eating looks like",False,False

Keep in mind I was a young adult male, so I probably would eat slightly more than a typical young female, but still.  I would always have a large, hearty breakfast, which typically would be a bowl of wholefat milk and cereal. Sometimes I would choose oatmeal made with milk and topped with jam, fruit or peanut butter, but mostly I would just stick to milk with cereal.  I would have a mid-morning snack depending on the context. E.g. if I was at the uni I would have something from the vending machines, like a small packet of cheesy crackers or a soft bread. During high school I would get a slice of pizza. If I was at home I wouldn't have anything as far as I remember.  For lunch I would have a main dish - pasta or rice with a sauce or legumes - followed by a smaller, lighter ""second"" dish - meat (often poultry) or fish - simply cooked in a pan with some oil or just baked. Then I would end the lunch with some fruit and/or a yoghurt.  Usually I would have a mid-afternoon snack, another bowl of milk with cereal, although smaller than the breakfast one.  For dinner I would either have a soup with some pasta/rice (but less than at lunch), or some eggs with bread, or just some cheese if it was hot and we couldn't bother cooking. Then some steamed veggies and again some fruit.  This was the standard. I didn't count calories but I guess this all would add up to my TDEE, as I was skinny and my weight was remarkably stable. I did happen to eat a lot sometimes, on special occasions (e.g. at Christmas or when I dined out), but I would tend to unknowingly compensate those by eating slightly less on the following days as I wouldn't feel so hungry.  I didn't ""exercise"" regularly nor did I go to the gym but I did walk around a lot and was just generally pretty active.",False,False

One of them is and has always been a bit overweight and was quite obsessed with losing weight to impress her middle school crush til she slowly gave up on it and as of today, although she doesn’t really act on them, she still has a lot of food/weight-related toxic thoughts. The other one is a bit more complicated, when she was 11 or 12 her parents divorced and her mom had a series of asshole bfs, which was very hard on her so she started binge eating to cope n gained a ton of weight. Then around last year she decided to lose it all and went on a hardcore diet and altho she looks fine imo she wants to keep eating a salad a day. Both of them also smoke a shit ton of cigarettes because according to them they work as appetite-supressants to some extent. They don’t know much bout my issues with food, just that I lost a lot of weight some years ago by dieting rly hard, but they don’t know that I still have a ton of insecurities related to my weight and how much I eat and that I sorta developed a binge disorder last year. When the three of us are together I have tons of fun but whenever its time to eat smth the atmosphere just gets kinda awkward as in we’re all thinking like “pls do eat so I dont hate myself”. Other than them and my close family lil but I only eat with them for dinner Idk what they eat at work,I don’t rly spend time with anyone else so just like you i have no framework of what’s like to eat like a “normal” person.",False,False
