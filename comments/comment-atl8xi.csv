I could eat 2k+ easily. Iâ€™m on both sides of the ED.

And people are commenting they control themselves mindlessly but 2k is a lot to me. Like today I ate a sÃ¡ndwich w one slice of bread and half a tsp of jelly, a medium vegetable pie, 2 cake pops, a slice of cake, and 3 slices cheese pizza. And I'm at 1900 cals. Like???? That's a lot I'm full asf and it isn't maintainable, like I have days like this and days &lt;1000 because I'm in recovery..(before it was 200 cals 1 day, fast 2 day, and 2 400cal burning exercises).

Working out a lot plays a huge role, and some people do have a high metabolism that causes them to be able to not gain weight/be more difficult to gain weight.  It all depends on person to person.  Bingeing also plays a role in ED, and a person's mind with ED sees food differently.  If a person binges they may restrict longer, try to purge it away, or work out for a few extra hours (just an example).     &amp;#x200B;  In my case, I personally see food is something that will do more harm than good.  That is an example of someone seeing food in a different way, since normally food is seen as something to give you strength and energy to continue on in the day.  But, again, that is my personal experience.  There are different cases out there.    &amp;#x200B;  It is also addicting to watch the scale drop; it is basically a rush of \*""I finally did it.""\*  That being said, it isn't as simple as just seeing food in a ""new light.""
