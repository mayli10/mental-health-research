My best advice would be to not react in front of the whole class, but if she continues to make remarks, pull her aside before or after class and discuss how uncomfortable her comments make you feel. You do not have to explain WHY you are so thin, just let her know you would appreciate if she could stop pointing out her observations in class, and if she is genuinely concerned, to express her feelings in private to you.",False,False
