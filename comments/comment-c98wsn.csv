Now it’s searching for a new job stress and I guess I’m restricting easily? Our minds are weird.,False,False

However, you're probably also relatively high in cortisol, which makes you retain a lot more water than you'd expect. But if you stick with it, I promise it'll eventually go away.  And actually, it may decrease your cortisol levels to increase your calories a little - you can probs lose a good amount of body fat even if you increased your calories to close to 1700 - 1800. If you're male, even more. This way may be slower for fat loss, but sounds more sustainable, especially if you're prone to binging cycles",False,False

I’m not anorexic, I’m a binge eater and food addict. I was once 320 lbs and now 255 lbs. I was going up and down between 10 lbs this last year and now I’m back in some sort of restrict mood but for past 2 weeks I’ve been at 255 lbs and eating less than 1200 calories. I have to restrict more... I’m 5 foot 8 and super morbidly obese, am I not tall or fat enough for 1200 calories to lose weight?",False,False

They're composed of different macronutrients. Beginners who just start strength training are at a really good position to both lose fat and build muscle simultaneously. Highly recommend!   And I totally agree that for just fat loss (not muscle building or improvements to physique), taking long walks is better/less stressful/more sustainable than working out",False,False
esyr2el,t3_c98wsn,t1_esufwto,ddmar,1,2019-07-05 12:31:31,/r/EDAnonymous/comments/c98wsn/is_it_really_possible_to_slow_your_metabolism/esyr2el/,"So the exercise thing is kind of a misconception. Loss of body mass (whether muscle or fat or any other body tissue) will be dictated by calories in/calories out (for most people, tissue that isn't fat will not be burned for energy; this changes if you're drastically underweight like most people who are anorexic).   If you're exercising, but not in significant amounts and eat back extra calories, you're not going to lose fat and if you're in a surplus of calories, even with exercise, you will gain weight.  Unfortunately, if you exercise a small amount and keep your calories the same, there's a chance that your body may adapt and lower how many calories you spend at rest to compensate. This generally happens more with cardio than strength training (which makes sense: when you do cardio, you're training your heart to become more efficient at pumping blood - i.e. greater output with lower energy). So if you're doing mostly cardio, but not a significant amount of it (e.g. running on a treadmill for an hour at the same pace every day for weeks on end vs. training for a marathon with changing intensity and different training routines), exercise may not be as beneficial as you'd like. It sucks, but cardio is a really inefficient way to try to lose fat.  If you're strength training, and you are eating the same amount of calories, but you're gaining weight, there's a very good chance that the excess weight is water retention, especially if you just started out or are using a new routine. You're stimulating muscle growth that your body isn't accustomed to, and that requires a lot of water (protein synthesis occurs through polypeptide formation which requires the presence of a solvent, generally water/aqueous solution. When you don't strength train regularly, your muscle volume is generally lower because they're less hydrated since there's no stressor promoting muscle synthesis). You're likely losing fat/gaining muscle, but you're not going to immediately see your weight change because of the extra water weight",False,False

If doing 30 minutes on the bike is getting easier over time, you might be gaining more than you think. That's a good thing, but you should expect that the benefit of exercise is better health and not lighter weight.  Walking is nice because it's a whole-body motion, low-impact, takes up a lot of time, physically moves you somewhere so you have to keep walking to get back, and gets you out into the world.",False,False

There metabolisms decreased by about 20% on average but after 2-3 months of eating normally, most of their metabolisms bounced back. So I suppose the answer is yes, starvation may reduce your metabolism but not to the point where it makes you maintain. Otherwise, no one would ever die from starvation.",False,False

A pound of fat has more energy than you need to build a pound of muscle. So when you exercise, the activity is going to help you lose some weight by burning calories, and the muscle growth is going to help you gain some weight.  Converting fat to muscle will make you stronger, healthier, better-looking, and increase your metabolism. But don't expect to lose weight doing it.

I feel your frustration and that frustration is what lead to my eating disorder. With help from my ED therapist and a dietician, I learned about the science behind weight loss and low restriction is best for weight loss. It sucks because it takes awhile, but it is healthiest for your mind and body and works the best. Also, muscle is heavy so you might gain weight but muscle burns more calories and will help anyone’s fitness journey. Plus, you’ll feel great!   I stopped weighing myself and worked closely with a doctor. By eating 3 normal, healthy meals a day (and snacks when I was hungry!) and working out 4ish times a week, I lost weight in a healthy way and was strong too! I advise anyone with a disordered eating path to do this with a therapist to limit a slippery slope in to an ED.",False,False

From my understanding, severe *long-term* calorie restriction slows your BMR because your body will try to conserve energy by limiting the calories it burns. Your body burns carbs/glucose for energy, and then fat and muscle stores, to fuel body processes. When your body runs out of stores and you aren’t putting in new sources of energy, it slows the metabolism and stores anything it can at any chance it gets. This isn’t something that happens quickly, but if your body goes a long time without the adequate caloric intake it needs to sustain life, it’ll eventually start trying to store the calories it might otherwise burn if the person is eating adequate calories.   I believe it IS a myth in society that this happens easily or causes people to gain weight. In order for this process to happen, your body will be going through this for quite a long time. It doesn’t store the energy to put weight on a person, but to  have a store of energy sources to maintain normal life.   Summary- long term, severe restriction can do this. Anorexia can lead to this. It doesn’t happen from occasional restriction, and it typically isn’t going to make someone fat.",False,False
