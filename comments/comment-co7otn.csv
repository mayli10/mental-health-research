Maybe as a compromise you can go and order something smaller off of the menu? I know exactly how you feel because eating just about anything is painful for me. Sometimes the softest and easiest to digest foods can be too much for me. It's not easy to manage. I only eat anything at all because I know I'll feel worse if I don't.,False,False
