I just think my body doesn’t like sugars, so I think it’s possible you might just not be eating things your body runs well on. If you’re eating lots of processed foods maybe try adding veggies, protein, and a multivitamin maybe? ",False,False

It is often supplements on top of a balanced diet rich in these minerals and vitamins.  So any restriction can make you feel like shit.   Definitely start taking supplements every day!!",False,False
