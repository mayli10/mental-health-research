I have a fucking oral exam that’s super important for the rest of my education tomorrow and instead of preparing for it at all, what did I do? Nothing !!! I went for a run so long I cried in the end and then I spent 30 minutes staring at a piece of cake in the fridge before having a pickle for dinner. I’m already planning my post failure binge rn.. so yeah we really out here. I’m praying for you though :)",False,False
