Omg I’m so in the same boat with the scale thing! Hopefully it won’t make a huge difference in the long run. Will have to force myself to get used to not being as ‘empty’ ,False,True

But even if I eat earlier the cravings come on. Night time/evenings are the worst.  I also have trouble falling asleep if I'm hungry so eating later helps BUT eating later at night means the scale won't be as low as possible in the morning. I really need to break the late night eating habit. I'm getting better but I need some sort of intoxicant to relax and getting stoned or drunk adds to the struggle. ,False,False

I think it stems from the classic ""dont eat after 7pm (2 hours b4 bed)"" diet advice that we grew up with?  I try very hard to still follow this but find it difficult at times",False,False

I postpone eating as much as I can during the day because once I start eating it's sooo much harder to stop. Not talking about binging but like if i eat breakfast, I'm gonna be hungry by lunchtime and then snack the rest of the day just because. If i don't, i can't usually hold on until i leave from work. Then i have all the day's calories in a shorter period of time which makes it more satisfying and i like eating right before bed because it makes me fall asleep easier. ",False,False

Then I start eating a bit, but I eat the bulk of my calories an hour or so before bed. I'm pretty weird, but I get anxious about getting decent sleep, so I want to feel satiated :/ ",False,False

On weekends I’ll put it off til later in the day but if I’m gymming (usually around lunch time) or if I have a ton of work to do I prefer to eat something in the morning otherwise exercise makes me dizzy and weak and/or my brain can barely function. My job involves high performing brain work so it’s so hard to high restrict. I’ll get fired lol ,False,False

So over it, probably one of my worst cycles yet. But fortunately I’ve noticed in the last couple of days it is easier for me to restrict if I just put off eating at all till the very end of the day. I don’t have a job at the moment though and I’m worried it will be too hard when I start working again.",False,True

In my last restriction phase used to fast from about 3pm onwards. That phase eventually morphed into a b/p cycle for about a year and recently it seems to have transitioned back to restricting but I find it a lot lot lot harder to go to bed hungry (stomach pains hungry) so I’ll usually just eat something “filling” like a thick soup as long as it’s within my planned calorie intake. If I don’t I usually can’t fall asleep for hours. It’s really weird. ,False,False
