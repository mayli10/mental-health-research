For me, I felt like she was asking to be complimented on her weight loss when she would openly comment things like: “Wow, it’s so nice to have pants that fit comfortably!”  or often she would make comments about how she enjoyed her trainer at the gym, and how much meal prepping has impacted her life, without explicitly mentioning weight loss.  Basically, I felt like she was asking for someone to tell her that she looked good, and applaud her for her weight loss.  It was kind of inspiring IMO, to see someone lose weight through healthy methods like lifestyle changes.  On the other hand, I would be afraid to compliment someone on their weight loss bc I would be afraid to encourage unhealthy methods of losing weight....like most of us (myself lol) on this sub .... ha....ha.ha......",False,False

I'd only confront someone like that if there were solid red flags and even then it's tricky to bring it up in a way that will be well received. From your post the red flags aren't there anyway.  I definitely project my own problems on others just like this. It's easy because my perspective is warped and I literally can't imagine a healthy relationship with food and exercise. Gotta hush that voice though. Remember the flags. Her flags are all green right now. Assume genuine healthy lifestyle change before anything else.  Your caring is very sweet and I bet she would appreciate you looking out for her.",False,False
