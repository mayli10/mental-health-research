An adult facility would probably have way more dedicated patients bc they're choosing to be there.  The main difference between ED IP and psych IP is the hyperfocus on food and body image. That's all your life is about in an ED facility. That's what you talk about all day every day: food, body image, and eating disorders.  Meals sucked. Every patient worked individually with a dietitian and *some* of them let you have a say in what they fed you (*what* they fed you, not how much food) but if you weren't lucky, you'd be given fear foods at every single meal. It wasn't uncommon to be the only one eating while everyone else refused food/supplement. It was just so toxic to be eating meals in that environment.",False,False

In general you can expect to fill out some kind of questionnaire about your ED behaviors and probably have a brief checkup to get your weight and vital signs.  Inpatient itself is what you make of it. If you work hard and are dedicated to recovery, you'll gain a lot from the supportive environment there. That being said, make sure you feel good about the therapist/dietitian you'll be seeing, because that can make or break your stay.  Best of luck, OP. I'm rooting for you. You can do this.",False,False

If this doesn't work the next place I will have to go is inpatient which is out of state for me.,False,False

It's hard and I am only on day 2. I had an anxiety attack over the meal plan.  I have to get better though,  if I get any sicker I may have to go to the hospital and I am the breadwinner for my family so that cant happen.  Plus my body aches,  my head hurts all the time, I'm dizzy alot and have no energy and my brain is foggy.  I cant keep this up. Stay strong and dont listen to the ED voice screaming at you.",False,False
