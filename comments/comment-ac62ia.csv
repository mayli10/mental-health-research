Carbs go into glycogen stores unless immediately used and require 4g of water per 1g of carb, so that can account for a lot of water retention weight gain.  Look into the ketogenic diet, which pairs great with fasting and check out Siim Land or Thomas Delauer on youtube for how to break a fast without weight gain.",False,False

I started to whoosh yesterday (lost the first kg, waiting for the other to go) a week later. It's been hard for me to face the numbers, but if I check my calories intake it just can't be real weight. And I tend to gain water weight the week before my period and I lose it when it begins.   Having to deal with Christmas, NYE and period bloat is like hell on earth, but I think you shouldn't fast or low restrict. You will have a whoosh eventually, don't overthink the numbers on the scale (easier said than done, I know..). I can have a +3 or +4 kg of bloat depending on the situation. Don't worry too much and stay safe ‚ù§",False,False

And although you seemed to have ruled out the possibility that it's all bloat, I think it is. Between period water retention, alcohol water retention, and not having a BM yet, you are definitely not gaining. You've probably lost a bit, all said and done. Just hang in there, and remember that at the end of the week, your math checks out and eventually the scale will match. Bodies aren't perfect machines, so just remember that all that fluctuation is normal and not your fault!!!! Good luck!!",False,False
