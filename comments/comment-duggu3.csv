They're 190 cal, 20 g protein, 1-2 g sugar depending on the flavor (added sugar is a big thing for me and most protein bars have soooo much). The peanut butter flavored ones are really soft and feel weird to eat so I like to get the pack that doesn't include those  If you're into tofu or chia seeds it's a good place to get a large amount for cheaper",False,False
