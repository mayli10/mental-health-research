If you want alcohol without sugar it‚Äôs best to buy the ones that don‚Äôt have any sugar added,False,False

I‚Äôm a biochemist and I‚Äôm not sure I could give you a straight answer. Alcohol calories are processed metabolically differently than normal calories because alcohol is very inefficiently used as an energy source (due to it being a toxin), but there are a lot of conflicting resources on whether or not they ‚Äúcount‚Äù for spirits. Also the rate and amount you drink is another factor on how your body will process the alcohol so really it is just very difficult to know.",False,False
