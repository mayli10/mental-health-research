Margot Robbie has lost a tremendous amount of weight in the past year and is no longer at a normal weight; you can see the picture I linked in my other comment in response to this post.  She looks as though she lost 20-30 pounds on an already small frame.  As for Natalie, she may be vegan (though she was not during her last pregnancy) but that wouldn‚Äôt explain why she‚Äôs eating under a healthy amount of calories.  It sounds like the same rhetoric Keira Knightley used in explaining why she was so thin‚Äîbecause she eats a lot of salad.  That‚Äôs fine, but vegans need to eat a lot higher volume than omnivores since fruits and veggies have so little calories.  And Emma Stone has commented on her extreme weight loss, so even she is aware of how small she has gotten.
