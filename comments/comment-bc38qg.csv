I take them regardless but vitamins do help me to not feel as shit when restricting heavily. Also, any sort of sport replacement supplement is great. I use a specific vegan sport protein powder for meal replacement and I've found that even with restricting I feel decent the next day because I'm pretty much getting everything I need without a shit ton of calories.",False,False

You won't be able to keep up the exercise (you're already feeling weak) and you won't get the benefits of strength training without allowing yourself to fuel it.   You can't possibly gain weight at 900 calories while exercising like that. You love food; use this as an excuse to eat it, lol.  I know ""just eat!"" is about as helpful as ""just be happy!"" but if validation and permission to eat more helps at all, then here you go.",False,False
