If you haven't heard of her yet, Tabitha Farrar has some amazing self-help resources. She recovered on her own and now writes and vlogs about it, she has a website and a YouTube channel. If you don't know her you should really check her out! Every time I do she makes me cry, she hits all the nails on all their heads.  I really wish you luck in this. If you can or if you want to, and if it won't set you back to keep coming here, keep us posted! I'll be thinking of you, I hope it goes well.",False,False

Don't forget that. I hope you hear back soon.   &amp;#x200B;  Can you do any work yourself or with a therapist (idk if you have one already, but if not it'll probably be another long wait...oof) in the meantime?",False,False

I’ll definitely keep you guys updated. Luckily I’m in Canada and these programs are covered by provincial health insurance, so I don’t have to pay money, but the price is the long waitlists. :(   Thanks for the support, I really appreciate it!   Take care! ",False,True

If they don't take you seriously, they're just not worth your time and money. You deserve someone who will take you seriously and help you get better. Good luck!
