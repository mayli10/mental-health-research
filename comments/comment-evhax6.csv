I'm obsessed and it is all organised in one neat little app it's great.",False,False

I still think I’d be irrationally anxious if I wasn’t able to wear it tho bc I like knowing that I can know if I want to ya know",False,False

I use it to track steps and heart rate and all that. At first it helped me spiral into my ED. I tracked everything meticulously and reached all the daily goals and had a huge caloric deficit. But then about 6 months ago I started justifying binges and overeating with it. Like “oh well yesterday my TDEE was rly high” and stuff like that. These past two days I haven’t worn it just to see if I can avoid that mindset of “omg my TDEE is so high from all the steps! I should probably feel really weak and crappy right now so I should definitely eat more!”  So far so good. I feel naked and weird without it and I keep reaching for my wrist to readjust it but it’s not there.  However, not seeing what my TDEE is actually has thrown me out of the mindset I was getting stuck in.",False,False

Whenever I turn it toward me it shows me how many ‘active’ calories I’ve burnt that day, and my goal is always to burn at least 550. It’s so enabling of my ED it’s unbelievable. If I haven’t met my goal for the day I will jump around my home til it tells me I’ve met the goal, which can sometimes take a really long time. I also have a lot of time-based anxiety, and having the current time so accessible helps and hurts in different ways.",False,False
