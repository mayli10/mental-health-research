I think it's mostly based on your mindset at the time, but it also took 45minutes-an hour to drive to my school every day, so that was two solid hours I couldn't eat, plus if I didn't want to eat for the day I didn't have to because my parents assumed I got food at school. meaning I really only had one meal, dinner, and maybe a granola or protein bar as a snack mid day if I needed it.",False,False

When I stay at home (my school is in a different city than my parents and I live there) I have to take care of myself and there are so many ways I can get food in just a couple minutes. Tina of restaurants within walking distance, cheap delivery options through UberEats and SkipTheDishes, and I live next to a mini grocery store/convenience store with a restuarant in it. Literally 75m from the entrance to my apartment is the grocery store. I just have no excuse not to eat when I'm hungry. I suppose that's a good thing though since I'm not supposed to lose weight again.",False,False

For instance, at my first college there was a single stall bathroom sort of hidden away in one of the dining halls that I would use, as well as a single stall bathroom across from an almost always empty study room (with vending machines) in my dorm. On the flip side, when I'm doing better, the structure and engagement of academics keeps me doing well, in part because I value my cognitive ability and academic performance to a probably unhealthy extent, and the things that would have made ED stuff worse don't affect me as much if I have some stability.",False,False

Routines and schedules make meal times easier to skip and I blame it on being productive. Am I still pounding coffee and snacks in the library at 11pm though? And drinking at Thursty Thursdays?Absolutely. I find parking far away from campus gives me extra steps though and sometimes Iâ€™ll go up and down the staircases during my breaks for mini exercise.,False,False
