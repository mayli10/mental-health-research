People can't control their initial reactions when their shocked or something makes them feel gross or uncomfortable and generally that's how people feel about fat people. I make people uncomfortable I remind people of what they DONT want to be. I'm an example of how to mow love your life. And although I know my body is not unpleasant for the most part. When I get stink face at the beach... When people make a grotesque face and stare at my body parts when people talk about my body when I can hear it. Yeah. Makes me feel not good. Don't get me wrong. It's not like I don't have a good handle on this shit. You don't get to 25 yrs old and not develop a thick skin to bullys but STILL UGJJ WJJYYYY,False,True

This type of behavior is what has made me an asshole to these people. I *will* get up in their face now and ask them if we have a problem. People don't expect that shit and they cower away. Try it sometime. I'm not a fighter, I'm a lover. I always have been. I've always been that person that sticks up for people, protects them, and is their friend when no one else will be. I can't *stand* these jerks. You know what? Next time it happens, tell that bitch that you can always change your weight but she can't change her nasty disgusting ass attitude. Say it with vigor.
