I have a very square type of body and even at my thinnest I never had that ‚Äòcinched‚Äô waist look. What always makes me feel better is knowing that (bad as it sounds) tons of the most visually desired women aren‚Äôt hourglass. I mean, look at Mila kunis, Natalie Portman, Adriana Lima (and most of the vs angels tbh) and while skinny / super toned none of them are classic hourglass. As cliche as it sounds, acceptance is the best in this situation since you can‚Äôt change your bone structure.",False,False
