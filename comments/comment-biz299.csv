I make a big deal of creating a meal in front of my parents and my brother, then go upstairs to eat it (I basically live from my room so it's not weird, I eat everything up there). Then I C&amp;W into a small bag, and drink a hot drink while I'm doing it so my stomach doesn't feel empty and I feel somewhat satisfied. Then about an hour later I'll walk my dogs and secretly drop off the bag in the trash can at the end of my street.    Cravings are satisfied, and then any tiny amount of calories ingested is worked off by the walk.",False,False
