I thrive on routine and structure and self-soothing rituals... And now because of my ED diagnosis, it‚Äôll likely complicate obtaining such diagnosis because professionals could use it as a scapegoat for my behaviours üôÉ  !!!even tho!!! these needs have always been present and I‚Äôve been hysterical since I slungshot into this shitstorm we call humanity lmfao",False,False

Really takes a mental toll on people. It's so scary to think that we only have a switch which is extreme and if we are ever gonna have balance in our eating habits. It's horrific.,False,False

Any ‚Äúreasonable‚Äù way of dieting just doesn‚Äôt seem to work for me, or if it does I just lose ‚Äúmotivation‚Äù. It feels like my eating is controlled by a switch where if I‚Äôm not actively restricting I‚Äôm automatically binging :(",False,False

If I didnt have body image issues and lived with the IDGAF mindset I know for sure I would be fat by now. I could eat several portion meals in one go and still want more. I get full but not satisfied. If I wanted to gain 20kg by the next week it'd be no issue.,False,False

Like I already had an ED, just one that made me binge every day, so I feel like I genuinely can‚Äôt lose weight if I‚Äôm not severely restricting",False,False
