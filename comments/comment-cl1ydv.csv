In reality, everybody's metabolic physiology varies based on a number of variables outside of the CICO principle. Its hard to study ""starvation"" because it is not ethical, but your body will not behave the same in a starved state as it would in a fed, calorie-deficit state. I won't get too much into it, just take what Reddit has to say about weight loss with a grain of salt.",False,False

However, I've recently stumbled on the science behind intermittent fasting and/or ketosis, and now that it's been proven to me by the scientific data I'm very optimistic (because otherwise I'm back to feeling completely defeated).  Essentially, this doc claims that caloric restriction for maintainable weight loss is a farce because it ignores the hormonal responses to eating certain foods.  https://youtu.be/7nJgHBbEgsE   I'm hopeful this will work for me because I can't handle this ED or being obese. In treatment, you may know they preach set point theory, and I was hopeful they were wrong. It turns out, according to this doctor, it's not wrong. He says caloric restriction results in temporary weight loss, but your BMR goes down to compensate and eventually bring you back to your weight. Talks about insulin and other hormones and such. It's a good watch if you like science.  Hopefully I can come back and report on some success from my trying to work around these hunger generating foods and eating times by trying out the keto and intermittent fasting.",False,False
