I find the idea of something growing inside me gross. I used to be very self conscious about my hips and boobs. I now wear very baggy clothes and am happy with my smaller boobs. I used to also be very uncomfortable with any form of jewelry and dresses cause it made me look womanly. After getting a less tradional haircut and some piercings I'm not so bad about feminine clothing cause the womanlyness isn't what stands out in my appearance. I'm very lucky that when I gained weight from my lowest my fat redistributed more into my thighs, butt and arms rather than my boobs and hips which makes me feel a lot better. I think probably because I gained some form of muscle for the first time in my life.",False,False
