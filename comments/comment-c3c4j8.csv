Probably two-thirds of my clothes went into the garbage or taken to Value Village.  I feel so much better now when I open my drawers.

I was happy to get to a smaller size but SO PISSED I couldn't fit in my clothes anymore. I stubbornly wore them until they were basically falling off of me.   I'm too scared to get rid of them because before things went downhill, I maintained about the same size for years. I still have trouble seeing that I've dropped like 3-4 sizes. I'm also terrified that getting rid of them will ""jinx"" me and I will get ""fat"" again.",False,False
