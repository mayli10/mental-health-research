I've had disordered habits for my whole life (I remember writing in my journal how many strawberries I was allowed to eat for breakfast when I was like, 10) but I didn't get ""bad"" until my 20s. When I was working three jobs I would usually only have a granola bar and dunkin donuts coffee or something from there during the day and I dropped a lot of weight. Now I live with my boyfriend and just have a lot of food control issues and restrict badly most of the time.  I think part of it might be growing up in a big family where everyone was heavy (I'm about half the weight of the next smallest person) and not wanting to be that way. Being skinny makes me feel special and different and clean and pretty and if I gain weight I feel gross and gluttonous and ugly. Also, controlling my intake makes me feel like I have control over everything. I restrict mostly when I'm stressed, and purge when I have anxiety.   Skinny has kind of always been my identity, and I don't feel like me if I'm anything other than underweight.",False,False

Some other contributing factors can be personality (being a perfectionist is a big one), other mental health issues such as anxiety, depression, compulsive behaviour, and like you mentioned - bullying and parental/family issues.  A common factor that can be seen with a lot of us is that we want some form of control over our lives. An eating disorder can be born out of a feeling of lack of control.  For me personally, I think it was always inevitable. I have a perfectionistic personality, my mum was always trying out crazy diet fads, talking about calories around me, and combined with being a particularly overweight kid and being bullied mercilessly, my eating disorder began at around age 10, and went from restricting to bulimia and back to restricting and just cycles on like that for years",False,False

While I was there one of the doctors told me I was overweight and one of my counselors explained her ~weight loss story~ to me, and once I got out I started dieting within a few months. I don‚Äôt blame them or anything, I was chubby and I had wanted to lose weight for a long time so I think I would have ended up doing it anyway, but I remember reacting angrily at one of the counselors who suggested I lose some weight by saying something like ‚ÄúWhat, so I can develop an eating disorder and be back here?‚Äù and she just shook her head, like she thought I was being silly. Lol, if only she knew.   Anyway, I started to lose weight in a ‚Äúnormal‚Äù way by having a healthy deficit, and it obviously worked - I felt great, and I lose 30 pounds doing until my BMI was healthy for the first time since I was like 13. Then shit kinda got fucked up - I went through a really, really bad spell with my OCD and I was so anxious I didn‚Äôt eat for 5 days, like pretty much at all. I wasn‚Äôt even hungry. When I stepped on the scale I had lost so much weight so quickly, and it made me feel awesome. Then of course I spent the rest of the summer over-eating and gaining weight, which made me feel like shit. I was 18 by now, and just wanted to be small and was tired of feeling like I had no control, so I started to restrict again, thinking that I could lose the weight I gained back in a ‚Äúhealthy way‚Äù. That quickly turned into 20k steps a day, eating 800 calories, obsessing over everything, and even though I got back down to the weight I used to be comfortable with, suddenly it wasn‚Äôt nearly skinny enough.  Fast forward a few months of doing this, I‚Äôm working at a restaurant and my co-workers are also commenting on how shaky I am, and I almost pass out during one of my shifts because I hadn‚Äôt eaten and refused to. It, along with the general stress of the job, started to build up and I quit without notice, ‚Äòcause I‚Äôm that person.
