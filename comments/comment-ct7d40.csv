I can reassure you that they did not mean to hurt you whatsoever, but when it comes to eating disorders, most people are painfully ignorant, and they can inflict this pain upon others without being aware of this. But oh gosh what a frustrating situation! He should have shut his mouth and keep eating. They probably made those comments and forgot about them in the next second. Don't let their poison reach your heart. Just remember that you know yourself the best, you know what's happening, you know how it feels. Your friends don't. I'm terribly sorry you had to go through this :(. I hope you remember that you are strong and beautiful and above their ignorant words! Don't go down to their level. I'm sending you all of my love and I hope you will be alright ♥ !",False,False
