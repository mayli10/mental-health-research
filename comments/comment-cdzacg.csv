I'm not even kidding, I literally just got done watching an episode a few minutes ago. I'm only on episode 3 but it's officially my new guilty pleasure, though the way the diets are set up seem a little sloppy.   While on the topic, am I the only one that thought the girl in the second episode was in her 20s and was hella taken aback when they said she was only 14?",False,False

Sometimes its just focusing on calorie counting and healthy alternatives, ok. one episode they said no coffee or tea at all, even though it wasnt a problem for them or anything. why? thats just removing an appetite suppressant?? plus there was the episode where they made them juice two meals (terrible idea when youre trying to lose weight for the first time) and i hate the narrators accent so much.  otherwise i really enjoy it though lol",False,False
