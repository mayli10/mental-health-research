I'm surprised I don't regret it or anything.

It may be higher calorie, sure, but burger ingredients like beef and cheese really pack in the bioavailable forms of vitamins A, D, E and K, which are all important for bone-, skin- and heart-health.    You absolutely will not gain weight or get fat from one meal.  I might recommend not weighing yourself for a day or two afterward if you can to let your body process everything through first.",False,False

I try to have one day every week where I eat what I want. The problem with that is that i usually dont want to eat when that day comes around lol but i have been trying to push my calorie limit on that day every week. I have been in low restriction though so it's just difficult even on that one day.,False,False

I'm still not at the weight I'm cutting to, but four days ago, I went to a place that's pretty famous in Boston (@waypointharvard on Instagram - also foodporn). I split a couple dishes with my boyfriend, including a burger and fries, which I'd been craving for MONTHS. It was so good, and I had some other dishes, as well as ice cream afterwards. I estimated eating around 3500 calories that day.  Anyways, I went right back to 1200 - 1400, didn't do anything further to compensate for the extra calories, and my weight is actually a little lower than before the burger day. I wholeheartedly support you enjoying the damn burger.",False,False

You get to eat the thing you‚Äôve been craving and then get back on track. You will gain water weight and you will gain food weight. This can last for a few days or even a week, but it‚Äôs *not* real fat. You can let yourself enjoy this and have a positive experience!   Sometimes I feel like if I treat myself to one thing I‚Äôve been really craving it saves me from having a blowout on something I don‚Äôt even want. Enjoy yourself!",False,False
