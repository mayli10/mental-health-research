It's true that bodies sometimes don't burn as much as we think they will, sometimes they burn more or less because of a million tiny factors we can't be aware of, but thermodynamically that is the conversion. And there's no way that any number of internal processes or body trickery would total 30,000+ extra calories. Like even if your TDEE was zero idk how anyone could accidentally hit that number.    Also you're not dumb or needy. This IS really scary and you're dealing with a lot. Any one of us would spiral, EDs are a huge bitch. Reaching out for help was the correct thing to do. I'm happy I can help &lt;3",False,False

I feel kind of dumb now. I can’t think straight or logically when I’m panicking like this so I know I sound dumb and this is common sense. I’m just finding the so hate to understand it isn’t genuine weight gain. Our bodies are weird and don’t always follow the rules they should. And I think my high restriction for the last 5 months has messed my body and metabolism up a bit too though. But your comment has caused me to pause for a second and stop spiralling, so thank-you! I know I seen needy lol. This ED shit got me fucked up.",False,True
