I’m so sorry you feel ashamed of your actions (I don’t think you should, this is a sickness, not a lifestyle choice!) but it might help to share that fact as well. This isn’t an uncommon issue amongst the population and I’m sure that’s true for most therapists, so try to imagine from their perspective; you’re not going to be judging someone opening up to you and asking for help with something they feel anger and shame over if you’re a decent person!!  So if you trust/like your therapist, I’d share it all. I’m rooting for you!! Stay hydrated and make good decisions!",False,False
