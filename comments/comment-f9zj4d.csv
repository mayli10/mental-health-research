It's like any other lifestyle. There are vegan junk foods as well as whole foods and you can make your calories as high or low as you could as an omnivore. If you really want to go vegan/vegetarian while being recovered just replace what you currently eat with the veg equivalent. If you're already thinking of ways it will help you to reduce calories or be cleaner/healthier just hold off. It's not worth falling down that path and it will make it harder to go veggie when you're more fully recovered.,False,False

It’s not good for me to have to plan everything out all the time and to not be able to eat at social functions, not having cake if someone is bringing it etc.  Being vegetarian however works pretty well for me and is very separate from my eating disorder. It’s so easy for me to avoid meat in my life and I’ve honestly never even connected it to my ed. That’s just my experience though, it’s very different for everyone:)",False,False
