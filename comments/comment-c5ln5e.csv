Instead of it being a streak where you are returned to day one, think of it like a test. Each day of the month or even the year is a different question. Today, you got one ""wrong"" (not trying to shame or anything I just mean in terms of the broken streak) but you still have 6 or 7 other days that are ""right"" and each day you dont binge or purge is a higher percentage on your test.   Anyways, great job on resisting the purge! I know how hard that is so I'm really proud of you",False,False
