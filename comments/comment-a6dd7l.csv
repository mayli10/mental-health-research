It's form of interacting with narcissistic personality types and abusers. You practice a flat face and show no emotion. Eventually they get tired of you or are less likely to Target you because what they want is your emotions. They want you to love them or be angry with them. But they are insecure and they want your attention. So you just don't give it to them. It's ok if you mess up in the beginning because eventually you get the hang of it.
