Like yeah, when you have an ed, you cope in really unhealthy ways that damage your body. That’s why it’s a disorder. But it’s because that’s what I feel I have to do. My brain tells me to starve myself and that I’m a failure if I eat. The coping comes because of my feelings. People usually say something like this to me when I say I’m afraid to get better because I don’t think I’ll ever stop feeling this way. So maybe everyone feels insecure sometimes, but that’s not what I’m afraid of. I’m afraid of living with the voice screaming at me every time I eat or think about eating. The voice that tells me that I’m worthless and need to move as much as possible to burn as many calories as possible so I won’t gain weight. Living with that and eating like normal people do sounds too hard. I don’t know how I’ll cope with it.",False,True

That’s really awful. I’m afraid to go to a psychiatrist honestly. I don’t want to take medication. So I stick with therapy,False,True

I’m sorry you heard this :( Your struggles are definitely valid and you deserve help.   When I was telling my psychiatrist about my body dysmorphia he did similar. “Yeah, but everyone has things they don’t like about their appearance”. I was like, okay but does *everyone* want to die over it? Does *everyone* spend hours upon hours dedicated to their flaws, obsessing and distressed and panicking? That seems abnormal to me. If they do though then fine, don’t help me. Leave me like this.   You’re right, it’s super invalidating and even if the intentions are to be helpful, it isn’t at all. What you’re going through is real and problematic even if others don’t see it as as big a deal as it is.",False,False
