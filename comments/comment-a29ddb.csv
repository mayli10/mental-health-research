Honestly, I've already eaten some things I didn't plan for. But I'm doing what I can to stick to my routine of safe meals. Also trying to stay hydrated and take my fiber supplements so my digestion doesn't get too thrown off. I'll still net more calories than I hoped for, but I'm hoping to be mostly on track again by tomorrow.",False,False

I binged yesterday for the first time in months and it scared me so bad. I spent months stuck in a binge cycle and it took me a long time to get out. But I did. And you can too.   Take really small steps and you will eventually get there. Drink one extra cup of water per day and work your way up. Plan balanced meals in your maintenance range and start by just preparing the easy parts. In several weeks, you can create a new 'normal' that doesn't involve binging.  The biggest thing for me was learning not to tear myself apart when I make a mistake. Two pounds over the weekend does not mean you will gain 20 pounds in a month. Try to forgive yourself for making mistakes. You are a strong and capable person and you will get through this. Draw a bath or do some skincare. Give yourself some TLC and start again tomorrow. Soon that binge that seemed so horrible will just be a distant memory.",False,False

Sometimes it helps me to put on some cozy pajamas, make myself some mint tea to settle my stomach, and then force myself to literally write down 20 things I love about myself. Try to focus on that list, read it out loud. might help to break the cycle of bad thoughts. Im out and about so I can't chat now, but maybe you could try a helpline or chat service? I've had some good experiences with them before.",False,False
