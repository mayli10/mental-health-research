I'd have two bowls of the shit for breakfast, a litre of fruit juice for a snack, went to Timmies for a panini and croissant with an iced coffee for lunch once a week, and homemade mac &amp; cheese (yes, really homemade! Hated KD) for dinner. Never made myself physically sick. I had no stop point. Now if I ate that much as omelettes, avocado, meat, fried mushrooms, my body just stops me when I've eaten enough. I've tried to binge (mostly to see if I could, not really for emotions or any real urge) but the dietary change I've made is like Vivitrol. It just blocks it.",False,False
