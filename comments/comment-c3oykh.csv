IMO, AFRID is the only eating disorder that doesn't seem like just a symptom of something else. Anorexia and bulimia almost always seem like a coping mechanism. If you brain is like, ""okay, we're gonna purge now"" that sounds to me like a compulsion. But I'd also bet OCD and ADHD have a high morbidity rate, which means the symptoms would definitely overlap. Unfortunately, mental illnesses are not black and white/cut and dry at *all*.",False,False

I""m super emotionally unaware though, so I might be wrong but in the year of therapy I had for my ED, I was never officially diagnosed with depression.   I mostly use my ED as a way to avoid sitting with uncomfortable feelings I think, and while I definitely feel worse when my ED behaviours get bad, and I definitely still feel a bit shit when they're going ok, I feel like I dodged a bullet (maybe ! honestly though I don't know what I'm feeling half the time !!)",False,False

I think my ed responds more to when im nervous or anxious about something rather than depression.
