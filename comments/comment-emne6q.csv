I think I had a moment of clarity from the pot because when I took off my clothes I just cried when I saw my body, I hardly recognized myself.

I had been holding off weighing myself until January 10th so I wouldn't stress the holidays as much (I may have broken it last week, but we won't talk about that). So I weighed myself before the bath and was super happy with what I saw for like a minute and then I felt like shit about the fat on my body.   After the bath (which was lovely and calming) I started cooking dinner and I think the combination of not eating in 24 hrs, smoking, taking a hot bath, and then standing for 1 1/2 fucked me up. I started feeling faint and had to sit down. This has happened before, but only when I was alone and my partner had come home by this point so they saw it all. I tried to downplay it, but I was a little scared for a moment. But I managed to eat a bunch of dinner and went to sleep. I woke up fine today so who knows lol",False,False
