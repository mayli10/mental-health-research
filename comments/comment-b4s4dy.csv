I've noticed my binging tends to be the most triggered by anxiety/stress and feeling overwhelmed or like there's too much work to get done and not enough time. It might just be the placebo effect and I'm still in the adjustment period, but it seems like the medication has helped dampen those feelings and put more space between my negative feelings and how I choose to act in response, if that makes sense? Before I would feel extremely stressed out and I had this sense of urgency that I NEEDED to binge RIGHT NOW on ALL OF THE FOOD, whereas now the stress itself doesn't feel as great and there's less urgency which lets me ride out the binge urge a bit more easily. I've also noticed that now when I do end up going over it doesn't tend to be as intense, I don't feel as bad about it afterward, and it's easier for me to get back on track the next day.  So I would say I'm seeing positive results but I would think the results may depend on your reason for binging in the first place. I was a binger before I was a restricter, so I think that tackling the anxiety that my binging is rooted in is helpful, but if you're someone who didn't binge normally but started to in response to restricting then I'm not sure it would be as helpful since the anxiety/depression isn't what's causing it in that case. But that's just speculation and you should definitely seek out resources if you need help. Best of luck!",False,False

Iâ€™ve been on 7 or 8 different ones and some of them killed my appetite, some made me binge and some had no effect at all. The drowsier ones are definitely more likely to cause bingeing/overeating, i.e. tricyclics like clomipramine, amitriptyline, etc. I was on mirtazapine (a tetracyclic) and holy sh*t I could not stop eating. I actually refused to take paroxetine despite my OCD being quite bad because Iâ€™d heard itâ€™s very similar. Right now Iâ€™m on Venlafaxine and it doesnâ€™t affect my appetite too much - if anything it decreases it a bit but thatâ€™s a very common side effect of this particular medication",False,False
