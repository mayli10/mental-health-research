I mean, what if she is intentionally adding more calories than she is letting on.  Also, if you already told her to not mention carbs and calories around you and she doesn't respect that boundary you should really reconsider that friendship.  I've had disordered thoughts about feeding everyone around me so I don't have to feed myself, or everyone gaining weight while I get thinner, but going from that to actually do it...its just **wrong**.",False,False
