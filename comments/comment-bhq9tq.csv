I guess that made it seem normal to not come regularly, and it slowly trailed away. I haven't had it in around 4 months now.",False,False

It just didn't turn up in March and seems like I won't turn up in April either. I'm not even underweight so just don't really know where it's gone. I know I'm not pregnant and I did a test in March and I'm gonna do another one tomorrow (my bf wants me to). I've had regular periods for the last 10 years until now.,False,False

When I was younger they were awful, which was why I got on birth control in the first place. I'm not exactly mad about not having it but I definitely have it in the back of my head that it's not ok.
