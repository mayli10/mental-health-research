Like there's a beautiful, sexy girl on r/petitegonewild and people will start telling her she's too thin and should it a burger, but she actually doesn't look too thin or thinner than other people on this sub. It makes me even madder when people say it in real life. People are making comments when  they think you're  too fat, but when you lose weight, ""you look too thin"" and ""oh you're eating a pizza?  you should eat two!!""... like.. hell?! You can't make it right for them and all you want to be is perfect but people keep criticising everything until your behaviour is disordered, but then you should just fix it, and be normal. Like... just fuck off!",False,False
