I'm kind of afraid of that as I have no idea what they'll think about this and I don't want them to put me on a diet that makes me gain even more weight lol (shocker).  Honestly I think i'd be feeling just fine if I was at a healthy weight, I think i could come to a peace with myself and my body as I'm an active person that enjoys just having a healthy balance in life (outside of the disordered habits). The biggest problem are the binges, if those didn't come around I'd be able to work on my actual relationship with food and my body, I'd feel at peace knowing I'm eating with balance (as in not only ""health food"" but a good mix of all things) and exercising in a sustainable way. But those damn binges man, I literally feel like a junkie needing a heroin fix or something. I haven't heavily restricted in a long time, as I've said i sometimes wish I could as I used to but I haven't really acted out on this in over a year. Last year I was really controlling of my food but I didn't loose so I wasn't really restricting or I would've gained weight, I kept a healthy BMI all year. This year as I've said I've been trying to loosen the grip around the control, challenging my rules. But that kinda means that when I'm not bingeing I'm eating good, so it makes me so friggin angry and sad everytime I binge because it's like.. why? Why do they happen, and then I feel gross and I wish i really could just get a grip on myself and starve myself until all the excessive fat is off. Rarely do I really do anything, I usually try to stick to eating well anyway but I do get very fixated on how I look because of the binges, they make me feel extremely anxious about what I'm doing to my body and how it looks.",False,False

It also sounds really unsustainable and I think you are not far off hitting a breaking point.   Part of the problem seems to be that no matter what your behaviours are or how your disorder is manifesting, you are hyper-focused on your diet and your body. Obviously this is normal for people with eating disorders, but do you find it’s detracting attention from other areas in your life, or even causing you to pull away from your hobbies and responsibilities?   Putting some time aside to try to really focus on other things and spend time outside of your disorder would at the very least give you a reprieve from all this negative energy you’re experiencing, and may eventually provide a path to healthy, sustainable recovery that you’re comfortable with.

I don't think I want to all out relapse, but even when I was at a healthy bmi last year I wasn't happy I was restricting and keeping a close eye on what I was eating and exercising to help counter the binges, I've only been happy when I was at my lowest weight. Since last year I've tried to loosen my grip and stop feeling so in need of control but it has just left to me bingeing more often and on even worse junk which has made me gain and it's making me feeling horrible. I wish I could say I now have more control over my eating again because I don't want to get fat so I'm not gonna let myself overboard but the cravings and the urges continue to get the better of me.",False,False

Something that really worked for me with binging was planning them in advance. I haven’t lost control around food in almost eighteen months since I started doing that, because I know 1) the food is coming, I just have to wait and 2) I ate so much during the last binge that I need to restrict right now to undo the damage (spoiler alert: this is 100% driven by the fear of getting fat, haha).   I don’t think you need to feel shallow about your feelings around getting fat. It comes back to control as well: you want to feel in control of the meat suit that you wear to keep you alive. I’m terrified of gaining weight, and not just out of my need for control: I like the body I have now and hating my body was exhausting. I expended so much energy on hating my body I had barely any left for anything else.   I suppose I would ask you what happiness looks like to you when you envision it.  Do you want to recover? Do you want to get down to a certain (healthy or unhealthy) weight and maintain there? Or do you want to relapse (no judgement here if that’s your honest answer)?   Clearly you’re unhappy with your current situation but trying to change will just be flailing in the dark unless you can identify your goals.   If it helps at all: for me, I’ve reached a weight I’m happy with and I want to maintain within a couple of pounds of here. That requires a certain amount of disordered eating, which I’m comfortable with. Recovery for me would just be a loosening of the rigid grip of control my disorder has on every aspect of my life (fear of travel, panic around schedule changes, anxiety over food plans going wrong, etc). For me it’s all mental. ",False,False

So yeah, I want to have control over my eating because I'm getting fat but then food has become a way for me to cope with anxiety and cravings and all the negative thoughts in my head, it's a sweet release because food in my mouth tastes good so there's this constant battle between those two sides of me and the bingeing part of my brain is getting the better of me because of course.. we're still animals o some degree and food makes our brains go dingding! good job! so yeah. I'm loosing a fight i really don't want to loose but to which i feel powerless to actually stand up against.",False,False

It seems like something has triggered a reversal in your behaviour though; that you’ve gone from rigid control over what food you put in your body, to feeling out of control around food (thus the binging).   Just to tackle the binging itself for a moment: can you think where you feel the most in control around food? Is it in public, at restaurants, in the grocery store, at home? Because if you can identify that, it can help to cut the binge off at the root. For example, if you feel okay around food at the grocery store, but completely out of control at home, practice just not buying more food than you need for one meal at a time.   For the rest: is there anything that happened in your life around the time you switched from restricting to binging? Identifying that and trying to work on it might help more in the long term.

Are there other areas in your life where you feel like you have no agency, or feel directionless? Or maybe it’s the opposite, and you have rigid control over everything else, so you find yourself just giving up that exhausting grip on your life around food?   You’re right that it’s not recovery if it doesn’t come along with the intent to recover. The foundation of the disorder is the thinking that drives the behaviour, not the behaviour itself, and if you feel like a failure for eating then obviously the thoughts are still there.

When you’re avoiding a relapse, it means you’re actively working on your recovery and trying to create healthier coping mechanisms to deal with whatever underlying stress and anxiety caused you to develop your disorder in the first place.   When you’re unable to relapse, it means you’ve replaced one maladaptive coping mechanism with another (eg, binge eating) and that you’re still giving in to disordered thoughts, ie, I don’t deserve this food, this food is bad, I’m fat, I’m gaining too much weight, I’m disgusting, I have no control.
