I think this is what I’ll just have to do rather than expect him to just get it right off the bat. I’m glad your boyfriend was so kind! Thanks for the advice (:,False,True

He’s definitely interested in learning more but maybe I should just let it happen as things come and go. I love that you have such a supportive boyfriend! I definitely feel really supported by him and he treats me better than anyone I’ve been with. I hope that all continues to go well and thank you so much for the advice!,False,True

It upset me because he brushed it off as just eating but didn’t understand the mental anguish i was constantly going through. After a couple months he figured it out and he told me he’d support me no matter what. I’m in a sort of quasi recovery atm but he told me he’s really happy to see me eating more foods but if that’s not what I want he’ll support me if I wanted to lose weight again. I would just explain to your SO your thoughts about eating as they come up or if you go out for food etc. My boyfriend once saw that I was so uncomfortable with a restaurants menu and the calories listed on it he told me we could find another restaurant and we left. But he wouldn’t have understood that if I didn’t let him know what I was thinking.,False,False

I always thought Wasted was a pretty spot on explanation of what we go through.  If he’s not super intrigued about learning more, maybe consider that his view is not a particularly bad one. As long as he is supportive and is treating you right, what does it matter how he views your eating disorder?  My man doesn’t “get” my eating disorder. He has commented before about how he doesn’t understand why I can’t just use moderation instead of the binge/purge/restrict cycle. Maybe a person who hasn’t been here won’t ever understand. But, he still listens when I vent and tries to comfort and support me.",False,False
