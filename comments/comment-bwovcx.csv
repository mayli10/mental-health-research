I feel like my ED isn’t valid because I can’t restrict well. Having autism and sensory issues as a result of the autism doesn’t help my case at all.   I can’t fast at all because I’m on Venlafaxine which I have to take with food. I’d be fine if I was able to at least restrict heavily but no. I have to have some vanilla soy yogurt with it at the very least when I’m restricting. :( I know how you’re feeling and I know how awful it is. ❤️,False,False
