I find that if I work out religiously while low fasting I pass out WAY more easily and I find it to be relatively unsustainable because I’ll typically binge to compensate after a while.,False,False

I usually go around 4 ish days a week, and eat around 300-600 cals (the higher the cals burnt, the higher the cals eaten) and I haven’t passed out yet lol. If I don’t go to the gym I lower the cals eaten slightly or sometimes (try to) fast.",False,False

I know this is unsustainable I’m working on upping it this week. I hope you stay safe, and before I forget, another good thing if you’re going to be exercising is to keep glucose tablets on hand. They’re fast acting carbohydrates and they help if you’re lightheaded and need something to hold you over until you can eat. Be safe",False,False

I use exercise like purging, it’s really not healthy and I don’t have a healthy relationship with it. But ideally what you described would be what’s best if you’re wanting to keep active. My big issue is blood sugar and I faint easily. Eating frequently and exercising very lightly without specifically going for a number would be more sustainable and keep your energy up more than fasting then eating then exercising. I get the desperate state of mind too. I feel awful when I get really into the numbers of it.",False,False

I literally can’t fast because I have to exercise. I usually eat protein, but this whole week I’ve been restricting really hard (tw numbers) usually with around a 300-500 daily allowance burning 300 calories. Monday I did well. Tuesday I started having a chest pain about 250 calories into a (albeit intense) workout. I went really slow after that and burned 400. Wednesday I netted 200 because I really felt bad, I had work and didn’t want to pass out in front of coworkers, but I just felt clumsy and only could burn 200 calories and I was really slow about it. It’s really hard, and exercising while restricting means you really shouldn’t restrict like you want to. I’m really not wanting to offer advice but keep yourself from passing out by eating before you work out, before you stand for long periods, or walk a long ways. Even if it means small meals, work towards three per day. But working out so much is really not good in so few calories. Up your intake if you can.",False,False
