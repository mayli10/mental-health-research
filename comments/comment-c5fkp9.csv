I just finished a 50hr fast and while that's not much at all to some people, I honestly wouldn't have though I could've done something like that a year ago.  But thinking on it, it makes sense: I switched to keto like ~3 years ago and that was hard (and the least fun because god I miss carbs) but I got slowly used to it, then eventually did 16:8 intermittent fasting ~2 years ago which also was challenging at first but then became natural, then OMAD ~6 months ago which honestly fucking sucked and still sucks some days but now it's only somewhat-suck, and decided why not try going further? But yeah, I think it's the type of thing where you just really need to go one step at a time otherwise it's just so hard it's not very feasible.",False,False

I don't know how people here are actually able to fast for a long period of time. My stomach hurts so much.   It's almost 10am and I wanted to eat at 2pm. Now I am waiting 10 more minutes to allow myself a snack at 10am to take medication against a headache, because I can't focus on anything. But when I start eating now, I'll be hungry all day long.
