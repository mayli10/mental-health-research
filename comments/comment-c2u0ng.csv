I also would just like to say that weight gain does not always equal recovery, especially from a mental standpoint.

I agree, only she can make that decision, and I hope all the people saying she looks healthy dont trigger her into a relapse so soon, her health was definitely very bad when she started recovery and after only a few months she's likely not physically better. Although I will say, it's also likely that she's still underweight. Her face has always not necessarily ""matched up"" with her BMI and even when she was underweight (just not as much so as when she started recovery) her face looked like that of someone at a higher but still low weight.   I just hope she continues to have the strength to recover, and that her viewers on YouTube who also have EDs will be inspired and see how beautiful she is at a healthy weight.
