Symptoms will get better, but for that to happen, you’ve got to do your best to eat more frequently.  That being said, minimizing fiber and limiting fluids while eating can help you fill up slower. Also, try to distract yourself during and after meals. After you eat, a gentle walk can help digestion (just don’t push yourself. The idea isn’t to work out, it’s to get your digestive system moving).   There are medications that help increase stomach emptying, decrease bloating, or decrease nausea. Maybe talk to your dietitian about if anything like that would be appropriate?",False,False

You could try decreasing bloating by having cooked vegetable (not broccoli or cauliflower) an kinky dairy and fruit etc during the day until your digestive system recovers. Maybe try an IBS type diet and see if it helps? ,False,False
