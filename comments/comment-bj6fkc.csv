If I eat like shit/ especially if I eat a lot I feel like shit. If I eat healthy/intermittent fast/ just don’t eat a lot I feel like I can do anything. I feel light and sharp.,False,False

I am pretty sure that in my case it is mostly psychological: I have two different ""modes"" of existing: When I am in ""restricting mode"" I always feel like the best possible version of myself. I feel disciplined, clean, pure, perfect, and that enables me to be enormously productive. When I am in my normal eating mode, I feel pathetic and disgusting and have no motivation to do anything at all.    I guess that ketosis can affect your mental capacities, but if you substantially restrict for an extended period of time, it will definitely have a negative impact on your brain function. That is sadly just a fact. Your brain consumes an enormous amount of energy and if you don't give it enough to function, it has no other choice but to run in energy-saving mode.    My shrink always warns me that if I lose even more weight, my brain mass is going to decrease, and since I am an academic and am completely dependent on my brain functioning well, that is in fact a much more effective warning than telling me that I might never have children etc.",False,False

Fatigue is associated with the early stages of recovery but I figured I'd leave that out because OPs post seemed to ask in a more general sense and the recovery thing is very temporary.,False,False

There's definitely a sweet spot (if you can call it that) where hunger heightens everything in a good way. It can be a little euphoric. I've relapsed a few times and for me, there's always this honeymoon period where I feel amazing and full of energy — but after a few months, not so much. For me at least, sustained long-term restriction feels like shit...   I started experiencing massive fatigue and depression when I started refeeding. That's a thing, too. I think it has to do with the fact that your body is struggling to keep up with daily metabolic needs as it also tries to repair itself, etc. Probably also psychological, to some degree.",False,False

For as long as I can remember, eating even relatively ""normal"" amounts for my meals (like 4-500 calories per meal) made me feel so lethargic and ""blah."" I said this in a comment on another thread here before, but basically it seems like my body runs better on empty, so to speak. That's why my periods of eating at maintenance/""quasi-recovery"" never last very long, I think. Because even though I'm eating what should be a healthy amount for me, it makes me feel totally drained. I have no energy and it just feels like I'm in a fog. I feel like there must be something messed up about how my body is able to process food, or maybe certain types of foods, that leads to this.

Food tastes a lot better when you’re starving. I think I ate round 800kcal, but I’m still hungry af lmao.

I think OP may be experiencing some placebo. We all wish that restricting was healthier and improved our cognitive functioning, but I don't think there is really anything out there to support that.
