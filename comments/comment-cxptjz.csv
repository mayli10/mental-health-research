Most people don’t make it 3-4, the difference is perspective. Like, somebody who doesn’t suffer from an eating disorder would probably eat an entire horse after going 27 hours without food. Like, seriously, the things I’ve seen people eat after getting, say a colonoscopy is freaking insane. I digress, sorry about that.  I’m not sure if you’ve started recovering yet, or where you are emotionally. But from the perspective of somebody who’s recovered, 27 hours is a long time for anybody to go without food.   What you’re feeling is natural, you set an extreme goal and when you didn’t get to it, you broke down. It happens to everybody, and we all process and deal with it differently. I hope you have somebody close to you that you’re able to talk to. If not, I’d recommend a hotline because you seem to be taking this pretty badly. Good luck to you",False,False
