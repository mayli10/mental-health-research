Im also a lot shorter that I was supposed to be (5‚Äô2) which is sad. But the psychological effects of having an ED at that age are honestly devastating because I hated myself for YEARS even after I‚Äôd ‚Äúrecovered‚Äù officially and struggle with eating issues to this very second and it all just is terrible. I would def say that young teens are a super psychologically formative age and help dictate how you‚Äôll feel about yourself for a long time after you leave pubescence ‚Äî including literally what you wear, what kinds of guys you think you deserve / you allow to date you (read: not good ones bc self esteem so screwed I thought I would never be able to do better) etc ((all this is my experience))",False,False

And honestly, it was a matter of maintaining a BMI of 17 for about 4 years. Nothing fatal, but it was enough I believe. My height is significantly shorter than any of my close family members, and at 21, I have the frame of a 10 year old.... just throwing this out there in case validation is needed.",False,False
