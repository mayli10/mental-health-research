It's great to hear from someone who ""gets it"".  You are completely right about aesthetics vs. athletics. I'm glad you are attempting recovery. I'm sending good vibes your way and I hope you recover to live a happy life where your focus is you and not your ED &lt;3",False,True

I'm 5'3"" (recently lost an inch - raging). I was a (high level) figure skater in my childhood and teens, and a lacrosse player through uni and my twenties. I know ALL about the quad issue.   125lbs (which is 8st 13lbs) is where my recovery team are trying to get me to at the moment. And that's because that's where I managed to agree to. Its still not quite where they want - they'd rather another 5lbs or so, because it gives some wiggle room for when I inevitably go ""sod this"" and lose some of it.   125lbs / 130lbs is a pretty reasonable, if not standard weight for an our height. And even more so if its on an athletic body because its all tight and solid.   I promise you, your head is fucking with you and is ruining your sporting success. I'm going to be harsh and frank - you can have an ED or you can have sporting success. (as an aside, I watched an ITV short documentary last week about Fitbit and calorie counters and anorexia and one of the girls interviewed at one point in a background shot was wearing a hoodie from the most recent lacrosse world cup which was held in England. Guarantee she was a spectator watching friends or family or old schoolmates compete because she couldn't have lasted an hour on the pitch. Who knows if she could have been out there too?)   Anyway - my point - your overall weight is fine. I think you have an issue with its distribution /your proportions. Maybe speak to a strength and conditioning coach about rebalancing the power throughout your body? But stop fucking your chances of success. Either quit your sport and give it all over to an ED, or quit this shit and focus on your sport. Doing both at the same time puts so much strain on your body and opens you up to so much muscle and bone damage (plus heart damage!!) it's just not worth it.   Sorry for being a bit of an arse. Hope it helps   ",False,False
