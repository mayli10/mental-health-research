I figured out that 'meth addiction' quote and wanted to put it out there because its accurate, I went through a lot of diseases/disorders till I decided hah. I talk a lot, about anything and everything but jesus it's so scary with this.   It's weird to have something that I feel like I personally dont suffer from enough (thin enough, ya know) vs the panicked normalized reaction people seem to have. Not sick enough to be loved like that, but sick. It's safe to say my eating disorder has almost ruined my life. I'm tired.",False,True

It's so isolating really and truly. God bless both of our souls mate",False,True

My mom was talking about how she was 3 lb away from where she needed to be for some work wellness thing weigh in, which was a few days away.  My stupid ass said ‚Äúoh, just don‚Äôt eat‚Äù. You better believe I got a few blank stares... but 3 lb is totally attainable just through the laws of physics since you sometimes eat literally pounds of food, even if it‚Äôs like celery.

Jesus fuck I wish you were wrong but you aren't. it's so fucking true. literally the other day I was talking to my partner about it and how everyone reacts so poorly or in a nonhelpful way, and said that I wish I had a normal disease so people would know what to say.
