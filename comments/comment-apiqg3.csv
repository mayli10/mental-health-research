Sunday night it came to our attention that a clinician employed by Walden may be associated with an organization(s) with values that are contradictory to the values and beliefs of Walden Behavioral Care.  We have taken swift action and this person has been put on leave while we conduct a review.  Our mission is to offer a safe and nurturing environment for all individuals; all genders, ages, race and religious affiliations. We take great pride in our inclusive environment and we seek employees who believe deeply in our mission and share our values. There is no place for hate in our community.",False,False
