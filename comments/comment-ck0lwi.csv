Your body doesn't digest all the grains and the complex carbs don't cause as much of an insulin spike.   I'm also worried about diabetes and health in general sooooo this sort of thing is right up my alley!   And also part of the reason I had to get rid of the r/loseit sub... ""Why shouldn't I drink diet soda when it's 0 calories ðŸ¤ª""   There's more to health than calories and being skinny but whatever.",False,False

I literally can't convince myself to eat a whole serving of cashews even if it's in my budget these days, this would help so much. 12g of cashews isn't enough to be a snack, it's just enough to make you angry you don't get more cashews lol.",False,False

That said, different kinds of calories can certainly impact your satiety and nutritional status and hormones, making it easier or more difficult to sustain a deficit.",False,False

Our guts and metabolisms probably vary so widely that I have a feeling if you put two identical twins on the same strictly administered diet- same height, same weight, same caloric deficit- they would lose different amounts. Maybe not a huge difference, but still some. Just because of slight differences in metabolic processes, gut bacteria, and even hormones.",False,False

I think if a qualified nutritionist or dietician says something I previously believed to be untrue, well they probably know more than me on the matter and it would be pretty ignorant to say they're wrong just because what they're saying doesn't fit in with my personal worldview.  So i guess like I believe in CICO in general but it's not the hill I would die on. Obviously I don't know everything and if more qualified people than me say CICO is flawed than I'd believe them.",False,False
