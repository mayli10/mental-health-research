I've now had AN-R for close to a year and the compressed nerve has improved, the neuropathy improved slightly so that I am no longer in a leg brace, but I have almost no feeling in one of my feet and a low dorsiflexison score that has barely improved. I don't know if the osteopenia has improved as the DEXA scans are taken every 2 years if necessary (I think). I have osteopenia in L1-L4, my hips, and my left leg, which is the same leg that had the compressed nerve. My left leg also has the neuropathy, had the drop foot, and still has poor dorsiflexsion scores.   Disclaimer: My medical terminology/understanding is not great. I might have not used these terms correctly within sentences. I tried my best as a layperson with zero medical education.",False,False
