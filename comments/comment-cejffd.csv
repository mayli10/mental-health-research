I spent two years with chronic vomiting and it ruined my teeth. Now at 31, I am eating but I hate it so much as I can't seem to eat food that makes me feel good. Acid-forming foods taste good but they mess with my mind. I struggle to eat alkaline forming foods, this inhibits my serotonin levels and makes being happy difficult. I have thus put a lot of meaning on eating, and now I get so anxious about eating I starve myself for long periods of time then binge then feel manically sad. Oh well. All we can do is try our best every meal time.",False,False
