I saw a psychiatrist to finally address my binge eating and walked out with mood stabilizers to treat my? bipolar disorder? But to my surprise the mood stabilizers help. I was binging to cope with my unstable moods, but now that I’m properly medicated I’m binging a little less than usual. I’m still going to talk to my doctor about Vyvanse tomorrow morning (wish me luck!) but if you are bipolar, that could have a direct link to your ED behaviors. Talk it over with your doctor, but definitely bring up your desire to directly address your ED behaviors!",False,False

It's not perfect. I still struggle every now and then. I have bad weeks. But the ultimate truth is that it can and will get so much better if you just stick with it, even when there are lots of ups and downs, and you will finally give your pain the time, attention, and respect that you need to start healing.   I think sometimes we feel so raw and vulnerable, especially with eating disorder treatment, that when people don't immediately acknowledge what's happening with us it almost feels like an invalidation. It's like, it is so crystal clear to us that we're in total mental agony and dying from the inside out, we tend to think ""how could anyone not immediately see that amount of pain?! The only explanation is that it isn't real/that serious/no one believes me!""  But the truth is that we hold it together pretty damn well. Even in your post, you write about how intense your feelings were in such great detail, but you say you only gave your therapist an odd look. Part of our illness is being incredibly good at blending in and hiding our true thoughts, even when our insides are screaming.  The more you verbalise your experience and open up, the more you fight against that and let those feelings out into the open, you will edge towards a better place.   You'll always have a community rooting for you x",False,False

I was previously diagnosed w atypical ana but my new therapist/psych thinks it’s just “self destructive tendencies” and it just isn’t. Or i’m not doing a good enough job lmao,False,False

It helps for someone to help me to understand the process because I know nothing is instantaneous but I am frustrated with having to wait. Honestly if I could afford it I would check myself in someplace so I could be in therapy every day. But I digress.   I think I just needed something to make me feel like I don’t have to JADE (justify argue defend or explain) everything I think and feel and something to help me to trust myself that this is a good thing. It’s hard to logically understand something and still not be able to wrap the other (STUBBORN) half of my brain around this.   Honestly I never considered whether the ED would resolve if I took the time to find solutions to the other issues because I didn’t even start to realize I had been through so much trauma until probably ... last August? And it took my until February to leave my parents house and until NOW to finally go get help and honestly until now to realize how deeply affected I am by it all. Like I’m literally dying and my brain is saying “no this is good keep going!” and it needs to knock that shit off lol.   It’s hard to be patient and it’s hard to trust him and it’s hard to trust myself. I’m definitely not going to give up but I feel a little less lost now that I’ve read your comment. Words always sound better when someone else says them to you instead of you just saying them to yourself. Thank you so much kind human - I hope that you are well and I hope you know how much love this internet stranger has for you! Really though, thank you. I needed this.",False,True

Asking for a diagnosis as a way to feel validated is something you did to try to help yourself feel better, but it doesn't help you get to the root of the issue of why you feel that way in the first place, and telling your therapist your feelings directly would probably be more constructive for you.  The second appointment is definitely still in the ""getting to know you"" phase... ED diagnoses are complicated. A lot of the diagnosis comes down to how pervasive it is, how chronic it is, and whether or not it exists in the absence of other symptoms (for example, someone who is just too depressed to eat doesn't necessarily have anorexia, even if the behavior looks and sounds similar). He is still getting to know you and trying to understand how all these symptoms fit together - if the bipolar (or whatever the primary diagnosis ends up being) is treated, will the ED behaviors get better on their own, or is it a standalone addiction? It's complex. You are a complex person.   It's clear that you're struggling immensely. You have been through so much and it has had a very real, valid impact on you. In my opinion, the exact words we use to describe that suffering are rather superfluous... At the end of the day, our mental illnesses can make it seem like it's important to get that ""stamp of approval"" of a ""good"" mental diagnosis, but what truly matters is the person underneath all of that and where the root of those problems lie.  I'm really proud of you for getting into therapy even though it's hard. The first few months are always kind of awkward and rocky. Don't be afraid to voice your feelings and if you don't feel like your needs are being met. Getting open and honest can yield so many results.  Keep at it. You can do this.",False,False
