You can infer a lot more about somebody from their bmi than from their weight alone.   Personally I feel like people with eating disorders are very data-driven, and I don’t feel like I have a complete picture of a situation unless I have all the data. I much prefer talking in terms of bmi than weight.   Also I feel like it’s kind of an equaliser. I know taller people often feel inadequate because their numbers are higher, but it doesn’t mean shit that you weigh 110lbs and your friend weighs 90lbs if you’re 6’0” and she 4’3” or whatever.",False,False
