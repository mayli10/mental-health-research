The alcoholism, introspective thinking, the nihilism, the feeling of a life lived and wasted, the overall sense of defeat and the ability to function in a challenging work environment with a high level of Alcohol dependency while suffering from Anorexia.  I just wonder sometimes and I just wanted to ask the group.   Do you feel of all the issues people experience with gambling, drug addiction, alcoholism etc. Are acceptable as plot devices or song lyrics.   Eating Disorders on the other hand are treated still as a taboo subject in the main stream media and if included in or as part of the overall story arc, are generally portrayed in a subliminal manner or never addressed directly in the media in which it is portrayed.
