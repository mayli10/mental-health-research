Now I don't get hungry like I used to, been restricting too long, my body doesnt even acknowledge hunger, so when the existentialism creeps upon me (I swear mine is from hormones, i mean i barely get my period but the hormones are still around I guess) I look for other ways to punish myself, gymming harder sometimes helps, mostly just wish i could sleep until it passes, ive been considering self harm lately and havent done that in years.
