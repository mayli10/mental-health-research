I don’t know what your environment is like when you’re eating but try to focus on literally anything BUT the food. Sometimes i find myself going through my meal later and subconsciously counting so once i realize i’m doing that i start singing a song out loud so i can’t. good luck my friend ,False,False

It’s mostly automatic estimates, I’d prefer to measure precisely, but either way I tack on extra ‘to be safe’.  I’m not sure there is an easy answer to this. From my experience, the hard answer to meeting these kinds of goals is consistency. If your goal is not to count calories, you need to figure out a plan that helps you stick to it despite the anxiety it causes. Maybe you can’t help automatic estimates, but you can refuse to add them up. And plan things to distract yourself when anxiety makes you want to add anyway. Something that makes you happy? Meditation? Make notes for yourself to read before adding?  Sorry if that isn’t helpful, it really is a challenge.  It I find making a plan to deal with the anxiety to help me be most successful when attempting do do something that scares me.  All the best!",False,False

Its even worse because it could be a peach and I would think its 100 ""just to be safe"" and eat even less the rest of the day because of that",False,True
