The menu is really just a list of suggestions, they’ll make you whatever you want.",False,False

Maybe a hard boiled egg somewhere if possible, and the dark purple cabbage bits to make it look like it’s not just lettuce. If someone says anything just be like I am trying to eat healthy and clean and there aren’t many clean options here... that’s what I’d probably do. I don’t think that looks too weird. As much variety as you can muster and nobody will really think about it, I used mustard and a tiny bit of ketchup to look like thousand island dressing and stuff. Dressing is loaded with calories... and you could have crackers and things piled around.  After you are done, dip em in the “dressing “ make it appear a bit sloppy and half eaten. Really nobody will notice as long as you don’t seem nervous. I love water and lemons because it gives the appearance of leftovers. Remember people don’t know much about calories generally and the ones who do won’t likely bother you because they are too busy counting themselves. It’s the illusion of volume you need.  As far as anxiety, I just take small bites and look down. I can’t stand people watching me eat. It’s horrible. Maybe talk more... I drink a lot of water. I don’t know. I usually ignore everyone at the table to get through those things.    I sometimes refuse to eat a lot and get tiny portions and it’s annoying when the hostess tries to give me food. I get so anxious that I start to feel bloated and my back gets so rigid from the anxiety. Just keep in mind it’s only an hour or so and then they will forget. So try to relax. Sometimes I’d order some fish fillet with lemon and a baked potato, the fish is easy to get down with anxiety and quickly and people expect you to leave a potato skin, depending on how it’s served you wouldn’t have to eat it all.  This is probably disordered as hell because I’m pretty bad right now, I hope it helped though and good luck with your dinner.",False,False
