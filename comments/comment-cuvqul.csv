If you like tea, see if they have Oi Ocha there! It was my favourite thing to drink when I visited Japan, and I always buy a bottle (... Or ten) when I shop in an asian grocery store in my city! There's 0 sugar or any kind of sweetener in it, so all you get is the clean, refreshing taste of the tea! It's heavenly, haha.  As for food proper, check out their produce section! In my experience, a lot of asian grocery stores have really amazing and affordable produce. I like getting king oyster mushrooms especially, since they cost an arm and a leg elsewhere but are usually really well priced at these shops! Also, if they have yu choy, definitely get that. Sauteed (using a tiny bit of cooking spray instead of oil) with garlic and a splash of soy sauce? Chef's kiss  Although I suppose I should ask if you're looking for pre-packaged things or if you'll be cooking for yourself? Since everything I mentioned (minus the tea) requires cooking, haha.",False,False

I eat a bowl with chopsticks and it pretty much takes me an hour to finish lol. Nice with salt and very filling.   Pocky, yum, prepackaged and 40g to a serving. I usually get strawberry so I can feel like a cutie anime girl.  Oolong tea (which is partially oxidized green tea) is said to boost metabolism more so than green.  I also like roasted, seasoned seaweed, omg sooo good! Low cal and to me, it’s a good sub for chips. Be warned tho, if you eat too many your farts will stink like the bottom of the sea.   These snacks are all pretty mainstream now and can be found at most grocery stores, just so’s ya knows :p",False,False
