I'm also 5' 9"". I was 5' 7"" in high school and then in college I grew a bit more (and my mom said girls stop growing in their teens.... not always true). I used to have terrible posture because I didn't want to look so tall and I slouched. A lot of boys that were my height were older than me, and boys who were my age were shorter than me. I was way too insecure about my height to wear heels. Ugh and all my pants were always short cuz my mom insisted that American Eagle was ""too sexy"" and ""too expensive"" to order longer sizes from. It has always been hard to shop for skirts and dresses (legs for dayz), so I have embraced the under skirt gym short aesthetic ;)   After college I moved to a country where the average height for men is shorter than I am now. If I see someone who is taller than me, I'd bet money they are a foreigner. My husband is really short, even for here. But once I realized that statistically speaking, most potential partners in the world were going to shorter than me, I stopped worrying about it.   If you have ever feel like a fish out of water, try to meet up with some Scandinavians or serious athletes—you'll find a lot of tall, sexy women there. The only time I was the shortest woman around was when I was on a random ferry with a bunch of Dutch tourists. I used to work with a woman who was like 6' 1"", and she was really athletic and had giant hands, not a skinny stick at all, but she modeled in local shows and magazine shoots a few times a year and she looked gorgeous.   That said, here are some perks that I really like about being tall:  * I can always reach things on the top shelf at the grocery store or book shop.  * People think I have answers to things. I literally get asked for directions several times a week. * Despite living in one of the world's most violent non-warzone countries, I have never been mugged (I really believe it's cuz I'm taller than potential bad guys). * I get places faster cuz I can walk fast. Really great for when there is limited time to sightsee in a new city ;) * My husband and I think it is really cute when we see another couple where the girl is taller than the guy. It's especially adorable with old people (google a pic of Julia Child and her husband and tell me they aren't adorable). And if you watch the Oscars, you'll usually spot more than one couple like that on the red carpet (all those avg height actors + model combos). * I can eat more calories than short people because my body's BMR is higher. Pass the cookies and hold the jealousy! ;)  * Being taken seriously when I was a teen. This doesn't matter as much now, but I think I got a lot more respect from adults when I was a teen because I could look them in the eye. * It's easier to find someone or something in a crowd. It's also easier to be found. * I always look a bit slimmer than I really am, thanks to body proportions.   You're right, you might never feel petite and protected unless you get with Hagrid. But personal style can help you look and feel more feminine if that is what you are after. Otherwise, I'd start reading some feminist empowerment books to help you grow past that mindset ;)   Both Michelle Obama and Melania Trump are 5' 11"" and I'd guess their height has only served them well in life.",False,False

Part of my motivation for weight loss is to appear taller. This girl in my jiu jitsu class asked me how tall I was last week and when I told her, she said, “Whoa I thought you were waaaay trapper! It must be because you have such a lean frame and long legs.” I would’ve married her if I swung that way and she wasn’t the girlfriend of the jiu jitsu instructor lol. I wear monochrome to appear taller. I wear heels so frequently my husband is shocked by my height when I wear flats. I spend hours sifting through high fashion model photos as thinspo longing for those long thighs that look straight.  I will volunteer as tribute to take your inches. To cure myself of my Napoleon complex, you goddess.",False,False
