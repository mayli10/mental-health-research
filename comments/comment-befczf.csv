My piano teacher always complimented me on how big they were (and I immediately inwardly cringed and wanted to die) and they stay around the same size regardless of whether I’m UW or N. Unless I’m retaining water for some reason (usually due to drug abuse), then they explode lol. But anyway, I don’t think finger size defines frame size. Just another one of those rando weird human body things.",False,False

I wear a 6 ring and I'm obese. Just like some people have bigger feet, some people have longer/thinner fingers. It isn't something people notice unless you bring it up.",False,False

Malnutrition and electrolyte disturbances are both things that lead to retaining fluid in the hands and feet, making them larger.  My own ring size is a 7 when I’m being relatively healthy, but between a 8 and 9 when I’m on my bullshit.",False,False

For example, some people have larger hands/shoulders/etc. and smaller feet, and some people have smaller hands and larger feet/shoulders/etc. It could be that you have a smaller frame overall but just have larger hands.",False,False
