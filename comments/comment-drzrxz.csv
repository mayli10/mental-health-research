Try bringing your own foods to things and say you're saving up. I found this helped with controlling what I actually ate. For restaurants, I looked up things beforehand and tried to get salads with dressing on the side and such.  &amp;#x200B;  It's very important to keep your friendships when you have an ED. I find the more I isolate myself, the more my ED takes over in ways I don't like. It has lead me to shame and bingeing. It has led to a life of hiding bc of feeling fat and trying to restrict, depression from hiding and being in my awful head too much, anxiety from when I do need to go out, and regret from losing my life to this.  &amp;#x200B;  If you can't get into a recovery program or are struggling with it, whatever you do, stay functional. Keep those normalities of work/school, a social life with friends and family, a hobby. Those are your lifeboats. Those are the things that will give you reason to move forward when your ED tries to drag you down.",False,False

Honestly it's a very delicate balance. I was able to maintain a slightly underweight BMI while still enjoying events with my friends, but it gets stressful. Right now I gained a bit because last month I have seen people quite often, and I'm trying to lose it. I'd love to lose a lot, so I can ""afford"" to go out :/ I really have no tips for you, but I'm in the same boat and I understand your struggle. Though I'll say that having friends might help you not get worse (or even help you get better !) which is a good thing, and something to hold onto.",False,False
