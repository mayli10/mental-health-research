I eat lots of carbs though. They help with my migraines. I definitely prefer starch over sugar, but any carbs will do. I think I might actually have the opposite problem where I don't get enough fat and protein because I eat so many carbs.",False,False

It's gross but worth noting when you cut down on calories it's easy for your system to get backed up. That's why ed memes often joke about having a bm ðŸ˜‚ With enough fiber though I don't hold on to all that and my weight goes down how I would expect it to,False,False

I avoided carbs like my life depended on it. Iâ€™d feel like absolute crap because I WANTED it so I would end up eating lots of my safe foods to compensate. One day I said sod it and had a slice of toast... and I was full. That was it, I was fine..??? All that time I could have just had it and nothing would have happened?? I could have saved myself so much stress.",False,False

Itâ€™s helped in regards to maintaining my body composition and optimizing energy usage over a long period of time. Not to mention, the education helped me chill the fuck out about food.   I really feel that personal education on nutrition is underrated in helping people with EDs. Yeah, everything is CICO for fat loss, but the nitty gritty macro/micro details affect so many other important aspects regarding oneâ€™s diet.",False,False
