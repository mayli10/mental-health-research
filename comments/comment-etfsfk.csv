I've gained and lost weight in between then and now, all unrelated to this medication (I take others as well) and due to eating better and binging less. It also works as a mood stabiliser for a lot of people, hence it being used in the treatment of anxiety, borderline personality disorder, etc, but for me it never worked this way. Just helped with the migraines in my specific case, no major side effects.",False,False
