Im sure you know the feeling, but sometimes it can be hard getting through the daily grind while always being tired and I sometimes do feel like there's just never a break or time when Im not on high-alert. I've never had insomnia but a few people that I know have said that it makes daytime functioning really difficult.    haha restrict/binge cycle of sleep is exactly how i think of it actually! Even during the days I'm more rested, I'll end up with almost no sleep the next day. I've talked to a few people (not sleep specialists, but mental health workers - psychologist, therapist, psychiatrist, etc.) and they all think that it has to do with traumatic childhood events that would happen at night but idk. I've also noticed that my nightmares do get more violent when im more stressed out, so that's probably something I should work on lmao",False,False

New LW, and I'm officially in the 20-BMI range.   I always thought that at or close to a 20 BMI would be the final stretch for me. That I would be near perfect, and I would be able to see that the 1.5 BMI points left were all I had to lose to look perfect.  So why the fuck do I barely look any different from when I had a 29 BMI? My arms are so fucking fat. My legs. Chest. Stomach. Back. Everything is so fucking fat still. I haven't want to dip my UGW under 98 pounds, but tbh, I might wanna shoot for like 88-90 because by then I'm sure I won't be as fat.  Anyway, I got two hours of sleep the day before yesterday, and last night I couldn't sleep again. I've never had issues with sleep two nights in a row. I'm so fucking tired but I can't sleep. My brain and heart just feel fluttery when I try.  And you know, I don't even feel like I accomplished anything because I've tried so hard in the past to starve myself only to binge and gain more weight, but all of a sudden, I'm eating 300 Cals/day now and I don't even feel like it's me doing the work. Like, I feel like there is hardly any drive or willpower involved. It's just kind of happening, ya know? I'm not even hungry all day, and I only eat those 300 Cals for dinner because I promise my boyfriend to eat everyday. And you know, it's also the fact that my body feels exhausted, but idk, I'm still walking to class just fine. I feel mostly functional at least.  I knew weight loss wasn't what would make me happy, but fuck, after being overweight all my life, you'd think I'd at least appreciate not being borderline medically-obese. I mean, I guess I appreciate that my body can actually fit into most normal female clothes now ffs",False,False

I haven't purged in several days, partially because one of them I was too hungover to move and partially through serious grappling with the urge to bp. I think i've run myself down too far; the thought of my usual binge foods repulsed me, and I ate some 'safe' foods which I never purge (something that I know would be painful/difficult to get up). I hope this is the sign of a jump back onto the wagon.   I had to have a nap after eating like I always do, and when I got up I caught myself in the mirror and realised just how different my face looks when it's not all bloated and puffy from purging. I've got a couple of spots and burst blood vessels, but my eyes look wide and I have defined structure in my cheeks and jaw. I was stunned, because I didn't feel revolting for the first time in a while. But then I just felt so sad, because I remembered that this is something I do to myself, and that a lot of the symptoms I try to correct with my behaviours are themselves caused by my own misguided actions.    I pray that this really is the start of a turning around. I don't know if i'll ever recover and honestly my outlook for the future is bleak, but I feel a little hopeful for the first time in... a while.",False,False
