I'll wait until my roommates are asleep and go on nights I'm too restless to sleep. I change up grocery stores depending on my mood. Sometimes I go to winco and take note of the prices of my favorite foods and then a week later go to walmart and compare. And then I just buy a diet snapple and come back home and go to bed. If someone was following me around they would think I'm a psychopath ðŸ˜°,False,False
