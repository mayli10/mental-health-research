I try to only eat whole foods, low sugar, and have to have a particular balance of things (for example I have to have 2000 ml of water at least, keep sodium lowish, getting 40g fibre a day at least) it can be a bit of a struggle",False,False

I have extreme anxiety about eating if I didn't work out that day. I refuse to use olive oil and I have so little fat and so much fiber in my diet that using the bathroom is a tortured experience.

I’ll never eat anything that consist of artificial sugars. I take forever when it comes to grocery shopping because I have to look at every single macro and find the one with the least amount of calories. Sadly, IT IS A THING and it’s very time consuming. But I guess I’ve learnt how to live with it.",False,False
