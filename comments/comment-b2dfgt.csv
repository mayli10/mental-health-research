I have so much oatmeal on hand but have been turned off of it for a long time and this sounds like a great way to get back into it because I'm a slut for pumpkin. ",False,False

Add some pumpkin spice seasoning and brown sugar/stevia, youâ€™ve got a tasty, *actually* filling meal. Would recommend without half a bottle of pumpkin spice seasoning :)",False,True
