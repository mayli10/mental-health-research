I opened doors for myself when I was fat, often after they slammed in my face.    I got less smiles and chatty small talk when I was fat.  No one calls me names or makes animal noises at me anymore.    The more weight I lose, the more my spouse wants to have sex with me.  The thinner I get, the nicer people are to me in stores and restaurant settings, instead of being exasperated.  If I do draw attention, it tends to be positive, but when I was fat all I wanted was to feel like I could blend into a crowd, and now I do and it’s such a relief.",False,False

How!!! You look great!! You're tiny!!!

Yeah my poonani game is up, but it’s just flings. I’m too much of a self deprecating anorexic for an actual relationship.
