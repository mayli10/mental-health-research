The entire video kind of went around the subject and never really touched on it. She said that she had an eating disorder but never said that she was anorexic or that she intentionally restricted. She made it sound as though she was just severely underweight and didn't have the cognitive and emotional side of the disorder.

Did she say in the video that the doctors at the treatment place didn't use a label? I admit I skipped around so I could've missed that, I thought it was her who was uncomfortable naming it.

Social media has been a journey associated with her weight loss during the years. It's like a journal of all bad things. I think social media being her career is not the best.

Unlike people who mindlessly eat or forget to eat, Eugenia is hyper aware of her appearance.  She did a lot of try on hauls because she knew that would get the most views based on her body.  YouTube certainly played a role in her disorder because she was ‚Äúrewarded‚Äù with views (and the advertiser income that goes along with it) by showing her body in revealing clothing.
