As someone who’s been through the ringer of purge hell- I absolutely encourage you to please reach out and tell someone that you’ve been engaging in these behaviors. I know it might feel very difficult but your heart could stop and you could die from an electrolyte imbalance from purging.   ,False,False

The fact that I could die from this doesnt even scare me anymore. And that itself is scary. I know the only way to give it up is to stop but how can I stop when it's all I ever want to do. I dont care about anything else. ,False,False
