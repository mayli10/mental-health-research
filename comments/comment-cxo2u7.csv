I went on a two week honeymoon a few months ago and I threw my eating rules out the window to enjoy this once in a lifetime experience with my new husband. It was tough to let go but I knew I would regret it for the rest of my life if I didn’t.  We ate lunch and dinner out at various restaurants every day and we had breakfast out about half the time. I had pancakes with whipped cream! I had fries! I had shrimp and grits swimming in butter! We were also gifted with a giant cooler full of road trip snacks that I enjoyed and we drank A TON of beer.  And you know what? When we got home I had gained two whole pounds. I was expecting 10, easy. I was back to normal in five days. Just let yourself enjoy your time, and get back on track when you get home.",False,False

My first ever major binge was on the last night of a vacation with my SO. I snuck out of bed and binged on Kettle Chips and Twix Bouchees. The next morning I was so unnaturally bloated and felt so unwell that my SO and I thought I had caught some terrible stomach virus. It felt like a particularly terrible hangover.   I’ve stopped eating basically at all on vacation now because that’s when I want to look my best, but I do have the occasional “binge weekend” that I plan in advance (starting one tomorrow, woo) and by the end I’m in the same boat, I can’t stand up straight and my back muscles are in agony from how stretched out my stomach becomes. The next day I usually am badly dehydrated, have terrible nausea, heartburn, and gas, a brutal headache, and it takes at least a week, sometimes up to two, to lose all the water weight.   Not sure this counts as help or support lol, but hopefully it lets you know you’re not alone. If you want any tips, drink as much water as you can before you go to sleep, and take some digestive enzymes, some bromelain, a diuretic, and/or some probiotics. This will all help with the side effects I mentioned above!",False,False
