I've only had one purging slip since October... prior to that I was purging compulsively... like 12-15 times a day. Hours and hours leaning over the toilet.. countless episodes in public places. Esophageal and gi problems forced me into stopping and I truly thought it would be impossible but as you said, after a week, the urge was almost totally gone... unfortunately I'm still struggling with restriction and body dysmorphia but at least my throat isn't going to explode...",False,False
