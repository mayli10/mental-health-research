That doesn't mean you can't gain control over it and make it nothing more than a whisper that pipes up every now and again.  Addressing what seems to be the main complaint, besides your weight, have you spoken to a doctor about your constipation? There could be an underlying issue causing you problems that isn't resolved by usual otc measures. I can't really suggest anything else, besides making sure you're taking in fibre, both soluble and not, and drinking enough, ideally water or juice.  Once you find a reliable way to manage your constipation, then you can tackle your nicotine addiction, though if you can in the mean time, you can try to cut down.  When that's all dealt with, I think you're going to likely find that you'll need to address your ED. It isn't going to go away simply because everything else has been resolved. It might lessen, but to avoid it flaring up, definitely seek help for managing it. It may even be you need to do all this in reverse, because EDs can cause damage we can't see, and that may be compounding the issue.",False,False
