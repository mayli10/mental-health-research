There's enzymes in our saliva that help break down food, but unless you actually swallow, you're not getting any of the nutrients that are breaking down. You might feel fat and full because chewing can make you swallow you air, or because anxiety can make you bloat and you seem rather nervous about this. ",False,False

If you’re gonna CS, you have to close your throat off.  Use a water bottle to swish and spit out.  If you’re going to swallow, you’re going to end up swallowing more calories than you think and it’s gonna be bad news.  Source:  me doing it right versus me doing it wrong.  ",False,False

That's an absurd amount of c/s!! So I'd think you'd have a hard time gaining from it alone. No reason to purge. ",False,False
