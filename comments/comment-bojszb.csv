Clearly your friends and your boyfriend think you're absolutely fine the way you are but maybe you've set impossible standards for yourself in all directions and when you can't meet them you pin it on your body and weight.,False,False

Congratulations on every single one of your accomplishments, including your recovery! Beauty isn't defined by how soft your stomach is or whether your thighs touch or not; to a small extent, it's your natural features like your eyes or nose but the most beautiful people I know are strong and confident.   Right now, I'm succumbing to my ED and feel repulsed by myself but you've given me hope. ðŸ–¤",False,False

It just means you have a good amount of energy stored.  You're probably just idealizing being thin. I know I have health problems, but even before they started I was always so tired all the time after losing weight. My life was genuinely better before I lost weight. I would accept bigger thighs if my body wasn't already trashed from all of this.",False,False

It's also fulfilling, and healthy, so long as you're not underweight. I feel less healthy now than I waa when i was underweight because I no longer restrict my food groups and I have thigh fat.",False,True

Instead I have this idea that I have to give in to having a bigger body and a high percentage of fat to live and succeed and I know logically that's not true.,False,True

Most of us do have soft tummies even when we're still struggling with our disorders and your entire thighs could be touching while still being at a totally healthy and normal weight. I'm proud that you were able to accomplish so much because of your recovery and I don't see any reason you should feel bad about it. You're doing great things and you're probably more beautiful than you give yourself credit for.,False,False
