It sounds like she means everything positively (complimenting you on your cheeks, complimenting you on your body, but also being protective of you) She probably doesn't mean to give mixed messages, it sounds like she likes you and is just trying to be nice. But that is really confusing and triggering to hear. I know this isn't really helpful advice but try not to let it bother you, your ED will probably want to distort everything but she's honestly probably just kind of clueless. I'm sorry you have to deal with these comments",False,False

I have people in my family that are like that with me and it's not a cultural thing, just people with no idea what their words can do to people.   Her touching you unprovoked is also super not okay like reading that made me cringe. I don't have much advice for you, you could just be very blunt with her but I understand not wanting to cause conflict. Sometimes if it's for your own sake in the long run it is worth it though.  People need to learn that ""skinny"" is not an okay compliment and commenting on someone's body like that is way too common ugh.",False,False
