Yes, a resting heart rate in the 40s might be normal for an athlete, but it may be a sign of something else going on when combined with ed behaviours.  For my GP who is aware of my ED, that would be a worrying sign, but if I went to a doctor without telling them I have an ED and they just questioned my exercise levels, the low heart rate would make sense in that context.",False,False

My heart rate jumps into the 130-140‚Äôs sometimes, but I think there is a high chance that is anxiety/ptsd. I‚Äôm also restricting fairly heavily and have dropped weight pretty quickly. Plus some occasional binge/purging. I run or swim about 7 hours a week combined. I‚Äôve been pretty thoroughly checked out at this point. ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èOther than palpitations the only other ED health stuff is some orthostatic hypotension and I‚Äôm anemic, but taking iron since I found out.",False,True
