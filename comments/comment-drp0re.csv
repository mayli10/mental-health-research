Movement always requires energy. And on average expending more energy than you consume produces weight loss because the body will use its own cells to acquire the needed energy.   Getting exact answers about *how much* energy would require lab equipment, but in general moving more mass requires more energy, while doing the same activity over and over will train your body to get more efficient at it and maybe use a bit less energy than originally. (But it will absolutely still require energy!)",False,False
