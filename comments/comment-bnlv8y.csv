Mother‚Äôs Day brunch, gummy candy of all types (I bought a specialty bag earlier this week), ordered pizza + wings, cheese, literal Mac &amp; cheese and followed it up with pretzels. Rough estimate 5,000+ cals.   I‚Äôm 45 days sober from booze. My weekends have gone from binge drinking to binge eating. I‚Äôm incorporating more fasting days to try &amp; offset my own garbage. Decided on a two day fast Monday &amp; tues, plus running for cardio both days &amp; hot yoga. This is my 4th week of consistent running! The rest of the week omad. Tomorrow I‚Äôm meal prepping a bunch of shit for omad variety..  Butternut squash dal, white bean soup w/ kale, raw veggies for roasting &amp; a fruit salad. Focus on vegan v low cal.  I don‚Äôt have such an issue binging when I‚Äôm not around my S/O?!?!? It‚Äôs not his fault, I love him so much, why do I do this very specifically when we‚Äôre together. üò≠",False,False
