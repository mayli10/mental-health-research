I'm so so sorry it didn't feel the way you wanted it to. I know that constant feeling of disappointment and longing. But hold onto this memory when it comes time to recovery, knowing that being under 100 never brought you the happiness it seemed to promise.  Please do all the harm reduction you can muster.",False,False

People have only in the last decade or two really started to acknowledge and place proper significance on mental illness and mental wellbeing in general (the majority of people will go through tough spots at some point in their life, some much worse than others and may deal with lifelong issues unfortunately), and even that is still an uphill battle because there is *still* huge stigma and taboo around talking about these things. And then, on top of struggling against that slowly changing public opinion and awareness of mental health, there's a huge lack of infrastructure and accessibility even to those who have decided to or been encouraged seek help - many can't get it even if they desperately want to change. And there's no quick fix for that, nothing will change overnight, and it's so frustrating.",False,False

We'll be getting our MP involved, do you think it would be worth trying that route, too? Since it's a funding issue, they should be able to apply a large amount of pressure at the higher levels of the NHS - at least, that's what they've told us..  Just fuck ED services here in the UK, honestly. It's so abysmal. ",False,True

I am close to your height and I've felt the same thing looking at the weights of users on ProED (and MPA before that) I know how fucking invalidating it is. triple digits can feel huge. but 99/100 to us is like 80 or even 70 to them- INCREDIBLY small. dangerously underweight. I hope you feel better soon love :( EDs are such bullies. they hold us to the most ridiculous standards. I hope you find strength to feel well soon.,False,False

They don't really offer outpatient anymore because once the inpatients are discharged they go back down to England so it's not financially viable for them (or so they say). They're trying to cobble something together for me - basically to take my money - but all they can offer is CBT every 3 weeks. Its better than nothing but its unreal. People will die from this level of care ,False,False

(I was hospitalised a few weeks ago for seizures etc.)  I lost about 120 lbs in a year, and I've literally not received more than 4 sessions with an ED specialist, whom was more detrimental than helpful. ""You will have to deal with this on your own."" No meal plan, no CBT, no body image therapy, nothing.   I would've much preferred outpatient treatment, but now I get to be put on a waiting list and *still* am receiving nothing! ‚ò∫Ô∏è",False,True
