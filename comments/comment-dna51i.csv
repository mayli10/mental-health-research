It's there and I promise it's not as terrifying as it feels like it will be. It always feels like you're sitting at the top of a massive cliff and asking for recovery is like throwing yourself off and asking to be caught... but it's much slower and gentler than that. It's more like being at the top of a grassy hill and rolling down while some people roll with you and other people cheer you on.,False,False
