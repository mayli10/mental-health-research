I had pretty bad social anxiety at the time. Just remember no one is paying attention to you and maybe make a list before you go so you can focus on just getting what you need and then getting out  Also I like going to stores with self-checkout because then no one is looking at everything you picked out (I know the cashiers donâ€™t really care but I still get self-conscious especially if there are people in line with me),False,False
