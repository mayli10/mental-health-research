I had bad anxiety as a child and one time I clogged the toilet at my grandma's house, and I was so embarrassed that next time we went (for about a week) i ""held it in"" the whole time, and somehow that triggered a months long ""mysterious illness."" Basically, I got impacted but it took months and many doctors to find that out. I had emetophobia, which is a phobia of throwing up, and my constipation made me feel nauseous, so I wouldn't eat. I was frighteningly thin - and for some reason all I would eat was cheez its and milkshakes/instant breakfast shakes. It was a miserable time in my life and I missed out on summer camp and my best friends birthday. I dont even remember how I started eating regularly again after that.",False,False

If it was not flat enough for me I would skip a bunch of meals.  I did it unquestioningly and with no angst even, as if it were just a chore I had to do. It's only now that I'm struggling with disordered eating and its mental weight that I wonder what was going on with that.",False,False

My entire brain would be absorbed with how to get the snacks but in the most secretive way possible. If I saw snacks I could not forget about them, even as other kids were off doing something else.    I read somewhere that's just like a genetic thing that heavier people tend to have. I've actually kind of outgrown it by restricting so much and also abusing other substances lol.",False,False

I think this started when i was around 10 years old, id eat to feel something and id eat just because there‚Äôs food and id eat because i was looking for something and even if i was eating slow enough to actually taste it i was never satisfied.

As a young child, about 7, I would stash my Halloween candy and I would ration it out to last me a year. I'd get so upset when my sister's or dad would eat it, like I was personally violated. I remember my appetite being directly related to my emotions. It's always been my natural reaction to not eat when under stress, or to over eat, when I'm cycling through behaviors.
