But congratulations on even deciding to recover, that's so strong and we're all proud of you. I know how hard diet culture can be, especially in the beginning of the year. But you have to stay strong and remind yourself that *your* new year's resolutions are to fight this disorder and get better. Everyone's different and sometimes we need to stay true to ourselves. Maybe you could talk to your friends about it, or set some boundaries. Or just block them out completely, take some time for yourself and continue your journey. Stay strong&lt;3",False,False

There's a lot of societal pressure to empathise, play along, understand, feel the same way about your body too  If you have a mental illness you need companionship. These days it comes at a price. It shouldn't, but it does  I think it's crazy how people are always expected to explain themselves (""Don't you care about your health?"" cut out x y z until nothing is left), aspire to lose weight, work on their diets constantly- like we're never good enough  It gets to a point where you have to stop because your quality of life is compromised and focussing on weight loss- or trying to trick yourself into losing weight is driving you insane bc you have a mental illness  The New Years goals/resolutions is followed so blindly, like a cult- everyone jumps on the bandwagon and it's an excuse to lose weight for people who are way too thin anyway and it's sad  If you can separate it, it's no big deal, but sometimes people are so intense about their goals they won't let you- and they keep making it an issue and they won't respect your boundaries  I don't think society has ever had so many issues with overweight people, either, than it does now- fat shaming is worse than ever, because society are obsessed with being as thin as possible",False,False

I am working towards recovery now and ooh lawd has it been tough. I am also in medical school and being around so many stressed and “health conscious people” all day every day is also taking it’s toll. Today I feel clear and know that recovery is what I want and need but I am not sure if I will be strong enough to say the same tomorrow morning. One day at a time i guess,False,False
