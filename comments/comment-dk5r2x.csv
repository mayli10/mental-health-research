And nurses are trained to be particularly observant of all things people-related.  I‚Äôve had mine for almost 15 years üò≥ and I don‚Äôt know how else to cope with the world. I stopped drinking about 8 months ago and have lost a ton of weight since then; not only from ridding myself of those calories but bc I‚Äôm not drunkenly eating and not puking. I haven‚Äôt gotten comments on it LATELY but damn I can see their eyes staring at my collar bones or mentally checking some box in their mind when they see me eat candy or a salad or anything.   I feel constantly assaulted by all things unsaid.,False,False

It really doesn‚Äôt make sense  On Christmas my fianc√© wanted to leave to go get cigarettes and when he told his fianc√© that we‚Äôd be right back they said ‚Äúshe probably wants to go get a cheeseburger‚Äù  Like you can‚Äôt bitch I‚Äôm too skinny &amp; say I eat a lot... like pick a side for fucks sake,False,False
