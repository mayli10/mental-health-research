I know what you mean about feeling like you have nothing to show for it. My firstborn  was stillborn and I had that same thought constantly. Like I should at least have them to SHOW for this. It drove me crazy for a while, along with everything else that comes with losing a baby. It's just hell. I hope you can find some peace soon.  ",False,False

My bf has cystic fibrosis so I have to have a genetic test soon to see if we can even have a baby but, while I would like the result of that to be 'yes' (even though I'm not sure I want one), pregnancy really scares me. Both the weight gain and I have a huge fear of losing a baby if I was pregnant, so my heart hurts for you that you have to go through this.  :(  It will probably take a while, easy for me to say but I would just try to take it easy and focus on self-care and really slowly ease into eating smaller meals (if you're still binging and want to cut down) instead of going into full-on restrict mode which could make you mentally feel way worse. Your body probably really needed all that extra food when you were pregnant, so try not to feel bad about it if you can, not eating may have made you feel quite sick or weak. ",False,False

Don’t beat yourself up about gaining weight, it’s a process. Even small changes in emotion can screw up everything. What’s more important is your feelings and mental health, and sometimes mental heath involves some food! I know it always feels like failing when you gain, but it’s good to eat what you want, do some self care, and just think about yourself for a while. From personal experience, trying to restrict while going through stuff just makes everything worse. :(  Message me if you ever need anything or just want to talk. ",False,False
