I know it can be hard but accepting rules like that into your life is only feeding your disorder, but you know that. Sweet potatoes, and tofu are awesome foods. I like to bake my sweet potatoes whole in the oven really slow and low and they come out so sweet and fluffy and full of nutrients. Personally I don’t really enjoy meat so tofu is a great way to get protein in your diet without meat.",False,False

Sweet potatoes and tofu are good for your body so if you can feel okay moving to that I'd say its a really positive thing and it's unlikely it'll hinder your goals as this is still low cal. Also I find things like those foods to be really satiating so I feel fuller for longer after. Keeps the hangry at bay.,False,False

Tofu is high in protein, which keeps your muscles from deteriorating, and therefore keeps your BMR from dropping.  Sweet potato has lots of nutrients, and also is high fibre to keep you full and energised!!  Definitely eat these foods",False,False
