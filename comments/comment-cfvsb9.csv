My boyfriend used to unintentionally trigger me with his attempts to be supportive. The best thing for you to do would just be to tell him what he should/shouldn‚Äôt say. If you don‚Äôt tell him what bothers you I can guarantee you he won‚Äôt realize that he‚Äôs actually hurting you and will just keep doing the same thing. Don‚Äôt wait for him to pick up on signs and just be honest, I‚Äôm sure he would rather know for certain than have to try and figure it out himself. Good luck üíï",False,False

I completely understand how you feel‚Äî it totally sucks. For example I told my husband about my eating disorder a couple of weeks ago and it went okay. But sometimes he‚Äôll make comments just like you described; for instance, today we went out for Mexican and we shared the skillet fajitas. I filled one tortilla up with the fajita mixture and ate it all, and a few chips &amp; dip, and was done. When we got home he commented, ‚ÄúWow you actually ate a lot! More than I expected.‚Äù And he playfully pat my stomach. I brushed it off in the moment because I know he was genuinely just proud and happy that I ate at least a taco‚Äôs worth of food,  but I‚Äôve been obsessing about his comment ever since. I‚Äôve stayed well under my daily BMR calorie intake but it still made me feel gross, and it inadvertently encouraged me to heavily restrict the rest of the day. :(",False,False

I wouldn't have realised it was not the best option to respond that way to your or anyone's progress. Think a rule of thumb, when it comes to EDs, is to just stay away from food or body related comments.   &amp;#x200B;  If I see better portions or a suitable approach taken towards food, I will remember to compliment how you are actually glowing today!     You could try talking about this issue in general. If he doesn't seem to make the connection, go ahead and create it for him. Also, important to acknowledge his good intentions before you enlighten him.",False,False

He sounds like he doesn't mean anything by it, and most people i don't think realize just how hurtful those comments really are. Good luck with it &lt;3",False,False
