It makes me sad, because on one hand I wanna be the better person, and not add to their negativity, but I also want to stand up for myself. Annnd some people are so stubborn, that they won’t admit to saying something wrong. Idk how to let it get to me, because I already feel fat when I’m at a healthy weight. I guess what I’m saying is I totally feel you, and you’re not alone. If you come up with something that shuts people down, without hurting their feelings too, let me know. I completely understand your pain, and I’m so sorry that people are bullies sometime. It hurts. ♥️",False,True
