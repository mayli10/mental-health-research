I usually purge my dinner because even though it's very small and about 300 calories i feel painfully full after and I need to get rid of that feeling. Starting tomorrow I'm cutting them in half and eat it separately. Hoping that will work.,False,False

For instance I can eat say... grapes or potato chips and be fine because they're so light that I dont feel it in me but  if I were to eat French fries or rice, etc, I feel like I need to get it out. I plan my purges all the time. Like I'll go to McDonalds or get Chinese takeout and know that I didn't overdo it too bad, probably ate just below or exactly at maintenance and I'll purge. Some days I'll eat 800 calories and purge. Some days 500 calories and purge. ",False,False

I plan out my food at the start of my day.. everything carefully logged and calories on point. Im at the point now were I really like to stay under 600kcal/day, sometimes thats before counting exercise but depends on the day tbh. Anyways, if I eat something unplanned or go over even a little bit I purge. Even if I just ate my planned salad and had 5 unplanned almonds I purge it all and still log all the calories.  &amp;#x200B;  Nothings wrong with you.. it happens... I started dieting after recovering again and was logging my calories at 1500...then 1300...then 1200... then 1000...ect.. Once I hit the 1000 mark I started my full blown relapse....  &amp;#x200B;  Id just say be kind to yourself (even though I wont do the same for myself -\_-) and just keep trying.. sending love and stay safe &lt;3 ",False,False
