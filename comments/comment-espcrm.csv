SINGLE. TIME. she buys me a size large in a sweater or smthn and is like is it big enough for you?? bitch ??? i may have body dysmorphia but i know for a fact i fit fine in a size small. i could go on for hours she is literally a demon.",False,False

She is a petite woman but always makes comments about how she wants to eat (whatever it is) but she can't because she's too fat. And she'll always pat her stomach and look me directly in the eye, like she's waiting for me to tell her she's not fat. And for many many years I played along, but I just fucking can't anymore. Now I don't respond or change the subject. I grew up doing ballet intensively so everyone around us was extremely thin, and I don't know if that played a roll in it (cause she's still obsessed with the ballet world/people I used to dance with) but every time I see her and have some sort of conversation along those lines my immediate internal monologue is like ""fine mom, you wanna have a competition? I'll stop eating. I can be the thin one and I'll never have to put up with your bullshit again. Shut the fucking FUCK up."" UGH that felt good to finally tell someone else about, thank you.",False,False
