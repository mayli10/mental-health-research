I never realized this is a core of a lot of my issues. Regretting whatever choice I make. Wanting to gain to a healthy weight and then regretting it because underweight gave me a sense of satisfaction. Regretting being underweight because of mental and physical problems. Never satisfied.,False,False

I hate myself when I‚Äôm in a binge cycle but then when I‚Äôm trying to break it or not binge I kind of miss the feeling of just eating whatever I want and as much as I want. I remember it nostalgically as like comforting even though I absolutely hate myself after I‚Äôve done it??? And then on the flip side when I‚Äôm in the midst of a binge cycle I romanticise fasting and eating ‚Äúperfectly‚Äù and think about how good I‚Äôll feel when I‚Äôm doing it. but then when I‚Äôm actually in the middle of trying to fast or heavily restrict I don‚Äôt like it and I miss food or being able to eat more/ a normal amount. Yikes haha,False,False
