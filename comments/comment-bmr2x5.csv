I subscribe to a monthly vape box from Zamplebox which allows me to try a lot of new flavors while saving money. The 11 bottle/mo box I’m currently subscribed to is $54 (vs $15-20 per bottle retail) and I think they have smaller 3-6 bottle subscription packages as well. Right now, I’m really into fruit flavors, but I used to be all about dessert vapes &amp; Heliomilk by Space Jam is my all time favorite juice; it’s like vaping straight honey.   Some of my other favorites:  🌬 Pancake Man - Vape Breakfast Classics (maple pancakes) 🌬 I Love Popcorn - Mad Hatter 🌬 Lemon Tart - Dinner Lady 🌬 Lion - Illuminati (oatmeal cookie custard) 🌬 That Thai Tea Tho - Marina Vapes (sweet bubble tea) 🌬 Cupcake Freaks - Half Baked (vanilla cupcake) 🌬 Lavender Town - Dead Sea (lavender pomegranate custard) 🌬 Sugar Drizzle - Cuttwood (creamy cinnamon sugar) 🌬 Sweet Nipples - Vape Goons (pop rocks &amp; honeydew) 🌬 Meteor Milk - Space Jam (strawberry ice cream) 🌬 Whipped CC - RNR White (tiramisu)",False,False

(Like I’m talking battery charging station, expensive coils and everything)  Then I started smoking cigs again and it ended up in my garage and the coil needs to be replaced. So it hasn’t been used in a while.   BUT then I had to go home for a couple of days (my family doesn’t know I smoke) so I bought a juul with some cucumber pods and I’d 100% recommend going with the juul first.   It’s cheap, small, and easy to charge. Plus the cucumber pods are really good.   No I’m in the process of weening off cigs and using the juul more",False,False

All the staff are chill twenty-something dudes and when I picked mine up I thought for sure I'd be judged hard (I am a very very short, young-looking female) but if you just say you're a newbie looking for an easy set up they can point you in the right direction.   I use a pretty basic E-leaf mod with a more expensive tank (literally just what the guy there recommended me). Definitely do your research first, but feel free to take advantage of the brains behind the counter!",False,False
