I'm mostly worried about starting the diet with good intentions (trying to get decent variety, sufficient calories for my body), but slipping into bad habits with the restriction on what's safe to eat. I kinda get in cycles where I start counting calories and freak out when I see them start inching towards a ""bad"" limit. I worry that the liquid meals might accidentally facilitate that.",False,True

I've seen someone eat pasta the day after getting their tongue pierced. You can eat right through that shit if you're determined enough.   The ED brain is always looking for new opportunities. You can blame the piercing or you can blame the ED brain.   ,False,False

If you want to get a venom piercing, awesome, go you. If you wouldn't get it if you didn't have to have a liquid diet, don't get it. That way you can really appreciate you're getting something positive for you",False,False

I'm not sure if you're worried about a liquid diet being unhealthy or just about not eating enough, but lots of people seem to like the meal plan I posted, so maybe it will be good for you too.",False,False
