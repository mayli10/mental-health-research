I'm the lowest weight I've ever been in my adult life. After she dumped me I just stopped eating. It became the thing I lived for. I wanted d everyone to see that I'm suffering and get scared about how skinny I am. Including my ex (we're still very very close which is breaking my heart tbh).  I feel like I have absolutely nothing left except my ED. Nothing is going right, I'm in love with someone who doesn't want be in a monogamous relationship, my dad got back news about his heart. Everything is garbage and I genuinely want to die.  This ED shit is hard enough without all the external ""life"" factors that people experience, and then it gets so much worse when life gives you those damn lemons. I hear you, and even though I've got literally zero advice to offer you because my life is a pit, if you just need to freaking complain and vent or cry and scream or whatever about just how garbage everything is, please message me.",False,False

I know there is nothing I could say to make these feelings magically wash away, but something that brings me comfort in situations where it‚Äôs another person deciding to end the relationship is: ‚Äúwhy would I want to be with someone who doesn‚Äôt want to be with me?‚Äù  Seriously, would you want to be with someone who‚Äôs not as excited to see you or won‚Äôt love you 100%?? Noooooo. Think of ways that you can grow to be better for your perfect future parter (if you can‚Äôt convince yourself to do it for yourself). It‚Äôs okay to be sad, don‚Äôt deny those feelings or feel like you have to move on immediately, but also allow yourself to think of all the negative parts of the relationship that you didn‚Äôt like or wish would have been different. But also, don‚Äôt blame yourself for the relationship ending. It‚Äôs 50-50, all of the time, because ppl are equal (and I say that to help you accept it).   Try picking out something new to do. For example, I‚Äôve joined new clubs, and got a personal trainer and tried swimming, skating, etc. Things that you‚Äôve had genuine curiosity over but haven‚Äôt tried or things that excite you like painting or sculpting, heck even wood making if it tickles your fancy lol (I hope that‚Äôs a saying).   I‚Äôve never heard someone say it so bluntly that they want someone to cry in-front of... it‚Äôs something i thought i was weird for wanting. I honestly just get a really nice fluffy pillow and wrap myself around it. (It‚Äôs also good for your hips if you sleep with a pillow between your legs if you‚Äôre a side sleeper) And for me, I like the feeling of a pillow between my legs, a pillow pushed up against my back, and a thin, comfy pillow under my head, feels like all of the clouds are giving my an endless bear hug.  You can vent to me if you like as well, stay strong, being tired and hungry (even if you don‚Äôt mentally feel it) will make your mood and feelings harder to manage. Foods with a lot of flavor of sweet help me when I can‚Äôt eat. A smoothie could really help I think, my favorite is a berries one with pomegranate (seeds included) sooo good. üíú",False,False
