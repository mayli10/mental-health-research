There’s nothing wrong with knowing what you’re eating or how much you’re eating, the issue is that you become obsessive about it. I think that to recover you need to come to an understanding of what amount of food you need and where these calories should come from. You also need to come to an understanding that these calories will change and your weight will fluctuate, and that the fluctuations are normal. Recovery is understanding that you will not want to eat most of the time, but that you have to so that your body doesn’t like die or something. It’s understanding that “clean eating” is probably not achievable for most of us all of the time, but instead focus on eating more foods that are whole. This is getting too long, but yea basically recovery is probably going to be a continuous state of checking yourself and ur thoughts and not allowing them to do what they want. It’s realizing what’s best for ur body and for ur health. This might only just be relevant for me tho cuz it’s probably different for everyone. Also it’s apparently not eating romaine lettuce.

The freedom of not calculating would be amazing. I'm practicing following my meal plan based on exchanges, not calories, and I'm finding once I set my mind on an idea for a meal, I need to go with it before the overthinking starts.",False,False

It's about a shift of a balance of power: TO you (empowering yourself) FROM the numbers, the thoughts, the shame.  It's never going to be perfect. It's going to be a practice for many years. I've had an ED for 20 years...you better believe that after a couple of years I am no where near full recovery, but I'm better now at steering the power back to me and ripping that power out of the hands of my ED behaviors and thoughts.",False,False

The information is too openly presented. You see it on the menu at every restaurant from McDonalds to Olive Garden right next to the price. That combined with my memory (think calorie aspergers scene from *To the Bone*) and it's no use at this point.,False,True

Got worse! all that mad mind math is so exhausting. Once you know about calories it's really hard to get rid of them.
