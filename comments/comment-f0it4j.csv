Maybe not actively but when ever you brought it up he ignored it. Now you cant see him for legal reasons, professionally, which I guarantee he knows, yet he still is wanting to meet with you for coffee and when you are doing well and are trying to be healthy he tears you down.  &amp;#x200B;  This man sounds straight up manipulative if not outright abusive. Please pick yourself over him and never see him again.",False,False
