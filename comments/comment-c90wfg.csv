I only had like 2 meals a week, mostly because I was out with friends and didn’t want to look too weird... then I started dating this guy, felt better about myself and binged everything.   I never felt more disgusting than after eating a whole thing of nutella within a day. I have to go to the grocery store daily because if there’s food around, I WILL eat all of it. I try to only buy healthy foods now so I don’t feel as bad eating a giant cucumber and half a celery in one sitting.   I really wish I could go back to restricting but it’s so hard now.",False,False
