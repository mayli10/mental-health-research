Even if he was trying to say these things in ""your best interest"", what he said was still fucked and he either needs to know that and seriously apologize, or he needs to leave.   I hope it gets better for you",False,False

Legit, you should probably call him out and educate him. Be gentle about it, because you don't want him to get defensive - just use it as a valuable learning experience for him. Remember that while what he said was triggering AF, he doesn't know shit.    I'm someone who fullfills the stereotype probably pretty well, at this point, and my boyfriend knows it's a thing for me, and we've talked about it and he's learning more about it every day - but my boyfriend can be naive and often says equally triggering things also. The thing is, they just \*don't\* understand it because they're not living it like we are. I've since educated my boyfriend a little more on what i'm dealing with and what I need from him, but I always need to remember when he has slip-ups that he's just coming from a place of naivety, and he doesn't understand what kinds of thought processes the ED mindset can lead me through.",False,False
