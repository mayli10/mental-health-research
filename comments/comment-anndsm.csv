I didn't see any posts with weight in the title scrolling for 4 pages. There is a good amount of OC on those subs but also just a lot of stuff from porn sites like pornhub.  We may not like or agree with some sexual fetishes, but that doesn't mean we need to petition to shut them down. There are feeder fetish subs too. At least I'm not seeing comments about how OP should lose more weight.  The only issue I have is posts about ""teen"" or ""highschool"" girls that is bordering/playing on underage porn and that is gross and illegal. Report the shit out of those posts. ",False,False

I don't think consensual porn is bad, but even if the content is objectionable like in this case, nothing will come of a petition -except perhaps having our own sub banned. ",False,False

I guess men relieving themselves physically is more important than women reliving themselves mentally.,False,False

Our safe places have been removed and this feels like retaliation.     This is, perhaps, someone else's safe place. Thinspo, triggering, or otherwise.

We ideally want to stay as quiet as possible (squeaky wheel gets the grease, etc) and so starting a pissing fight between a bunch of porn subs and our community isn’t recommended.
