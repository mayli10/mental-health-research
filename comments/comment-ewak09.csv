Good Thins are super low cal for the amount you get- 28 crackers for 120 calories of the veggie flavor (which I like to eat with salsa). Lil cuties (clementines) are 35-40 cal each. Pickles help curb my salt cravings because I can eat a ton for few calories but they do make me bloat because salt. I also like to make low cal sandwiches on sandwich thins or the 35 cal a slice bread; I add mustard, lots of shredded lettuce, cucumbers, tomato slices, and red onion (if you’re not vegetarian I bet thinly sliced turkey would work too). Hope this helps ❤️  Edit: seaweed is amazing too!",False,False
