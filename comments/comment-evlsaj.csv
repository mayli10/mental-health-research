It’s absolutely understandable to have a strong emotional response when we’re told something that hurts us. Especially when it’s something that clicks right into one of our major fears. My brain screams “SeE I tOLd yOU!” and I immediately want to ‘fix’ that pain and quiet that fear.   But we don’t have to build our lives around the hurts or lies handed to us by others &lt;3 Sometimes people say things that are the verbal equivalent of email spam and the best thing to practice is pressing ‘delete’.,False,False
