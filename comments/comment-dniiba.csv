I don‚Äôt think ppl gave it enough of a chance to see how the eating disorder affected her mentally.   When I first had my eating disorder and I lose a ton of weight, ppl looked at me and treated me differently. All of the sudden ppl paid attention to me and wanted to be friends with me. I‚Äôd get free stuff where ever I went. Ppl would call me cute and adorable.   It just made me even more afraid to eat bc I thought if I eat and I gain weight, I won‚Äôt be this wonderful person anymore. The whole issue was that society is too obsessed with looks at times to treat ‚Äúbigger‚Äù  ppl with that Same sort of decency.",False,False
