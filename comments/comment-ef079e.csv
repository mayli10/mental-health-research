I've actually been considering making a whole post about this because this rule seems to be very unenforced lately. Don't forget brigading is against the rules of reddit altogether and while this isn't an extreme example, if we don't want heat on our community we should not be making a habit of criticizing, mocking, calling out other subs or encouraging users of this sub to go check out/post on their sub to trigger themselves.  Though it can't be proven, it was highly theorized the old sub got shut down because in the months before it got banned, the sub as a whole developed a very negative and toxic relationship with many of the other dieting/calorie counting subs and brought a lot of bad publicity to our sub because of it. I'm seeing that happening again and it's making me nervous for the future of edanonymous to see threads like this and the other CONSTANT calling out of the isplenty subs, fasting subs, other dieting subs etc.   They don't come into our community and go post on their subs about how horribly triggering the content here is and how we are all bigots and shouldn't be allowed to exist, so quite frankly I don't think we should do it to them. And the content here can be much more upsetting and competitive in regards to EDs than fatlogic or dieting subs meant for people who medically really need to lose weight and are attempting it in a perfectly healthy manner. Their subs are not meant to accommodate or cater to people suffering from Eds, if the content there is too upsetting for you and you cannot control your emotions around it, simply choose not to visit there instead of purposely going and being upset by the posts. And I'm not trying to be a dick but if we want this community to stay on reddit we need to start following this rule (which is OUR rule on our subreddit, again, so I'm not sure why these posts have become so prevalent again) more closely and avoiding this subtle brigading type behavior.",False,False
