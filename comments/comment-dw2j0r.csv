(Didn't use the toppings it lists in the recipe)   https://juliasalbum.com/pumpkin-chili-with-beef-and-black-beans-recipe/#wprm-recipe-container-15431  Didn't use oil, used lean beef. 1/2tsp salt instead of the 1/4tsp it says.   If you don't want to use beef you could use mushrooms for a vegetarian chili? Would make it even lower in calories as well. Or freeze a block of tofu, thaw, then squeeze out and break it up to resemble beef. ðŸ–¤",False,False
