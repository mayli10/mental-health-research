From the FAQ (this probably should have a TW):  &gt;Hard fast is absolutely no contact with water (no showers, no brushing teeth, etc.)  &gt;By not putting anything into your body, you are finally giving it a break and giving it a chance to heal itself. The body has much better healing and repair mechanisms than some pharmaceutical pill that you get at your doctor's office.   &gt;The longest dry fast I am aware of (where I was following the person's experience) was 10 days.

Water poisoning is a thing, and both chugging tons of water in a short period of time as well as sweating a bunch from exercise and drinking a lot of plain water puts you at risk.
