I'm just hoping I'll be stronger tomorrow and can actually get back into fasting. I'm not great at restricting because I feed the kids and cook for the rest of the family and it's so easy to stress graze, so I'm wanting to get in a few days of fasting and remind myself I can be actually have a little willpower and not fuck up what I've already lost.  It may have been 600 calories of truffles, but now you don't have to worry about them and you can do better tomorrow. Baby steps! We've got this.",False,False

First of all, I hear you. I've been having *the most awful* binge cycles these past three weeks. I just can't seem to quit going to the store, buying tons of garbage and gobbling it up, only to throw it up later on. I've frequently fallen asleep after my binges so sometimes it was more than three hours after binging when I started purging.  I haven't weighed myself in weeks because I'm too afraid to step on the scale and face the truth (but I have *definitely* gained weight, I can see and feel it) but today I looked at my MFP logs and as it turns out, from my starting point to my lowest logged weight (5kg difference) there were only 6 weeks! And I've looked at all my kcal logs in those weeks and I was between 1,000 - 1,200 kcal on pretty much all those days with only very sporadic, half assed exercise. So, you and I and everyone else here, *can* get back on track in no time. You just have to feel ready. ",False,False
