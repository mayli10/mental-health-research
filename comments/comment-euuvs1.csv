Gotcha. 1250 (not sure why it’s so specific but 🤷🏻‍♀️) is my safe number so I feel you, I’ll still lose on it but don’t quite feel like dying.   Tdee is Total Daily Energy Expenditure. So what your body burns in a day. Depends on height, weight &amp; activity levels (so job type and amount of exercise). Mine if I don’t exercise or work (I work on my feet all day) is 1700, but when I work and go to the gym it’s 2200, for example.",False,False
