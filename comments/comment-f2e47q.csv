It’s just like that but chunkier. So it’s really harsh-tasting but if you get used to it it’s not bad. Totally worth it for someone who constantly craves chocolate like me.,False,True

My stomach was flat and my thighs looked a lot smaller.  Weirder still is even if my body looks one way or the other, I don’t like this. It isn’t sustainable. I feel like a pig.  I can pinpoint my mindset. I feel like I’m missing out. Like I need to eat this now or I’ll never be able to even if I don’t LIKE the food or aren’t hungry.  Even though I’m wistful of my 300-cal restriction days, I know I can’t do those because I’m in the army and we have an upcoming PT test in which I have to do leg tucks, deadlifts, and a 90-lb sled drag among other events. I need muscle and thus need protein. So I need something less restrictive.  I like your idea, particularly because my biggest binge hour is 0800 (after morning PT).  I can’t believe I’m writing up a “cry for help” post. I’ve always felt my ED was under control. I sustained a BMI of 14 for years without feeling horrible. Now that I’m closer to BMI 18, I’m out of fucking control.  Thank you btw.",False,True
