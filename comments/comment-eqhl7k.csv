fese1gf,t3_eqhl7k,t1_fesd96i,situationtypedill,2,2020-01-18 10:17:04,/r/EDAnonymous/comments/eqhl7k/mental_health/fese1gf/,I definitely over eat when Iâ€™m depressed. I got up to 210 pounds in the past year but now Iâ€™m tracking calories and exercising a lot again and Iâ€™m down to 182 as of this morning! Iâ€™m very happy with my results but I know Iâ€™m not losing weight in the healthiest way.,False,True

I think it's entirely possible that your bipolar disorder could influence your eating habits (ex: eating more while in depressive episode and compulsively exercising while in a manic/hypomanic episode). Your psychiatrist will be the best resource once they've collected more data for your particular situation but I definitely think you're onto something there and it would be good to bring that up at your next session,False,False
