You get all sorts of fun spikes of not so fun chemicals during you're period. I'm sure part of it is the muscles are contracting to expel the lining. Sort of like after you work out.",False,False

I think I remember that helping with the feelings of severe hunger even if I wasn't restricting as intensely. Thank you for your response! I'll definitely look into trying some caffeinated pain relievers alongside a potential sports drink. Would you think that the reason people have increased hunger in the first place is because of the body working harder to expel the left over lining?,False,True

Or Midol (which is tylenol, aspirin, and caffeine). The caffeine may help with appetite. I drink lots of Gatorade Zero or the Body armor lite (40 cal/bottle but it has a lot more potassium and that helps with cramps, plus less sodium than Gatorade or Powerade zero so that helps me not bloat).",False,False
