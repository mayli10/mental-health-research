Because I remember seeing your post actually if so, I had also did a monologue performance for my drama class (from taken excerpts from WINTERGIRLS of all things, damn) and while it seemed good I immediately regretted it. Except that the rest of my classmates (whoâ€™ve I had for semester 1 + 2) never seem to mention it.  At the same time, mine is just a performance for a class while yourâ€™s is an important work, but you put too much work in to discredit the true, emotional thought and effort you put in every page.  Iâ€™m pretty sure most people who see your work wonâ€™t think immediately that itâ€™s you, and if they do then they might just have pity, which sounds worse but people are too awkward and unsure to ever act out on their thoughts so.... lol  But EDâ€™s donâ€™t make sense. I literally performed the monologue to try to force myself to restrict and fast before, but all I did was binge and I was at my highest weight when I performed too.   Sorry if it sounds like Iâ€™m making this about me, but trust me when I say people will either forget it or leave thinking of the story, no one thinks of the authorâ€™s face when they think of an iconic book like War and Peace.   I hope youâ€™re able to not beat yourself up, donâ€™t feel guilty either way. :)",False,False
