If I talk to them theyâ€™ll just say Iâ€™m too sensitive, and if I go to the manager theyâ€™ll be pissed off at me. I canâ€™t avoid working with them because I only work Saturdays during school and they all work Saturdays too. Itâ€™s easier for me to just pretend it doesnâ€™t affect me rather than stir up conflict.   Thank you for offering advice though. It feels a little better just being able to talk about it, even to strangers on the internet. I hope your day is going better than mine. ðŸ’•",False,True

Iâ€™ll bet they donâ€™t say anything similar to each other.   I second going to HR. And create a paper trail! Write down exactly what they say and the time/date they say it. Talk to the other girls and see if theyâ€™d be willing to do the same, as well as sign a document stating theyâ€™ve experienced or witnessed this harassment as well and have an issue with it. The more proof and support you have means the better of a case youâ€™ll have for HR! And if you can, get video or audio!!   And tbh, I feel like when you make it a mission like that, it kind of distracts from how hurtful the words are. Like haha, bitches. Iâ€™m about to get you for these crimes. Just keep on makin it worse for yourselves. &gt;:)   Nothing is more pleasing than spite and vindication. Lmao",False,False
