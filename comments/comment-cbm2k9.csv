Also, there's one line of thinking that says all eating disorders are restrictive, even those characterized by binging. The restriction can be mental (telling yourself you can't have certain foods or feeling deprived) rather than physical (actually depriving yourself of them) but sometimes the end result (binging) is the same. Binging is a natural response to restriction. It might help to try and think of it that way, as opposed to thinking of the disordered part as only taking place during restriction. Regardless you deserve help for all of it.",False,False

Not sure if it'd specifically fall into the category of anorexia but it's definitely an eating disorder.,False,False
