My younger sister has been my current weight or less her whole life and when she wants to lose weight, no one says a word. It's a weird place to be for sure.   What is it about going home?! I always feel like I'm going to be ""found out"" so I make sure they see me eat. And now I can't stop... The very first time that someone referred to me as skinny was so bizarre. That had never been said to me in my whole life, even when I was smaller in high school (but still higher than my current weight).  Thank you for your kind words. I have been thinking about seeking help for a few months but I was so afraid of being shut down because I wasn't ""sick enough"" and if it didn't go well I don't know that I would ever make another attempt. I still feel like my doctor didn't know exactly what to do with me but it wasn't a totally negative experience and she did did suggest therapy and scheduled a follow up in a few weeks. I hope that you find some peace as well, if that is what you're looking for. Take care of yourself.",False,True

Literally the same starting weight (but I'm 100 down, not 110 :( ) and I'm nowhere near underweight, but my mom says the same to me.  It's frustrating because I think she only says that because there's a big difference, and I definitely still have obvious fat to lose before looking unhealthy.  If I was normal weight my whole life, I don't think anyone would comment, but they see me as the fat one and now it's weird that I'm not obese.  And I have the same reaction when I spend time at home! My brain switches for a second and is like ""ok you're skinny now see you have to put one weight!!!!!"" and I eat and eat and eat and then feel awful but can't stop. I'm so afraid to go back home in a month.  Good for you for seeking help, I know that gaining and not being able to restrict is stressful, but I hope you find some peace/middle ground and I wish you the best.",False,False

I have had longer periods of binge eating in the past but they never last this long so I think that is why it is making me so upset.",False,True
