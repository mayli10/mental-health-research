Technically my goal body is muscular and well within a healthy bmi range, but for some reason I feel like I *have* to maintain underweight first. A lot of times I see women who are within a healthy/high healthy bmi range and wish I looked like that, and the urge to just, you know, eat normally is really strong.   ...but then I always feel like I have to look at thinspo and trigger myself to continue losing so I don’t “give in”. I don’t know if it’s a compulsion or what but I just have a hard time accepting that I might like myself at a healthy BMI.   I have a feeling that this will eventually become the reason I’ll recover, but I need to get worse before that can happen.",False,False
