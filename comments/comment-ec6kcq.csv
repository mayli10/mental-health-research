Also, I don’t want help in the first place. I know what they’re gonna tell me. I’ve had issues with food since I was literally like 4. Overeating most of my life. Now restricting. I know exactly why. I know what a nutritionist will tell me.  I won’t do literally anything they tell me. I also don’t want a diagnosis. I thought I wanted one but I don’t want that attached to my name for the rest of my life.",False,True

It kind of sounds like he’d just be referring you to a speciality doctor who could help alongside with your current therapist which could be very beneficial :),False,False

It’s really hard to switch councillors (sp?) especially when it takes that long to build trust. I would continue that trust and let them know how you’re feeling “I understand that you want to do what’s best for me, and so do I, but this situation really scares me and I’d like to stay with you” or something along those lines ! Please keep us updated OP I hope everything goes well 💛💛",False,False
