I have toyed with the idea of sending him an email, or maybe even writing him a letter and having him read it while we're in bed together. I know I'll need to have everything I want to say pre-formed because I don't do well organizing my thoughts in real time during something super devastating like this. I feel sick and like a hole is in my stomach because I know once I do this there is no going back, the seal is broken and both of our lives changed forever. If I have to be honest with myself, I think a motivator for not telling him is so that I can continue on with what I'm doing and that I don't want anyone or anything to interfere with my WL. =(",False,True

I know that when my boyfriend told my mom I had been b/p she really wished I felt close enough to her to open up to her about it. Now, if I'm having a rough day and relapse with purging, I tell her very soon afterwards. If I'm restricting hard and manage to eat anyways, I tell her. I dont tell her everything, but I'm a lot closer to her, and she's told me that she appreciates how hard it is for me, and that she's happy that I tell her these things.  I know that from an SO point of view, if I thought my boyfriend had an eating disorder, I'd want HIM to tell ME because I'd want him to feel as comfortable as possible disclosing it.  It sounds like you know you gotta tell him soon. If it's too hard to say it out loud you can go my route, write a letter explaining things, have him read it in a different room, and then come back to you and you guys can discuss it more freely. Probably less extreme emotions as well.  Idk if that would help you, but it's what I do cause I physically CANNOT say hard things, like I'll choke. Anyways, good luck, and remember he supports you and loves you",False,False
