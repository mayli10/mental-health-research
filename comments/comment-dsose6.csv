I like the beat and the refrain is cathartic for me. It hits me partly because the lyrics talk about ‘...when we were young / and didn’t care if we messed up...’ and I genuinely remember no age at which that was my reality. I have *always* cared.   And **“Short Skirt/Long Jacket”** by Cake (which is an old song but always makes me chuckle.),False,False
