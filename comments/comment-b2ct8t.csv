It's also hard to explain it to people who don't have the same mindset about being fat that I do because they don't get what the big deal is, and also make me feel like a bad person for feeling such a way despite it being ingrained in me since early childhood.  I have an appointment on Friday and I think I will tell her. At least mention it. You made me realise that my weight and eating disorder is actually one of the main problems that is keeping me depressed, anxious, and suicidal right now.

It is really difficult. Especially when you already hate that part of you and to see so many comments about how fat people are disgusting and such. Makes me feel even worse about myself which only increases the likelihood that I will binge.  Another issue is that I'm on psychotropic medication for psychosis and mood disorders and those medications really make it hard to lose weight. Something like 54% of people with psychotic disorders are obese because of a combination of how the symptoms of the disorder make you mostly sedentary as well as the medications can affect your metabolism and hunger.  It is really hard. I wish i could just lose the weight and be healthy. : (  Another difficult thing is that people see fat people and assume that they must be lazy and all sorts of negative things and not understand that they may be suffering from an eating disorder. Unfortunately people are judgemental rather than understanding. I feel like the prevalence of BED and EDNOS are really high among the obese population and that it is underdiagnosed.,False,False
