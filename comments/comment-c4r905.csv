For a person who is 100 pounds, 1000 steps is around 28 calls. If you’re 120 it’s 33, if you’re 140 it’s 38, 160 is 44. It’s just an estimate but hopefully that gives you a bit of a better idea.",False,False

Less than 15k would probably be light, 15-35k moderate to high depending on intensity and 35k+ as high. This is assuming the steps are only walked, though. If any of it is run then it could easily be high.  Source: drove myself crazy over this q for years :’)",False,False

Regarding the calories you can use this site to know how much you are burning.  https://www.mapmyride.com/improve/calorie_calculator/  Been using for a while and it seems accurate.,False,False
