I get it hardcore, and so do many of the people on this sub.  It makes a lot of sense, from an evolutionary standpoint. Resources were scarce, so it's natural that we would develop a strong, emotional response to a perceived threat to our resources. When we restrict, we can feel like there are very few foods we ""can"" eat, and therefore feel like our resources are very limited. So when we find safe foods, they become very precious to us. If something threatens that, like being taken without our knowledge or permission, it's understandable, IMO, to get upset about it. Then add on an extra layer of human socialisation that makes us extra frustrated by having our requests ignored or overruled and it's a very frustrating, upsetting situation to be in.  If something happens to my food I've set aside, or if something interrupts my specific food plans, I get very upset and its source is fear/anxiety around food insecurity. Self-talk helps - I remind myself that there is more food, I can get more at any time (not literally ANY time, but in the grand scheme of things, I won't be without that food forever), and that I have other foods I can eat instead that are also safe for me.  It sucks that your family has just recently started ignoring your boundaries. Depending on how comfortable you are around them, could you maybe ask them why? Why do they feel the need to touch your food? If they like your food, they should get some for themselves and some for you, and leave your portion alone. That's only fair.   Honestly, it would be very petty, but if they didn't respond well I would start taking their food and destroying it then saying you ""ate"" it. Maybe if they understand firsthand what it's like to be looking forward to eating something only for it to disappear unexpectedly, they might have a shred more understanding. (This would only work if this is a genuine misunderstanding/lack of context on their part, though, and not them intentionally mistreating you.)",False,False

For what reason, I have no fucking clue. Iâ€™m the only person in my family who likes honey. I legitimately was suicidal after I found out someone threw it out. Was it an overreaction? Yes. But I canâ€™t control how I feel about food. I got that honey at a farmers market. It tasted like no honey Iâ€™ve ever tasted before. And Iâ€™ll never be able to buy it again. Iâ€™m still so upset over that ðŸ™ƒ",False,False
