It's more psychological than physical with suppositories I think. It shouldn't be painful, and if it is then something is wrong. If you decide to try them I recommend latex or nitrile gloves + water based lube.   I prefer them because I can't afford the gamble of longer acting ones that sometimes start working way later than they say they should. I want to be able to handle it in the evening and not be worried that I'll have uncontrollable diarrhea or excruciating cramps at work the next day. ",False,False

I combine an osmotic lax with a stimulant lax. I usually use mag citrate because it's fast, but there are times that doesn't work for me.   More extreme options that you put up your butt, but they work faster: fleet saline enema (salt water basically, osmotic laxative), glycerin enema (osmotic laxative), glycerin suppository (osmotic laxative) and bisacodyl suppository (stimulant laxative).  I'd also suggest eating some corn. It doesn't have to be a ton, but that way you'll be able to see that the backlog (teehee ""log"") has been completely cleared out.   There are also certain yoga poses that help. I do the ones that are supposed to help with passing gas when my stomach is all gurgley from an osmotic lax. ",False,False

My go-to is always milk of magnesia. It tastes awful and you will probably gag. But then somewhere between 2 and 8 hours later, you'll feel a lot better. It works best if you take it with a lot of water.   Try to avoid senna going forward. Even though it's ""natural"" it's still a stimulant and prolonged use can damage the nerves in your gut, causing you to become dependent on them. Milk of magnesia is an osmotic laxative, which means it works by watering down your poop so it passes easier. It also means fewer cramps, too. :)",False,False
