People see a body they like better than their own, they make stupid wishes. I’m willing to bet people with physical maladies that cause low body weight hear similarly stupid things.   The way I’ve tried to explain it at times is that my AN wasn’t about just ‘not feeling like eating’, it was about actively wanting to not eat. But then having to eat. Which can cause distress so overwhelming you want to collapse in the grocery aisle and rock back and forth with your head in your hands. It’s wanting to scream at your brain to stfu about the effing numbers. It’s spending an hour looking at restaurant menus before going out, and *still* being unsure of what to get. It’s constipation, and fatigue, and heart palpitations, and stress fractures.   What I want to say to them is... Yes, my sweet summer child, I understand that you like the number sewn into the waist of my jeans more than the number sewn into the waist of your own. But I promise you. I *promise* you. You do not want the reality that got me there. The reality that doesn’t stop when you hit your preferred pants size. **This is not a disorder that wants me pretty. This is a disorder that wants me dead.**",False,False
