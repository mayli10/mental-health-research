It sounds scary if you're not used to it, but it'll be much better for you in the long run. üíõ  Eat lots of vegetables, oatmeal (Quaker does flavoured ones which I make with hot water and still love), soft-boiled eggs. There are loads of filling options. You will definitely not gain on 1000-1200, it's scientifically impossible, don't worry about it.",False,False

Not anything extravagant and too perfect. Something actually attainable.   I recently saw a post in another sub where a girl was talking about how she started eating 1400 calories instead of 1200 or less or whatever, and finally started to lose weight because she wasn‚Äôt wanting to binge anymore. Eating so few calories (many of us well under 1200 a day) will eventually lead to eating everything. It is such a simple concept, and yet it can seem like that is WAY too many calories for those of us with fucked up eating habits.   Gonna give it a shot.
