It was because my potassium was dangerously low! It could be because of a really low weight as well. I‚Äôd recommend getting your levels checked at the doctor to see if it gives you any answers. I started taking potassium supplements and it helped a lot. Please stay safe!,False,False

As a reply to the question about fruits I'd suggest  pomegranates, grapes, cherries, bananas.. any really.. if still not helping - have you tried to sneak in some ""actual"" sugar stuff in your diet? Also what about vitamins?",False,False
