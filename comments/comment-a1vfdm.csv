Trust me though you‚Äôre burning a lot of calories by standing for that long so you probably can afford to eat enough to feel more solid before you work.

I work a job where I'm standing and walking a lot and it can be tough when I'm fasting. Unfortunately I think you're gonna have to at least bring a small snack or some kind of drink (today I had an aloe drink that was 80 calories). I know we're ultimately committed to getting our bodies, but you have to also understand that we have to work at making the other parts of our life fit too. And if your job is a lot of standing then you're going to be burning more calories than you would a desk job. So you can afford some calories in because of the extra calories you're burning.

Don't put yourself in a position that would make you pass out at work, the mental suffering of it won't be worth it. Bring a snack, do some discreet exercises while you're there, and I promise you that the balance of that will not fuck up any progress you've made or cause some downfall.
