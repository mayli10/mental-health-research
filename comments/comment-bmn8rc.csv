I assume so that doctors can see and take measures before I'd drop too low. I guess afterwards it's more of maintaining. It's just so many problems with work, family and money just keep sending me into restriction because its my only cope. Thank you for your nice words! Best of luck to you as well. Everyone with this shit, just deserves the best to happen to them.",False,True

You got this, tough it out, help lift eachother.   Don’t feel guilty and spiral more into this rabbit hole, just understand that slips n slides are okay &amp; making mistakes is normal.

I wish I also got over my food discomfort so his effort could be properly appreciated. But my fucking lizard brain just wants pain and suffering with any cost.",False,True

He puts up with so much of my whining and lying about food and isn't mad. How can I wish I was just sick and starving? He's basically saving my life but my brain wants something else,False,True
