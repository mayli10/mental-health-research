My GI issues definitely contributed to my ED though. My relationship with food has become so negative since then and I feel like food and exercise is the only thing I can truly control about my body so it gives me some comfort.   And bummer :( i hope you'll be able to get through this! It's not easy, but a little support goes a long way from my experience. my PMs are always open if you want to talk more or rant or whatever.

Were they caused by your ED, or unrelated? In the case that  they were unrelated, do you think they contributed to your ED at all?  Thank you again for the information by the way, it is really helpful.  I actually just had a meal plan increase because the treatment team were getting concerned about my lack of weight gain progress, and the TPN isn't enough right now. So she said I either either need to increase my intake, or get the NG tube. She was pushing me toward trying to eat more real food but I told her I would rather get a tube because I think eating even MORE real food would be too way too difficult for me at this point, seeing as I can barely manage my current portions... But then she backtracked and kind of seemed reluctant to agree to the tube and said if I got it I'd have to move to a different ward (a more restricted, intense one) because they don't have the required facilities for it here. So for now I don't think it's a feasible option for me :/",False,True

I don't think you should be so hard on yourself though, it sounds like you really struggled with it and you needed that time to realize how to heal yourself &lt;3  I think I'm starting to struggle with the stubbornness thing myself, too. When I first got here, I figured it was all over and now that I was in treatment my weight &amp; eating would be out of my hands. I thought I wouldn't have to worry about it anymore and as soon as I went IP i would magically start gaining weight and I could just let the professionals take care of my recovery process. But now I see that I was dumb for thinking things would automatically change just because I am in a hospital now, and it really sucks cause I'm so exhausted and wish I could just be done with all of this already.  Right now  I'm starting to feel all ambivalent and weird and reluctant about recovery/eating/weight gain again and it's seriously messing with me. I refused to drink my meal replacement shake today or eat dinner tonight because I already passed the conditions for remaining in treatment in the open ward for this week (have to comply with my treatment plan 5/7 days of the week or I will get moved to the closed ward, which is much more intense, uncomfortable, and restricted) and in my mind, I can't justify eating anything beyond the absolute bare minimum that I have to. I know it's dumb because I'm here to gain weight and recover but that feels so distant &amp; unattainable right now and in the moment, I feel really conflicted and guilty even for eating this amount.  They haven't even mentioned refeeding syndrome to me, so I guess they aren't really worried about it? I dunno. I actually did a super disordered thing and tried to roughly calculate how many calories my current daily intake is, and it's about 1000\~ish calories a day including the TPN (I looked up the brand of formula, it's 800 calories a bag &amp; and only about 2/3 of it has been going in a day cause my veins are shrunken and shitty. The meal replacement drink I have at lunch is 200 cals, and I'm guessing my 1/4 portions of dinner are around 200\~300 calories). And they jumped into that pretty much right away with no problems arising besides a bit of stomach upset.",False,True

So I was placed in the general psychiatric ward of a large university hospital complex that has lots of separate departments, where they can call in doctors and use resources from all the other departments so I can receive treatment for my mental &amp; physical health all in one place. But I don't have much in the way of a meal plan or dieticians or anything, and none of my doctors specialize in or have much experience with EDs. There is a nutritionist included on my treatment team, but she only swings by once or twice a week or so since she's not part of the ward.  As for the food, again, this isn't an ED ward so what I get is just the random hospital food. Because I had so much difficulty eating it they have made a few of exceptions and notes in my charts for what comes on my tray but generally, it's not something I or the doctors can choose. I opted for the western menu instead of the Korean menu because it seems like more of my safe foods fall under that category. Usually it's a salad with cream soup, a side of some sort, and a main that has some kind of protein with some sauteed vegetables. It's been really hard to cope with because sometimes the main dishes are things like fried, breaded pork cutlets or greasy hamburger steaks drowning in tomato sauce which is incredibly shocking and terrifying for me to have to attempt to eat.  The rule my treatment team has set up so far is that I have to eat at least 1/4 of every separate food item on the tray. A nurse checks my tray after I'm done eating, but no one even watches me while I eat lol. I haven't pulled any tricks or anything so far and have mostly remained faithful to the 1/4 rule, but it makes me raise an eyebrow and feel dubious about the effectiveness of the treatment here sometimes because I could literally just throw it all out and no one would know or care. The food I do eat, I eat in an extremely disordered way, taking 3 hours on average to eat that 1/4 portion of dinner l and 2 hours to drink 200ml of the Ensure type thing. I can't do ALL of the rituals and behaviors I did at home simply because I am physically unable to (in a wheelchair rn) or don't have the right tools/am not in the same environment, but I still do a lot of them. I cut my food into small pieces, move the pieces around from plate to plate in a compulsive ritualistic way, and separate &amp; categorize everything into rows on my plate. I also still use tiny utensils (they let me bring my own), water the soup down and reheat it 5-6 times a meal, and obsessively sprinkle different combinations of seasonings onto the food out of fear that the next bite won't be ""perfect"" and to make up for watering everything down.",False,True

Most of the doctors have been gone from the ward for the past few days for the holidays (Lunar New Year) but they should be back today for a meeting, maybe it'll come up in discussion then and I can ask them about it.  &amp;#x200B;  I would say my loss of appetite is both physical and psychological. My hunger and satiety cues are completely fucked atm so I am pretty much never hungry. Having no appetite/weird stomach issues when I *do* happen to eat certainly doesn't help, but generally, the bigger issue in getting my meals down is the mental part. I am terrified of food. Even the small foil packet of the meal-replacement drink I get at lunch is difficult enough to choke down, so eating actual food is just an absolute horror. Dinnertime is a huge ordeal of crying, pulling at my hair, choking on anxiety, yelling, and hitting myself in the head every single time. They do give me an anxiolytic (alprazolam) an hour before every mealtime, which has SIGNIFICANTLY helped me in getting the food down, but it's still a rough experience.",False,True

I've had an NG tube placed once. Its not pleasant but you can get through it.   The tube feed will increase your stool looseness and frequency unless they give you a formula with added fiber (like promote with fiber) to slow transit time.   The best option is honestly going to be eating actual foods. I don't know if your loss of appetite is physiological or psychological. What foods are they giving you to actually eat? You're going to want to go for things that are very energy dense, like full fat versions of Greek yogurt, and things like but butters that you can eat a small amount of but get maximum calories.

Don’t be as stubborn as me. It fucking sucks and I regret every minute I wasted there. Incredibly grateful I received the treatment I did and that it gave me the tools to recover when I am ready, but it was still stupid to try and avoid eating once i was somewhere where the entire point is to eat.   Rate of weight gain is going to be determined by your energy requirements and how much formula they can push without making you sick. If you become hypermetabolic and need 60+ cal/kg to gain a kg, then you’re likely to be there for many weeks at a minimum. The most super aggressive WR targets I’ve seen tend to be about 2kg/wk, but obviously I am not a doctor and you should trust them over random strangers with Pubmed access.   Your stat will also be extended because you’re well below the weight where medical complications during refeeding are a risk (&lt;15 is where many start cropping up). You’ve been on TPN for a while which probably defrays the risk of refeeding syndrome occurring now, but I’m sure it’s a concern on their minds and will stop them feeding you at 100% of what’s needed to gain straight away.

My weight went up farily quickly and went up enough to get me to a more stable point, but in order to gain more I did eventually need to transition to an NG tube, and then real to real food after rhat.    I had an NG tube for about 2 weeks and then i started trying to eat real food. It was difficult because I hadn't had actual food in so so so long at that point, but i was eventually able to get through it. The NG tube helped me gain some more weight, a little bit more than the TPN iirc, but ultimately, i view it more as a helpful stepping stone to being able to tolerate real food because real food is what helped me gain the most and get to a healthier state.    That was the longest amount of time that I had an NG tube. I've had about 6 within the last 2 years, but the other ones were mainly to empty my stomach because i had pseudo-obstructions. They have to use a larger tube for that, so I'd say i'm pretty experienced in the world of having-a-tube-in-muh-nose.    Side note: i highly recommend starting a little slow on the tube feedings and then increasing the rate at which the tube-fed food enters your stomach over the course of a couple days. They started my feedings at too fast of a rate at first and i had a couple of stomach aches because of that. They weren't horrible, just annoying. ",False,False

I wasn't sure how long the weight restoration period in inpatient treatment usually lasts, but I didn't know it could take that long...  I've got about 10 kg/22 lbs to gain before I reach the goal weight my treatment team set (45 kg/100 lbs). I'm currently 35 kg/77 lbs. At this point I'm a bit concerned &amp; anxiously wondering how long I'm going to have to stay inpatient, since it's been a whole week and I've only gained a pound or so when they initially said they wanted me to gain 6~8 lbs per week.  For now they've sent a blood sample in for testing to check all my levels and see if they need to change anything in my formula to help me start gaining, but if that doesn't work maybe I will ask about switching to the NG tube instead. It kind of freaks me out somehow imagining the discomfort but at this rate I feel like I'm not making any progress... it does sound convenient to not have to be hooked up to an IV stand all the time, though!  How quickly did you gain on the NGT? Even though I know I need to gain weight  the thought of putting it on TOO quickly is kind of intimating, too.

Oh, so I guess they do administer through a central line for EDs sometimes too! Wasn't sure if it was even an option for me... good to know. Thanks for sharing your experience!

I vastly prefer the latter; it can be disconnected when you’re not receiving a feed and it’s much easier to push the quantities of supplement required for aggressive weight restoration compared to IV.

If you need to be on 24/7 feeds some places have pumps that can be worn in a backpack or sling so you don’t have to wheel an IV pole everywhere.
