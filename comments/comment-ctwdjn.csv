A few months ago I was using my friend’s mirror to do my makeup and I realized how thin my face is, which was a huge surprise. I also recently saw a video of myself that was at a different angle and that shocked me because I looked so different than how I see myself in the mirror. Pictures from my sister’s wedding do the same thing. I think the way you usually look at yourself in the mirror/looking down at your body is how you usually view yourself and it’s easier to distort that versus seeing yourself in a novel position/way, but I don’t know 🤷🏻‍♀️",False,False
