It may be good for the health of your relationship too; if you both have those struggles it could easily escalate and become damaging or toxic, so why not just address it now? It won’t be easy and may be emotional, but if you guys can handle it, it may just make your relationship stronger. :)   You guys can do what my best friend and I do- we both have EDs and since we live far away, we always spend weekends or a few days together when we hang out. I was concerned about it becoming and issue so I addressed it early on and found something that works for us:   I always tell her that I won’t pressure her to eat &amp; it isn’t my role, or healthy for me to monitor and comment on what she’s eating. However, when we’re together I make sure that we have drinks and snacks/meals that we both feel comfortable eating (we largely eat the same things lol). I put it on the counter and eat things as I want them, and encourage her to do the same if she feels up to it. At this point she just goes in my fridge if she’s over and wants something, but I feel like just fostering a supportive encouraging environment around food &amp; having it easily accessible is the best I can do for her, and the best environment for me surrounding food. When I go over her house, even if her anorexia is bad, she does the same for me.   It can be hard and takes self awareness, but working together to both learn your triggers, and are able to find ways to work around them, it’ll benefit you and your boyfriend. It may take adjusting to, but in the long run it’ll likely strengthen and elongate your relationship.   I hope you guys find something that works; my ED destroyed my first long term relationship, but it may have been for the best. I know how chaotic it can be. Just try, and do your best. That’s all you can do. :) cheers",False,False
