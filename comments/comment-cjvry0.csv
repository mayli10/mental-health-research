You’re the one posting on an eating disorder subreddit. I was only trying to help from the perspective of someone with one.      Be well.,False,False

But shortly after that, when your body is so malnourished that your stomach swells to 10x its’ size because you ate a grape, it’s not so glamorous.      Again, if you’re truly afraid of that slippery slope, you need to focus on yourself and bettering your mind. If you have a healthy communication with yourself, that health will project outward and reflect itself in what you put in your body.",False,False

I've come here because I am sincerely afraid that I might fall for the slippery slope any day now.  I know how it works, I need to ingest less calories than those I burn. And he most efficient way I feel like (ab)using is no eating at all. Probably a stupid way of thinking but the most effective nonetheless, perhaps?",False,True

Anorexia is a deeply rooted disease that goes way beyond just “not eating”.      If your weight is bothering you that much, and it seems like it is, then wanting to change is the first step. Look into some healthier eating habits and do some inner searching to find out why and how you got to this point. You need to find a healthy way of speaking to yourself, without focusing on GUILT or SHAME. Talk to yourself like you would a close friend that’s hurting.     Going back to your “stop eating” mantra, maybe there’s a little truth in that. Remember, gaining weight is a VERY simple mathematical problem of consuming more calories than you burn. You burn calories by living, but if you eat 3500 calories more than you burn, that’s 1lb. Same goes for losing weight, just the opposite. Snacking is a BIG issue for a lot of people because those calories add up. Focus your attention inward and learn what it feels like to be satisfied, and THEN “stop eating”.      Maybe instead of looking on here, check out some healthy meal prep or recipe subreddits that could help kick start your weight loss journey.      Be well, my friend.",False,False
