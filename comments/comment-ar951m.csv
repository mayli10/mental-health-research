I'm not so much as allowed to walk down the street alone, so a hotel is out of the question. There are no facilities nearby aside from this specific one so my options are very limited.  I'm not committed or interested in recovery but since I'm a minor, I'm forced into it. I'm aware that I should focus on recovery if I'm so set on helping my parents, since that's what would help them most. But, I guess I'm too selfish for that. I'm going to gain the weight regardless of what I want though.  All your suggestions and questions are good ones, but my options are weight gain at home with stress on my parents or weight gain at the inpatient facility.",False,True

If all you're doing is looking to give your parents a break (not actively seeking treatment/to get better), then why not spend the same amount of time/money and just get a hotel room for a week or take a little vacation?   Alternatively, if you really want to commit to yourself/treatment and go inpatient, wouldn't it be worth it to find a better facility that you'd actually get quality care and treatment? If you're going to go, might as well do it fully and do it right?",False,False

It definitely took a weight off my mom's shoulders. If you have any questions about it feel free to DM me,False,False
