It's SO common in movies from the 90s, I even remember jokes like that in some early 2000s Hillary Duff movie. I'm glad those type of jokes aren't quite so prevalent now. ",False,True

At the time, I was trying to recover from anorexia and b/p ing frequently. I was at my boyfriend's house and his dad made a bulimia joke.

It‚Äôs happened before... I actually noticed it more with my American friends. I‚Äôm Canadian. Not sure if it has anything to do with it but it pisses me off so much. I remember we were on vacay and this girl started using a ditzy voice and saying she was going to throw up after lunch - essentially saying all girls with ED‚Äôs are ditzy and dumb. I had to get up and leave the table. People are so ignorant. This was 5 years ago. I like to think people have changed but I‚Äôm not sure that‚Äôs the case.  I also remember my older male cousin joking about how ‚Äúif you want to lose weight just stick your finger down your throat.‚Äù I couldn‚Äôt believe it. About two years later I became bulimic and I‚Äôll never forget how ignorant he was for saying that. I didn‚Äôt know if it was him saying indirectly I had gained weight or what it was but god he was (and still is) a dick.,False,False
