Mine wasn’t a stranger, but this summer I went and picked up one of my brother’s friends, who’s about a year younger than me. I hadn’t seen him in a couple months at the time, and when he got in the car he looked me up and down, laughed, and said, “I forgot you’re such a small person.” I think I protested and insisted I wasn’t, but secretly it warmed my heart. Compliments like that feel so good because of that little moment of clarity where you realize that not everyone sees you the way you see yourself.",False,False

I hear that type of thing at work all the time regarding the carts or pallets I'm pulling. I usually find it more insulting, implying that I must be a weak helpless girl. However, one guy saw me lifting something heavy the other day, did a double check and proclaimed ""You must be Hercules!!"" For some reason that one made me smile despite the other comments being taken as insults. Brains are weird.",False,False
