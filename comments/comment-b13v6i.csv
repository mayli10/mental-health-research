However, no matter how long or little I wait, it’s nearly impossible for me to purge cookies or other flour-based sweets! It sucks and I have no idea why ",False,False

I mostly just eat big portions of normal food and enjoy the feeling of fullness for close to an hour before purging. Purging right away makes eating the food in the first place feel pointless because hunger hasn't had time to fully go away.  Even if I did absorb 25% of the calories within the time I wait (highly unlikely with my slow digestion), I could still eat 4000 calories a day to lose a pound per week without feeling hungry for most of the time.",False,False
