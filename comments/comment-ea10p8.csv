I was able to say to my fianc√© ‚ÄúI am going to have problems with eating breakfast today because I am not used to eating this early because sometimes if I do, it triggers obsessive binge/craving thoughts for the rest of the day, so can you keep me occupied/talk me through it?‚Äù It‚Äôs me being able to say to my close friend, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm starting IOP in January and I‚Äôm scared.‚Äù And allowing her to console me and talk me through it. So often, we deny ourselves self love and the love of others. Being secretive about our pain is another way we deny ourselves the more gentler things in life.   And, honestly, there is something so powerful a lot of us to say ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt do this alone. I need help.‚Äù It‚Äôs a type of vulnerability that strengthens us at the deepest levels.",False,False

Kind of makes me think of what my sister is going through with addiction - it's only just come to light in a real way, she's getting help for it now, and the fact that for once it's ""out in the open"" seems to be so important: it thrived in the dark, in secrecy and shame. I was terrified when she was in the stage of trying to shove it all back under wraps and minimise it and I know for her a big part of that was attached to the shame she felt around it, which paradoxically seems lessened now that she's in treatment and being so open with us.  All that being said, my answer to ""are you okay"" is still always I'm fine, I'm handling it ü§ê",False,False

People get this very specific glint of pity in their eyes when they ask if I'm okay. I get that this is no longer an invisible illness bc I actually look sick now but it makes me feel so terrible - very much a just-been-stabbed feeling, like please don't worry about me, I'll handle it. Laughing about it would be great tbh. I think that's my favourite thing about this sub alongside the solidarity - we can laugh about the sheer absurdity together.",False,False
