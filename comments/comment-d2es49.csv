This guy doesn't sound like he has your interests truly in mind. And again, I'm automatically SUPER skeptical of any gastro who is ignorant of how EDs can effect the gastrointestinal tract. If it's at all possible, I'd look for another doctor. I know it can be hard to get in with specialists, but it's better to start looking now than to waste time on a doctor who isn't truly invested in diagnosing you.",False,False

All I managed was that I missed a lot of school because of this and then he would start saying what he wanted to talk about.,False,True

Unfortunately, I think you need a new gastroenterologist. Weird that he'd deny you the endoscopy, and for real, idk how you could be a gastroenterologist and be unaware of the ED/gut motility link???  frankly, he sounds like one of those male doctors who kinda jumps to IBS for any woman who has gastrointestinal issues, and then stop thinking about the diagnosis. (Due in part to unconscious sexism, and the idea that women are hypochondriacs/drama queens/whatever). I'm not saying you don't have IBS - it is indeed a common condition, and worth considering in your search for answers - but if your gut (heh) is telling you there's something deeper going on, listen to that.   Shit, and I only just noticed what you wrote there at the end. You were bedridden for weeks, and his response was to recommend more fiber? That is so messed up, and it's clear to me that he's not taking you seriously as a patient. New doctor, ASAP!",False,False

I would def get a second opinion, that sounds incredibly suspect. Obviously he‚Äôs a doctor and I‚Äôm not, but my experience was very different so I wanted to chime in for you!!  Having eating disorders (which can be [either/and/or] acute, chronic, mild, or serious in all combinations) can cause some complex health issues. I really hope you find a good doctor who can help!!  Side note!! Fiber makes my abdominal pain SO MUCH worse. Too much fiber and it‚Äôs absolutely assured I will be constipated for the Rest of Time‚Ñ¢Ô∏è. Worse, for me, too much fiber can be like, literally one apple? I‚Äôm a mess.",False,False

Also, if it doesnt help, you can then tell your next doctor that you've already tried that and it didnt work - that's another piece of data he can use to help diagnose you.",False,False

I definitely would like an endoscopy test, but he immediately refused to do that. That's like a big part of his job though. I don't get why he wouldn't do that when he described himself as ""an endoscopy guy"". üòû",False,True
