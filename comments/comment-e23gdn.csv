Some of them are more crucial than others). There's a balance of them that the body naturally holds when you eat enough and pay attention to balanced meals, but with purging/undereating/overexercising/excessive use of laxatives this balance can be blown up pretty hard. Low potassium (which is very common with EDs) is especially dangerous as it can cause serious acute heart issues and seizures so I started to pay extra attention to this. I drink an electrolyte drink every workday just in case (everyday when I'm worse ED-wise). I also found that I feel way more tired if my levels are off and since I work 10 hours a day and I don't eat before 7pm, but at least I keep up with my electrolytes I can manage things easier. I hope I explained it okayish❤",False,True

I always associated them with sodium for some reason, and since I eat so much processed junk I figured sports drinks would be overkill but obviously I have no actual idea what they are lol",False,False

Apart from the energy drink, can't have them because of my heart. But like, chips and sports drinks all the way! So healthy!
