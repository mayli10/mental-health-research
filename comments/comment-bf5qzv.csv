But your boyfriend sounds great, I love that you guys can have dinner dates where you feel comfortable &amp; good around food. :)   I don‚Äôt know your age, but could you simply not involve your parents in this sort of thing from now on? Just realize you can have a relationship with them in every way BUT food. Cut them out of that part of your life, it‚Äôs not serving you &amp; is toxic. Instead, keep up the dates with your boyfriend.",False,False

It must have been so hard to make yourself sit there and eat with them doing that. Maybe next time you are going out to a special meal you can go with just your boyfriend or friends who don't do things like that? Wishing you the best. üíê,False,False
