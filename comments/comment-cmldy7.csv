I've got bulimia, so I know the panic after a binge, but really the ""easiest"" way to not binge is to not purge after a binge.   I've slipped up a couple times but over 2 months I've only purged twice despite having numerous binges- the kicker is that I've only had 1 binge this month when before I'd binge up to every day a week if things were bad. The idea behind not purging is that if you eat say 6000 calories in one sitting and purge until ""completion"" (no more comes up, bile comes up, whatever that means for you) you maybe still absorbed 2000. Your body then interprets 6000 calories of food as only 2000 so you wont be satisfied with what is a normal meal because your body is like ???? I need WAY more than that to get my energy needs!!!!   It's not easy by any means to ""just not purge"" but that is the way I've had the biggest success in the long term to binge less. I hope that helps for you    And I don't know you but I'm sure you have plenty to offer to this world (even if you dont know it yet) beyond what your body looks like. I cant let go of that same desire as you but maybe it'll help to hear that",False,False
