I love planning beforehand (optimizing my list in terms of calories/cravings/coupons/prices is like a game or test for me), obsessing over all the options while I'm there esp. stuff I won't buy, seeing what others are buying, getting home and having safefoods stocked again....  It's bad though because if anything is off or unplanned I will freak out and it becomes the most stressful thing ever: if something I planned on buying is out, or a coupon isn't right, or the store is too crowded/hectic..... it's like a switch flips and I become an anxious wreck.  And of course when I'm bingeing the grocery store becomes like this chaotic enabler and everything goes out the window (calories AND money lmao)",False,False

There is more distance between the food and the act of eating it... before I even get the chance to eat it, I must decide to pick it up, walk to the check out lane, buy it, and drive home with it. There are so many chances to change your mind and delay a mistake. It feels... safe from impulse?",False,False

Iâ€™ve always loved it but I love how succinctly you put this because Iâ€™ve never known why I have such a weird obsession with grocery stores. I work in a shopping centre and even on my break Iâ€™ll just go walk through the grocery store and not buy anything but spend ages in the confectionary aisle ,False,False
