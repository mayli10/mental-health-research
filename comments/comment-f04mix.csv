In this case, that's a good thing, because it helps you gain weight, but the fact that the increased insulin signal is much lower for fat-and-protein than for fat-and-protein-plus-carbs means that more is left over to immediately fuel more expensive metabolic processes, which is because you won't gain weight as fast (because of the lower insulin levels), which could be an issue if putting on a BMI point or two is your primary goal. If your primary goal is getting those expensive metabolic processes back (especially while providing your brain with non-glucose energy, which it may well need if you have something like a seizure disorder), then yes, keto is what's up, and getting up to a healthier weight will be a side effect of it. If the primary goal is gaining, you do need to consume carbs on top of the rest of the diet.",False,False

I’ll try to get more fat in me, but the concept of mechanical eating doesn’t work for me, sadly.  I’ve tried timers and meal plans, but I never stick to them.  I really tried to eat when my timer went off, but my body was like, “Oh, you can just finish this task and then eat.”  Then I forget to eat when I’m done, and so it goes.   Also, I feel really hesitant to label what I have as disordered eating.  It’s liberating, in a way, but I’ve been struggling with this issue my entire life and I feel like I’m “cheating” by saying “Help me with my problems that I’ll never want to willingly fix!” and that slapping “restrictive eating” on something that’s been “normal” for most of my existence is unfair to others who, for instance, struggle with calorie-counting.",False,True

Keto could help you gain as fat is very calorie dense and could make a surplus easier to achieve. Your BMI is very low, and if it drops much lower function will become limited. I think talking to a professional would be really good, your doctor for a start, and perhaps a dietician also. The concept of mechanical eating and being on a meal plan could help you regain your natural hunger cues.",False,False
