Its unreal how I forget the simple things I should do when food becomes an obsession for me. Its like the food and the behaviours around it somehow stop me seeing things clearly- what Im doing to myself. I just slip into denial when my ED is raging inside my body &amp; mind. I didn’t even stop to think why I was doing it but reading your post actually got me thinking about that very thing. Like I said I was triggered a couple weeks ago and I’ve been feeling overwhelmed &amp; under pressure since then: I wasnt consciously aware of this until just now. There is too high of an expectation on me by a loved one at present &amp; I feel guilty that I cant meet their expectation of me.  Its a relief to actually stop &amp; recognise this. OK! Tomorrow is a new day. Ill look at a few Youtube videos (how come I didn’t think of that before you suggested it!) Then Ill get out walking. I love exercise- it makes me feel liek Im taking charge of my recovery. I always feel good after doing some walking but when my food slips so does the exercise. For me the 2 go hand in hand. Thank you for support &amp; I’ll try my best tomorrow again. It is defenitely good to share. I cant do this alone",False,True

I been working out a lot which makes me feel great, even when I am having a horrible day and I don't want to.. I let myself chill until I get restless and than I get back at it. Just take it day by day, start going on walks if anything. Remind yourself as to why you feel the need to binge... I have trouble with binging and it's usually triggered when I feel like crap about other things but, of course, I regret it immediately. Just be smart about your decisions and forgive yourself for weight fluctuations. I know it's hard, but you gotta do it.",False,False
