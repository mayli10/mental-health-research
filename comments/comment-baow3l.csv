I don't feel offended or attacked because I know where you are coming from.  I have never been obese, but I've been slightly overweight and I've been called things that I'd rather forget.    What I really want to make clear here is, that I don't say fat people in general use it as an excuse, but a lot (especially a lot of obese people I know personally). I don't say that all overweight people are lazy or doing nothing for their health!  &amp;#x200B;  I actually feel like I am MORE body positive than **some** obese people who are preaching it, because some of them are all against skinny girls, but Pro ""Plus size"" (like they're advertising it and telling skinny people to put on more weight or normal girls to eat more to get more womanly curves etc.). And for me body positivity is about ALL bodies. For me it's not about being beautiful, but socially accepted and not being discriminated against. Noone should be judged for their body.   You think you're fat and you hate your body (and I know that feeling, because I hate my body too). But I THINK everyone should love their body, because without our bodies we wouldn't be alive and in the end it's all we have. And overweight people (or underweight) people SHOULDN'T hate their body, they should LOVE it (yey, body positivity!!) and BECAUSE THEY LOVE IT, they should treat it better! They should treat it with activity, with exercise, with healthy food, fruits and vegetables. Not (only) to lose weight, but to BE healthy. Do you know what I mean? I don't mean it in a mean way, you know? You are enough just the way you are. I just read this one comment of you and I know that you're a wonderful and nice person who will be loved and cared for because you fucking deserve it. But I think if someone really LOVES their body (like those youtubers pretend) then they would want to treat it right... and as long you hate it, you treat it like shit (like I do.. binge and restrict...cause I hate it).  &amp;#x200B;  I actually feel horrible writing this, because I am treating my body horribly, but I think we all know that feeling when we care more about other people than ourselves.   One of my best friends is... reeeally obese and he IS lazy and he LIKES fried food and sweets. And it hurts me because I want him to live a long and healthy life... and when I see obese people... I never think: you're ugly and fat. I see statistics, and HOW MANY obese people get really sick and have really energy-sapping illnesses and so many die at a young age and it really physically hurts me, since I'm going to be a doctor in less than 2 years and I'll see lots of risk factors and most of the time I won't be able to do anything about it because let's be honest: When a doctor talks about the weight of a patient, he/she feels (most of the time) offended and attacked.      I actually want to say more about it but I can't focus anymore because there are too many thoughts about it and I can't get them sorted in my head. And I have 9 exams next week and I actually have to study :/      I really hope that this comment is in round terms and not mistakable and doesn't hurt your or anybodys feelings because that's not my intention. I just want other people to watch after themselves. And I fucking hate it, wenn other people lie about medical-related issues/topics or say that big is beautiful but skinny isn't. ",False,False

It sounds like ""Your body is fine the way that it is, except it's actually not and you need to change it.""  However, i also understand completely that criticism of the movement. This isn't meant to attack your opinion or make you feel bad but rather to discuss it I guess because I understand where you're coming from. However I have also been fat my entire life, and had a very unhealthy relationship with food, so I hang out here. I can tell you 100% that hating my body has never gotten me motivated to lose weight. It just puts me in the yoyo of losing the same 15 pounds, much like it does for people of lower weights than myself. And I will tell you that there is something really demoralizing about knowing that when people tell me that I'm beautiful, I'm enough, I'm loved just the way I am....that there's a caveat to all that and it's that my body is still technically bad and I should actually change it. It irks me that if I'm openly comfortable with myself that is what everyone is thinking deep down. It really amps up my anxiety about it and makes it very hard to like the person in the mirror.   Anyway that's just a perspective. ",False,False

But here comes what annoys me:  I feel like a lot... like A LOT of chubby or **obese people use it as an excuse** to NOT change their lifestyle and their weight. Because ""everyone is beautiful and you have to accept me even though I am overweight""... And when obesity is considered 'beautiful', they don't care about being healthy, but they're actually just lazy! They don't want to lose weight or do anything for their health and say things like ""you only want me to lose weight, because you think it's ugly, you're not concerned about my health,  and I AM healthy!"".... But no. I know you are not! Because even though you don't FEEL anything in that moment, your liver and your heart and your blood vessels are already suffering and fighting for you!  The healthy human brain thinks that **healthy bodies are beautiful** or attractive... and obesity isn't considered attractive (mostly) because it's just not healthy!! (Of course it is the same with too skinny, anorexic woman....)  But I see those body positivity videos of obese people making excuses for not being healthy and staying the way they are but at the SAME TIME they're also skinny-shaming (which really fucks me off!) and talking so much bullshit about medical conditions or health-related stuff, that **I just don't want to be like them... ever.** So yeah, I get where you're coming from, maybe we have different reasons, but the result is the same.

I feel crap too sometimes, but as long as you keep treating everyone with the same amount of respect regardless of weight (except for people who are complete jerks lol) then I don't think there's really an issue.
