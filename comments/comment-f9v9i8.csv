I  get super bad nausea from not eating too along with pain in my ribs and chest (I realize this is not good.) Yesterday was a bad night, I literally had to just sit there chanting in my head that it's mind over matter and that I will be okay. I also lay down with my headphones on and a show playing so I had something in my head to distract me from how I felt. Eventually I was so tired and my only focus was the show and I was able to fall asleep.",False,False

It seems like a waste, but I get bad headaches when I try to sleep when I haven’t eaten for a while. I end up not sleeping or sleeping very little.   I budget calories within my limit for about 1-1.5 hrs before bed. Helps me restrict during the day because at least I know I will eat at some point and I won’t be tossing and turning all night.",False,False
