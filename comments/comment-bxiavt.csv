I'm sorry it was so stressful but I guess if (hopefully when) you decide to recover you know something you can work on.  But I'm glad to hear you dont go through that very often,False,False

I usually do a lot of home cooking, this day was an outlier which I think is part of what made it so stressful. I usually cook and know EXACTLY what’s what, like you said, so switching to not knowing... I guess my mind isn’t ready for that jump just yet.   Anyway, I appreciate the well-thought out post :)",False,True

You can know EXACTLY how much of each ingredient you'll be using. If you want something like chicken in rice, you can add whatever spices you want to the rice while its cooking for super flavorful rice, you have so many options for chicken cuts, cooking types, and spices.  Plus its healthier b/c fresher food has been shown to have more nutrients, so you're getting more nutritional bang for your calorie buck.  And, you can cook exact amounts for you and freeze or refrigerate the foods. So you can buy enough for multiple servings, make one serving, and it's harder to binge because you'd have to go back and cook more servings, so by the time you get to the actual cooking you might have rode the binge urge wave.  Unless you can only afford premade stuff I would definitely recommend cooking for yourself. For me its helped heal my relationship with food a tiny bit. I only binge on processed food now, and have really come to appreciate each bite of a homecooked meal.  Sorry for the rambling, I hope it helped a little tho",False,False

Even before my relapse last month it’s funny how I held onto this habit. I was so out of tune with how disordered my behaviors have still been in the last couple of years.  At least now I’m not half-assing it ¯\_(ツ)_/¯",False,False
