Also I’m sorry if this is not what you’re looking for:     “Normal” I think is hard to define. Especially because finding out your child has been bingeing for 2 years is not a “normal” thing to discover, and everyone handles stress differently.       I imagine it’s devastating to find out emotionally. Here you have this person that you are trying to raise well and do right by. You find out (even if partially) that they have an eating disorder. They’ve had it right under your nose and you haven’t even noticed. There would be a lot of guilt, I think. “Where did I go wrong? What did I do that made this an option? Why didn’t they come to me earlier? Why didn’t I see this happening from the beginning or notice signs of it developing?”      On top of that it’s financially difficult. You can see some of the posts by us older folks in this sub, having an ED is fucking expensive. Buying a luxury high calorie food item just to cry and throw it out without even opening it, (or eat and then purge.) And then do it again that same day. If your parent is supporting you financially, and they’re having a tough time of it, stressing out for months, years, not understanding why the food budget is so so much. But wanting to do their best to support the family.... and then finding out it’s all going down the toilet. I’d definitely be upset. Honestly the degree to which someone gets upset is probably directly related to how tight the budget is. Some parents try to keep money stress away from their kids.     I guess in conclusion, depending on how your parent deals with stress and guilt, it would be reasonable to expect them to lose their shit.      However under no circumstances is it ever reasonable for ANYONE to physically hurt you or verbally abuse you.     Edit: There’s probably also a lot of perspectives to consider I’m not even aware of.",False,False
