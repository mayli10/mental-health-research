When I was 9kg heavier, I thought I had completed my weight loss and saw myself as very thin. I even wore a cosplay costume that was skin-tight and I had such confidence.   This morning, I found out I've gained half a kilo and my hands look bloated. It's probably because I haven't been running to let my sore ankle rest, and I'm less dehydrated, because I haven't been overconsuming caffeine lately.  Despite these explanations, I feel like the weight appeared out of nowhere like a curse and it'll keep increasing forever. I feel like a cow, even though just a couple of days ago I was convinced I wanted to gain weight. And I feel like losing that 0.5kg just to prove that it's not out of my control.",False,False
