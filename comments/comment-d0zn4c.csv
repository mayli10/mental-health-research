As hard as I’ve tried to make it work in the past I’ve come to the conclusion that my brain needs a certain amount of fuel to function well.  Coffee helps too (apparently it’s a nootropic which means that it helps enhance cognitive function) however be careful about drinking too much on an empty stomach because it really messes your insides up.  Good luck ✨,False,False

It’s a *whole new level* of counting cals. That and “The body starts using fat as fuel source only approximately 12 hours after the last fuel intake. After glucose, glycogen and protein(this one partially) have been used up.”  **It’s not strictly what happens** but boii that phrasing is fucked up.",False,False
