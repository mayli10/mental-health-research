I‚Äôm also in a sorority and it helps to have the chapter (and nationals) come together to help them with medical expenses or just visiting them in the hospital. We did that with a sister who got really sick and had to have multiple surgeries - we had like visiting shifts and made cards for her and ordered her food to her room. A lot of sororities have infrastructure to help members with mental health issues btw, make sure to ask your chapter advisor. Remember she‚Äôll probably be furious with you at first but in time she will appreciate you saving her life.",False,False

These disorders kill people and just because someone isn't passed out on the floor doesn't mean their bodies aren't going to fail on them at any time. Nobody got help for me because nobody could see that my heart was in actual pain because they didn't see that i hadn't eaten in a day and covered up my body so well that they didn't know i was far too sick to be fasting. Never wait till it gets so bad you can't ignore it anymore. It doesn't matter that they don't want help because they will die without it at any point in their life and it could be when nobody was around to help in time.  Dont feel bad for saving someone's life!,False,False

We were actually wondering if this is sort of her last cry for help because she didn't even try and tell us that she was okay after we found her passed out in vomit.
