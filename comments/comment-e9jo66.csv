Anytime someone compliments me I always question it, but the couple weeks I was at my LW I feel like I looked like shit. dark circles visible from other space lmao",False,False

It helps me to remember that in some sense, these aren't \*real\* compliments, and not just because they're harmful. People are unconsciously programmed by our society to unthinkingly compliment weightloss, regardless of how it makes them or the people they're talking to feel. When people say that, it's not an expression of how they actually feel, it's just a line they've been taught to repeat.",False,False
