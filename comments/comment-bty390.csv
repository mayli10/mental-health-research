I remember telling my therapist about my ED back in January when I lost 18 pounds in a month, but I was still obese. She didn’t seem concerned about it at all, and now that I think about it she was probably more concerned about my bipolar mania swings. This actually made me feel a lot better too...",False,False

I have had my ups and downs weight wise but would be considered ""anorexic"" ...however I have BED and Bulimic tendencies for anywhere from 2 days to 2 weeks. Binge eating is a horrible thing to go through. It doesn't make sense to so many people because they just think of it as eating because we are ""sad"" or ""happy"" but it is so much more than that.   &amp;#x200B;  It is an uncontrollable impulsive behavior. At times I am not even hungry and do not even want the food but I have it anyway because it is my chance to have it. I can stop a binge mid-day but I don't because I can not shake the urge until waking up with a new day. Other times I am just so focused on the taste I feel like I am high. It is a fucking nightmare girl and I am sorry you go through this.   &amp;#x200B;  Your well being has so much to do with our eating behaviors. They truly go hand in hand. I am so sorry you are struggling so much and that it is not being taken seriously.   &amp;#x200B;  Your pain and your ED are real and valid. I am sorry you have had to go through that. &lt;3",False,False

It's your money, if you want to focus more on the eating stuff keep pushing that. You may have to help the psychiatrist see how it is connected for you... Also the book ""brain over binge"" is really helpful.",False,False

From what you wrote I believe they want to work on your other non ED issues since your weight isn't in a dangerous place right now. If someone came to them who was dangerously underweight they would probably just focus on getting them to eat as any other work would be a waste of time if the patient starved to death before the underlying issues could be helped. I think they believe that your ED is a coping mechanism and by dealing with the other issues they may be able to help the ED issues in response. Your ED is valid its just not a present danger so your psychiatrist has time to possibly help with the depression and loneliness so that you won't feel the drive to binge anymore. I would would trust in your psychiatrist and in the process. You went to them because you wanted help and we're done living like this, let them do what they do best.",False,False

Do you think maybe she was suggesting tackling your mood as the root of the eating behaviour? I could be wrong though because it sounds like she was very dismissive. I hope you get the help you need soon.,False,False
