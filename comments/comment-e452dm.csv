I got so nervous meeting my boyfriend's family and worried about messing things up. Then they ended up being the most lovely people. Remember they are related to your boyfriend so they will have some of his same awesome traits. Plus you all already share a common interest, your boyfriend! I think it is natural to be scared and worry about the food. I felt the same. Eat what you can if you can, otherwise just take nibbles and enjoy the conversation. They likely won't even think about what you are eating or how much. When I have conversation with people, I find it helps to be a good listener and take a positive interest and others. I compliment my boyfriend and tell his family how wonderful he is. People love that and then it takes the attention of the self and lets you enjoy the moment. Sending good thoughts to you.",False,False

You always have the option of saying you ate a big meal earlier, stomach is feeling unsettled, etc. I think it's common for people to ""lose their appetite"" when they are nervous, so I don't think it would be super noticeable if you didn't eat a lot of what is cooked. If you do, that's okay too!   From my experience, eating dinner with parents for the first time isn't really about the meal, it's just something that facilitates conversation. I fidget a lot when I am nervous, and I think I spent more time moving stuff around my plate while answering questions when I met my bf parents for the first time, and nobody seemed to notice at all. They will probably be more preoccupied by what they will say next, and you can always ask your bf ahead of time to help keep the convo moving so you don't feel like the pressure is all on you. Maybe it would also be helpful to ask him if you guys can set a loose time limit so you know when you will be able to leave the situation?  It has also helped me in the past to say ahead of time that I need to do something at X time in the evening (""I need to talk to my mom about X thing at 7pm and sort something important out really quick, just a heads up."")  so I have an opportunity to step away from the stressful situation and breathe for a few minutes in the middle without it seeming like I'm just hiding in the bathroom, lol. Maybe that's just me though.  Best of luck, it will be okay!",False,False
