Lmao I almost fainted at the gym yesterday so I had to get picked up early. When I got home I got mad at myself for only working out 40 minutes instead of 60.. GIRL U ALMOST PASSED OUT.,False,True

Nothing seemed worth it, nothing was gonna taste good enough or satisfy me to bother with.   Do you enjoy cooking or baking? I had to bake something for a bake sale at school (Catholic school lol) and I got so many compliments on it that I started baking regularly for my friends and local events and stuff. It totally reignited my passion for food and now I love baking and cooking and meal prepping and everything associated with food.   (If you‚Äôre worried how this might affect your weight, I will mention that I‚Äôm 5‚Äô5‚Äù and 86lbs, so it won‚Äôt necessarily impede your progress.)   But personally I found life very dull and upsetting and uninteresting when I was going through what you‚Äôre going through now, which is a lot scarier than just garden-variety anorexia imo. So it might be worth trying. ",False,False
