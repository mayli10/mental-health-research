I just thought about it last night and how it didnâ€™t really make sense that all medication could be 0cal so I looked it up and now Iâ€™m very sad.

For example, hand grippers burn around 150 kcal per 100 grips, sex burns about 3.6 calories a minute, drinking cold water alone boosts your metabolic rate, and chewing gum for just [12 minutes boosts your resting metabolic rate](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJM199912303412718). So no, you shouldn't base all your calorie burning based on just one form of exercise.",False,False
