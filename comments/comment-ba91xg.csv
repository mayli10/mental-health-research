I am not a doctor nor a dietician. I don't relly feel equipped to give out medical advice. Especially if you are working toward recovery, I would follow your dietician's advice.",False,False

Is this true?   I feel like if I maintain at 1600 I'll start to slowly gain at 1650.",False,False

That being said, there's medical conditions that can affect metabolism and lower BMR until you can survive for a whole on astronomically low calories. PCOS and hypothyroidism are two I can think of. I know someone who needed a medically-prescribed 500 kCal/day short-term diet and I hadn't even thought those existed.",False,False

It’s so much easier to say (and truly believe) you have a slower metabolism than it is to have to monitor everything you eat like a hawk and keep on the grind for months/years to lose weight. Being mindful of everything you put in your mouth is a lot of work. If I counted up all of the little ‘bites’ of things I said no to all day id probably have about 600 calories in things I probably really wouldn’t remember eating or enjoying.  And there are so many people that believe they have ‘slow metabolisms’ that also believe they can ‘walk off lunch’ if they take the stairs. It’s a lack of understanding how many calories are in the foods we eat and what it takes to actually burn them off.   My mom had a thyroid problem so losing weight was actually hard for her. She was exhausted constantly so she didn’t want to work out and your willpower takes a big hit when you’re tired all the time. She was still able to diet and lose weight because it just took a little more work for her and she had to manage her appetite differently.  ",False,False

Your metabolism will also slow down some if you have a huge calorie deficit, as with a restrictive ED. But this effect can be rescued by returning to a healthy diet and weight.  To my knowledge, except in cases of hypothyroidism (which can be managed with thyroid drugs), we expect an overweight person to burn on average more calories than a normal or underweight one, all things being equal.  However there are absolutely physiological changes that occur in obese individuals that make it harder to lose weight. For example, obese people typically have a resistance to a satiety hormone called leptin, meaning they won't feel full as easily. While their bodies try to produce more, it isn't usually enough. Moreover, if overfeeding (or underfeeding) begins at an early age - prenatal (as a fetus) or early postnatal (1st year or so) - brain development changes in ways that make these individuals more likely to become obese and have heart disease, diabetes, etc.. However that doesn't mean it is destiny to end up fat, those people just need to be more careful.",False,False
