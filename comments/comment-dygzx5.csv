It's a lot easier when you're the stoner so you can pick the weed and how you consume it.  I've never gotten hunger though, just ""munchies"". That's easier to control with flavored drinks and having something else to focus on. (music, video games, watching tv)  I don't like smoking with other people because I don't like joints and end up feeling anxious instead of high.",False,False
