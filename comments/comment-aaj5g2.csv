I've been dealing with disordered eating for over 20 years and just recently reached out to one friend. Being able to confide in at least one person is giving me hope that I will make a real attempt at recovery one day and that I will be believed when it happens. Sending you lots of positive thoughts...,False,False

I'm just like you, I like immediate results. I like stuff that I can see, touch and feel. However you're going to fuck your body up. Your brain is one thing, but your kidney, liver and other things won't follow this diet for a long while.   I learned how to pace myself in life by doing cardio. I know it's stupid and clich√© but that's how it is. When I started cardio, I hadn't done proper exercise in a long while. Asthma, living in China and depression fucked me over. I lost all interest in sports after I hurt myself when i was 18 and started cardio again at 24. The first weeks were HORRIBLE. I'm not kidding I was so disappointed I couldn't do more than 4km on the bike, and I felt like dying for 2 weeks after.   I'm now 27 and, even if it's been more of an on and off thing than regular exercise, I can now do so much more. I see the results in terms of stamina, breath capacity and muscles. I can now do 10km on the bike, another 4 or 5 on the treadmill and 1200 steps on the stairmaster. I couldn't dream of that when I started.   Patience is a learned skill and I hope you can train yourself in that, regarding food. Best of luck, I believe in you üíï",False,False

I can relate to feeling like I have to reach a certain ‚Äúdanger to myself‚Äù threshold before I ‚Äúdeserve‚Äù help. But this is just one of the many ways my brain lies to me. It really doesn‚Äôt help that sometimes with EDs the medical establishment will dismiss people just because they aren‚Äôt *yet* in serious physical danger. (This short-sightedness really pisses me off.) I hope you won‚Äôt let this dissuade you from seeking help, should you want it.",False,False
