Yesterday completely fell off the restriction wagon and ate about 2200 cals ðŸ˜­ As much as I've loved the UK weather this weekend, I can't fucking resist ice cream, it's my downfall.   Today was never going to be a good day either. Haven't even calculated my calories for today cos I'm scared to. Had a black coffee for breakfast, big roast lamb for lunch, hot cross bun bread and butter pudding. Luckily went for a long walk with the fam but stopped for ice cream.  For dinner had leftover roast veg, and then more bread and butter pudding with Nutella.  Thank god I haven't had any cravings for the easter chocolate.   But f*ck it! I had a good day with family and even though I'm way over my limit, just gotta tell myself it's worth it, just enjoy it for what it is. We should be kinder to ourselves. It's one day, and everything can reset tomorrow. We've got this ðŸ’•",False,False

Like damn for once can't you just enjoy it. It's one day. It's not going to kill you. Just have a great day with your family and try not to feel guilty about it!,False,False
