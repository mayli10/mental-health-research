I’m in Australia too and sadly there are many ill informed people in our country who either won’t or don’t know how to get informed. People like Clive Palmer and Fraser Anning are the absolute worst examples of the kinds of people in our society.  Try to hold onto the hope and belief that most Australians are good and believe in helping each other out, they’re just not as loud. I think if Labor gets in this election we’re going to see some real progress and changes reminiscent of the Whitlam days. There’s a heck of a lot of conservative parties on our ballots this year but we can beat them if we vote right.  If you’re voting for labor they’ve got “how to vote” things on their website that show how you should preference your green house of reps and white senate ballots. No worries if you’re not voting labor as I’m sure whatever party you’re voting for has the same thing. We all deserve a fair and equal chance to live our lives in this country, no matter how different our experiences have been.",False,False
