But I really hope you do get some real life birthday wishes, if you mention it at work then it'll likely be too late to buy any food/cake etc, but you'll still get the good wishes?   But try and take a little but of time out today, to do something for yourself, that makes you happy. Go for a walk, have a nice bath, spend 30 mins on a hobby, try and go see some cute animals?   Idk if any of that was helpful at all, but I really do hope your day is at least OK. ðŸ’–ðŸ’–ðŸ’–ðŸ’–ðŸ’–",False,False
