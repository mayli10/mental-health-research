I can touch my pinky and thumb so at least thatâ€™s not something Iâ€™ll worry about getting to. I just use the scale multiple times a day as my tool. Maybe the wrist checking method is healthier?

The body checking is kind of a compulsion for me (as it is for most people here), so asking me to just stop just postpones it. When he tells me to do it on him though, I can certainly feel that his body is larger than mine, but I don't feel like he is fat, and I certainly don't feel like he is an abomination to humanity. It's soothing to do it on something that feels both bigger and normal to me. ",False,False
