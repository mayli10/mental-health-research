We do not allow posts about ""ana buddies"" or people who don't have EDs and are ""[wannarexics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wannarexia)"".   This sub is used for emotional support for those suffering with EDs, and your post would be considered very tone-deaf, insensitive and ignorant by the community.  This is your only warning, similar action in the future will warrant a ban. Thanks",False,False
