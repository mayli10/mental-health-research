I'm still struggling and I'm back to really bad habits right now, but something that stabilised me, at least for a little while, and helped with my mood and energy, was upping my restriction intake and exercising.  I ate the exact same thing every day - having to choose what I eat from meal to meal overwhelms me and can trigger a binge, and the consistency took a lot of the anxiety off of me.  I ate high protein and fiber, moderate carb, and it wasn't perfect, but it gave me time to escape the binge/restrict cycle and the energy to see people and do things.  I hope this is even a little bit helpful.  If you want to talk, shoot me a message.  Feel better soon!",False,False
