When you have anxiety about eating, the foods you don't feel anxious eating become very special. We elevate them mentally into something more than food, something more important. It's a special comfort, and it's almost like we form a close relationship/bond with those foods, to varying degrees.  So it might be that you're angry about other people liking ""your"" special food because you don't feel like they appreciate them on the same level, and that they're implicitly comparing their arbitrary fondness for them to your reasons, which are much more meaningful and thought-out. You don't just like them because they're tasty, you like them because of all the other very specific and personal reasons they mean to you, and it might feel like those reasons are all being ignored or disrespected in favour of ""lol tasty I guess, mine now too."" These thoughts might not be totally rational but that's the nature of EDs, right?  Also, a sense of control and reliability over food is a BIG ED thing, I think - food **in**security drives a lot of disordered eating behaviours, so it makes sense that a feeling of food **security** would help alleviate those behaviours. If you have a special food that nobody else in your family likes or eats, then you can be reasonably sure nobody is going to unexpectedly eat your food. You can rely on your safe foods still being there when you need them, which gives you a sense of food security. If the people in your household suddenly start liking/eating those same foods, then you can't be as sure that you won't come home to find that the safe foods you were relying on have been eaten by someone else, in part or in whole. Hence, food insecurity, hence anxiety, hence frustration.  Also, the taking-food-from-your-bowl thing is just shitty, lmao. I think a LOT of people, disordered or not, can relate to feeling frustrated or upset when someone else takes their food without asking. It's a very base human response that people either have or they don't IMO.",False,False

Doesn't make much sense cause it's going to be less ingested calories than originally thought....but still, it messes with me a lot.

Then possibly that the anger is a defence mechanism because you anticipate the potential distress should this happen...?  Also, do they know about your ED and how are they supporting you? It could help to tell them about counting and how important it is for you to know exactly what you are eating and in what quantity (and hopefully stop them from eating from your bowl in future).",False,False
