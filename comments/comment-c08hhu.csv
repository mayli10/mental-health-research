All of it is banned because of how I became addicted to that crap. It’s not real food... it’s too scary for me to eat now.,False,False

I work in a supermarket putting stock on shelves... it kind of boggles my mind when my colleagues pick up products and say they’re going to buy it/it looks really nice/they could soooo eat that right now. None of our products are on my (currently rather short lol) list of safe foods and I’ve realised that I don’t actually consider them food at all, they’re just boxes. Just shapes to put into the correctly-shaped gaps on the shelves... the idea of actually *eating* any of them literally never crosses my mind.",False,False
