Recently it hasn't been working at all (other than giving the weight) which doesn't bother me because it was clearly bullshit. So I would not bother paying the extra if I were making the decision again.,False,False

Generally, they're not considered accurate (I've heard they maybe get within 5%, which is useless in my mind).  I have a fitbit Aria scale that offers this feature, and I definitely do not trust the body fat % number. I got a second bf% estimate using the navy equation and the results were very different. All the bf% on the scale does is upset me so I usually step off before it has a chance to do the body fat % estimate.",False,False
