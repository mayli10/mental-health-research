Also, I love my hot water bottle and think everyone should have one. Also a thing a lot of people don't have/buy if they are under 80 years old. They are less than $20 at a drug store.  Tea is also good and/or a cool mug to go with.  Bath bombs are also great as gifts because they are just expensive enough that you can't justify buying them for yourself, amirite?",False,False
