I would like to at least believe there was a net benefit to humanity in what was learned about the effects of starvation",False,False

Also, as the other commenter said, human experiments have duty of care and this did fundamentally change the directions of participants lives and forever fucked up their relationship with food.",False,False

Like how doctors take a “do no harm” oath. Hence the Stanford Prison Experiment being so controversial too.   MOST people participating in studies are also vulnerable groups (either poor and need the money, or in such a dire spot health-wise that they’re willing to go experimental route) so it’s unethical to be taking advantage of someone’s desperation ",False,False

I guess it's unethical because starvation probably led to at least a couple long term health problems in a few participants.  but I'm soooo thankful for the contributions of those men... we have learned so much from that study alone! ""Turns out restricting one of the body's main needs has huge ramifications on how one allocates mental real-estate."" so eloquently put and extremely true. honestly it completely changed my perspective when I realized my food obsession was due to restriction and I wasn't just a crazy hungry food obsessed freak.",False,False

Seriously, Burger King and all. The worst it got was eating my normal lunch at work (salad (94), apple slices (76), yogurt (90) and then sneaking out to Burger King for a Rodeo King (1260), Sourdough King (970), Fries (380), Twix Pie (370), and an Oreo Chocolate Shake (610). Then going back to work with my head hung in shame. it was a good thing no one there really cared about me or noticed I left. Or was it just that I left, ate, and got back in 30 minutes flat?  The only *advice* I can really give is to tell you the satisfaction is temporary. You'll crave it again. You'll want to go back the next day and the next week and it'll never be enough. Eventually, the day-long misery you get when you step on the scale will outweigh the hour-long joy you get from stuffing your face. So I encourage you, get out sooner, rather than later. Oh! And also, it gets really expensive, really fast. People who say eating shitty fast food all the time is cheap, is dead wrong.",False,False

They started to obsess about food, create weird rituals around eating and like get really interested in cooking and hoard cookbooks and shit.   Turns out restricting one of the body's main needs has huge ramifications on how one allocates mental real-estate.   I spend 80% of my time looking at food related stuff or making tiny adjustments to the food I have planned for my next meal. Hell, basically all my Reddit time is spent here or the dieting subreddits.",False,False
