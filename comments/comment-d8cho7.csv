I am going to set up an appointment asap now that I have renewed my medical. It is hard because my anxiety makes me not want to go anywhere near a doctor's office because I associate them with germs and bad news lol I also have terrible social anxiety so having to leave my home and talk to strangers is hard. I know it will be for the best, and it won't get better until I seek treatment. I just posted here because it's been really bad today and I'm trying not to give in to the anxiety.",False,True
