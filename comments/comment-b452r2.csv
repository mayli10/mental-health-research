It sucks cuz I honestly forced myself to just ignore my ED when it came to school. Like feel dizzy? Poor u, you've got a math test do u gotta crank thru it. And yet I still get shit for that??

As long as you're able to go to a school with good facilities/programs for what you want to do (or explore) that's all that matters, and even if that's not the case there are so many opportunities ahead!  Some of the smartest and most accomplished people I know graduated from meh schools or community college.  You have a fresh start after high school and even if you feel like a failure you are most definitely not.  Pressure from hearing everyone talk about where they got in/are going is so high right around now but it will be gone in time and eventually you won't care about high school grades.    Good luck with future applications/decisions, and I hope your week gets better! &lt;3",False,False

Getting rejected from all the schools I applied to last year was the main trigger for my ED, and it looks like this year I‚Äôll get the same outcome. Just know that you‚Äôre not alone in this, and that your worth is not determined by whether a random admissions officer somewhere thinks you are a good fit for their university or not. ",False,False

I apply for so many but it'a just one rejection after another. I even had an interview where they said I was more than qualified but they still rejected me. Part of my irrational self thinks it's because they see what I mess I am from my ED or maybe they don't  find me attractive and that just stresses me out and makes me want to relapse. Sometimes I wonder what's the point of getting better if no one wants me. I really do feel your pain,False,False
