It can be really frustrating and you get a bit stir crazy, but resting it until you see a PT is really important, you don't want to make it worse and end up out longer): I usually ended up drawing or crocheting to get me through periods like that.. It obviously not the same as exercising but it would keep me at bay kind of.  I'd try to find some kind of hobby to occupy yourself until then. Plus while you can't really do cardio there's exercises the PT will give you to keep your muscles going and what not. It's rough as hell but it will get better:) ",False,False

Pretty much everywhere it says to stop exercising point blank for a bit just to avoid the stress it could possibly put on me.   I just spiral really easily when im not able to follow my routine and depend on my workout schedule a lot so this whole situations pretty frustrating.,False,True

I have had 3 knee surgeries and they usually start me on recumbent bike. My surgeries were not for a torn ACL though so always consult your therapist or doctor about things like that. While you may really want to work out (and I understand as I've been laid up A LOT) it's better to let it heal than make it worse and be out longer. Hope that helps!,False,False
