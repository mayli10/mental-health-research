It’s anxiety. There are 3 ways to relieve it. The most obvious is to make efforts to change whatever I think I’ve done “wrong” (ie eat properly!). Then there’s the quick-fix but not-ideal way which is to use anxiolytics. The final way (and best imo) is to practice meditation.

My therapist told me to think back to the last time I had really bad intrusive thoughts and ask did the bad thing happen? The last time I resisted an intrusive thought did anything actually happen? No. And it won't this time either. Sometimes it helps, sometimes not. ",False,False
