I'm in the exact same boat as you; even with missed calories, I'm well under my TDEE and yet, I've been maintaining for almost a month now. It's gotten to the point where I'm starting to believe in pseudoscience like metabolic damage or starvation mode.  A small word of advice, if it's been 20 days since your period, then you're in the window of time where your body is putting on water weight so that might be hiding some of your weight loss. But aside from that, I've heard of some people's plateaus lasting for weeks on end so maybe we're not metabolic unicorns, just unicorns prone to wooshes.   If you need someone to rant to about plateauing, my messages are open because oh boy, I can def rant with you.",False,False
