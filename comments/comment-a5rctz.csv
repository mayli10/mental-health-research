ebpemur,t3_a5rctz,t3_a5rctz,HoldenCaulfield7,1,2018-12-13 10:24:15,/r/EDAnonymous/comments/a5rctz/concept_remove_all_boys_w_lower_bmi_than_me_from/ebpemur/,I can kind of relate to this in a way. I’m a straight female but I have requirements. The guy I’m dating needs to be 6 feet at the very shortest (preferably 6’2 or taller I’ve dated 6’4) and 180 pounds or more (but fit) or else I don’t feel dainty. There’s nothing like feeling tiny next to a man who’s bigger than you. ,False,False
