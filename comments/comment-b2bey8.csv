But he was bewildered I even thought they’d care when and if I ate! And there’s a gym in the hotel we’re staying at! I’m so relieved ",False,False

Good tips  I will bring a few sandwiches and some fiber rich snacks and veggies to fill on. It’s crazy that people can be so non healthy when it comes to food. Even something healthy like a salad with lasagna they smother it in dressing and croutons. Why can’t people do dressing on the side.  And they use be fattiest meat and don’t drain it for the lasagna. I get sick just thinking about it. Ughhh,False,True

I visit my boyfriend’s family and it’s just DAYS of insanely rich, fattening food. Another problem is that their eating schedules are way different than mine. They’ll eat super heavy, small breakfast at like 11 (I’ve been up since 7 and just starving) and then make a super meager but high calorie dinner at like 8. I’m always starving the whole time and then my options are super calorie dense foods that make me feel sick. The kitchen and living space are the same room and they are in a major drought so I can’t do dishes or discreetly eat in the main house.    LUCKILY the guest room is built separately from the house with a small fridge so in recent visits I’ve been able to shove healthy snacks in my face in private.    My advise (based on my own experiences) is to bring safe foods to snack on in private AND just bring tons of safe sides and force the food on them. Are they going to make lasagna? Great! Fudge around with a small piece of it but bust out the BIG portion of green beans or salad kit or whatever that you brought to go on the side. Just let them confuse you being an overly polite houseguest with bringing food that makes you feel comfortable. Fruit and raw veggie trays for snacking go a long way too!    Also, if you say ‘I looove pizza but eating tons of salt and carbs really makes me feel sick and makes me break out I just love eating healthy!! I’ll have one slice and some salad’ They (hopefully) can’t really suggest you eat more of what you have openly said makes you feel ill.      ",False,False
