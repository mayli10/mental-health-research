I live in Also, and while I interact with a lot of fat people, thin people, and average people, snacking is huge. There's food everywhere. And if you struggle with food, it's there CONSTANTLY, not just once or twice a day. And there's always people telling you ""you really ought to eat 5-6 small meals a day, it's better for your metabolism!"". I'm so thankful for IF being more popular so it's not weird if I say I've been fasting ",False,False

No one has any problem commenting on my weight when I'm a normal/underweight size but I always wonder if they would be willing to comment on someone's weight who was overweight.

I feel like the best way to deal with these people is inform them how rude they're being. try and make it as clear to them as possible that calling out another person's food choices is not okay.

Snacking would've felt weird in other countries because NO ONE does it, so I lost weight when living abroad.
