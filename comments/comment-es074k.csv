I made it but barely. I've really only been eating anywhere from 300-500 calories recently. (Aside from sundays ) And yesterday I was right at 300 when I was so hungry I went for some raisin nut brand. That put me around 600. I then couldn't resist the small bag ranch doritos. MAKE IT STOP. Thankfully I did.  830 calories.,False,False
