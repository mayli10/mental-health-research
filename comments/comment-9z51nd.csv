I've only ever restricted, but before losing my period completely they were way crazy.  This is after getting REALLY regular (like more or less 28 days on the dot) during times where I was weight restored and kinda recovered).  First of all I'd skip one, then I'd have one which lasted a day (TMI but it was that dark colour blood), then nothing for a couple of months then a heavy as fuck period.  Towards the end I was getting spotting now and again.  Hormones and EDs, eh.  Lol, my last post was about supplements, so here's another.  Might be a good idea to take some calcium supplement to help avoid bone issues like osteoporosis in the long term because of low estrogen levels because restriction's making your hormones wonk.  On a lighter note, hope you get the opportunity to unleash your libido very soon   X",False,False
