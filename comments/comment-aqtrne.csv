I was sitting at a lunch table with a bunch of other girls in my grade and one of them asked why I wasn't eating, and I stated very matter-of-factly that it was because I was fat. She told our teacher, who then called my mom after the school day had ended and I was back at home, sitting in front of the TV with my lunch (which, at that point, I was finally eating because I was 10 and hungry).  As far as media, I was a young teenager when being scene became really popular, and I remember all those skinny-mini girls on Myspace with hair bigger than their heads, wearing tube tops and skinny jeans. I was obsessed with bands at the time and either some of the band members were dating scene girls (i.e. Brendon Urie and Audrey Kitching) or they at least looked like that would be the type of girl they'd go for. And the only popular scene girls were the skinny ones! So it just made sense to me that if I wanted a boyfriend, I'd have to get skinny like them.",False,False

Thandie Newton in Gridlock’d, Uma Thurman in Pulp Fiction, Jodie Kidd on the runway, that was the standard I kept to back then. Fashion was AWFUL, there was literally a thing called “heroin chic”! Looking sick was in, drugs were very in. There were no laws against underweight models, there wasn’t the same body positive culture like there is today. They weren’t good times for recovery lmao. I don’t blame the media or the times I grew up in for my ED though. Plenty my age had the same exposure and turned out fine. So glad my daughter has healthier role models to aspire to though.

I didn't know what it meant until I got older and realized how insecure about her legs she is....and now I am too. We have the same legs. It makes me sad to see her so distressed over it but at the same time, same.   Also, lol, my classmates in catholic school were bulimic and threw up all the time on our group bathroom trips. I stopped eating my lunches when I was 10. I asked a friend at the time how to make my stomach get smaller. Another friend and I, the two big girls, bonded over being big and we encouraged each other not to eat for as long as possible. 11 at the oldest. Watching this other, waifish girl that everyone loved pick apart her peanut butter and fluff sandwich and offer it to me or the other fat girl. Admiring her wrists, her knees in class. 11-12. Writing in my hello kitty diary that my wrist bones were that prominent, that I wished I was smaller. I didn't know how much I weighed but every day was a disappointment, looking at her and then at myself.   I wonder where they all are now.",False,False
