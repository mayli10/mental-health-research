The night started with tequila shots at an apartment my friends shared and ended with me waking up with no pants, on top of a counter.   Safe to say I didn‚Äôt remember that night.   BUT from what my friends told me.  This is what happened:  After pregaming, and a good few bar hops. I tipped our male bartender 100% with a note saying ‚Äúthanks for the drinks bubble butt ;)‚Äù along with the WRONG phone number. {Mind you I‚Äôm very clearly a lesbian, so poor kiddo was probably confused. }  We then went to a fast food restaurant, where I insisted I wasn‚Äôt hungry repeatedly despite no one asking me if I was hungry. I got up, left and took a bird (rental electric scooter) 2 miles to my friends‚Äô apartment.  Luckily my other friend was home to let me in.   After smoking through a pack of cigs and endless stories that ‚Äúliterally wasn‚Äôt English,‚Äù I apparently went ‚Äúexploring‚Äù through their house and then proceeded to remove my pants and urinate on their ottoman. I then passed out on their kitchen counter.   So yeah. I bought them a new ottoman and cleaned their counter, but nothing can repair my dignity at this point.",False,False

Hadn‚Äôt really eaten at all in days but I decided to drink half a bottle of whiskey at my friends house beforehand. The rest I don‚Äôt remember since I blacked out but I‚Äôve been told the following: I cried whilst doing a my chemical romance song on karaoke, I passed out on the bathroom floor, my friends put me in a taxi with a bucket because I couldn‚Äôt stop throwing up but I couldn‚Äôt remember where I lived so I ended up at my old student house (where I don‚Äôt live now and is occupied by strangers who did not know me), then the taxi driver took me back to my friends house where I pissed myself and passed out on the sofa whilst everyone else went out. Keep it classy.",False,False

By the end of the night, I was laying on my dorm room floor, snapping and texting everyone I knew, talking about everything from student theater to whether or not Mamma Mia Here We Go Again is the superior Mamma Mia movie to whether or not rats deserve rights. I ended up texting the captain of my time, in almost incomprehensible English due to the amount of typos and lack of spaces between words, that I thought my time was similar to rolling the second blunt (literally makes no sense, I know). At some point, somebody else on my team came over to check on me (bless her honestly), and saw me lying on the floor and almost thought I was dead. She ended up staying with me all night, and I‚Äôm pretty sure she texted everyone else on our team saying how concerned she is for me, because over the past three days, I have gotten multiple text messages and have had multiple people ask me in person if I am okay. Could be worse though, I guess ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø",False,False

And it just happened to fall on my birthday. So this was the **perfect** day to celebrate and catch a great game in the same night. I was super worried about eating and had been in a pretty strong restrictive phase. Well we started by going to a brewery and began sampling beers and I felt good. A little tipsy but still good. After the game we went to a place that had a special for birthdays. They basically fill a dog bowl with beer and put a picture of you and the bowl on the wall. It was very cute and the people were super nice. People kept passing me by and as they saw the *infamous dog bowl* in celebratory fashion, countless strangers began pouring MORE beer into the bowl as I drank. Now if I had a good lining of grub in my tummy I would have been fine. But I had hot chicken and a few roadtrip snacks. So I immediately felt drunk as all hell. ""Excuse me."" I took a trip to the bathroom and I dont even remember anything else too well from this point which is SO embarassing. Some dude goes ""hey is that your girlfiend?"" Ahh yes I had fallen over, just sprawled out on the dirty bar bathroom floor like a dingus. My boyfriend helped me up and I smiled. Oh no. During the fall in the bathroom I had chipped and lost my front tooth. I remember seeing myself in the mirror and telling him super casually ""hey look my tooth is gone"". But it just didn't really bother me at the time. In the morning however, I was so confused and sad. I blackout fairly easily when drinking and couldn't remember anything after that. I was mortified thinking of the people who saw me at the bar. How my boyfriend must have felt babysitting a toothless gremlin the rest of the night . I ended up getting a fill in at the dentist (which led to bulimia and ED discussions in order to help prevent any further breakage) and now you cant tell it happened unless you look closely. But it makes for a good 21st birthday story üò≠",False,False
