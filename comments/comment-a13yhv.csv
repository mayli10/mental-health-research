That's around my breaking point for when I start feeling faint and that's my sign to go find a snack machine.   Gum is my best friend and I go through a pack a day but I usually keep it at work. I think I might have to start putting packs of it in random places so I'll always have some on hand.,False,True

I've been on a pretty low daily calorie total for about 2 months now so that makes sense that it would happen over a shorter amount of time since I'm sure my glycogen levels are sustained at a much lower level due to that. I'm definitely gonna work on drinking more water,False,True

And that's for a person who was eating normally beforehand. If your glycogen stores are already depleted from long-term restriction or lots of cardio, you can get into ketosis much faster. It's also really easy to get into ketosis on low restriction, depending on what you're eating.  If it's not that, try drinking more water. Dehydration can also cause a weird taste in your mouth, and if you're not eating, you're missing out on all the water in the food you would normally eat.",False,False

Idk how long your fasts are, but with the very low cals over a few days, it's possible you're getting few enough carbs to where you are going into ketosis.   If possible, you may want to obtain some mint gum, just so your mouth tastes less awful. ",False,False
