Watermelon is soso delicious and is so watery which is probably why I binged because I replaced it with water. I think water is a more filling choice.  Thank you for your kind reply, it means a lot.",False,True

If you’re feeling sick but want to eat more, maybe replace it with some water. Do you drink enough?  I’m usually dehydrated as hell so binging on fruit, especially watermelon, is an easy peasy task. Plus it’s so damn delicious.   With that said, it’s impossible to gain fat and the water weight will be gone as soon as you pee it out. Get some rest, it’ll be alright.",False,False
