Don't fall for the cauliflower crackers (if they even still have them. They were a special buy item). They were nasty. Or do. My friend liked them. I think they were 100 cals for 44 crackers.",False,False

I love these because I find them filling.  The Soulful OnePots are gorgeous as well.  They're £2 each but worth it.  Eat one of those with some salad and I'm stuffed.  (They're like Bol pots but a quid cheaper).  &amp;#x200B;  If you do snacks, the  Pea Snacks are 87 calories a packet and really nice as are the Veggie Straws.  The sugar free licorice is good and the sugar free boiled sweets.  Benefit cereal bars are nice and cheaper than Alpen, and if you can do approx 140 cal on a cereal bar, the Quinoa Bars are really good.",False,False
