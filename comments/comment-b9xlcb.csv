Probably people didn’t get exactly that that’s what you were saying and took it as comparing two equally mentally crippling EDs. I don’t think most of the posters I’m referring to have EDs but that they’re engaging in unhealthy behavior that at worst has the potential to lead to one in the future or that at best is straight up bad for their health and metabolism if not their mental health, but that it’s heavily encouraged in the sub, which is what I meant in my original post. For example, I’m talking about when I see posters saying ‘ugh, I’m so frustrated, I’ve been stalled at 140 lbs’ (not significantly overweight to an unhealthy extent probably) ‘and every day I have *MAX* 1000 calories :(’ or the ones who post screenshots of MFP where they save up all of their calories for wine and halo top and drink a bunch of zero cal monsters and come out at 1000 calories, or various other similar posts I’ve seen.

I know that the person behind the screen in that subreddit may have an ED, but I think people here also forget that an overweight person doing cico, fasting, or IF, is probably not choosing dangerous behavior.

We do the things we do because we have eating disorders, we are mentally and physically unhealthy. On dieting subs, the overwhelming majority do the same things many of us do because they need to lose weight, and it's improving their health, and they do it in an overall healthier way (ie not eating under 1100/1000 at most even for the shortest people). Some people are only seeing their habits, that they are ""doing what we do"", and projecting their own reasoning onto them and ignoring their intentions.   Navigating this world with a rare and serious psychological disorder like an eating disorder is a hard thing. But we have to remind ourselves as a whole our society is facing a serious obesity epidemic, 40% of adults in America are obese (not just overweight, obese) and heart disease is the leading cause of death. Diabetes, stroke, and other diseases/conditions caused in part by and/or greatly impacted by obesity are up there as well, and rates are going nowhere but up. EDs are a VERY small fraction of the population, restrictive EDs a fraction of that tiny fraction, and then those diagnosable with AN are just a minuscule portion of that low number of people with a restrictive ED. Unfortunately, we just can't discourage weight loss for overweight individuals or demonize calorie restriction and tips/tricks/tools to eat less for the sake of the teeny tiny fraction of the population with a restrictive ED.

I've been lurking somethingisplenty for years and I feel as a whole they do a great job at calling out inherently eating disordered posts and discouraging EDs as much as possible in their sub. As someone else said, there is a difference between disordered eating and eating disorder. And this may get very controversial considering it's a sensitive subject on this sub, but I think intention and starting point does matter. Using smaller silverware and posting jokes about being hungry and seeking online support for eating less comes from a different place when the poster is medically overweight/obese and in serious danger because of it. Most posters on those subs NEED to lose weight, or are eating higher than 1200 and just post there for support if they are taller or maintaining. Coming from a normal or underweight person, those acts ring quite different to me.   If anything I have always felt mildly bad about invading their ""safe space"" and I do not like seeing our posters post there trying to call them out or attack them when the majority of people there are struggling badly to better themselves, and in many cases, even save their lives. They aren't killing themselves like normal or low weight people with restrictive eating; for obese people, it is almost universally medically advised to lose weight for health. The same can't be said for us. And I don't personally care about people making posts like this in this sub but I will say there was a very distinct increase in cross posting  their subs, going on and making blatantly disordered posts (at a healthy/low weight) on their subs, trying to ""call them out"" for their posts while identifying as someone with an ED and (in my opinion) incorrectly projecting etc. in the months before proed was deleted so it makes me nervous to see this stuff.
