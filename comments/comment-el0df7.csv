Wasn’t underweight at time in fact i was in middle of healthy weight when it started. Bloods were fine ecg was fine. It was literally malnutrition, dehydration and hypotension. After over a year of intensive exercise and restriction there just wasn’t enough to fuel my body. I was running 16k one week the next I couldn’t manage 10 mins.  I got back to running after I increased my intake for a while but it didn’t last and once I restricted again I had to put a stop to it. I’m gutted I love running and it’s one of my reasons to recover. I haven’t ran for 6 months now.   But you can’t just eat well for a few days and expect to go back to your routine. It will take a while. It doesn’t matter your weight your body needs to recover and needs to be fed to run. Take it steady look after your body first before you try again. I know it’s frustrating (and maybe scary god knows it terrified me and embarrassing going to hospital from gym after fainting) but you can get back there.  Your body’s telling you it’s struggling. If you can listen to it.  I found I could use a bike but not treadmill. Standing exercise made it worse.   Also check in at the doctors if you can just to check on your electrolyte levels and heart function.   You got this!!!!",False,False

I would recommend trying to eat more (like a banana or nut butter), but if you cannot bring yourself to eat more here is what I do... 32oz of water, 1 tsp potassium chloride powder, 1 tsp calcium citrate powder, and .5 tsp salt. I also take a magnesium pill in the morning. You could also just drink a sports drink (like Gatorade zero). Please stay safe!!!",False,False

Drinking the water might’ve caused you to flush the rest of your electrolytes out, thus causing the fainting.",False,False
