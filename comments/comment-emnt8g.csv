It's doable, with a firm will.  But seriously, I've seen firsthand what miscarriage does to a mother (and father). It is the most horrible thing. I cried every day for a while, my sister cried every day, still cries often. She considered suicide, because she fell in love with her baby boy. You need to talk to a doctor. Let them know you're a high risk patient, and get them to talk realistically with you. You cannot take any chances with this.",False,False

I got pregnant. I debated between abortion or having it and then giving it for adoption, but 18 weeks in, the foetus had stopped developing and I had to have a medical procedure to remove.  You should go to the hospital and be honest with them. I know its so scary to think about admitting all this to medical people. but your health is really at risk here. Be honest and explain how you feel about termination.",False,False

My mum started smoking when she was like 14. Smoked her whole life. Well fuck, she gets knocked up at 23. Does she want to quit? Of course not!  But she did.  For 9 months.  And then she went back to it.  You don't have to be ready to recover, you just need to pause. Eventually, when you hold your baby in your arms (if you choose to keep them), you will want to recover. And you will.  I believe in you.",False,False

Also for sure get counseling and try to think of it as not feeding yourself but your baby. After all, you would never force a newborn on an Ana diet.",False,False

Please seek advice from a doctor. If you're determined to continue your pregnancy I'm sure you already know that disordered eating habits could seriously hurt your baby's development and put your own safety at risk, so the sooner you get professional help, the better.",False,False
