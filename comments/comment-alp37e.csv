Especially when speaking to a community that is prone to anxiety related to the products that they injest. Currently there is no definitive research that shows that artificial sweeteners impact your insulin response.    A few studies have shown that it does (and only for certain sweetener types) but other studies on the same sweeteners showed absolutely no change in insulin response.   The current consensus of the medical community is that they really don't know. There is simply not enough research to say one way or the other how sweeteners affect you.   Hell, they don't even know HOW sweeteners would even cause a change in the insulin response (some studies thought it might be due to changes in gut flora for goodness sake).   But just for fun, here are a few sources regarding insulin response and artificial sweeteners:  https://www.acsh.org/news/2017/06/19/artificial-sweeteners-dont-impact-blood-glucose-and-they-never-did-11447  https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5591507/   Do your research.

But there is no sugar to back that up so you have too much insulin in your blood stream.  &amp;#x200B;  Insulin's normal function is to move sugar out of the blood and into cells.  If you are working, much of that sugar goes into muscle cells.  If you aren't it goes into fat cells.  &amp;#x200B;  Excess insulin can also make you feel hungrier, because blood sugar is dropping.   If your blood sugar drops to 75% of normal you fell awful -- cold sweats, nausea, energy of a dead dishrag.     Lots of people overreact and end up binging more due to the drop.  &amp;#x200B;  Alternate drinks:  Soda water and lemon juice -- next to no calories, no artifical sweetener.  Soda water for some is a diaretic -- makes you pee -- which then makes you thirsty again.  Peeing is a short term win, long term doesn't matter. Soda water is hard on bones and teeth.    &amp;#x200B;  Plain water with lemon.  Still zero cals, but easier on your kidneys and your calcium balance.",False,False
