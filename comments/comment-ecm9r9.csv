The reasons your psychiatrist gave are pretty logical. And logic just isn't going to hit home in the way my visceral *need* to continue hits home.  I think everyone has to find the reasons they can really feel. Example - I don't care about dying but I do care about being stuck living a horrible life. As a teenager what hit home was the potential for brain damage and the delay (or destruction) of academic and career goals. As an adult I've now experienced people walking away because they're weary of caring about me more than I care about myself - a result diametrically opposed to the need that fuels my behaviors.)   Those are the consequences that hit home for me. I hope you'll find ones that resonate for you. I hope you find what you need, wherever that takes you  &lt;3",False,False
