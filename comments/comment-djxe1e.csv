It‚Äôs supposed to all be in good fun and a lot of people enjoy it but obviously there are some types of people who should never go to them and anybody with a history of disordered eating falls into that category. There used to be one near my SO‚Äôs work and he went with his coworkers for lunch once and they had a pretty good time, but it sounded like hell to me.",False,False

Then, the longer the streak goes, the worse I feel ruining it.   Today my partner and I went out with friends and I have no idea how many calories I ate because it was restaurant food and that‚Äôs terrifying. Tomorrow we are eating out again too for another event and I know that even if I fast the entire day I‚Äôll go over budget if I finish at the restaurant but it‚Äôs so hard to stop yourself so early while eating.",False,False

If your mom wants you to eat, I can empathize, but making something like that up doesn't seem like the way to do it. :/    Maybe she isn't lying. Maybe there is more too it or you guys got your wires crossed or something. Without having much info, it is hard to say. But I will confidently say I've never heard of something like that before.",False,False
