Those pictures capture roughly 1/800 of a second in a life. It’s easy to pretend we are who we wish we were for 1/800 of a second. And we edit even farther in what we actually upload. We post our best hair and makeup days, the beautifully decorated living room, the smiling couple on vacation. We don’t post the 23.99 other hours. The fights, the tears, the hangovers. The photo from the first day of a new fancy job can’t tell you she saw a doctor yesterday for depression, or that she’s going through a breakup, or that she’s terrified she’s not good enough for this job.   **We can’t judge our insides by other people’s outsides.**",False,False
