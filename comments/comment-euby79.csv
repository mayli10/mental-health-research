My very recent ex is engaged (it's dumb, he's dumb, still hurts), and I feel like I keep trying to get attention/love/support by being sexually appealing, but all I get is sexualized and objectified and none of them give a shit about my feelings.   I literally mentioned being depressed to this one guy, and he's like, want to talk about it after I finish myself off? I'm sorry our conversations have been all sexual lately. And I said I would like to when he's done. But he wouldn't fucking drop it. Everything I said he made dirty and was like ""oh wow, how are we back onto sex already"".   And then he said it's because he's thinking of me as there. I just didn't answer, and I'm pissed he hasn't apologized, and kind of don't feel safe with him at all now. Thinking of cancelling our plans to get together next weekend :(  Bonus, because my body image is so shit, all the sexy things he was trying to say were just triggering the shit out of me and making me feel gross. Like ""he just thinks you're hot because he hasn't actually seen your stomach/arms jingling, and that's all he cares about so you're going to just be a disappointment and it's going to hurt.",False,True

I'm in school and it was part of funding meant to top up my income for the whole semester...but the dumb ED brain is like ""but future you will go back to restricting only and your grocery bill will be like 20 bucks a week, it's perfect"".   Thank you for the tips. I just hate feeling food other than my safe foods. Reading that makes me so anxious.   You're right though.",False,True

Haha.   The only way to do it is to sit with your food and instead of blindly eating it, be aware of every bite. It’ll help you feel full and fight the binge.   Then when you’re full or close to full, sit with it and acknowledge that you nourished your body and the food will go to bodily functions and not primarily fat stores.   We can’t avoid the feelings of food and feelings around food. We have to tackle them head on and change our perceptions around it.",False,False
