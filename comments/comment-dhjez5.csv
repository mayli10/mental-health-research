I feel judged, even if I'm eating celery sticks. It makes life a bit awkward b/c I will often duck out of social situations to quickly eat something in private.  But I can understand the opposite scenario",False,False

I mean I do eat alone as well, but if I know I'm going to eat socially I love to restrict a bit harder and maybe get some extra steps in, and being able to keep up appearances like that kind of adds to that addictive feeling of control. ""Not only can I control my calories and weight, I can even control my ED enough so you won't suspect a thing"" kinda deal.",False,False
