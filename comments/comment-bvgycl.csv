It really rubs me the wrong way to see people who think others should live their lives a certain way. Very controlling.,False,False

I remember when /r/fatpeoplehate got shutdown and we had to worry about the influx of new subs. I honestly visited both, but often really felt fph went way overboard.  Nowadays, its a full on cesspool and fatlogic is like fatpeoplehate lite.",False,False

I ended up in hospital. I really don't like that sub. I still go on it some days though when I feel like hating myself.

It's just a lot of uncompassionate/self-loathing people spewing hateful rhetoric under the guise of ""I'm hurting your feelings for your own good"". At least on /fit/ people will outright admit their disdain for fatness, instead of FL - rationalizing bullying and deflecting anything calling them out.   Another reason I stopped going there was I began hypocritically judging people I knew nothing about. I had no problem with snickering about someone else's struggle with weight, while simultaneously I was at my highest weight (and my self esteem and depression reached an all time high).",False,False

Reading harsh words about how any people deserve to die just makes me feel uncomfortable and unsafe, even if they aren't targeted at me. I guess since EDs make it hard for us to actually value ourselves and deplete our self worth, these sentiments are very toxic for us to be around.",False,False

People just post pictures of fat people being happy to scream about their health, like fat people arent allowed to live or be happy because they might be unhealthy.   It's so triggering when I see innocent body positive posts and all the comments are just hate for the idea of loving yourself when you're fat.

It's like a fat person cant live at their weight without a million comments attacking their health. It gets so toxic and hateful.  Fat people stories is the other one I go on to upset myself.
