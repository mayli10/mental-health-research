If you lose weight, you will be slimmer in every area of your body. Kind of like unrolling a roll of toilet paper. But working out your legs will make them look more defined, which is certainly not a bad thing.",False,False

The body shrinks its fat cells by its own inscrutable algorithm.   I have added in some thigh exercises a few days a week though, since I *can* target muscle development and that seems to help me look ‘better’. Maybe just because the exercises help me feel more positive, which changes my experience if what I see in the mirror.",False,False
