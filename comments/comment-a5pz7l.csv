I had complications and was in hospital for probably five days total.  In that time I ate a banana.  (I'm sure they pumped calories in via an IV, too.)  When I finally was ready to leave, my clothes literally didn't fit because my stomach was so distended.    Wait until the whoosh though!  It's gonna be amazing.  Also, harm reduction matters right now:  Your body needs nutrients to heal.  Feel better soon.",False,False
