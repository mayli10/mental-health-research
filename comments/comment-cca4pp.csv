I found it helpful to accept that I didn't want to live my life like this anymore. I was tired of being obsessed with food and having it dictate my life - I wanted/want freedom from that!,False,False

I've had atypical anorexia for close to seven years now and if I had honestly sought help when I had first realized that my dieting wasn't normal I would have saved myself so much pain. I went from 250lbs to 120lbs in the span of 11 months and wound up with peripheral neuropathy from severe malnutrition. I sought help but only after I had lost normal functioning of my legs and shortly after treatment I relapsed because I was completely unwilling to give up my eating disorder. It's 7 years later and I just had a baby that I'm trying to breastfeed and be a good example to but my eating disorder still controls my life.  Seek help if you can and if you're currently unwilling pray for the willingness to be willing to seek help.,False,False
