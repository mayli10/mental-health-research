I recognize that nothing about eating disorders should ‚Äúfeel right‚Äù!! Just agreeing that if a correct label is applied, vs an incorrect one, your behaviors and mental state will be the same regardless.   I know it‚Äôs not that easy and I have angsted over diagnosises so many times - just be well, as much as you can üíï",False,False

For me at least, I don‚Äôt really see the value getting caught up in the diagnostic criteria of each specific disorder, especially with the dynamic nature of my own (which sounds similar to yours).  But it sounds those labels are important to you though, and I‚Äôm not trying to invalidate that at all. Disorders, especially those developed in formative years, are naturally going to a part of peoples identity, and if finding the right terms makes it easier for you, you do you, but I just thought I‚Äôd offer an second perspective :)",False,False
