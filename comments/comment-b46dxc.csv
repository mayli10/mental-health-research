I’m glad to hear you’re doing good with recovery and all that! :)  I’ve only been in “recovery” for a few days, so I’ve still got a while to go haha. I’m currently in track &amp; do weight-lifting, and I’m sort of worried that may hinder the process, but then again I’m not doing it to lose weight; plus I’m eating an adequate amount, so I’m hoping it won’t do any damage.   I’m just ready for my hair/nails and all that to get back where they were beforehand too. It sucks. :( Either way, thank you again. It makes me feel better to know that other people have experienced similar things &amp; I’m not alone. ",False,True

For example, I have a similar time frame of when I had my ED, it was almost a year, so yeah, not that long! And I lost my period like a month into it and had lost 30-40 pounds overall. My period was restored a year later, probably because I was binging a lot for like a month, and I wasn’t overexercising anymore. (But I wouldn’t recommend binging as a tool for period restoration, just my experience)   Your body may not have enough of what it needs yet, despite being at a healthy weight. Also, if you’re still exercising a LOT, that could also be a reason why. In recovery you really have to take a break and let your body rest and regenerate bc it’s been through a lot. Any type of restriction in recovery isn’t really conducive :o   This is just based on my opinion and experience, and I’m sorry I can’t give you explicit help, but just some general things I thought might help? Good luck :) ",False,False
