I also know that my problems won't get better if I'm not honest in therapy. So, I decided to speak up at my therapy appointment today.  That takes so much guts. You probably knew it'd set your brain on fire almost as soon as you said it, too - and you still did what needed to be done. I hope I can have your level of courage someday, and I hope she's as gentle and patient as possible about following this breakthrough.",False,False
