You can absolutely fall ill in your 20s. Even a bad flu or pneumonia could kill you if you don't have enough reserves. Being too thin also lowers immunity.  Disclaimer, the people I'm talking about are almost never ED sufferers or recovered people. It's just general people who aim for being underweight but have no idea what that looks or feels like but feel they're in the clear because they're young and invincible and saw a healthy looking runway model once",False,False

I recently learned she had an eating disorder when she was younger.  I grew up and developed restrictive eating behaviors without this knowledge or her influence, so yeah, I think it can be genetic.  My dad has always gotten on our asses (my siblings and I) about eating and I realize now it was because my mom worried him when they were younger and he didn't want us to fall into disordered eating either. I'm sorry yours brushed it off.",False,False

It's something I think about sometimes, how underweight people are less likely to survive in accidents or when health issues pop up because their bodies have less energy reserved.   I'm scared the next time I get sick, it'll be bad. I haven't been sick in over a year and usually i get decently sick twice a year on the dot. I'm not looking forward to feeling miserable and I always lose my appetite, which doesn't help.  I don't think I'll have any health issues randomly pop up, but it's a pull back into reality to realize an unprecedented health issue or accident can fuck you up and make you especially vulnerable.",False,False

I know that my dad's sister has had issues with food, and that my great grandfather on that side of the family purposely overtook his (hypo)thyroid medication to try and lose weight.   I haven't asked for any more details to avoid suspicion, but it does make me feel a little less alone, and like maybe there's a reason.",False,False
