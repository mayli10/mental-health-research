You met the criteria for AN previously and are not fully recovered or a low enough BMI for full remission. It’s usually taken more seriously bc you can’t pretend someone isnt suffering or blissfully turn a blind eye. A low BMI is very visual and undeniable. Both can be dangerous but the more outward the illness is the more people think it’s valid. Same with BED and not being overweight. Mental illnesses are still stigmatized bc they aren’t always visible.   https://www.opalfoodandbody.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/summary-of-dsm-5.pdf,False,False

I engage in ed behaviors every day (restricting, fasting, obsession with weight and food, etc everything listed in DSM V) and I just don’t understand why that seems to be taken less seriously than “typical” AN.",False,True

That’s usually the term for partially recovered anorexics. It’s different to have atypical anorexia vs anorexia and have gone through some recovery/weight restoration. Both are valid just slight differences.,False,False

And just to clarify: I agree that being really underweight is unhealthy, I just think the health consequences of that are a separate issue from the post here, which is about atypical anorexia. And I'm not saying that everyone with anorexia has the same complications, just that according to the research cited in the podcast, people with atypical anorexia, when actually taken seriously by doctors, have many of the hallmarks of anorexia complications at similar rates to typical anorexia.",False,False

Their physical symptoms are not determined by their weight. It is possible that there are certain health complications more common in people who are underweight versus overweight, but that's not the point here. The point is that anorexia causes the same issues regardless of your weight, because it is the act of restricting and suppressing your weight that causes those issues, not your weight itself. Whether being severely underweight has certain risks is another question that is irrelevant to the question of whether ""atypical"" anorexia is dangerous.   I recommend listening to the podcast or at the very least reading the article and looking into the actual research if you would like more information about this.",False,False

If you’re very underweight and have a low bf % you don’t have anything other than muscles (including your heart) to use for energy, it just isn’t the case if you still have fat stores.",False,False

Often times restriction leads to weight loss, but that may or may not result in a low weight, depending on the person's starting weight and how long they have been restricting (eventually you might just maintain, but if you are still restricting you're still doing damage). It can also have to do with the amount of weight someone loses--if you start from a higher weight you can lose a greater percent of your body weight, but that is also frequently much more dangerous than going from a low normal weight to underweight.  So weight itself has very little to do with it; restriction and weight suppression is much more likely to be correlated with physical complications.",False,False

The guest is a fourth-year PhD student who studies this and she argued that atypical anorexia is likely much more typical (in terms of how common it is) than ""regular"" anorexia, and that weight is not a useful measure of severity or medically significant in the same way that behaviors and symptoms are--it is restriction, not weight loss, that causes most physical complications of anorexia.  She found that people with higher-weight anorexia, which is how she refers to it, have the same medical symptoms but tend to be dismissed more by doctors unfortunately.  So there are researchers and clinicians out there who agree with you!",False,False
