A special thanks to whoever gave me gold for this comment! If you're feeling the same way, I can only hope that we get out of this seemingly endless cycle. Much love. ❤",False,False

I dont know why I thought that if I lost weight I would turn into this beautiful swan that nobody could resist. I'm still single, friendless, and quite miserable. Just smaller. I still cry the same amount and have bad thoughts. Sometimes I think, '' Just a few more pounds until people start to love me.'' And then I lose those pounds and think the same thing again. Not even, ''just a few more pounds and then I'll love me.'' I'll never love me. That hurts. My soul is trapped in a body that she despises more than anything in this world.   Woe is me.

My face isn’t as round (although my double chin looks worse) but now it’s WAY more asymmetrical. I always think of that quote from friends where Rachel’s ex best friend says her friend is “all bitter because she lost the weight and turns out she doesn’t have a pretty face” because that is me 💔💔💔😂😂😂,False,False
