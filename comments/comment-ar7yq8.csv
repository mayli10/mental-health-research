Raw or cooked, I get so insanely bloated that I'm in pain. Spinach is my fave and it hurts the most. I have GERD and IBS, so starch-y things aren't my friend.   I wish I liked veggies; it'd be so nice to have a full plate of stuff for a couple hundred calories. ",False,False

Basically my only safe foods anymore are protein bars and low carb bread substitutes.   Definitely causes GI and malnutrition issues, so if you can find some veggies that you like, you'll be better for it.   If it's a taste thing, look into how you're cooking the veggies. For instance, boiled brussels sprouts taste awful, but if you oven-roast them with a bit of olive oil spray and season them well, they can be spectacular!   As far as non-veggie low cal junk, Chocorite candies are great, sugar free jello of course, and single serving packs of nut butters can be really satisfying. ",False,False

I force myself to eat some, but there are many days where I don't get a single serving of vegetables.   It's so difficult because I don't like the taste, the texture, the preparation time and the feeling they give me - not filled up, but stuffed without being satisfied, if that makes sense.
