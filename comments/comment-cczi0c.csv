I've always had a blood pressure on the low end of normal, and I have POTS, so even at the healthiest of times I get very dizzy whenever I stand. ED behaviours do make it worse though.",False,False

And anyway chest issues I might have is from anxiety and head rushes I guess.",False,False

But ugh good luck to us both and I hope it's not just our ages and we stay upright.",False,False

Even when I haven't been focusing on hydration or electrolytes I've been  okay. And I'm worried that it's because my body hasn't reached its absolute breaking point yet and once it gets there (and I'm getting older) it's completely downhill.",False,False
