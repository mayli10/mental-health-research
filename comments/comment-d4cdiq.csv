I eat out almost every day though so they’re surprised. Like I went to hawaii with my family and obviously didn’t know the calorie content of anything I ate and I came back from the trip at the same weight ):",False,True

You dont have to get to 145 right away but just a few lb could reduce some harm.,False,False

It would be a good idea to ask your GP for a check up to find out where you are right now.   For reference, my BMI hovers between 13.9 and 14.5. I had a series of tests done a few months ago that determined I’m generally healthy aside from a few vitamin deficiencies, which I’m now taking supplements for. You need to at least know these things so you can take steps towards harm reduction.",False,False

I'd recommend telling your doctor your concerns and working on a plan moving forward.  Gaining too quickly can also have health consequences and gaining through binging isnt going to help you once you need to maintain.  We're all here for you!

You are at major risk for osteoporosis. Your joints already hurting is probably a bad sign.  There's also a massive risk if you become ill. Not only is your immune system weakened but you dont have fat reserves to rely on if you become majorly sick. A common example is cancer - you wont have any stores to support you through chemo. I like the example of the flu though because it takes a manageable illness to hospital level really fast.  Not having fat stores can also fuck up your hormones as a young cis woman. Regardless if you want children, it can increase the risk of a lot of issues with your reproductive organs and damage organs/glands dealing with hormones.  It's simply not possible to stay at such a low body fat % and remain healthy.",False,False

You will need to gain weight and eat consistently to become healthier and stronger. It will help with the dizziness once you start eating more.

Even if you're not experiencing a lot of complications right now, you're setting yourself up for a lot of future health issues, potentially screwing over your metabolism, and if your body needs more nutrients than you're providing it then it's breaking down muscle for those nutrients- please remember your heart is a muscle!!

You simply aren’t giving your body enough to fuel it. You are very tall so it can be difficult to understand how much you need to eat when it’s going to be different from other people.  Does the idea of eating more bother you?,False,False
