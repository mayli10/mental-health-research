The problem is that’s so many calories and it’s honestly extremely hard to get down. You HAVE to drink the entire gallon jug within the day, preferably as fast as you reasonably can. But it cures it and starts curing it literally within 1 pee of starting, from my experience. I used to get like 5 UTIs a year and have never had abx for them  EDIT: BUT if the next day your symptoms come back, go straight to a doctor! But nothing wrong with trying cranberry juice first if you can’t afford a doctor visit or want to avoid abx",False,False
