I would train heavy periods of cardio restrict and binge drink. 3-4 times a week.   33 years of age to now I restrict and train all week and normally binge and purge after a heavy leg day. Usually Saturdays. I usually sit in the sauna and sweat out the liquids after bingeing. Then re-hydrate with alcohol.   The reason I guess I moved from anorexia to bulimia was the lessening effects of the hypertension from restricting &amp; the crippling hunger.    The reason I went from heavy drinking periods of 3-4 days to 1 was the effects the alcohol was having on my personal and professional life. Also I came to terms with the fact I wanted to die. My behavior was a slow suicide.  I am not 100% but I am working at it and I better understand myself. Hope my sharing helps.,False,False

You’re not alone &lt;3  I was definitely a “drunkorexic” for a while, I loved how easily I could get drunk or high when I hadn’t eaten. Obviously this was so dangerous, looking back I’m honestly I’m amazed I’m alive.",False,False

Yeah I feel you on overdoing what feels good, ironically makes you feel bad lol.  Keto has helped me the way weight lifting has helped you!  I hope I’ll try it, I’ve heard great things.  I hope you feel better soon, thanks for sharing❤️",False,True

Anything that feels good to me, I over do it because my brain is fucked.   I’ve pretty much obliterated bulimia by going to the gym regularly, I quit using drugs, but alcoholism is pretty bad these past couple of months. Started experiencing alcohol withdrawal which is hell on earth.   I’m in a shit place in my life right now, but haven’t gone on a life ruining bender since my last one in June. Had to go to the hospital to detox and it scared the fuck out of me   Gym n weight lifting has helped all of these things, though obviously haven’t eliminated all of my problems",False,False
