I try to remind myself that when I feel bad on what Iâ€™m eating and idk if this would help you but I gave myself a weight about 10 pounds higher than my resting weight when Iâ€™m not restricting. I made myself promise I am not allowed to try to diet or lose weight until I hit that number. Helps me a lot with little fluctuations :) because I have never been bloated by more than maybe 6-7 pounds.   Also congrats and keep it up! ðŸ’• super proud of you.,False,False
