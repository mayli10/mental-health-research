At least 1/3 of people at most raves haven't showered this week, never mind putting work into an outfit... Plus dancing is class cardio and not eating for 3 days wired off speed is a convenient way to fast for days. (you'll need to have a smoothie or something halfway through to keep going and will probably overeat the day after, but you're not gonna gain more than you lost over several days of dancing and barely eating...)",False,False
