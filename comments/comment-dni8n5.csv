Super hope you’re using epsom salts labeled for internal use and following the dosing on the package! Hope you’ll be careful - electrolyte imbalance can accompany rapid changes in hydration. It is often just unpleasant, but it can potentially become dangerous.",False,False

You’re drinking things that are going to also dehydrate you more than hydrate you. You’re effectively purging yourself of water. And the human body is a loooot of water.   In wrestling they do all sorts of crazy shit to drop waterweight for weigh-ins. One of my exes dropped 12 pounds for his by essentially living in a parka and garbage bag and not drinking water.   Super healthy.,False,False
