I can't imagine how overwhelmed you must be feeling right now, with this on top of everything else.   Do you want to talk privately? I lost my pet recently and it's still so fresh in my mind and my heart, I know how you feel and maybe venting a little would help. I'm sorry you've been having such a terrible time. I hope you feel a little better about yourself and everything else soon, and can bring yourself to get out of the house for a little bit.",False,False
