Saying ‘just eat’ to anyone with an ED is just as nonsensical as when I was told ‘just drink less’ for my alcoholism or ‘just stop’ for my SH struggles. They 1000% do not get it. The physical action is *not* the core problem here - the physical action is only the final domino in a long chain that starts deep with me.,False,False
