There are massage therapists who are specifically trained to deal with Ed patients but that's not their only clientele, so you don't have to disclose if you have an Ed. A massage is so relaxing and soothing and only a tiny part of your body is ever uncovered at a time, plus the masseur/masseuse have seen literally every type of body and everything there is to see. They are trained not to judge, and you can tell them concerns ahead of time. It helped me with just being able to accept anyone touching me overall plus I will never see them again so who cares what they think. Also pro tip a lot of massage places offer a huge discount for your first massage so definitely take advantage!",False,False

He sounds cool, If you have not already perhaps have a nice talk to him about it...let him know you appreciate his love and affection but would it be okay to hug in a different spot for awhile??",False,False

I don’t he feels anything but love for your body though. Just remember that you are probably thinking you’ve gained more than you have :),False,False
