I have enough eating problems of my own to worry about other people tbh. I dont have the energy to judge the way other people go about their food.   Also processed foods are everywhere.... they put chemicals in them to make them addictive. A lot of people grew up on processed crap and had very little access to produce due to poverty or geography. (Produce is cheap obviously but many families would rather see something that isnt as perishable as more economical)   I don't see the issue w/ people wanting to have more vegetables,False,False
