I didn’t watch the whole thing, but just her French toast breakfast would put her pretty close to her maintenance calories. That lunch and her snacks would mean she would be consistently gaining weight every day.   Maybe this is ‘what I would love to eat in a day’ video or just a trick to make her seem more cute or down to earth.",False,False

Most of the snacks did seem to be low calorie options. I really don't think she eats a whole bag of popcorn in a day or has much to eat when she gets the flatbread or pizza. She probably also doesn't eat the same things every day.,False,False
