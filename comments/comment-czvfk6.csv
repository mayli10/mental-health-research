And remember that sex isn't about being perfect! It's supposed to be fun. You don't have to be flawless to be good in bed. My partner and I have a very healthy sex life and it's not always perfect -- (TMI warning lol) sometimes one or both of us doesn't climax, sometimes it gets uncomfortable and we have to stop, sometimes we just get tired. And that is all okay. Movies and porn can give a really warped view of sex and how it works.   Sex is a wonderfully human thing, and humans are imperfect. You are worthy of love and affection, no matter what your ED brain is telling you.   However, I know that all this is much easier said than done and I'm lucky to have a partner who is very good with my body issues. I hope things turn out well for you ❤️ my inbox is open if you need to vent/talk more!",False,False
