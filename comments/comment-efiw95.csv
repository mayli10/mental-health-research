Bf really wants to start working out, especially so together with me, but the idea of him seeing my fat ass exercising is so scary and repulsing, I can never imagine this happening. My plan for now is to force myself to exercise in the coming months, get in shape, lose weight and MAYBE then I could allow him to work out with me.",False,True

My BF keeps talking about going to the gym and I would love to but everytime I actually think about it and picture it I start spiraling. Even the idea of him seeing me workout is painful even though we‚Äôve been dating for so long and literally talk about everything. My rat brain just can‚Äôt handle the concept of someone witnessing me exercising.,False,False

Workout routines, training for races, workout classes- they trigger the worst in me. I go hard in, have to go every day, can‚Äôt miss a workout, and then burn out and end up binge eating a lot. I‚Äôve lost a lot of weight this last year from CICO, and took a lot of long walks/hikes. I‚Äôve been wanting to try yoga, but that‚Äôs as far as I can go, I‚Äôve sadly realized. I used to run a ton so I would love to one day get back into it. But like you, working out brings up super unhealthy thoughts for me.",False,False
