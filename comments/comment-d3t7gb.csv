I was thinking about trying OMAD just because I can eat so many calories in one sitting. It’s sad that that’s my mentality but I need to lose weight and whenever I get close to a new lowest weight I stuff myself because “i deserve it” and gain back the few pounds I was trying so hard to lose. It sucks :/,False,True

Once I start eating during the day, I don’t stop. I have to stuff myself to prevent it. I’m only satisfied when I’m stuffed and I hate it.",False,False
