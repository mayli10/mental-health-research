I feel like I've transcended human needs, just for a bit. I'm not telling people about how long I've fasted because honestly it's an amount of time that would really freak some people out- and that makes me feel even stronger.  Joke's still on me. Yesterday, for instance, I spent ~10 hours sitting on my bed. Just. Sitting. Maybe using my phone. But mostly just sitting there or lying down, thinking, waiting for time to pass.  Oh yeah buddy. You're *sooo strong*. So fucking strong you fucking can't even leave your bed. What a life you live, just sitting and waiting. Idk who you even are anymore",False,False

I have to isolate myself from others so I don't flip on someone. My anxiety gets horrible by the end of a fasted day and I think that it's my brains way of tricking me into eating.",False,False
