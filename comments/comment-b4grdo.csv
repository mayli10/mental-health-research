Or if I have any energy lol then rocking on my back with my knees tucking in slowing can help x,False,False

I've also gotten a lot of relief from laying on my stomach then tucking my knees up into my lower abdomen. It gently encourages gas out. Drinking a cup of hot water also encourages bowel movement which would help with trapped gas. ,False,False

Hope you feel better soon! ,False,False
