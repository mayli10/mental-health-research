I have completely untriggered attacks that send my heart between 160-180 bpm and I black out/faint. Itâ€™s scary af. First time I went to the ER because of course I thought my heart was going to explode going that fast. They didnâ€™t take me seriously. They tested me for cocaine. Twice. Then have me Ativan and sent me home. It was frustrating. Iâ€™m sorry you had to experience that. Itâ€™s super terrifying. Hugs!,False,False
