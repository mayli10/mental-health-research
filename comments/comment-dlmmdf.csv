It was a scary realization that I could and would continue passing the years like this forever unless I force myself to get better and actually live a full life. that continuing like that, waiting for something (motivation, a person, a goal) to trigger me growing out of that lifestyle was never going to happen, and that I had to start right now.  It's possible though. I'm getting a little better, though I'm always super skeptical of my own progress lasting... but it's easier to see the real potential in others than in yourself, you know?  Reading your reply, I saw you SO clearly as a person somewhere out there who has all the makings of a full, fulfilling life - but has thus far been hampered by a really difficult, unfortunate situation. you always have and always will have it within you, though, and you CAN go out and live your best life once you beat back your particular demons.  sorry if that's off base or unwelcome, but I felt a really strong sense of empathy and optimism when I read your reply and wanted to let you know how strongly I believe in you",False,False

If she's otherwise completely sedentary, that's about a 500 calorie deficit a day = 1 lbs a week. Exercising on top of that makes things go twice as fast, even though it's only a lousy 2 lbs/week. Not to mention the slight thermogenic boost to your BMR that exercise has been proven to cause.  it would effectively be the same as restricting to only 400 calories/day, which I think is a lot harder than 900 calories a day depending on your flavor of ED.",False,False
