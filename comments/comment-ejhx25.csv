I've been on Topamax (+ ADHD meds but not vyvanse) for over a year now and initially found them helpful at reducing my increased appetite from my other meds (antipsychotics, antidepressants, and mood stabilisers). After a while though things seemed to balance out and my appetite was much like before I started taking them.",False,False

My mom has been trying to convince me to stop topomax for so long and that’s not happening any time soon. Also my psych is dumb and believed me when I said I need adderall to focus at my new job. She questioned my weight loss but still prescribed and eventually upped my dosage when I asked lol.,False,False
