I lost about 7 pounds in between seeing my long distance partner and they said that I looked emaciated. But when I lost 40 in between seeing my parents, not only did they say they hadn't noticed, *they said they thought I'd gained*",False,False

I found a size medium shirt of his and asked him if I could have it since he would never wear a v neck. He responded with ""it probably won't fit you"" I just kind of looked at him with a confuse look on my face and said ""it's a medium it should fit"". He turned around and went back to what he was doing. I put it on and of course it fit a little baggy like I expected. We saw his mom yesterday and she immediately noticed I had lost weight and asked if I was doing okay. My boyfriend said afterward that he didn't even notice I had lost.",False,False

It’s rude and it’s always so triggering. 😭",False,False
