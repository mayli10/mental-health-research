I spend a LOT of time and effort into making my face look freah and flawless....then people tell me I don't need makeup. Bitch, have you ever seen me without makeup? No, you haven't. Even when it doesn't look like I am wearing any, I am wearing a LOT.   People don't seem to understand that you aren't supposed to look like you are wearing makeup. The idea is to even out skin tone, hide flaws, and play up the best features, not to make yourself look like a damn clown.",False,False
