First of all, fuck that guy, and I'm sorry that happened to you. But also just from a business perspective...wtffff. The whole financial model of a restaurant rests on diners ordering plenty of food??? People ordering more than one entree is never a bad thing. Unless you hate your job and want the restaurant to fail, I guess.",False,False

Tasting a little bit of everything from normal portion plates (as opposed to those miniscule portions they serve at high-end fancy restaurants, not satisfying) sounds amazing lol",False,False

Not in a ‚Äúfood waste‚Äù way either, like he was totally disgusted with us for ordering more  than one entree to share.    Needless to say, it triggered the fuck out of me, I cried on the way home, and we never went back.",False,False
