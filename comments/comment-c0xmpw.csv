I‚Äôm also getting to the point where like I‚Äôm 26, no one can force feed me and I‚Äôm about to start making ppl uncomfortable and be like, ‚Äúno I‚Äôm actually not hungry and I‚Äôm not eating. It‚Äôs much better for me mentally to skip this meal than to eat it.‚Äù It‚Äôs been so long, it‚Äôs such a part of my life, that I just don‚Äôt know if I even care what other people think anymore.

I don't know how not to have one. At least you gave recovery a shot, which is no small thing! I know we're strangers, but I'm proud of you for trying.   But yeah....solidarity in feeling like having an ED is just part of my life. In some ways it's a blessing to have an ED that's even remotely ""manageable,"" but it's also kind of a curse...like even if I wanted to get better, which frankly I don't (I value thinness too much :/), I see treatment as a great way to waste tons of money on a problem that's a. not so out of control that it's putting my life immediately in danger, and b. so deeply engrained I am very unconvinced it would respond to treatment. Chronic EDs in adults are one of the most difficult challenges in mental healthcare.  That's not to say, of course, that there's no hope. Sometimes I just wish I could be open about my feeling that treatment - especially excellent, and therefore expensive, treatment - is not always a no-brainer for adults with long-term EDs. But I know if I admitted I had an ED that I'm not treating, people would lose. their. shit. And like sure, severe anorexia or bulimia is worth freaking out about, because those conditions are often actively life threatening. But it would be great if I could just admit to people that I have a non-severe ED that I am not currently doing anything about, without it turning into a giant shame carnival.   In contrast, I do openly talk about learning to live with my treatment-resistant anxiety and depression...but of course, those aren't vanity-based diseases of choice like my ED. /s  All I can say is I'm sorry you're dealing with this too. But c'est la vie! Look for joy anyway! Your ED does not define you üíõ",False,False

I had disordering eating before diabetes, and after, it just got so much worse. So yeah, unless that magic cure they keep promising us is ""only 5 years away"" happens, I don't see any point in treatment/recovery.   Because of insulin, not eating when I want to and eating when I don't want to, keeps me alive. So I might as well make my ED my BFF and use it to my advantage.",False,False

I'm 24 and have had an ED and depression for 12 years so pretty much in the same position. I think of my ED now like a physical illness that I have to learn to manage and will naturally relapse and remit. I've stopped crying over it, I'm sick of the emotional droughts. I'm focussing on keeping my mind busy and doing something fulfilling (I've just qualified as a doctor and I'm so ready to start working). I've tried multiple rounds of CBT, MANTRA, multiple antidepressants, self-management, etc. but my mental illness is too complex for a one-size-fits-all solution. I've been looked down on and shamed for being open about how I don't believe in recovery for myself, only management of the ED. I hate having an ED but just the same as someone with MS hates having MS. It can cause me disability but not always, and I'm stronger for learning to live with it, despite the constant pain.  My advice: don't think about whether or not you'll become the ED-free version of yourself that the rest of the world makes you believe is the ""right"" thing to do. Because that person doesn't exist unless you magically erase all those years. Instead be proud that you're here despite everything. Change will come when it wants to. I've stopped forcing it because when I fail it makes me hate myself more. I just want to do what I love until it drowns out the ED and the depression.",False,False

If you‚Äôre not in college then I recommend taking a gap year to figure out your health.   If you‚Äôre young and struggling ask your school nurse or family doctor about needing a referral to seek treatment at an eating disorder treatment center.   It could change your life and the earlier you do it then the better.   I spent 6 months in resi my senior year of high school. It did a lot for stabilizing my health so I could at least really truly enjoy my first 2 years of college.  On that note I will say this this is a lifelong choice that is made on a daily basis. The ED will never really quit, I‚Äôve never met someone who lives without some kind of thought every once in a while. But recovery is possible. It is possible to manage the symptoms and try to fix the traumas that fired it up in the first place.   You are more powerful than you could ever know. I believe in your ability to heal",False,False

I go to therapy and take meds and am generally doing well in life outside of this stuff.
