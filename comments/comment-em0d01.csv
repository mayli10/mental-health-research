Thanks for he checking up on lil ol me. I‚Äôm actually feeling a LOT better today. I‚Äôm still pretty nasty but my fever finally broke last night I slept all the way through the night in‚Äôs tree as of waking up drenched in sweat and coughing (victory!). I am so excited to not be burning up anymore. Already planning to spend the day hydrating and laying on the couch and honestly I‚Äôm probably not going to work tomorrow so I can keep resting. Thank you again for your kindness and your comments ‚ù§Ô∏è you are a wonderful person. Yesterday was hard to get through but I‚Äôm glad I made this post. Thank you so much!   Also idk the story behind your username but I used to read these children‚Äôs books about a dog named biscuit and all of his adventures and it just tickled me that your username reminded me of that.,False,True

I will def read that pdf I really like having the actual research to help me to understand (i love science and even though this is a horrific disease the science behind it almost makes me feel ... better? If that‚Äôs not too morbid.) and it‚Äôs nice to have concrete proof that I‚Äôm not nuts or overreacting. I‚Äôm def keeping an eye on my temp and I‚Äôm forcing myself to drink more water and high calorie smoothies to help fight the fever. I honestly don‚Äôt want to have to go to the hospital unless I HAVE to (but if I have to I won‚Äôt feel shameful anymore) .   I appreciate you taking the time to write such a thoughtful and informative reply. I feel a lot better emotionally and I am really touched by yours and everyone‚Äôs responses.

My BF and I have decided that I‚Äôm going to call a second doctor and if the fever persists I‚Äôll go see them on Friday (though tbh if I‚Äôm 100 degrees all day tomorrow I‚Äôll just go to urgent care).   Thanks for saying I‚Äôm not a wimp I can believe it when other people say it but not myself of course. Even my BF was like ‚Äúdude you have a fever go lay down and hang out or you‚Äôre going to end up making yourself sicker- I‚Äôll take care of you‚Äù and my inner child is just like holy shit.   I can‚Äôt wait until I can get healthier (in all aspects of the word!) I hope things are going well for you in your recovery üíï thank you so much,False,True

I'm so sorry you're having to deal with being sick *and* with having to worry about how your ED might affect your symptoms and ability to receive proper care.   I'm not a doctor and if you're really worried or are experiencing worse shortness of breath or rapidly intensifying symptoms, you should definitely call yours or go to the emergency department asap.  reduced or absent febrile response has been suggested in [some](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Rhonda_Brown2/publication/280887725_Reduced_febrile_response_to_bacterial_infection_in_anorexia_nervosa_patients/links/55caa54108aebc967dfbeba0.pdf) [research](https://rune.une.edu.au/web/bitstream/1959.11/335/3/open/SOURCE03.pdf) to be a pretty common symptom of restrictive EDs (PDF warning) and may somewhat impair immune response to bacterial infection in some individuals with restrictive EDs. it's also unfortunate because it can delay sick eating-disordered people from being put on antibiotics until they're much worse, which is where a lot of the complications come in. so your having being put on antibiotics already is really good! as you mentioned, people often won't really feel any better at all until a couple days into taking them, so it may just take a bit. one of the papers I linked also noted that AN patients who ended up requiring more serious care often presented with severe dehydration, so making sure to stay well hydrated might also be a good idea.",False,False

Thanks for your kind words - I think I just needed the validation that I‚Äôm not faking (I know you can‚Äôt lie to a thermometer but my parents did a number on my ability to validate and advocate for myself).
