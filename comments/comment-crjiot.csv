I know it's wasteful (money wise more than anything, since I just binge c/s on junk food anyway and that's not really nutritious). I'm even more messed up cause I end up vomiting after my C/S binge just to truly try and expel and calories I may have ingested. It's really horrible and it makes me feel like crap but the depression is worst than all the BS things I do to cope with eating.",False,False
