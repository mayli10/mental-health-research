If you want them to read your post, maybe edit the headline.  As for your actual post, is this the first time you‚Äôve wondered about having an eating disorder?  What else is making you think so?  It‚Äôs disordered to view your eating as some way to have control, but there are a lot more factors in having the mental illness. Is it about weight for you?  Do you constantly obsess over food and your body?  Are you afraid of food and what will happen if you eat more?  Do you have foods that are allowed or not allowed?  Obviously these questions aren‚Äôt comprehensive, but hopefully they‚Äôll help prevent you from jumping to conclusions.  Best wishes!",False,False
