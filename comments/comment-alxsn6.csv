That's a fact. I'm not saying this to make you feel bad at all, nor will I bore you with my personal health horror stories (I'm almost 30 and chronically ill now with a GI disease... coincidence? Hmm). But you may be very surprised one day to realize that these habits from your youth *do* affect your later health, even if you don't feel it now. Even if you think whatever you're doing is really not that bad.  I really commend you for being insightful and self-aware about this, but guilt usually isn't a productive emotion. No one is hurt by your behavior, except yourself.",False,False

I have always been healthy besides my anxiety/depression getting to me. My father recently passed away from complications from cancer treatment. I would feel so guilty seeing them, that I should be taking care of myself mentally and physically so I can live up to all of the potential that he gave me. I felt like such a waste (still do).",False,False

I’ve got some mental health issues, but I’m a perfectly normal BMI, my bloodwork always comes out perfect, I’m not diabetic or have any serious allergies... yet I can’t seem to get a fucking grip and take care of my body. I’m already on adderall as part of my treatment, but does that stop me from taking bronkaid and diet pills? Of course not!",False,False

Especially when I was doing pretty much every ~substance~ people commonly use (alcohol, marinuana, cigarettes, etc.). What helped a ton was just cutting out one thing to start. Weed was the easiest as I don’t even like it, then switching the cigarettes for a juul (trying to wean off of that now too), next to go was heavy drinking as that takes such an immediate toll on your body (nausea, hangovers) it was waaay easier than I ever expected to cut back from blackout drunk on tequila to a couple beers a night or two per week.   For me currently the last really nasty habits standing are ED and electronic cigarette! I take a bronkaid a day in the morning to curb appetite also but I don’t think using it in moderation is so bad since people actually take it every day for asthma, right?  Have you tried maybe thinking of one or two unhealthy habits you can cut out to start? It’s a lot less overwhelming that way I think than just confronting yourself with the entirety of your poor health at once. ",False,False

I have less than 4 or 5 years of youth yet. If I can get my ass into gear this next year, I'll at least me able to experience this for a few months.",False,False
