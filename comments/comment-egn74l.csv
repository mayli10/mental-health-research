Not even delving into the ethics of it... I just think they’re super gross. I hate mouths, chewing, and food sounds.",False,False

Also Stephanie, compared to other mukbangers on YT, never overeats or forces herself to eat everything. She also shares with her boyfriend (hopefully saves the leftovers) and the focal point of her videos are the stories she narrates, not the food itself i feel like. I find myself forgetting entirely about the fact that she has food right in front of her because I’m usually too into the story she’s telling.",False,False

As humans we are attracted to extreme behaviours, people who push the limits. Think people who climb up onto buildings or partake in extreme sports. It's irrational and dangerous, sure, but there's a weird voyeuristic part of me that wants to see a guy 50 stories up doing pullups off a window. I imagine some people may like mukbangs for that effect. It's seeing people eating to the extremes. I wouldn't label Steph's videos ""trash"" per se, but then again, my definition of ""trash"" may be a bit more intense.",False,False

Nik kept pushing Stephanie to bring up unrelated drama she had with another youtuber. He was manipulating her and twisting her words, saying things along the lines of ""but you said earlier you wanted to"". Repeatedly and slyly trying to segue the conversation to this minor drama she didn't want to talk about. She was scared and not an abrasive person so she didn't take a stand at the time. In one of the videos she's choking back tears.  He took weird secret photos of the inside of her house the first chance he got after Stephanie confided that she had been assaulted in her home and had anxiety about people being in her home.   All of this left her very mentally exhausted. She slept through another day of collabs after staying up having panic attacks. When she texted their group chat to apologize Nik was very abrasive, not even acknowledging her apology, being passive aggressive and trying to move her in to a private chat which she felt unsafe doing. Nik was repeatedly calling and texting her (called like 5+ times over 5 hours iirc).  Nik turned some of the things she said in her apology to inside jokes and had fellow youtubers knowingly and unknowingly mocking her publicly in social media.  He started almost blackmailing her on social media and in videos saying he's going to ""expose"" her about this.  Stephanie felt like it was all her fault and she did something wrong but after public harassment and threats decided to make a video to take back control of the situation.  This is basically the gist of it. Her video does a better job getting across the pretty disgusting and manipulative behavior from Nik. It was kind of triggering yet validating for me as I just got out of a similar friendship.",False,False
