The concern with these threads (especially the ‚Äúwhat did you eat today‚Äù) is that they would encourage disordered competition. This sub inhibits an odd space of benign neglect since we are neither pro-ED nor are we recovery only. We don‚Äôt encourage people to get worse and we don‚Äôt force them to get better. This means we walk a fine line with the reddit content policy.  We are totally open to suggestions but we do need to be very careful about the effects they‚Äôll have on our community *as well as how they‚Äôll look to outsiders/the admins*,False,False
