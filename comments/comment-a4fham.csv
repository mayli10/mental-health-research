I've been noticing it even more now that i'm attempting partial recovery and (tmi) have been pooping like six times a day. On one hand i'm pumped that my body is actually working (I was afraid the opposite would happen and all the food would sit and rot in my stomach forever) but on the other hand there's just that ""ew, i digested food"" factor.

Hate it for the same reason as you, because I know when I get less frequent, it's because I've been ""better"" with restricting. But I also love it, because it's like I can feel myself getting lighter and tinier. Ever hear someone talk about a whoosh after a day of eating at maintenance? I'm pretty sure whoosh is just a euphemism for massive poop.",False,False

I can’t adequately articulate the visceral disgust that I feel when considering how I have to have bowel movements. It feels like a permanent stain on my dignity. ,False,False
