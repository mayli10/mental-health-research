I wear really revealing clothing when I go out on the weekend and feed on the looks (although it's really fucking hard when I see real skinny girls ‚Ñ¢Ô∏è out at the clubs üò•)",False,False

I'm kind of in the same boat I think. I like wearing clothes that make it clear how thin I am. I'm asexual and I hate the idea of people finding me sexually attractive, but I still like showing off.",False,False

So I wear tight clothes/crop tops despite hating my body, it looks better than if it looks bigger than it really is... I only wear baggy clothes at home to hide my body from my family.",False,False

Idk why but I feel weirdly more confident now that my BMI is so low. I used to hate wearing crop tops even though my BMI was on the low end of normal. Now I wear tiny shirts showing my stomach, low cut tanks with no bra that show my chest now that I don‚Äôt have boobs, and I don‚Äôt hide behind high wasted pants. I hate drawing attention to myself but I still do this. It‚Äôs really really confusing. I went into the city today and got a lot of weird looks but it fueled my ed brained to keep going :-(",False,False

Shorts up to the cusp of my ass, shirts with all the cut outs to show the bones. I was basically screaming ""ADMIRE MY SKELETON"" while feeding off the looks and feeling the need to be *less*.  Then I had kids. So now I feel like I need to be more ""age appropriate"" I guess? I still show bone, but in more subtle ways. Like the collarbone, shoulder blades, etc. Maybe I'm just getting old, haha.",False,False

I have worn increasingly revealing clothes as I‚Äôve gotten thinner. It really ramped up when my bmi dipped into underweight. When people stare and whisper, it validates me like no other. I don‚Äôt want to be skinny to be pretty, I want to be scary-skinny. idk just a glimpse into my hellscape of a brain.",False,False
