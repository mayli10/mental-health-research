Growing up with a mom like that, it's sometimes not obvious...it took me years to realize that it's not normal for a parent to go snooping through diaries and emails and so on. I just want you to know you did nothing wrong by expressing yourself online, and you had every right to expect privacy.  I hope she's at least dealing with this in a productive way, but I'm sorry you're going through this either way.",False,False

I hope this ultimately results in getting help and living a happier life, instead of having the trauma of being chewed out for having an eating disorder stacked on top of the helplessness and pain of having it in the first place.",False,False

All children hide something from their parents, it’s normal (*cough* porn *cough*). Pls don’t act like he/she did something evil because he/she didn’t and it would only make it worse for both of you. This sub is a safe space for your daughter/son and you as a parent should respect those boundaries. Don’t cross them, everyone needs them!",False,False
