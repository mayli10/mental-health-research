Substance use with an ED can actually need a different kind of treatment since both have a comorbid relationship. In essence, if one gets better, then one might get worse as a way of coping. SUDs are actually extremly common in EDs. I think the statistic is 35%-50% of people with an ED also have a SUD. I hope you do well getting better! Please take care and good luck!",False,False

You’ll always have bills due, responsibilities to tend to, a social life you won’t want to leave behind, etc. but this sounds pretty serious. My suggestions are this: take a break from drinking for a while, if you can. You say you’ve had stomach ulcers before and I’m sure you’re re-opening those old wounds. Also, if you can, try not to purge anything for a while and stay away from acidic foods/drinks. If you don’t think that you can walk away from either the drinking or the vomiting, you need to talk to a medical or psychological professional about this even if it runs the risk of IP treatment. EDs are never “safe” and they’ll always be harmful to your body, but you should stop this bloody cycle before you do some really bad permanent damage to your organs. This is a pretty serious situation and as hard as I know it is to put anything ahead of keeping unwanted weight off, it’s not worth you dying in a pool of your own blood eventually. Stay strong and good luck.",False,False
