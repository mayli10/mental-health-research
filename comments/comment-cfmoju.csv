Everyone I've met or read posts from seems to deny there's anything wrong. I certainly tell myself I'm just fine, no matter how many hours I've been fasting. Especially for those who aren't underweight, it's hard to feel adequate or to believe. But you're posting here, and so am I. I think that might be proof enough.   People who haven't been through it tend to be clueless. Don't be too hard on yourself if others can't see your struggles.",False,False

For a moment I felt a bit of validation and dare I say considered maybe I should be more open asking for help.   We are all worth more than this shit.,False,False

It really really sucks to feel like your experiences aren’t real or important just because you aren’t suffering from the “widely known” disorders aka anorexia or bulimia. But I’m going to tell you: YOU are real, YOU are important, your happiness and health are important; and just because your disorder doesn’t fit into a pretty little box with a bow on top (as the media likes to present eating disorders) doesn’t mean that the people that know and love you won’t be willing to help.  The great news though is that it seems like the world at large is getting more informed about eating disorders in general! So maybe your parents will be understanding. It can be so hard mentally to say the words “I have an eating disorder” outright, but maybe you can broach the topic with “Mom/Dad, I’ve been having some trouble with body issues/food issues and I’d like to talk to a therapist about them. I may not be ready emotionally to open up to you completely about this right now, but if I am able to get some help you will be totally involved in my recovery.”",False,False

Sometimes I have trouble reaching or for help because I think since I’m not skin and bones, it must not be real. But I do know that I don’t have a health relationship with food and that even at my thinnest (which was quite thin) I would still look in the mirror and think about how much more work I needed to do. It’s still probably something I need to reach out for help with. If you feel the same way, you’re probably not wrong.",False,False
