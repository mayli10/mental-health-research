I absolutely hear you, and I think it just didn’t occur to me that my brain needs the energy to think clearly, for some reason. So thank you for that, I didn’t have the motivation or intention to ask for help but I think now I will",False,True

The space you are in sounds very risky my friend.  If you there is a part of you that wants to recover and have energy and happiness and a life again, now is the time to ask for help.  Being so malnourished makes it very hard to feel any happiness or hope. Your brain isn’t working properly. I’ve been here and it’s awful.  Getting help is the next step. Professional or with whatever support network you have. Life can be so much better, mentally, physically, emotionally, all of it. Starvation is a dark and painful road but it’s reversible. You are absolutely worthy of recovery. You can have a normal and healthy relationship with food and your body. You can learn to love your body and enjoy food without guilt. It’s so worth it. It’s so so so worth it to have happiness and energy again.",False,False
