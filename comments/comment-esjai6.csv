I think people only consider ""eating"" to be when they sit at a table with utensils and multiple varieties of food. An average person could eat an entire plate of chicken nuggets and still say ""I barely ate"".  &amp;#x200B;  Haha, eating a tuna pack salad thing and then drinking 2 bottles of wine alone does not add up to ""not eating"",  even if you tell every single person you've ever met that you're ""not eating much"". Sorry sweaty.   &amp;#x200B;  Pretty sure I consider my two spoonfuls of cashews to be eating, because it IS.",False,False

What you said for people with AN is mostly true for me, but it isn't true for all anorexics. I know several people with AN who were sociable and friendly. I will say that my biggest restriction trigger is physical violence (such as hitting, choking, shoving) because I want to be small so nobody will hurt me.",False,False

Unaffected drones) or naive like that after having internalised lots of mixed messages from yourself and others. Recover! Don't recover! Eat! Don't eat! Blah blah blah! Shut up! No one cares! \*Hysterical recovery fit\*  If she's never had an ED, and/or doesn't have any PTSD from it, none of this applies. I snack on higher calorie stuff. It's because I won't eat anything else  I'm kind of a picky eater (I prefer junk food). One day I might cut out fruit and vegetables completely and live off pizza and ice-cream lol  I think anorexics and bulimics have different social patterns/behaviours- anorexics are more isolated, less social and less group orientated  They're less likely to have friends in the first place and exposure to any type of eating habits. They were probably bullied and outcast or were unfriendly and unpopular  They feel inferior. Any arguments going on in their lives that effect them make them feel powerless and it's out of their realm of influence- like older family members, authority, people they can't reach  Where as people w/ bulimia- I think they're more network-orientated and relationship patterns that trigger bulimia could be arguments, threats, violence where they have equal or more power, and they respond to praise and are more agreeable than anorexics  They've had different kinds of feedback in their relationships to others (to anorexics)- yes they can co-exist AN/BN  Idk, these are just my thoughts",False,False
