I wish I could give you some advice or a solution that would solve all your problems, but unfortunately all I can do is relate to your struggles and remind you that you are important, cared for and worthy of recovery. I donâ€™t know much about the USâ€™s medical except that itâ€™s messed up, and Iâ€™m sorry itâ€™s not easy to get the support that you need. However itâ€™s great that you have professionals that can offer advice and are keeping an eye on your condition, and if you know that outpatient just is not working for you, I hope that you find a way to get the inpatient treatment you need as soon as possible. Please keep searching for solutions, because you deserve to get better. Until then, please remember that you are loved and supported, and that it WILL be worth it when you are finally healthy. I know itâ€™s so hard, but please please make sure youâ€™re drinking enough water and eating something, even if itâ€™s very small. Praying for you and your situation, hugs xxx",False,False

I have these dreams but I donâ€™t think Iâ€™ll ever achieve them. Everything seems to be crashing down and I donâ€™t know how much more I can handle. Iâ€™m scared my therapist is going to say she canâ€™t work with me unless I go to treatment. I understand why they do it. But it sucks. Itâ€™s mind boggling to me that in the US, we donâ€™t help people who need medical treatment of any kind beyond a few hundred dollars a month. $300 wonâ€™t even cover my rent. People have told me to take out a personal loan but I canâ€™t afford that. I canâ€™t afford to take out massive amounts of credit that I canâ€™t defer payments on until I finish school. My dietitian is right- this outpatient thing isnâ€™t working for me. I canâ€™t go a week without purging. I go days without eating. I want to get better but I canâ€™t. I want to give up because itâ€™s so hard. I almost died a week ago from purging. Legit. My heart was racing and I was in the shower and had to turn the water to cold. Thatâ€™s saying something for someone who is *always* cold. It was nearly 50 degrees yesterday and I was freezing. I told my dietitian (she asks every week about racing heart or i wouldnâ€™t have told her). She said thatâ€™s a really bad sign and my roommates could have found me dead in the shower. So I donâ€™t know what Iâ€™m supposed to do. Just die I guess. If I canâ€™t afford intensive treatment and outpatient really isnâ€™t working, thereâ€™s not really much else I can do.",False,True

Iâ€™m so proud of you for pushing through, getting away from your parents and seeking help - thatâ€™s a feat in itself. I know your situation is difficult now but one day you will look back on this and be thankful you got through it. Sending lots of love and hugs ðŸ’–ðŸ’–",False,False
