I am not in college (I am actually 37 and still dealing with this crap ðŸ˜«) but I do work in an elementary school with 2 psychologists on staff. It is in the back of my mind to approach them as a possible resource but my family doesn't even know exactly what is going on so I'm not sure if I want to open up to them about it. I will if I have to though.  I have googled therapists, also through Psychology Today, and that is where I ran into the road block. Two of them are straight up booked solid and I am still waiting for a call back from a third. At this point I might just have to go back to my useless therapist to see if he can offer any other resources. The only slightly discouraging thing is the one office I called said ED resources are scarce in my area and the specialist in their group often refers out to NYC because we are located about 90 minutes north.  At this point I am wondering if I would benefit from a short inpatient stay or IOP to get things jump started. The only thing in that case would be that I need to be honest with everyone in my life and I'm not sure if I'm there yet...  If nothing works out on my end, I might take advantage of your offer if you don't mind. Thank you so much for caring about a random internet stranger. ðŸ’—",False,True

I know there are usually clinics there with access for students.   Also, and I have no idea what your circumstances are, but maybe this is something you can talk to your GP about? Some are really stellar at sharing resources you would never locate on your own.   Lastly... (And this depends on how comfortable you feel) - your local library. I have my library science degree and I can tell you that reference librarians can find ANYTHING including community resources. Many places will do remote reference (via email or chat or phone) and can help you find clinics and programs. One of my test scenarios in school was helping someone irl find resources for their post-war PTSD.   Keep looking!! Keep calling places, sending emails, knocking on doors. I went through a list of literally hundreds of providers looking for mental health services before I found someone but I did! Psychologytoday has listings, try asking for recommendations from anyone without availability, call local hospitals, ask about programs there, walk into a crisis center if you can find one and see if they can help you find a treatment team. Call local universities with psychiatry or psychology programs and see about suggestions. KEEP trying!!!! Itâ€™s so so exhausting I know, and itâ€™s so unfair that it is so hard to find help when you are vulnerable but you deserve help!  (Also, idk how private you are so def feel free to ignore, but if you want some armchair google support from me, you can feel free to PM me and Iâ€™ll see if thereâ€™s anything I can turn up in your area -I know how frustrating this can be)",False,False
