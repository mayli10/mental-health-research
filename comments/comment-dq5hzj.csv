Their managers have an image to uphold. Thatâ€™s crazy with Mary-Kate. I donâ€™t know much about her so I just googled her and wow she really was very thin back then.,False,True
f62own8,t3_dq5hzj,t1_f61p66p,nomuddnolotus,1,2019-11-01 22:09:41,/r/EDAnonymous/comments/dq5hzj/all_of_my_behaviors_sound_creepy_af_if_you/f62own8/,"Definitely agree that weight is not correct for her. I have a theory that most actresses and their management lie about these things because if their true weights were known people would flip and start witch hunts over the bad example they're supposedly setting and what not.   I remember way back during all the gossip of Mary-Kate Olsen possibly being anorexic, before it was confirmed, it got out that her manager had been telling photographers specifically not to photograph her from certain angles because you could see ribs protruding etc. and they were trying to hide that. That was, what, 15 years ago? Holy shit I'm old lol. But I imagine these days they're way more careful about stuff like that, since people tend to be more educated on eating disorders and such nowadays.",False,False

Oh and sometimes I trigger myself by thinking that Iâ€™m not sKinNy enough for a boy.   Iâ€™m gonna die alone at like 30 with some cats lol.,False,False

I am actually a tiny bit taller than her and when I weigh less than 112 I still am not that thin.   She is my ultimate goal though so I wish I knew her real weight :(,False,True

But Iâ€™m just a bit smaller than her and a bit lighter but I look huge in comparison. Iâ€™m hoping youâ€™re right because Iâ€™m comparing myself so much to her!,False,False

From the outside though it would probably seem weird but most people probably do understand women arenâ€™t (usually) not looking at other women sexually.,False,True
f60xvbn,t3_dq5hzj,t3_dq5hzj,half-bad,1,2019-11-01 12:15:34,/r/EDAnonymous/comments/dq5hzj/all_of_my_behaviors_sound_creepy_af_if_you/f60xvbn/,I am both anorexic AND a lesbian so I might look even creepier doing these same things LOL,False,False

Cause I 35, Male so its not a pop culture reference to me.  I thought oh yeah American Gods. Clicked on info drop down and it had her estimated weight.  That seems mind blowing to me.",False,False

But this is very normal behavior with ED girls because of all that satisfying thinspo. Its different to look at them for motivation on your own body rather than someone looking at the photos sexually,False,False
