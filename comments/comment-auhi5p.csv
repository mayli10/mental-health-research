I always go with the generic version in Cronometer bc it has more micronutrients listed and I just trust it more. But this is definitely scaring me away from storebought products even more than I already am.,False,False

They ended up being right. They dissected the bowls and weighted everything out and the calorie and protein counts overestimated what was actually in the bowls pretty substantially.  &amp;#x200B;  Here's a prettier version:  &amp;#x200B;  [https://www.ontheregimen.com/2015/10/14/is-the-chipotle-macro-calculator-accurate/](https://www.ontheregimen.com/2015/10/14/is-the-chipotle-macro-calculator-accurate/)",False,False

My boss used to make me count how many pickles and stuff. So it's less likely the count would be off due to employee error than at a place like Chipotle where they're just scooping stuff into a bowl.

If So, a lot of people would not lose while calorie counting. And, i am pretty sure that the 20% off accuracy was an american thing ? Its quite accurate and always counted down to 100g (not portions) in europe.  But what the fuck was that Tofu Sandwich. That was malicious. ",False,False

I suppose that what you need to take from this is that: a) corporate franchises will typically be better at accuracy than mom 'n pop / small businesses, which is understandable because they're more likely to be held accountable. b) making your own food with unprocessed ingredients will always be better (but this is obvious. we all know this) c) anything that is prepared by a person will not exactly match the stated calorie estimate (also obvious)  i'm under the impression that measurement of food energy and calories is a bit of an inexact science anyway. as seen in that video, there's an absolute metric fuckton of factors, time, money and work that needs to be done in order to get an accurate result. this is simply not realistic for most small businesses. as such, they'll probably be using proxy measurements (adding up individual ingredients with known calorie values for instance) or using a more inaccurate measurement.
