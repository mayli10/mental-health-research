Honestly, I'm really grateful for the link to ask trans, as a lot of my friends are trans, and I'm always trying to get better at being supportive and trying to avoid unintentional transphobia. All that ingrained societal shit needs to back off, bc my friends are amazing and don't need that trash.  I did consider whether I might be NB for a while, but then I realized it was mostly because I was super ashamed of the whole age business, because it has this slightly predatory connotation. People tend to assume the age thing ends up sexualizing kids when my whole thing is escaping sexualization. I'm sure there's probably some gender issues wrapped into my brain, obvs. I believe gender is on a spectrum, and I probably skew a little more towards androgynous than the average girl, especially as I consider myself ace (probably not aro?), but I still feel pretty solidly set in the generally girl zone.  I will admit that I'm more tomboyish and that I don't really feel like a woman, but I *do* feel like a girl, if that makes sense? I kinda idolize ariana grande during her cargo pants phase lmao. I just bought a sleek, shiny ponytail hair extension that reaches my waist, and I have never felt more alive.  ",False,True

For me it's less about being more androgynous/less feminine and more about being kid-like. Unfortunately, age regression people often get preyed on by people looking for lolis, and I'm not gonna lie, some of the baby talk role play I've seen freaks me out, though I dont judge the people who take comfort in it if it helps them.

I've seen a handful of comments about hating chest size (r/proed) and it has made me wonder about the link with ed's in general.   I also started developing my chest at a very young age, and I have *always* hated it. But it wasn't long after it started that the thoughts of skipping meals and wanting to be thinner appeared. Here I am 20+ years later, still hating them (no matter how small they are at any given point) and still fighting food problems.  I wonder if we took note of girls who hate their (larger/ earlier development/ faster growth) chest from the beginning, what the likelihood of them developing an ed later would be?? ",False,False
