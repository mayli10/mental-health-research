It's also really normal for people to overshoot weight targets as the body is healing and then gradually drop some weight while eating intuitively. This doesn't mean getting ""fat"" for everyone- I think megsy recovery on youtube talks about the concept of a ""recovery body"" being just what your body needs to look like while it's recovering and trying to accept that.",False,False

If that's the weight your body ""likes"" to be, you'll probably stay somewhere near there, but take it slow and give your metabolism time to adjust.",False,False
