I usually just look for opportunities to give others some baked goods. I don't have a lot of money either, so I bake for birthdays, office parties, Christmas, New Year's, all other holidays where I know there will be social events.   Maybe you could bake if you knew that it would only be for other people? My gifts are usually really well received too. If you make something like mini cupcakes you can also keep one or two for yourself.",False,False
