I actually often feel like I don't have a real ed and if I didn't b/p would have no problem at all. I don't think I could ever just restrict on accident. I see posts where people say they recovered and then their habits start creeping back and they end up underweight again. I'm not like that. I feel like I force my eating disorder and i could just let it go and not have any issue and wouldn't slip into eating problems without making a conscious effort it feels like I'm faking and none of it is real at all! ,False,False
