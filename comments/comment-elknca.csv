Once it gives me 3 of the same reading in a row I’m good, but man does it ever mess with me. I can’t even recalibrate the model I have, so every now and then I weigh my cat on it to make sure it’s not out by some wild amount.   On the other hand my decade-old analog scale is more precise, but I don’t think it’s very accurate. I wish I could just get a medical scale.",False,False
