Most fruit, though I honestly don't eat fruit much so rarely buy it (living alone sucks for a lot of food that I can't eat in a short time)  tuna  egg whites  sugar free jello  peanut butter (peanuts and salt only) - but I have binge issues with this, so while it's ""safe"" I don't keep it in my house.    avocado  diet soda, sparkling water  protein powder (I bake with this, usually adding oat fiber in with it)  tofu  **Food that swings from safe to not safe and then back again for absolutely no reason:**  oatmeal   rice cakes  potatoes (obviously not fried or cooked in oil though)  gluten free bread - it becomes a binge food usually only because of the toppings. I buy peanut butter and make toast with peanut butter and homemade jam or banana slices which is just so damn comforting...crunchy toast and melty pb",False,False

You should be able to eat a goddamn banana if you want to. EDs suck that way sometimes. Bananas are NOT unhealthy.
