Anyways, got tasked with some HUGE things at work this week, and conquered them , which felt great. Decided to reward myself today with a cheat/""binge"" day (binge in quotes since a normal person probably would find it....uh. normal), and my partner accidentally made an off-handed comment about it.  So, uh, I momentarily went spiraling earlier today, and had a mild tantrum. The mood has passed, I've decided to not log today's intake but instead roll with the punches. Going back to strict XXX-cal OMAD tomorrow, and not sure if that's my ED brain or me being Smart but we'll see. My weight has been roughly maintained at my LW for the past week.  Also, took a leap and am in the works to starting talk therapy ASAP. it's scary and i don't want to recover at all, but ""trying not to die"" is fairly high up on my list of priorities at the moment.  Best wishes to allllll of you on here!!!üíï‚úå",False,False
