I’m honest and tell her I just don’t want the calories but I don’t allude to actually having an ED. I would never do it around anyone else I don’t think. Roommates is a unique relationship I guess,False,False

I don't do it that often just because I live alone and very rarely eat with people. At work i skip lunch and no one cares. But for example when someone brings something to share like cake or donuts I'll get extra napkins on one hand, eat with the other, and spit into them while pretending to wipe my mouth. If I'm with multiple people it's so easy. If it's just one person I'll wait for one second of distraction before taking an actual bite and spitting it right after. Also if i dont even want to taste the food that much ill hide it in pockets while no one's looking and after a while my plate is magically empty.  I had someone stay at my place for weeks recently and i just had us watch TV during every single meal so the other person would be distracted and i super easily spit into napkins and tucked them away somewhere and easily threw everything away at the end. Sometimes I'd even be standing around the house while pretending to eat a snack and go into another room, spit, come back to where they are, bite, disappear again.... Lmao it became an actual challenge, it was fun in a twisted way. ",False,False
