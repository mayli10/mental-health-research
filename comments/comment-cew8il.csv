No idea why it’s there either, maybe because I’m tired? I retain more when I’m tired.... or god hates me. I hate this, every time it happens I just loose the plot. It goes away eventually and then I feel stupid, but still here we are again",False,False

I had gone on a long hike, drank probably damn near a gallon of water, and ate a big bowl of restaurant style salty, salty ramen and got thirsty from the salt so I drank probably close to another gallon. The next morning AFTER peeing I was up 14 lbs. I damn near had to be committed I was so upset. But I spent the next two days peeing every 10 minutes and my weight finally returned to normal. Water weight exists just to make me suicidal tbh",False,False
