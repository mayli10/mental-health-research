Your body is likely dealing with a lot right now after restricting.   A 20lb gain could mean different things depending on your height.  We don't really need to know your BMI(I don't want you to feel like you have to share those details; you deserve your privacy), but 100-120 could mean different things for someone who is 5' or someone who is 5'8"".   Our eating disorders like to lie to us and you may be perceiving your body through that ed lens.   I really understand not wanting to become overweight, but recovery takes time, and your body may take some time to find that normal comfortable weight. Its likely you have been dealing with extreme hunger, which is also hit on a lot on those recovery YouTube's.",False,False

If you think you might be overeating you could try planning out your meals, but you'll have to be careful to not start restricting.",False,False
