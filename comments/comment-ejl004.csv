It breaks my heart to see how many shitty boyfriends there are on this sub (often I see posts from girls about their SOs being dismissive or even abusive or like, feeding their EDs and making them feel less than), I wish everyone had supportive partners (if they want a partner) who knows their worth and treat them right.",False,True

It’s wonderful that you have someone like that who is caring about not only you but your ED too.,False,False

I’m sorry your dad reacted the way he did, that must’ve felt awful. I guess people/parents don’t know how to deal with this type of information or might even feel like it’s their fault and so they react in weirdly defensive ways. I’m glad he came around, I really respect parents who are able to change their stance and apologise to their children when they get something wrong. Your sentence « our secrets keep us sick » is so on point. I am lucky to have a loving boyfriend who tells me I’m perfect now and that he found me perfect before and that he’d also be very happy if I gained some weight. Maybe I’m insecure but knowing someone will like me no matter what and find my looks acceptable lol (unlike my mom clearly as per this entire post), really makes me feel more relaxed about the food I consume.",False,True

However, you are definitely brave for telling her. It took me almost a decade to tell my dad about my ED. When I first told him (I couldn’t even say it, I wrote a letter) it was a disaster. He went on this strange and hurtful monologue about how I didn’t pull my weight around the house and how I took advantage of our relationship. I was in tears and so angry and distraught. I finally confronted him about how he hurt my feelings and how I just wanted his support (little things just to show that he gave a damn about my disorder. I think he was in shock and completely disoriented by my disclosure). He later on apologized for EVERYTHING and said he would try and support me and be more understanding. If your mother never comes around (worst case scenario) at least you had the courage to say something. Our secrets keep us sick. In the end, I think it’s important for us to be forthcoming to those close to us and say that we are not okay and struggling.",False,False
