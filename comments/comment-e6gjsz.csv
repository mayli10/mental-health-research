Like I specifically make a point to do all of my eating when I eat where someone can see me and I'll specifically schedule eating around events with family (like, oh my mom wants to see a movie tonight so I won't eat so that she can see me eat popcorn and think I'm normal) but they've started to see through it like... ""I know you had popcorn at the movie last night but are you actually eating regularly because you're literally crying about the house being too cold and it's 74¬∞""",False,False

You'd be better off bouncing your knee and twiddling your thumbs. All those ice baths I used to take... :(   If your hands and feet get really cold, I actually reccomend an epsom salt (magnesium sulfate) bath, it can help a bit with improving your circulation and the warm bath is niiiice. Toss some bubble bath in there... Mmm.... The only problem I have with this is I have to have one hand holding my phone and the other in the water. So now I have to have a seperate sink bath for just my hands.",False,False
