I hope she recovers quickly and fully.  Just remember it is human to want to go back to your safe place. It's hard enough go to through a trauma, but even more so in an unfamiliar space and without your companion. So please don't be hard on yourself for feeling this way.  ❤",False,False

I’m sorry to hear about your mother and that you’re having such a difficult time. I honestly cannot imagine what you’re going through. Life is difficult enough, and has enough problems to worry about, apart from what comes with an ED.   You are a strong person, and you can’t get through this and anything. I hope your mom’s recovery goes smoothly. Take care, my friend.",False,False
