Like, if my father thought the food was gross (basically everything is gross to him, even pasta) we couldn't eat it. Also, we could never cook anything indoors, everything had to be cooked on a hotplate outside and never on the oven/stove.     He also seemed to hate seeing people eat. He would stomp through and say ""you're busy always eating!"" Or ""you're only eating to try and get out of your chores!"", Shit like that. ",False,False

I would only eat pizza, ramen (cooked the way I LIKED), and macaroni and cheese. I liked having this control and I think these behaviors led to my eating disorder later.  I probably didnâ€™t eat a vegetable until I was 12. Being forced to eat foods would make me projectile vomit, and if my mom said â€œyouâ€™ll sit here and eat this or starve), I would have rather starved.  Iâ€™m still learning to eat food right as I never grew out of the pickiness. This past year, I tried steak for the first time, which was amazing. I tried sushi, which I hated, but I am happy to have done it. ðŸ™‚",False,False

I developed binge eating impulses early on. Iâ€˜d have mounds of empty food packages hidden in my room. Once my mom found a treasure trove of oreo cookies (just the cookie part, Iâ€˜d binge eat the filling) behind my bed.   My little brother (13) does the same thing now :(  In retrospect I totally get it. My mom has an ED (as far as I know, just BED but maybe also bouts of bulimia?). Iâ€˜m sure I picked it up from her. Food was always a source of shame and guilt in my household. ",False,False

In fact, for much of my really young years (4-7 ish) my family was genuinely confused about where a lot of stuff in our pantry went.

Even by my parents.   Also hated eating with people and was super embarrassed by making any noise (chewing etc) when eating.   I was raised vegetarian and detested milk, cheese, most forms of egg, and was just generally very picky even with vegetables, so I avoided most communal eating situations. ",False,False

There was a period of time I would only eat grilled cheese sandwiches cut into 4 little squares. Or a specific brand of fish sticks that I would dunk in applesauce. Or a specific brand of macaroni and cheese that I would only eat from a specific bowl.   I had to drink milk that Iâ€™m 99% sure my mom snuck Ensure into to fill the nutritional gaps. She never made it weird or punished me for my eating behavior but it definitely was a precursor to my eating disorder all the same. ,False,False

Iâ€™d only eat out of certain spoons or bowls, or with certain people, and I would be vehemently against certain foods. I almost never ate until I was forced to.  I think we all tend to have issues with control, perfectionism, etc. so this is just another side effect of it.",False,False
