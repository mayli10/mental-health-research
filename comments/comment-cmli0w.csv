There's a major problem in the bariatric industry for this very reason. Doctors figure, ""their stomach is smaller and they feel full with less, so this must work!"" Unfortunately, a lot of people will still overeat to the point that they are jeopardizing their surgery because they had an untreated psychological tie to food. I know this isn't the same thing as appetite suppressants, but pills and surgeries are only band-aids covering up a psychological problem for some people.",False,False

At least for me and several other people I know who binged/purged in some form, without having an appropriate nutrition plan, appetite suppressants just became another restriction/ purge tool that long term ended up early ineffective",False,False
