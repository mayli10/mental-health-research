I saw a picture of myself yesterday and I was like... what the fuck what are these hips they're like a girl's??? But sometimes I see a picture and I'm fawning over my own jawline. When I see myself in the mirror it's sometimes awful and sometimes all right. When I lay down and feel fat everywhere I remember why I hate myself again. Really it depends on the moment. And I know reasonably that I am not fat, I'm one of the skinniest in my friend group, people call me ""skin and bones"" (they *lie*), and yet... so yeah I feel you, basically, I have no idea what I actually look like, very weird.",False,False
