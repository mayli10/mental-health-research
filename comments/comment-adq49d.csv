You get so mentally burned out, so physically tired. You have so little energy. I remember switching between feeling overly relaxed and apathetic about almost everything outside of food/exercise/body image, just because I didn't have the energy to, because I was putting all of my energy into the disorder and either eating or not eating. I remember the fear/adrenaline surge I would get from worrying about food, or being around food in social situations. The crazy paranoid thoughts like you described about the coke/vodka. I stopped participating in a lot of my hobbies.  &amp;#x200B;  I remember early in my recovery when my brain finally started to come back out of the fog, and my eyes were opened, I realized there were all these little things around my house I had literally neglected to do for months, even over a year in some cases - I had multiple undeposited checks, unscanned documents. Lots of things I had bought or gifts received that were still in the packaging. I had bought a door to replace a broken one, and it sat in our garage for a year. I finally cut, painted, and hung the new one over a weekend. It was literally like coming out of a coma where time had passed me by. There were all kinds of things I remember talking about with my roommate and he'd be correcting me ""no, that wasn't a few weeks ago, that was last year"" or ""that wasn't last month, that was last weekend"". Easily the most disturbing thing was how warped my perception of the passage of time had become. My memory is poor, but it tends to either work or not work at all, and to have all of these ""gray"" memories floating around really messed with me for a while. Memories from that time were like vague dreams - fleeting, nonsensical images where you could discern almost nothing.  &amp;#x200B;  I really hope you get the help you need or find a way to recover soon. It's worth it. The best thing was the mental clarity. I remember the first time I talked to someone for 30 minutes without feeling like I needed to sit down or end the conversation simply because I was so accustomed to running out of energy mid-conversation... Watching/listening to people speak, but being unable to comprehend what they were saying, even after asking them to repeat themselves.",False,False

It drives me crazy how people try to normalize/glamorize this shit. It's not funny. ",False,False

Can kinda relate - last night I was up til 4AM as well because I couldn't fathom having eaten 800 cals after a 25 hour fast. I was having a panic attack over it and was checking myself in every damn mirror in the house. I'm currently on another fast and functioning on energy drinks and coke zero and no one at work even bats a fucking eye (even though they know I have extended fasts lol). Nothing about it is glamorous - I hope you feel better soon!,False,False
