My ex husband left me 6 months pregnant with our second child. It was so sudden and it was the day before my college graduation. His reasoning was i put school and career before him... but like.. i was graduating.. i was so unhappy till about 3 months after I had my child. But then everything just got better? Idk how it just did. Now im with an amazing man and know i deserve more.. it is hard though bc he was my bff for 6 years and eventhough my bf is amazing its different. But im much happier.. i hope you find peace üíï,False,False

I know its hard to eat, especially because you are going through so much pain. And its clear that you have a very low self-steem and thats why you feel like you miss your ex so much and dont want to eat. Right now i believe you have to work on self-love even if you keep fasting. It wont be easy  to get over him, but you have to do it, and the only way is to start loving yourself. I hope you take my advice and start looking for help. Whatever you are feeling right know just remember its going to be okay, and you deserve happiness. ",False,False
