I'm all sticky even before I'm sweating.  This is what we get every summer in Arkansas and it is nothing but miserable. The reason it feels so much hotter is that when you sweat, it doesn't evaporate, it just sits there on your skin not doing its job to cool you down. Fans are actually really good for this, the moving air helps your sweat evaporate.   Also, I keep a couple [gel bead cold pack things](http://www.oslinepromo.com/WebSite/images/stories/virtuemart/product/hc-01-b1.jpg) in the freezer and put them on my neck, arms, and legs where the veins are closest to the skin. Cooling your blood off and then letting your blood cool the rest of your body is something I've seen in a lot of nature documentaries, and I figured it'd work for humans too, lol. It does!",False,False

This week a lot of life stock has died. My home is so warm even my meds are melting. And it's not even the warmth I feel when I'm on vacation in Southern Europe. It's wet warmth. I'm all sticky even before I'm sweating.      I need to do stuff but the heat literally keeps me on the couch. I feel so exhausted and I don't sleep at all.

So I started to feel uncomfortable right away, because he didn‚Äôt tell me that he was going to pull my leggings down. He seemed to pull them down a lot more than necessary to access my lower back, but I was like OK whatever. But what really bothered me was a comment that he made, so I was talking about how I play soccer. And he was like oh OK what position? And I was like goalie. So this is when he said ‚Äú Oh so you like balls coming at you‚Äù? And I was shocked I didn‚Äôt even know what to say.
