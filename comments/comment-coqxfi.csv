I take 50mg hydroxyzine often to help with anxiety and insomnia at bedtime and it helps keep me from waking up in the middle of the night basically sleep-walking to sneak in snacks, and it truly does help me get a restful sleep since restriction and anxiety cause some issues staying asleep for me.   I have taken it as needed for going on three years now and have yet to experience weight gain because of it! Hope this helps.",False,False
