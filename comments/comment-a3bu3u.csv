I think if I didn‚Äôt have the genetic double chin and tummy tire that I have, I would have NEVER been an anorexic teenager, and then I wouldn‚Äôt have developed BED during my first ‚Äúrecovery‚Äù.   I had a double chin even when my BMI was around 17.  I have more of a double chin now than some people who are literally 100+ lbs heavier than me have. It‚Äôs not fair. ",False,False

The boys in my grade when I was 9 or 10 would literally slap them when I was sitting down because they thought it was funny to see them jiggle, and harass me for being ""fat"" (I was not overweight as a kid). That shit stuck with me. I feel like if they'd been small, I genuinely may not have had all of the different circumstances that came together to contribute to my development of an ED.  If I could change them now, I know my ED wouldn't magically go away, but it's easy to look back and see what could have maaaaybe avoided this.",False,False
