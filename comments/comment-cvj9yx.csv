But I want to remind you, that there's not just anorexia out there... there are  a lot  of different eating disorders and you don't have to be thin to have an eating disorder, even when it's about the diagnosis.    Your disorder is valid.",False,False

That ... really really hit me. Thank you for this.

Please just remember that EDs are mental illnesses, not physical ones. The ways that EDs are diagnosed are so awful that a lot of doctors and therapists these days donâ€™t even diagnose them anymore, they just try to treat the symptoms (at least where I live). You are valid. Normal people with normal relationships with food do not do what you are doing. You do not have to be skinny to have an eating disorder. You. Are. Valid. Please stop being so hard on yourself and if you ever need a chat feel free to DM me. Sending lots of love and hugs ðŸ’• xx",False,False

Given that eating disorders are classed as a mental disorder, your thought patterns definitely reflect those of someone who is struggling with an eating disorder.  I'm sorry you had such a poor experience with a counsellor. Their reaction is likely a reflection of their lack of training, not whether you are unwell or not.",False,False
