My perspective towards both my problem and 'when' or 'if' I'll be ready for recovery seems to be different everyday. This is why the nature of eating disorders are dangerous. Your mind convinces you that you need to reach a certain standard weight wise in order to have willingness for recovery and accept help.   If you think about it from a logical standpoint, that way of thinking is completely distorted. Take no offense to this but in my view, recovery should be an attempt to getting better. While a lot of us myself included have tried to make ourselves sicker and deeper into our eating disorders just so we feel we can get help? It doesn't make any sense to me. In doing this we are actually letting our eating disorders win and we only lose almost everything in the process (we lose our health, our friends and family, our sanity sometimes even).   The ""when I'll be ready for recovery"" is controversial to many. I am starting to think an ugw is just an illusion and the eating disorders' way to keep me ill. I reach my desired weight and mostly conclude that I am unhappy and unsatisfied with it. I feel like the stigma of eating disorders is also what prevents a lot of people from getting help or support. I find this sad and unfortunate, it shouldn't be that way at all and I hope it changes one day.",False,False
