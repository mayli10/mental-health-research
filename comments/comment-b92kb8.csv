I worded my post a little weirdly so it sounded like I didn't know what AN was , I do have an eating disorder myself so I got that part. I was just seeing people posting on eating disorder subs when it didn't sound as if they had an eating disorder at all which led me to become really confused. But now i get it and I really appreciate this community aswell. It helps me a lot to talk to people that i can relate to!",False,True

Some drugs/medications for example won’t make you hungry and list “anorexia” as a side effect.   Anorexia Nervosa is completely different. It’s a disorder that consists of a variety of characteristics (not just a decrease in appetite because it’s not really about that). In order to be diagnosed with Anorexia Nervosa you need to meet the specific criteria for it (meet all/certain number of characteristics).   ,False,False

Anorexia on the other hand isn't, and can be caused by other physical illnesses. With anorexia, you don't feel the urge to eat but you don't fret over it. With AN your whole life probably revolves around food and how much you're allowed or not to eat, you often have rules dictating exactly what you can eat, when, and how.
