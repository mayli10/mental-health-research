I couldn't care less how big other people are. That's on them. I personally prefer to look a certain way that is smaller. That really has nothing to do with my ED though. I preferred being smaller before my eating disorder. Eating disorders are a form of mental illness. Mental illnesses are not in your control. You can love your body and still feel the need to restrict or to purge or to partake in other forms of self-harm that are common among people with eating disorders. If somebody thinks that my desire to be thin means I hate fat people that's nothing more than them pushing their own ideas onto me. I know that there are people out there who are cruel to people who are heavier than average, but that doesn't make it right to say are people who are literally sick are all fatphobic as if there's nothing more to it than that.",False,False

I’m sorry somebody saw you opening up about something very personal and found a way to attack you with it, OP. I hope you’re doing okay.   I think everyone deserves to love their bodies, no matter how little or how much body there is to love. We should all love ourselves deep down, a spiritual love that naturally extends to a physical love; whether you’re 95lbs or 495lbs, I believe this to be true.   However, I think part of loving yourself comes the responsibility of knowing what’s healthy for you and knowing the things you ought to change for the better. Like, I know this is real rich coming from a user who frequents an ED sub, but self love is just as much “it’s difficult for me to walk because of my weight so I’m going to go to the doctor to see what I can do” as it is “I am going to eat this slice of cake bc I love cake and that will make me happy”.    It really saddens me to see people with eating disorders casted as the “enemy” of body positivity movements. We deserve body positivity and the message of self love as much as anyone else. If my eating disorder makes someone who is overweight uncomfortable, that’s just not my problem; I have never once projected my mindset onto other people, never once said “ALL overweight people need to be losing weight through self-loathing and restriction!”, this is not a punishment I think anyone is deserving of, it is simply the illness that lives in MY head and tells me how I should treat MY body.",False,False

Now what?   Nothing has changed, the universe didn’t implode, Fat Activists haven’t started beating down your front door, no police are on their way.   Accusing you of some flavor of thoughtcrime is ultimately pointless unless you give them power by denying it and engaging further.   The thing is, the type of person making this argument is trying to equate someone’s disordered preoccupation with gaining weight or carrying excess fat as an outward manifestation of internal control with something akin to racism. And that’s simply insane.   You can’t reason with unreasonable people. My advice to you? Stop engaging with this person and others of their ilk. If they are so narcissistic as to believe that a mental illness makes you morally flawed, it’s time to disconnect. You aren’t going to change their mind via twitter arguments.",False,False

But like I said - just don't lie. Like I've read obese people saying how they eat around 500kcals and day they GAIN weight..I am like ""that makes no cents, luv"" Atleast own that you are obese.",False,False

Like people can be overweight and ‘healthy’ in the sense that they’re not pre or typ2 diabetic or whatever but excess weight still puts a tremendous amount of strain on your heart and bones and lungs and that in and of itself is NOT healthy. Being at risk of illnesses you wouldn’t otherwise have is also NOT healthy. And I hate people the push the notion that it is.,False,True

I don't care if they are healthy or not, that is on them and I don't care how they look - but I have a problem with their fatlogic and delusion. You can be morbidly obese and not be delusional saying how you can't lose weight, you weren't meant to be skinny (when you can at least be in the normal range) &amp; that is just your set point. When I hear someone talking about how it is genetics or their slow metabolism or **starvation mode**. I have problems with that, there are people who want to lose weight and they get lied to because someone would rather lie than face the truth. People like Tess Holiday say how they are super healthy and fine.. but you can see that this is not true. The Body Positive was started for people who have lost a limb, have some sort of disease that affects how they look and so on, but now it is all about how fat is beautiful and healthy... And I dislike that. If you want to stay fat - fine, however don't lie to people saying your weight doesn't affect you.",False,False
