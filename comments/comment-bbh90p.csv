I don't think i'm using food as a distraction but rather just something to do. I don't have binge tendencies since i've never done it before but i think apart of it is me being worried that i will and lowering that risk by not being hungry.,False,True

What has helped me is very lose intermittent fasting. It wasn't really my portion sizes more that I constantly grazed on small snavks/meals. I was not overeating in terms of calories over maintenance but i felt self conscious because I felt like I was always eating and therefore greedy. I did this because I'm obsessed with food and it made me realise I use food as a distraction so much and also that I never allow myself to feel hungry without reacting to it. I'd rather entertain myself by eating another 100g of Yogurt than read or apply for a job etc. So anyways I implemented a no food before 1pm rule initially, then condescending the snacks into meals. I tried to employ mindfulness when I felt hungry to slow down the panic urge to snack, but this was quite difficult so it was often easy for me to leave the house and occupy myself instead. I know this approach may not be so straightforward if you have binge tenancies since being overly hungry may be a trigger, but thought I'd share my two cents.",False,False

So I no longer know what a normal size meal should look like and because I don’t get a “you’re full” que from my body, I’m always scared to overeat.   Trying to learn how to eat small portion meals now every somewhat hours to get used to it and also slowly, (very slowly) incorporate higher calorie things but allow myself to eat them because it’s low volume",False,False
