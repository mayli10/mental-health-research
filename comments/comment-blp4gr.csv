You might've been the very first person to ever point out to them that not everyone wants to weigh themselves and that they don't HAVE to in order to measure progress. I think you should feel comfortable going back to that gym so that this scenario doesn't happen to anyone else.",False,False

Thereâ€™s a few people in my family that refuse to weigh themselves at all (they donâ€™t have EDs), but they work out like every day. They say they donâ€™t wanna feel like they have to care about the scales going up while theyâ€™re trying to put on muscle, and as long as theyâ€™re feeling good and making progress with lifting weights then thatâ€™s all that matters. I honestly wouldnâ€™t have given it a second thought if I heard someone say that.",False,False

He also repeatedly offers to weigh me in to check my progress.  But no, my weight is my business, not his. I hate other people commenting on my weight.",False,False
