To gain ten pounds, you'd have to eat maintainence plus 35,000 calories. That's roughly 141 slices of your average pizza, for example. I really, really doubt you did (or even can) gain ten lbs in one day :) drink lots of water and avoid sodium for a few days and see how you feel. also remember to never weigh yourself after eating or drinking a lot, because the weight of the food or drink inside you will skew the number.
