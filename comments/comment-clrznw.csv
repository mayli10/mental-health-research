I also personally despise the idea that someone with anorexia has to *look* a certain way in order for others to validate that they do indeed have an eating disorder. I know people who are recovering from anorexia but say that despite being weight restored struggle with the disorder more in recovery than when they were underweight. And I personally believe that someone can be overweight and be anorexic/have any type of eating disorder.,False,False

Like, these thoughts never seem to end. For me, after I realized they weren't gonna stop, I basically just had to decide not to listen to them.",False,False

The other 10% is me worrying over the beginnings of pressure sores I'm getting on my chest and spine, and heart palpitations, and my hair thinning out more and more. But mostly I'm like nah fam I'm just a drama queen ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯",False,False

So many people I know are on intense diets like &lt;1200 cals or intermittent fasting, and I always think when I have days where I eat a normal amount (or more than normal lol) that 'regular people' who are just on diets are probably eating less than me that day, and if they don't have eating disorders than do I? Or if I'm eating the same as someone that's just on a diet, then what's the difference between me and them?  That's not to be accusatory of those people in any way, just that I have seen a massive increase in people eating very low cal diets or diets with very weird eating schedules that remind me of my own diet and it makes me doubt myself. Presumably a lot of them would lack the horrible disordered thinking and anxiety around food, but I can't see in their heads, I just see what they eat and compare that to myself - and sometimes anxiety makes me binge eat food and I feel fake.",False,False

I was trying to explain to my brother and husband how I hate eating in front of people who know I have an eating disorder because I don't want them to get mad at me and the were like... uh... what?    I tried to explain that as soon as someone *knew* I was *allegedly* anorexic that if they saw me eat anything EVER they would be mad because they would think I faked the whole thing.,False,False

I feel too big, I feel like I don’t restrict enough, and half the stuff that’s posted here I can’t relate to. I tell myself that I am anorexic and even if I wasn’t there is still something deeply wrong with my brain and that’s valid enough.",False,False

But I constantly feel bad about not being a good enough anorexic which is weird because I want to recover so being a bad anorexic in a sense is what I need to be,False,False
