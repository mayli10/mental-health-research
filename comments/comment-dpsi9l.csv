Unfortunately I doubt it's possible to zap you into a healthy relationship with food overnight... it sounds like  the place you're in right now needs some sort of structure so you can stop bingeing, and eventually move to a place where you don't have to count calories (like start with 1 meal a day where you're not counting, increasing to two, etc). You're absolutely correct, people with a healthy relationship with food don't count calories or have meal plans. I am just not sure it's possible to jump from what it sounds like you're experiencing, to healthy-person-ness. Unless you can walk around with someone else all day and eat exactly what they do, or something. (not entirely a joke)",False,False

I’m so done with counting calories and worrying about what I’m eating. It’s mentally exhausting and I don’t feel like it’s what people with a healthy relationship with food do?   You’re right though I should have healthy food available for when I’m in the “very hungry” moods.,False,True

What about if you do like 400 calories every 4 hrs? Not sure what your TDEE is, but would that structure help? Or something like that.",False,False

First one made me take diet pills to get to a weight that was below the normal BMI and the second one introduced me to cheat days which was a whole new way of binge eating. I get what you mean though and I do think I need to have meals prepared for when I’m hungry and will eat anything but I really hate microwaved food and it’s not possible to cook all the time. I know a happy medium exists but my problem is that I only know how to function on extremes. Thanks for the advice though. I appreciate it.,False,True

Working with a registered dietician? I think intuitive eating is misunderstood. Geneen Roth does what I think is a good job of explaining it - eat what you want when you are hungry, and being hungry is like being in love (you KNOW you are hungry like you KNOW you are in love). It's still HARD, and I don't think it's a great place to start. It sounds like you need more structure.",False,False

I too haven't found a solution yet, for now I'm doing my best not to obsess but it's always a challenge and binge town is always around the corner (along with purge town!). Today I prepared a cake for a special dinner with my boyfriend, and could not help licking the spoon wich totally led me to binge. I stopped at least and I'm not purging but still... is this ever going to end? Am I ever going to lick a spoon again just for the pleasure and stop there, and not feel horrible?",False,False
