I bled for two months straight, stopped for a week or two, then had a god awful period. My period were fucked up for nearly a year from one shot. I would recommend a lot of research before taking it. I did lose weight but it wasnâ€™t a good thing because i was already underweight, and that is actually a very rare side effect. Most people gain 4 dress sizes from the shot. Definitely look it up! I would never take it again ever.",False,False
