And it’s a terrible feeling. You shouldn’t have to feel bad about eating.   If you want to talk about it at all, you can pm me.",False,False

It’s absolutely none of that dude’s business and he’s just being a complete ass. I don’t know if there’s anything you can do other than telling him to leave you the hell alone and that he’s being a douche. I would disregard anything he says because it has nothing to do with him.   I’ve dealt with friends, family members, and people I didn’t even know trying to “make sure I eat” and trying to make me to eat or try new foods and it’s so frustrating and such a pain in the ass. Just remember it’s truly none of their business and try to ignore them as best you can.   Good luck, and I hope it gets better for you :)",False,False
