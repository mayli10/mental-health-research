I'm gonna post the same info I referenced in the meme sub a few days ago.  From UC Berkeley's Wellness site: ""In a study in the journal Obesity in 2013, NIH researchers determined the true calorie content of two dozen snack foods (national brands), including chips, candy bars, and cookies, using a calorimeter. They found that the actual calorie content was 4 percent higher, on average, than labeled. That’s pretty accurate, as such things go.""  ""In a study in the Journal of the American Dietetic Association in 2010, researchers purchased 39 reduced-calorie frozen meals (such as Weight Watchers and Healthy Choice). [...] The frozen foods averaged 8 percent more calories than labeled.""  ""In a study in the Journal of the American Medical Association in 2011, researchers looked at foods from 42 fast-food and sit-down restaurants. Of the 269 foods, one in five contained at least 100 calories more per serving than stated, and one in 10 averaged about 275 extra calories. Discrep­ancies were greater at sit-down restaurants than at quick-serve chains.""  So basically, packaged foods are pretty close to their labels. Frozen foods aren't as accurate, but they're not wildly undercounting, either. Restaurant meals, on the other hand, are more of a crapshoot, largely due to portion size variability.  Personally, I choose to take this info as a reminder not to be rigid about calorie counts. And frankly, if calorie counts were truly out of control, most CICO dieters would never lose weight. But I see successful non-ED dieters trust packaged foods like this all the time, and they still meet their weight loss goals.",False,False

I only eat whole foods that the calories cannot be wrong, like vegetables or fruits like potatoes and stuff. if i'm feeling brave, certain grains like popcorn quinoa or brown rice.",False,False
