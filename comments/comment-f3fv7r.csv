At this point my hunger cues were those of a normal person’s, and the meds were 100% an appetite suppressant for the first month or so. Then the effects faded.  This summer, I went back on 150mg after two years of being off of it. Little desire to eat, and binging/purging lacked its appeal. That effect wore off after a few weeks.  Caveat: I am bulimic, and haven’t gotten hunger signals like people are supposed to since I brought restricting into my disorder. Either my brain wants to b/p, my brain wants to munch, I’m nauseated and dizzy, or I am neutral. I never feel physical hunger. So I think that my experience this summer would probably be the equivalent of legit appetite suppression.",False,False
