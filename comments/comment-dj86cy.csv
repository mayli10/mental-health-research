That would be a hard lie to work around based on me eating only salads in their presence at work all the time. I don't hate the idea of lying to protect myself, I just hate that I feel like I need to so my ED can thrive. It's so fucking frustrating.",False,True

People usually don’t press it and if they do I just say that it’s a sensitive topic I’d rather not discuss. Makes them look like the asshole for prying into someone’s private life. And honestly, it’s not even a big lie. I do have a condition that makes it hard for me to eat, it’s just not in my stomach.",False,False
