I'm doing my best to ignore urges to skip lunch, because I still need healthy fuel throughout the day, that's how bodies work. I'm still struggling immensely, but like. I already purged. I cant change that. But going forward I can take steps to prevent another b/p, one of which is to eat my healthy lunch and ignore my ED voice saying I dont deserve it. Cause I dont have to work for my food, dammit!!!!!!!  Anyways, thank you for being sweet (-:",False,True

I try to put them in perspective of the bigger picture. Even though it feels like the end of the world, looking at it from an objective standpoint really helps me. I’ll say to myself “okay, that was 1500 calories. I’ve eaten a lot more than that before, and I made it through. This won’t hurt me. It’s almost nothing in the long run” and that generally helps ME.",False,False
