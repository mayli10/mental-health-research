I think itâ€™s just me having weird texture issues/being a baby when it comes to tastes, haha. The only way I can manage kale right now is mixed in a smoothie with berries, which I guess is better than not consuming it at all. (Iâ€™m a former junk food junkie!) But like you said, the other veggies are low-cal and high fibre so at least Iâ€™m getting those into me at this point :) ",False,False
