The binge eating episodes are associated with three or more of the following:  - eating much more rapidly than normal  - eating until feeling uncomfortably full  - eating large amounts of food when not feeling physically hungry  - eating alone because of feeling embarrassed by how much one is eating  - feeling disgusted with oneself, depressed or very guilty afterward",False,False

When I ordered it the cashier says to my dad ""We're closing up right now, so do you just want to take the rest?"" Of course he says ""Hell yeah!"" And that, ladies and gents, is how I ended up eating a dozen donuts in an hour.",False,False

I have plans to go home after work and gorge myself. Idk if I'll be able to stop myself because I've lost all will to do so. ",False,True
