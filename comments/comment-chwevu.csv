I don't eat normally because I hate myself and hate food and love food and want to disappear and have a horrible, horrible, constant self-critical stream of consciousness. It is awful and feels awful.  I don't think it feels *good* to be concerned a friend isn't eating enough, but I'm sorry, it is less uncomfortable for you to see me eat a small meal than it is for me to force myself into eating unwanted food. If food wasn't insanely difficult and emotionally charged for me we wouldn't be in this place.  It's just a type of insensitivity/entitlement imo, really frustrating to deal with. I will not make myself worse to pretend to be better for your sake.",False,False
