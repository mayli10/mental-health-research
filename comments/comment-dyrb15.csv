Your boyfriend (hopefully ex) is a horrible person. Cheating was his fault. Hes only twlling you its yours becuase he knows you have low self-esteem and that you'll take the blame if he tells you to.   This is a really bad spot for you but although you feel awful I promise you'll get through it x keep moving and doing your best and everything will work out. Nothing stays bad forever as long as you keep moving.,False,False
