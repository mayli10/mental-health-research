My Garmin will say I burn 100 cal for every mile I walk and I KNOW thats not accurate.,False,False

Average across many days, it'll be incredibly precise. Any error will come from the bmr and tdee (from heartrate)​ formulars they use and the parameters you put (height, weight).  Step count and floors climbed are not accurate tho",False,False

With a couple hours of moderate+ intensity activity, a Grand Total of 2,500 is totally possible. (My brain knows this to be true yet still says ‘nuh uh, no way dat can be’ when my own numbers indicate something similar.)   I use an apple watch and trust the kcal it estimates I burn during exercise, but mostly ignore its ‘total energy burned’ estimate.",False,False
