I also spent the car ride in silence. Trying not to cry so I could see the road. My partner kept saying ""Well sure it was sad but it didn't make me root for him. Hes a psychopath.""  and i had all these thoughts racing in my head i couldn't articulate. so I only whispered.  ""I don't think you are supposed to root for him.""",False,True

It really hits home because of the way his mentality was affected by his mother's own fucked up perception of the world. Because of the way he couldn't relate to most people and had a secret inner life that would scare people if he told them. But honestly it really made me sad because it made me think of all the young people out there who live with mental illness and don't have the resources available to get treatment, and who get nothing but misunderstanding when they try to open up to friends and family. How angry they must be sometimes. It's literally no wonder we have a mass shooting every other day in America. :(",False,False

Its the kind of film where you can see it happening in real life and that was scary. Especially with all the protests and political state of lots of countries at the moment.   In my own country we're ruled by rich idiots who have been telling us for years that the working class are the problem and need to scrimp and save and cut back. After over a decade of it people are dying because their public funding is being slashed, they can't afford food or heating while some of our richest politicians are tax dodgers. Joker isn't even farfetched. It's too real, all it takes is one damaged individual pushed to the edge.",False,False
