The doctor can’t force you to recover or tell your mom about what goes on in the appointment. The doctor might be helpful in other ways, like recommending you to a therapist (hey we all have issues, might help) or a nutritionist (might help you get all the nutrients in on your low budget).    But no, she can’t force you.  ",False,False

Could you go to the appointment &amp; let the specialist know you are simply not ready for recovery? Maybe you could get some harm reduction information out of it? ,False,False

You can also ask, ""hey my mom won't stop making me appointments that I don't plan on attending, what can I do?""",False,False

Make it difficult at summer break if you go home, at the holidays, not paying your cell bill or insurance bill.  It's up to you. I think it doesn't hurt to go to one appointment to appease her. It's more trouble than it's worth to try to challenge her when you are still a bit reliant on your family (as you are in college). ",False,False
