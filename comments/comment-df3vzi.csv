I'm not sure your weight/bmi/whatever, but you probably don't look as bad as you think. I think you should wear the high-waisted/one-piece suit if it makes you feel better. Plenty of thin women wear them as well : ) so I wouldn't worry about people automatically assuming you are fat just because you're in a one-piece.  I'm also going to the beach, but I'm trying to stay out of the water. Well I don't want to get tan and get wet and I want to wear makeup (bc I hate bare face), but I'm also not in any shape to show off my body lol. So I've come to the conclusion that I'm going to wear my swim coverup or a dress over my bikini while I relax by the beach/pool. It's unavoidable that I have to be in a swimsuit, but I think I will feel much better if I can cover up with a coverup/dress.  So maybe you can wear a coverup, maybe some shorts and your bikini top? That'll cover your problem areas.",False,False
