He absolutely should notttttt have behaved like this. OP, I am so so so sorry this happened to you. :(    I know like the whole “can I speak to the manager” thing is bs at times, however, I think these are circumstances that it’s meant for, so I think that you should call Starbucks corp rather than call the store/manager and make a complaint. — I say this bc in my experience from when I worked at Starbucks, customers would complain left and right to the several managers my store went through - and nothing would be resolved. Bc the managers would just kinda overlook it since it was never formally documented yaknow?  but if you call corp, then at the very least you’ll get your money back or something, plus I’m 100% certain they’ll definitely address it with him  &amp; coach him to improve his (lack of) people skills....not only this, but honestly (and this part is just imo), if he had the balls to behave this way over something so minor, odds are he does it frequently to other people. That’ll be up to Starbucks corp (and then the manager) to decide how to coach him / or what to do with him moving forward.   Again OP, I am so sorry this happened to you. I hope you feel better. Sending you internet hugs!!!",False,False

I’m a barista and if we did that, my manager would be furious with us. I usually just let the customers use whatever lingo they want as long as we’re on the same page.

I had something similar happen to me when I was around 15/16. I was ordering a cola zero at a football game. They usually get pretty busy during half time so they prepare the drinks during the game to save time getting orders out. Zero usually has this little plastic thingy in the lid pressed down + a Z written on the lid. And the one I was given didn't.  I HATE complaining and for some reason I really struggle in any type of situation where I'm the customer, so having to go back and say I got the wrong thing was really hard for me.  And the guy is basically just like ""I poured it myself earlier I know it's a diet I just didn't label it"".  I have diabetes. His laziness could have made me sick.",False,False

My family always gets so frustrated with me for being so sensitive or same that I'm acting like I'm the center of the universe. I looked it up a few days ago and apparently it's really common (like 15-20% of the population feels like this).
