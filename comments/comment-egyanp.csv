My mom does this to me all the time, ESPECIALLY when im upset about something. She tells me that ""that's not your feelings"" or ""you only feel that way because you're brain isn't still a 14 year old"" (the Ed shit happened around 14/15 im 19 now so I guess that means any experiences or things I've learned since then are invalid?)  Even when I talk about not liking something that I used to like as a kid she gets all huffy about it and says ""no that's your Ed talking"" or ""yes you do like [insert activity or food here] you always have that's just anorexia"" like ok thanks bitch guess I don't have real feelings or the ability to make choices cool cool cool",False,False

My ex-therapist and my parents talk about my ED like it's a separate thing from me. But it's not. It is me. It is how I navigate the world. There isnt a little devil on my shoulder telling me I should restrict food, or something outside of myself telling me to do so. I am not a victim to an eating disorder. I am simply me.",False,False

Fat isn't an emotion, so if you say you feel fat, it sounds disordered.   Describe how you feel using emotions instead.  Tell them how you'd rather have them respond ( just like you did in the post above).  Maybe saying it's not you invalidates the feeling behind the eating disorder. For example:  If depression makes you feel fat and you say, ""I feel fat"" What you're really saying is ""I'm depressed"". And if they say ""it's not you, it's your eating disorder"",  then they just dismissed/invalidated your depression.  I don't know. Just rambling here.",False,False

Among all the bad things, it’s made me more compassionate. It’s made me more aware of others struggling with body image. It’s not that I want to identify with the eating disorder. I hate it. I wish I could pull it out of my brain and burn it. I despise it. But it’s there. It’s real. And saying it’s not me feels like saying they aren’t actually my thoughts. I didn’t choose these thoughts and I hate them but they are my thoughts. Just like I’ll always have my genetic disorder, I’ll always have my ed. It’s not that it’s not me.

They are a coping mechanism. Not a personality trait. They help us deal with past issues that cause unmanageable feelings. EDs don't make you, you. They stop you from being you.

Even though I *know* this bullshit goal I created will not leave me feeling satisfied. I’m glad that separating yourself from the eating disorder is helpful for you. For me, it feels like saying it’s something external when it’s not. It’s a toxic part of my brain that makes me treat my body terrible. It feels more accurate to treat it like a toxic part of my brain. Like if it was external like say, an abusive partner, I could just get rid of it.

I do this shit because I have thoughts constantly running through my head about how stupid, disgusting, and fat I am. It doesn’t feel like it’s actually helping. I don’t think it’s actually possible to separate myself from the disorder. I am my thoughts, feelings, and behaviors and a lot of those come from my eating disorder. My eating disorder has changed me in many ways and we can’t just ignore that. I don’t really think full recovery is possible as in never have thoughts at all. Most people I’ve talked to that consider themselves recovered still have ed thoughts. Even if I come to a place of recovery, I’ll still be a person with an eating disorder. I’ll feel certain ways because I have an eating disorder. I’ll have certain thoughts because I have an eating disorder. Saying that it’s not me makes it feel like my experience is not real and is just some external force. My eating disorder isn’t a sentient being that lives in my head. I compare it to a demon because that’s what it feels like. It feels like a demon when it’s telling me to starve myself and that I’m weak and stupid because I can’t get through hunger pains and making me exercise to the point where my body is shaking from exhaustion. But it’s not some separate being that took refuge in my mind. It’s a real and toxic part of my mind. I feel it’s more helpful to say “you feel this way, think this way, do this, etc because of your eating disorder.” Instead of saying “it’s not you.”",False,True

I hate when people say this. It makes me feel so frustrated and invalidated  (How?)  And a well meaning person says “it’s not you, it’s your eating disorder.”  (They are offering a healthy perspective)  They tell me there’s a separation between the real me and the eating disorder.  (There is)  But I don’t like that narrative. It doesn’t sit right with me. My eating disorder has made me who I am. (But is all that you are? Who are you because of it?)  It’s a part of me and always will be.  (Agree. So what can be done if you know it's always going to be with you?)  While it may have stolen my life and my true self, it will always be a part of me.  (Those are some major things to lose, my friend)  maybe it is the eating disorder (It is)  but it’s me too.  (Agreed. It's the ill part of you)  I like to talk about my eating disorder as a demon in my head but it’s not going away.  (Are you talking about the demon or talking to the demon?What do you say to the demon? How do you make the decision not to listen? What changes do you make in behavior after talking to it?)  when I don’t eat all day and then eat a small meal when I planned to fast for 48 hours so I purge and over exercise? That’s me. It’s my eating disorder but it’s me. (Yeah, engaging in those behaviors isn't challenging the demon)   I can’t snap my fingers and just stop listening to my eating disorder.  (Nope, that's why theres therapy)  Believe me, I’ve tried. It doesn’t work.  (What have you tried?)  I can fight this all I can. I can gain weight and get to a place where I’m eating normal.  (Yes you can! Have you done so before?)  But at the end of the day, I’ll still have an eating disorder. (Because it's not about the weight. If you don't address the issues behind the disorder, and gain weight, you'll be a person who has gained weight and still has an eating disorder) I’ll still have thoughts of purging and burning calories and eating nothing. (Yep. The deeper issues need to be worked on. Until then....Eating Disorder.)  I’ve been told when you’ve been at this recovery thing for long enough, the thoughts are quieter and less frequent.  (True! What's your longest record time of being recovered?)  But they are still there. You can’t separate me from the eating disorder. (But that's soooo clingy)  I once said to my dietitian “I don’t like that it’s hard to measure jelly and it has a lot of sugar so that’s why I don’t eat it.” And she said it’s my eating disorder that doesn’t like it. Ok fair but I’m the one that acts on that. (Until you learn how to make healthier choices)  I am the one with the feeling, not my eating disorder. My eating disorder is not a person.  (No. It's not a person. It's your illness. You're the one with what feeling?)  It’s not a demon even if it can be compared to one. It’s a mental illness. It’s a part of me. It can’t have feelings because it’s not a person or an animal. It causes my feelings.  (Nope, your feelings cause IT and it helps you to not experience whatever emotional pain you're in)  I can understand how seeing the eating disorder as your whole personality is bad (It its)   and allows it to be stronger. (Good awareness! So, why continue allowing it to grow stronger now that you understand that this happens?)  But can I just acknowledge how terrible this makes me feel and how stupid my behaviors can be without someone saying it’s my eating disorder? (Do you really wanna take the fall for your eating disorder like that?)  Sure if I didn’t have an eating disorder I would do these things or feel these things but I do have one so I do. (What things?)   It’s a part of me and I hate the narrative that I should separate the eating disorder from me. (I bet it's scary to think of a life without it)  I can’t. It’s a mental illness and I’ll live with it for the rest of my life. (Sure, but why not live with a ""better"" version of it and be your own person again?)",False,False

And equally - this is the voice of self-compassion. Of recovery. Of playfulness.   But they all emanate from me. From my experiences and core beliefs about myself and about the world.
