It's good for about 2 pounds in my experience.

Sometimes I forget that I really am doing a lot. I just have this timeline of loss in my mind (thanks losertown) and I freak out when that gets disrupted or threatened by the numbers not going down as expected. Losing 3lbs a week until I’m within a healthy weight range is what I had planned on, I wanted to lose faster but I settled for 3 so that I could ensure I was eating a lot of protein and getting good nutrition.  But seeing it only go down 1.2 just scares the shit out of me because I’m not ok with losing that slow. I’m still so big (I’m very overweight!) and I should still be losing quicker than that according to all my calculations.  I’m just not going to be able to accept losing that slowly at this point in my weight loss, it’s not acceptable to me, especially given how hard I work, how careful I am with my diet/calories/macros, and how much thought I put into this.   I usually don’t woosh as much as I’m going to have to woosh to make up next week, for this lack of loss this week. I’m just praying that this will be the first time. ",False,True
