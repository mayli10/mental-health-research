Also I can never make myself eat throughout my first shift and I always get to have my break last at the second place so I survive on coffee and maybe a protein bar/shake the until it's time for dinner. It doesn't suppress appetite for me, kinda numbs it a bit. But it does wake you up even when you are running on crazy low sleep and have a horrible schedule so I'm thankful. I'm not dependant because I stop using it when I'm off work so I guess it depends how you start and why?   If you can I would advise to take it easy for a while, get more sleep, allow yourself enough nutrition if not more and see how you feel. I think it should help with lowering the dosage and quitting. If you are using it to replace the natural recovery process that helps with energy it makes sense that the ECA won't be as needed when you are actually physically rested.",False,False

I used to try to use the ECA stack and felt so awful, jittery and anxious and my heart would go wonky, but Ephedrine alone was alright. Maybe the combo makes it worse.   Good luck and be safe. It'll get better.",False,False

Was absolutely exhausted without it, even though I didn‚Äôt get any kind of buzz anymore.  After a while it even stopped making me feel less hungry üòë tapering off sucked too.

My team is really understanding if I fuck up.. and that‚Äôs an important aspect of working through a reliance, and also something you should consider with choosing an accountability buddy. You don‚Äôt want to feel guilty if you mess up, but you do want someone to be able to be like, it‚Äôs okay.. just try again. I started taking it again after my first streak because I just hit a wall. I literally got sent home from work because my coworkers were like ...dude.. you look like shit.. go home and sleep. And then I called out the next day because getting out of bed was just awful. I hate that when I first take a dose I‚Äôm like.. on top of everything... but by the end of the day I‚Äôm sweating, and jittery.. and just feel terrible. It doesn‚Äôt even make sense to do it from a weight loss perspective, because it really doesn‚Äôt aid me in that anymore. I‚Äôve hit a pretty low weight and I just don‚Äôt lose as fast regardless of popping pills, etc. As for appetite suppression, it works, but sometimes I‚Äôll eat anyway just to try and ease my shakiness. And it doesn‚Äôt matter how much water I drink.. the dehydration from those stupid pills gives me the worst Charlie horses. I‚Äôm doing a lot better this week, if that gives you any hope. I still get tired sometimes, but I just try and remind myself that the alternative is a quick boost and then I‚Äôm going to feel just as awful. I try and just drink a green tea or a coffee and power through it.",False,False
