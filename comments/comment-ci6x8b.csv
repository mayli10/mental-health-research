Let her bring up any actual weight talk. I would keep it centered around health and good choices.,False,False

EDs can sometimes be a method of coping with difficult emotions. It’s possible she is bingeing to cope with the negative emotions caused by her mother so having someone to talk to who she trusts will hopefully make a big difference. Only thing I’d add is maybe some reassurance that as long as she’s healthy, there is nothing wrong with her weight and she has so much more to offer the world than just her body (maybe remind her of some of nice qualities she has that aren’t image related, such as kindness or intelligence)",False,False

I ran away from my narcissistic bulimic mom at 12, so I really feel for baby girl.   As a woman, take her out and just ***talk*** to her. Lady to lady. She's gonna be going through a lot of body changes soon. Let her know it's normal and healthy but sometimes uncomfortable and that's okay too!   The main thing I would've liked from my aunt/granny/stepmom is the ability to just talk it out. Not have it turned into a religious lesson or ""Your mom was a crazy person"" or have a book shoved under my nose.   My stepmom literally ordered 2 sex/puberty books from Amazon and put my name on the label. And that was all the body talk I got. Not even a warning that they were on their way or even a note with the gift receipt.   If she has someone, especially a woman, to talk to openly about her feelings and her body then she'll start to grow beyond what her controlling mother taught her.   Offer to take her out to do something she likes: shopping, movie, festival, whatever and plan to go to lunch during/after. Ask her what *she* wants. No one has probably ever asked her that before. Let her choose. If she says nothing, try to guide her to a healthy choice and tell her it's okay to like the things she likes.",False,False

I developed a serious problem with bingeing, then purging, then restricting.  I don't really know how to prevent it, what with me still being a hot mess myself, but you're right to be worried.",False,False
