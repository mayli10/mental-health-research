Good luck ❤️",False,False

But yes extreme hunger after restriction is normal. It’s called hyperphagia and it’s your body’s natural response to famine. Your body doesn’t know that this “famine” was self induced, it only knows it’s starving and it needs to consume as many calories as possible to hold you over for when the next time a food shortage occurs. You should listen to your hunger and cravings. It’s hard because you probably feel out of control, like you’ll never stop eating until you’re enormous, but I promise that won’t happen. When your body heals, your hunger will level out. The important thing is letting go of controlling your body. It is not some wild beast that you have to bring to heel; it’s the only thing keeping you alive.",False,False
