I’m dealing with a friend group that is very much focused on drinking and meeting up to drink as a social experience so that’s going to be hard. But I’ve put the plan in writing (here on reddit) and I’ve asked my SO to support me, so I’m cautiously optimistic.   Have a great Sunday yourself!",False,True

I was actually hospitalized on Christmas night 2017 and the August before.   The hardest part was dealing with the shame from people looking at me like I was weak for not accepting a drink, but they didn’t know.  I wish the best for you buddy, the shty problem was that my Ed got out of hand thereafter to cope, calories from alcohol and binging were probably the only thing keeping me alive   but if you can quit drinking and out Your Ed, you are a STRONG person!   I was able to quit because of the availability of alcohol, so I might not be much help.   It means a lot to hear that you plan on setting a rational goal such as quoting for a certain period of time.  Well, bravo! And have a good Sunday friend:)",False,False
