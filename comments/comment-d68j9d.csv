I hit my goal weight and kinda losing and gaining 1.5 lbs around that for like a month and I just don’t know what I look like. At first when I hit my gw I would get freaked out at how I looked and scared at how mich weight I lost but now it’s just meh. I feel like it’s not enough and I need to lose another 5 to see some changes again.,False,False
