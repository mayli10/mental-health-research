Weirdly, recognising the whole “if you start you won’t stop” pattern has been really helpful in cutting the whole process off before it starts, but if I’m already on my way to get the thing, then it’s too late. Putting it up high or burying it under a mountain of other things or whatever wouldn’t work, because I already know I shouldn’t be doing it, I’m already thinking “what are you doing, this is a bad idea, you know you shouldn’t do this” so making it harder to get wouldn’t really help. For me, self control starts at the grocery store with just not buying the damn thing 😂",False,False

I literally have to put things out of reach (I hide trigger foods in the top of closets) so that I will have to physically strain myself to get it. That way I have time to reconsider while I’m trying to get it down. If I don’t bring trigger foods home I don’t have the desire to run out and buy them but if I bring it home or someone gives it to me I’m like an addict that won’t stop til I’m gotten my whole fix.,False,True

It’s called a subjective binge. You feel like you binged because of the kind of food or you feel physically full.   It’s not always an “objective binge” meaning you consumed an abnormally large volume or high calorie count of food,False,False

So it can be anywhere from a single strawberry to 3000 kcal of protein bars.   Something I find about myself though, is that my binges tend to drag on... like if I let that impulse get the best of me once, it’s gonna keep on going basically until I go to sleep and “reset” the following day. Like usually if I start to binge it’s because I can’t stop thinking about this one single thing I want to eat, so I tell myself “just eat it, get it over with, then it will be done and you can move on”. Except it never stops, because as soon as I’ve eaten that thing, my brain starts obsessing about something else and the cycle starts again. “Just eat the second thing, when it’s gone you’ll stop thinking about it and this torturous obsessive thought process with stop”. Nope, there’s always a third thing and a fourth thing until the day is over and I’ve managed to think of dozens of things that I just *have* to eat or I won’t be able to stop obsessing over them.   This is relatively new to me, I never had a binging problem until about a month ago, so I’m still navigating the ins and outs of it, but that’s a definite pattern I’ve noticed so far.",False,False

I usually feel like I’ve “binged” after eating something like 2 low-fat Greek yogurts or 7 strawberries lol. Also chips and salsa, I’ll eat a really normal amount (like 9 tortilla chips) and then feel like I went crazy and need to restrict for the rest of the day",False,False
