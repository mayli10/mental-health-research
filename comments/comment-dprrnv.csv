I'm used to seeing UW or OW. Sometimes people put BMI# with a number instead of a #. I guess that last bit matters the least actually because we're all here for support for ED's and not BMI.  Thank you.,False,False

Firstly congrats on feeling positive and going out to eat and having a good time! :)  It's super unlikely you'll have weighed less though, and this isn't me picking because I want to help you feel even better.  Sometimes when you eat a load of food your body shifts about a bit, gets rid of stored water weight because it now has enough calories and nutritional stuff and just does something different for a while. So don't be hard on yourself. The time with your GF is deserved and you deserve to enjoy the story of the fun, not the story the scale tells you.",False,False
