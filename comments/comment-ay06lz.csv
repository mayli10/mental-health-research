My body still wanted to vomit, I was still sick, but there was nothing left.  The point is, what I found interesting was, purging for an hour after dinner just isn’t the same, it takes a loooong time to get to nothing.  ",False,False

How do you know how much you are purging up calorie wise? I saw one study that said they had 17 participants binge and purge and it was approx 50%. I don’t binge but I do purge a lot of my meals that I can and I just count the full calorie amount eaten because there’s so much wiggle room in how many calories staying in my damn belly. Anyways. I’m right there with you. I wish purging worked better and more precisely lol. Like if our stomachs had a gauge like a fuel tank ,False,False
