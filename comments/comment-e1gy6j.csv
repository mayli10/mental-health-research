Long term it‚Äôs definitely going to take addressing why you do it and discipline to recognize what‚Äôs going on with you when you feel a binge coming on. For me any type of little stress just sends me to the kitchen even if I‚Äôve just eaten so I try and tell myself ‚Äúyou‚Äôre not actually hungry you just need to relax and focus on what‚Äôs bothering you not food‚Äù   Sometimes dealing with my emotions just doesn‚Äôt seem possible when I‚Äôm in a cycle though so I try and literally just remove myself from food and any safe eating place. Also eating with people forces me to eat normal amounts.   It‚Äôs not easy to stop so don‚Äôt give up!,False,False

It is not in english, so I hope my translation makes sense. Summary of the book:  Step 1: Keep an honest food diary starting today, and for two more days. Everything that has gone into you mouth goes into the diary under headings: Breakfast, Lunch, Dinner, Other. Or under the headings ""attempt at [insert meal] if it turned into a binge.  Step 2: Evaluste the food diaries. Have you  binged etc. Is there a pattern?  Step 3: Eat breakfast every day. No excuses. Focus only on breakfast for at least three weeks (continue w/ food diary) - Decide the night before exactly what to eat for BF. - Buy exactly that, no more no less. - if you can't shop the day before buy it in the morning.  - If it feels scary to eat alone, go to a cafe, but decide beforehand what to order. - start small - Eat something you think you would enjoy instead of the ~healthiest~ option. - only veggies is not a real breakfast. It could be a sandwich, some yoghurt and granola, or porridge etc.  Step 4: Write three coping mechanisms that will help you manage emotional distress (that you know or think will work).  Step 5: Every time you binge eat, try to write down exactly what you ate the emotion you had before you binged. One word is enough, but do it the same day you binged.   Step 6: Time for lunch.  Don't diet at lunch. Eat something filling with complex carbs, protein, and healthy fats that wont trigger a need for sugar in the afternoon. Lunch should be eaten ~11:00-13:00.  - Lunch should be a real sit down meal (plate, knife and fork, or spoon).  - It should not only consist of raw veggies. - Eat until you are not hungry anymore, not until you are full.  - Focus on eating lunch for three weeks, while also eating breakfast. - Keep upp the food diary.  Step 7: Dinner When you feel like you have breakfast and lunch down, it's time to work on dinner. - Eat between 16 and 17. - A proper meal (sit down, plate, fork and knife, or spoon) - If you had a cold dish for lunch, have a warm dinner. At least one warm meal per day. - Eat something you enjoy! - Eat until you are  ot hu gry anymore, not until you are full. - Finish the meal when you've eaten what you planned. If you are really want more, have a fruit. - Sit down and drink some coffee or tea after dinner, it takes 20 minutes for the stomach to sig al to the brain that it is full.  - Set the table and have a clear start and finish to the meal. - Eat without distractions, or at most have som calm music playing. _____________________ Even if you binged at breakfast, have lunch. Even if you binged at lunch, have dinner. Even if you binged at dinner, start the next day with breakfast.  This will (hopefully) break the binge restrict cycle. _________________________ Other tips: - Deal with your emotional problems that cause you to  binge. Identify feelings and triggers in the food diary. If possible seek professional help.  - If certain foods trigger your bingeing, keep them out of the house, or buy in pre-portioned packages.  - Some studies show that regular exercise helps with binge eating.  - Accept that recovery is not a straight road, and that it will take time to heal. __________ I hope this will help you or someone else reading this. I wish you all the bestüíï",False,False
