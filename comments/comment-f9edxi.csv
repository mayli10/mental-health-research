People fail to express how they really feel, so they try and put others down to make themselves feel better. Otherwise they bring the attention back to them like they deserve some kind of hoorah for being on a fucking diet. Could also be guilt that she cheated on her diet and is trying to overrly make a point of it",False,False

Everything she says regarding food is so disordered and incorrect. I moved out a few years ago so I’m no longer as immersed in her BS as I used to be, but she’s always talking about how all carbs are always evil and all fats are always evil and all of that will be horrible for my sister’s health. That’s cool Diane but science says no. You can eat as many dry salads as you want but keep that rhetoric away from my teenage sister (who needs both medicine AND food to survive! Wow imagine)",False,False

I don't find it triggering, I just don't want them to involve me in the conversation in any way. Other than that, it's just an annoying topic. People are always saying things that aren't true (starvation mode, don't eat at night, etc.) and it's just so cringey.",False,False

She said dieters need the diet to tell them the rules, they don't trust themselves so they need the diet to tell them what to do. People with EDs ONLY trust themselves. We might take a little bit here and there from various diets but we pile them all together and create our own rules.   I just thought this was a really interesting distinction between someone that bounces between diets and someone that has an ED. Don't get me wrong, I know that people with EDs can and do still follow diets from time to time and that people who diet might have an ED.",False,False
