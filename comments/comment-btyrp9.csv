I went to korea for 6 months and it fucked me so bad. I would compete with my cousin on who ate less even tho she had literally no idea it was a competition lol I would just be secretly proud she ate so much more than me and was heavier even though I felt like such a massive bitch. I was also always considered the ""tall american cousin"" (even tho im only 5'6""/168cm) so my family commenting on my diet also hella triggered me. Feel free to dm me if u ever want to rant on korean diet culture lol",False,False
