I felt happy with my body and made good choices with food without depriving myself of things I enjoyed. I guess knowing my weight now, there’s no reason to stop IF as long as I can force myself to continue doing it healthily and cutting back on simple carbs and concentrated sweets. Thanks for your response by the way. It really helps to know I’m not alone.",False,True

My dad has type 1 but only diagnosed in his late 50s, so I'm now terrified I'll get it too.   It's wonderful you didn't weigh yourself for so long though! Would you be able to continue not weighing yourself, but change your diet to gentle low-carb? That's really all it should reasonably take, and who knows - you may get comfortable with your body again! Plus, 26 is still young! (This is very do as I say, not as I do by the by) you got this.",False,False
