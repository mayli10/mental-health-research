The thing about mental illness is that your pain is so sharp in and in the forefront of your mind, it‚Äôs hard to focus on the pain of other people and even harder to consider how the things we hurt ourselves with could hurt other people. It‚Äôs important to get these thoughts out though, that‚Äôs why a therapist is very useful. You can say every fucked up thing that comes to your head without worry because the person hearing it is 1) not personally involved with you, thus objective and dispassionate 2) trained in it so your cognitive distortions won‚Äôt affect them",False,False
