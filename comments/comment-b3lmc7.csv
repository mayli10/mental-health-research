It has to be a balance of fat, protein, ECT ECT for the baby. I would look up what's good for the baby and you. Inspire yourself to eat for your child. Give it all the love and support it deserves even if you haven't had it yet. The first weeks of pregnancy is always important because the baby is growing all of it's most important parts of the body. Food is definitely important to that development.   Also don't over eat as well. If you do it won't be healthy for the baby and also there will be left over fat already because the body stores it in. If you over eat it stores in even more fat.   Vitamins and minerals are important as well. Calcium is important. The baby takes everything it can get from your body. The baby will quite literally eat you alive üòÇ. You will be tired if you're not eating enough. Water is important as well as you are hydrating for 2.   I hope this helps. I would talk to your doctor about food options. They will also tell you what you need more of. Whatever you eat or drink the baby is eating and drinking as well.   I know it's tough but you can do it. I believe that you can push through. ",False,False
