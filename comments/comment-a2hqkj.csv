I do a lot of speed painting videos and never post them bc when I rewatch my fingers look so chubby and unshapely. Too bad fingers aren't the easiest place to lose mass lol,False,False

I must look at noses, but it doesn't really register, but when I see someone with a really what I think is pretty nose I'll stare (stealthily).  I find myself doing this on buses because peoples profiles are more noticeable.    Saying that, I like ""strong"" profiles too.  I think Erin O' Connor is really beautiful and she has this really strong profile.  Everything seems in proportion with her though.  I watch youtubes how to contour noses to look make it look finer, but when I try it I can't get it to work unless I don't blend the dark contour on the sides and I think if I left it like that it'd draw more attention than a blobby nose!    How bad is it that practically everyone has an insecurity about a body part?  It's not like our hands and noses are of world-shattering importance to anyone else, but yeah, grr. x  ",False,False

I watch a lot of ASMR and hands are there in all shapes and sizes.  The only thing that gets me (and this isn't to do with the size) is when people wear rings that're either too tight or too loose.  Weird, I know.  The body part I hate most is my nose.  I think it looks blobby and (apparently) larger than it is.  Nobody's ever passed comment on my nose, but idk, it looks blobby to me with a weird bone that sticks out at the top because I broke it when I was a kid.  Kinda insecurity because my mum's side of the family all have this delicate bone structure and I take after my dad's side who all have this East European solid facial structure.  Oddly enough, the thinner my face the more pronounced the broadness and harshness (to me).  You should celebrate your hands really.  Lol, sounds stupid, but life would suck without them!  If you find a ring you find really pretty, it might make you feel less self conscious because people will be looking at that and not what you think are ugly fingers?  (Make sure it's not too loose or tight though, or I'll get triggered)!  &amp;#x200B;",False,False

And even then, I'm only noticing, not judging.   I hate my fat af ugly face but I'm having a BDD day today. ",False,False
