It sucks because it's like I'm aware of what I'm doing but I have way less self control. It's like an automatic robotic response for me when I do it, I don't even think about it. My body just does it and I'm unable to feel bad about it until I can think about it clearly the next morning/day, if any of that makes any sense. It's awful.",False,False

I didnt have a spoon but I _needed_ that sweet creamy goodness _rightnowrightnow_  so I just stuck my stupid face into the container, dripping that shit all over the place and practically making out with the pint tub. To anybody who may have drove by me and witnessed me suckling melted icecream from the cardboard, I apologize.  I wish I could say it was a low moment but I've done worse.     Im right there with you, bud.",False,False
