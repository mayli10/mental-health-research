I'd call myself relatively recovered at the moment, and although when I was in the depths of my ED, I'd probably call myself now fat, I'm actually at a healthy BMI, and am much healthier, and relatively happier. I gained about 15-20kg from my low weight, in about a year, putting me now towards the top of the healthy BMI range (it started *very* low). But also I've hovered within the same 3ish kg range for the past year, never quite creeping into the overweight BMI territory. And that's not at all intentional, I rarely weigh myself, and don't restrict my eating at all. It just seems to be where my body wants to sit, which has actually been quite reassuring after the very rapid weight gain.   That's not to mean, I LOVE my body now, and I wouldn't be against losing some weight. However I am okay with it, and quite accepting that this is where my body wants be, without trying to fight it which ultimately makes for a much less stressful, and generally happier life.",False,False
