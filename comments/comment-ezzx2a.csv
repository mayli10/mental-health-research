I’m not a doctor so I can’t say if it’s because of the ED, but just based on my experience, it might not have anything to do with the ED at all.  For me, I had to go to my gyno A LOT and get a lot of oral meds (that seem to work for everyone else but didn’t ever work for me) until they tried something else and gave me something that was basically a prescription strength monistat.   The healthyhooha sub has lots of info that have helped lots of people through their recurring infections if you wanted to give it a look but honestly, best advice I can give you is “go to a gyno.” They can help you figure out what’s going on and how to fix it better than any of us here can even speculate.",False,False
