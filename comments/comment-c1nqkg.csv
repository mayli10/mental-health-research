I can‚Äôt remember a few years of middle or high school when I was at my worst. I don‚Äôt know if that was because of restricting or if I just managed to block it all out.   I am derpy now but functional - if you address whatever it is causing it now I‚Äôm sure you will end up okay! I‚Äôm more EDNOS now so idk I just go through short more ‚Äúreasonable‚Äù relapses so I can‚Äôt speak for super long term active illness, I‚Äôm sure ceaseless restriction can cause intellectual issues down the road after a while but no real idea how long/severe that would have to be.   Also! Other people in my family have the same issue with not being able to remember when things happened (what year, was it a year ago or five?) and have lost periods of time so it can def be something like dissociation from stress as well! If you have a good psychiatrist ask them, or a GP. üíï",False,False

I have it because of ptsd, but i've found that restricting food makes it a lot worse - makes me more numb, spaced out, forgetful and generally kind of zonked. totally relate. it's a coping mechanism, certainly. being disconnected from yourself and reality, just sort of floating in a haze. it's so hard to break out of, and it's actually really exhausting and upsetting. I'm sorry you're dealing with this, I wish I knew of a way that could help, but I can't really find a way out of it myself.",False,False
