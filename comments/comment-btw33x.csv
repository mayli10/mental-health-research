Unfortunately, that’s how EDs work. There’s always something to nitpick about and losing weight always feels like the solution. Even when that last rational brain cell knows it won’t solve anything.  Bad brain is my life summed in two words lol",False,False

I haven’t dropped to being UW, and for the moment I’m still at a “normal” weight for my height/age. There’s still that nagging to get lower though, even when I know there’s no new “low” that’ll make me any happier than before because it’ll always feel like there’s something to nitpick about my body (if that’s not what you meant or I’m misinterpreting that, let me know!)  I really do want to thank you for your comment. Seriously. In some part of my mind I know that thinking like I’m the Bad Guy isn’t right, but it’s really easy to forget that in the moment and especially just over analyzing it after. I’ll probably still continue to overanalyze because. yknow. Bad brain. But having a slight reassurance, even from a stranger, of what I know but my ED just basically keeps blocking is nice to have  I’m wishing the best for you 💛 thank you",False,True

I don’t know what I was expecting based on the title, but it wasn’t this.   I also feel fat and see fat on myself, even though I know I’m considered thin by measurements. I’ve been teetering on the border between UW/N, unhappy with fat that I still feel but knowing that going further will make me completely spiral out of control, because there’s no lower limit I’ll be happy with beyond this medically defined limit.  This might be the push I needed to maintain normal weight. Because it’s hard to justify for the sake of my own health, but I could maybe do it to prevent my body size/unhealthy habits from triggering others into potentially hurting themselves to achieve the same.  FWIW just the fact that you’re thinking about this shows that you aren’t the villain. You obviously wouldn’t wish an ED on anyone. It is a mental illness. Wishing you the best and thank you for sharing!",False,False
