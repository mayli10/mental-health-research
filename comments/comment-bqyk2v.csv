It's probably a difference in the amount of cake it actually makes that changes by country. Where I live, the Dr. Oetker chocolate chip muffin mix has a total of 706,5 calories for the whole box.  &amp;#x200B;  Ok, so I got curious while writing this message and actually did a little research on cake mixes and yeah, I guess you guys get way more ""mix""? So it makes total sense your cake mix having that amount of calories. I was just shocked cause I've literally never seen it hahahaha Sorry if I freaked you out with my reply!",False,False
