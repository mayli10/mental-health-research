But she would outright encourage me to not eat along with her. She was thinner than me but not by much and would always brag about her weight loss. She'd yell at me for eating by saying stuff like ""oh god that's so many calories how could you even think about eating that?!"" Years later looking back on that time I was borderline underweight and my mental health was in a gutter, I'm surprised I got to this point in life. Honestly moving countries was probably the best thing to happen to me cause I was able to cut contact with her completely and eventually got better for a time.",False,False
