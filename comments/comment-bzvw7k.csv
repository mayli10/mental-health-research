Last summer's heatwave was a killer.  I carried heavy bags around with me to burn even more.  I honestly wanted to cry.  I walk everywhere and disguise this calorie burning exercise as exercise that's good for me to keep what's left of my muscle.  I've been trying to gain the past few months, so if it's shitty weather - too hot, too wet - I'll stay indoors.  I feel guilty, but it's something I have to deal with.  If i do go on a megawalk, I think of it as a good reason to eat something extra seeing how I've walked off the equivalent of whatever snack I fancy.  &amp;#x200B;  One thing I can't shake off is keeping my legs permanently in motion and at bus stops I pace up and down so I'm not standing still.  &amp;#x200B;  This illness is a tyrant.  &amp;#x200B;  Make sure you stay hydrated though.  It's saved me from passing out.",False,False
