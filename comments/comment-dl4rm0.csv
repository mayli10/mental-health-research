I always feel like I MUST look so stiff and awkward when I sit up straight. I think it's because I'm tall. And I suddenly become very aware that I'm tall when I'm no longer slouching down,False,False

I really hate how I look all slouched over, and I worry about being a hunchback when I'm old.   I've been working on it, but a lifetime of slouching is a tough one to break. It feels really unnatural to hold myself upright, and I'm constantly wondering if I look as stiff/weird as I feel.",False,False

I wish I could fix it. I was a ballerina and that probably why I’ve shrunk into such terrible posture now. I was too tall and big to be one. And I’m so with you in the alignment thing.,False,True

I've started like slouching and letting my stomach stick out when I get dressed just so I can be realistic about how I'm going to look haha,False,False

I've mostly fixed that ""ribs flaring out"" problem, but I still cannot for the life of me get my upper back/neck to be straight.  I want the posture of a ballerina.  I feel like I look about double my size from my arms-shoulders-neck not being in delicate alignment.",False,False
