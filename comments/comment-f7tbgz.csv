You *need* some fats and protein. Restricting your calories is hard enough as it is, so torturing yourself with *what type* of small amount of food you’re eating is setting yourself up for failure and discomfort.   When I was younger and first started restricting, I would eat a regular amount of carbs/fats/protein, but I was always starving, dizzy, irritable, foggy-minded, etc. It wasn’t until I tried getting into ketosis (eating fat and protein, but less than 20g or carbs a day) that I finally had energy, mental clarity, and reduced appetite. I was actually satiated.",False,False
