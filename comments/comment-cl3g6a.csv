The more support you have access to, the better.   It’s so hard when your brain is playing catch up with what your body wants and needs. The body is working instinctually whereas the brain has to logic through every detail to reach a conclusion. Of course, that’s going to take longer! So don’t worry, you’re definitely not the only one who struggles to “want” to get better.  Luckily, our bodies are very efficient and can put up with a lot of nonsense while our brains figure things out. You’ll get there. :)",False,False

I’m seeing my doctor in less than a week and am actively looking for a new therapist and nutritionist, going to talk about possible outpatient. I don’t want to get better but I know in my heart I do and it will be worth it.",False,True

It’s water weight. Give it a couple days, it’ll settle. Avoid the booze and it’ll settle faster. Alcohol dehydrates you so your body won’t be able to use the liquid to aid in digestion. You’ll just end up bloated, hungover, and extra miserable.  Please seek help if you aren’t already. You’re clearly dealing with anxiety and stress in an unsustainable way. You did the right thing and gave yourself nourishment when you needed it. Your body realized the food actually helped and demanded more, triggering a binge. The binge is THE sign that you did the right thing. Those blueberries were necessary. The binge was necessary. Your body wants to live... even if your brain doesn’t.   The feeling out being out of control will get quieter as you learn to cope with bad brain days in other ways. I know it’s hard, but hang in there. Recovery is worth it and so are you. :)",False,False

I just wanted to let you know I read it and was nearly in tears. I understand how you’re feeling. I recently have been sneaking alcohol into my workplace in the afternoons just to get by. I wish anxiety didn’t eat away at the rational parts of our brains so badly. This was just really powerful and you’re a beautiful writer and I’m sending you internet hugs!,False,False

My body goes into a complete shock mode when I eat a lot after dieting and my stomach cramps are hell but at least the fact my body isn't used to all the junk results in (very TMI Ik) pooping it out quite fast. In the end, after you've stuck to your normal habits for a couple of days you should be at least 4 pounds down again, I hope you're able to cheer up for a bit even tho it's hard... Binge guilt shouldn't control our lives as much as it does 😔",False,False
