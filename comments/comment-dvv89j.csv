My bf does the whole come home and brag that he ""hasn't eaten all day"" and it's ""really not that bad"". Of course not when his dinners are 5 course meals + dessert and I'm drinking a cup of broth + excersizing.   Sometimes feels like they trigger us on purpose lol.",False,False

We even argue about it because he’s triggering me, saying things like “I don’t find it difficult to fast” or “I force myself to eat way more food than I need” or “Or course I could eat more but I don’t want to” and keeps losing weight and I’m internally screaming",False,False
