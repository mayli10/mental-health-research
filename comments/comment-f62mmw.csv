You can mix it with water or milk, and measure out the amount of calories. It also is super nutrient dense, so it‚Äôs a good choice in my opinion. What I would stay away from is the slim fast shakes. They taste really really sweet and do not leave you feeling full, which might give you a bad reaction. Meal replacement shakes trick my brain somehow and help me eat ‚Äúmore normal‚Äù haha, so best of luck to you!! üíñ",False,False

I have anorexia b/p too and I'm not handling it all that well, but I have one safe meal which is 2 fillets of haddock or cod (200 calories) with 400g broccoli (or 200g broccoli, 100g onion and a handful of peas) and a low-fat chow mein sauce that adds up to less than 500 calories and is so big that it numbs the urge to binge afterwards. I can't eat it every day, but I have it maybe twice a week and see it as a positive each time. On days I don't eat, I find having half a mug of Horlicks Lite (58 calories) just before bed makes me feel full and sleepy.",False,False
