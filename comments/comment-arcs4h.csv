We do a little but I’ve never full blown admitted anything. Maybe one day! :) ,False,True

He loves tiny petite women and I'm 5'11. He actively tries to help but I can see the difference in his touching of my body and wanting sex when I'm 130(underweight) vs 140 and it's tough. We've talked and he feels like absolute shit because he knows and then I feel bad for upsetting him and it's a vicious cycle.   We do truly love each ther and I wouldnt give him up for the world. I avoid talking to him about my weight In specifics but we do talk when I'm feeling extra bad and we work through it together  ,False,False

He doesn’t mean anything by it, but I know it means I look noticeably better when I aggressively lose weight. ",False,False

My shit is together when I restrict too. I am more confident, cleaner, healthier etc! Had he not straight up admitted it then I would totally think this was the case as well. At this point I know it's going to happen. I'll be smaller. Just trying to not let it trigger me too much that I can at least lose the weight slow/healthily! ",False,True

I honestly don't really have any advice.   I think its as much that she likes how I look as she prefers how I act. When I'm restricting:   - I'm fitter and work out almost every day - I eat much ""healthier"" and cook meals for both of us so she doesn't have to bother - I'm a little manic? I am way more productive and do most of the chores/ projects around the house - I dress skimpier and put a lot more effort into my physical appearance  - I have a much higher sex drive  - usually I'm happier (though my lows are far lower)   So I can't really blame her.",False,False

My boyfriend loves slim thicc girls, and I’ve only been that once or twice in our 5 year relationship.  I can’t offer any advice, just solidarity in how much it sucks lol. ",False,False
