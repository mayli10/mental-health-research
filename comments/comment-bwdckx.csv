I didn't think I was gonna *have* to break 100, but now I know I do. I'm not happy with my weight at all at 105. I still feel incredibly overweight. And when I was 155+, 98-105, was my UGW. Now I *have* to get into the low 90's, at the very least, and in the back of my head, I think I will have a compulsion to hit the 80's. I think I'll be able to stop then though. Maybe 79, but anything less than that sounds scary skinny, at least for myself.",False,False
