I‚Äôve noticed that a few of your posts/comments have encouraged furthering ED‚Äôs or express contempt to recovery which is not what we condone here.  This raises red flags for the mod team, and if we see further behaviour of this, we may have to ban you from this sub as it violates our rules. It may help if you gain a deeper understanding of how ED‚Äôs are detrimental to your health physically and mentally.   This is a warning, please be careful.",False,False

I get wanting to vent, but this is a support sub, and what you said could be so harmful to people trying to recover.  And also, she had a BMI of 14.9, you don‚Äôt get there through being ‚Äúeffortlessly skinny‚Äù",False,False

I can't imagine anyone with an already perfect body striving to completely ruin it by gaining weight...... It legitly makes me upset that some people can be effortlessly skinny and perfect and want to throw it all away for no good reason ugh,False,False

I think the real takeaway is that not all weight gain is evil bc she looked so healthy and happy when I saw her in concert a couple weeks ago ü•∞ ,False,False
