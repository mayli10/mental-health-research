I use them In place of toast a lot of the time.   Sardines or smoked oysters and crackers   Cheese sliced with a veggie peeler (it'll change your life) and apple slices   Cucumbers and hummus or Greek yogurt+ garlic + salt and pepper for taziki? Kinda thing? Idk it's good   Iceberg dipped in horse radish (I live for this and I don't care how insane it is)   Watermelon sprinkled with feta cheese and wee bit of honey if you are feeling wild.   Just like 7 different kinds of pickles and some sweet sweet veggie peeler cheese   Sugar free jello with a spoon of marshmallow fluff on top. That's two food groups right? No no it's not but fucking fantastic and mostly air and gelation   Miso soup with rando veg mixed in and tofu cubes  Kimchi on rice bonus points if you heat it in a pan with some green onion   A raw egg plus two or three drips of soy on hot fresh rice (Fantastic breakfast)   Baby sweet peppers with the tops off and shove an olive in that bad boy.   Canned peaches (in water is what I go for) drained and mixed with Greek yogurt.   Literally take any frozen fruit- mircrowave it with a wee bit of water and some corn starch for just about as lon as it takes to defrost and thicken up. Or cook it on the stove like a real person. You know what you just made? Pretty much that glorious fruit goo found only in the greasiest of pastries. I love that stuff. It's super good on yogurt or rice cakes or ice cream.   Tiny quesadillas made with taco shells. Throw some cheese and whatever veg you have laying around in there. I love making mini ones because I can actually have them at like a level 5 cheese without it destroying me emotionally and physically.   Or take your tort and make a pizzadilla with some tomato sauce and cheese or open face it up for a sad but still tasty pizza   We haven't even talked about what you can put on rice cakes  Sundried tomato rice cakes with (you guessed it) veggie slice cheese.   Plain ones and great with tuna salad on them with a pickle cut into it. Daaaaaang do they make dill pickle flavoured ones?   On that note- can of tuna! With veg like sweet peppers, or cucumber or even grated carrot in there on some crisp bread or even on little slices of cucumber is baller.   Grab a tomato- make slices, salt and Pep. Add ya boy veggie peeler cheese (or like real people mozzarella which is fantastic and has great macros but snack sensei can't afford that shit) do you have basil or even herb mix around? Sprinkle. Got some balsamic vin or even red wine vin around drizzle. Five star snack right there.   Salted almonds and dried apricots   Oatmeal! Throw in some peanut butter and or frozen fruit and you've got yourself a party. I like to put some yogurt in mine and vanilla extract because I'm wild like that.        ",False,False

Be careful of that if feeling full doesn't sit well with you  Raw veggies are good as an on the go snack or with some kind of dip, like hummus for instance  Any and all fruits are good. Apples with nut butter or spreads are both nutritious and sweet, for instance. Kiwis are a great source of potassium if your electrolytes are low.  If you're not vegetarian/vegan, any kind of meat jerky is an acceptable snack. It's easy to take with you and provides a lot of protein to keep you going. A hard boiled egg could also be considered a snack.  Some cheeses come in small snack sizes, like the baybell cheeses and string cheese. You can also just buy cheese sticks and those make good snacks  Nuts would be an alternative to meat. They are pretty high in calories, so do watch the serving size so you don't freak out by eating an 800 calorie snack  Crackers are an easy snack. You have a lot to choose from and sometimes you can get certain brands in calorie conscious packs, which I like. Having the packs rather than just a box keeps me from binging.  Snack bars are good if you need something but you're in a hurry. I like larabars because I love dates, but you might find something else as a favorite.  A lot of what we think of as ""meals"" are technically snacks to other people. If it's under 500-300 calories, most people would automatically consider it a snack. If they were eating it as a meal, they'd probably have additional food in that meal as well. Hopefully this helped! I tried to include a range of food groups because that seemed to be what your nutritionist wanted",False,False
