I didn't know it was possible to truly dream about just food, but it happens to me regularly now.  Two nights ago I dreamed about binging on pizza. It went on and on. One of the longest dreams I've ever had.  When I finally wake up, I felt terrible for over eating and started building all this self hate. Then when I finally realized it was dream, I was so relieved.  Was not a fun emotional rollercoaster.",False,False

For me that happened while I was still normal weight. I was diagnosed at a normal weight in fact. Unusual, but possible. AN is about the mentality, not the weight itself. Now I'm recovered, I'm actually overweight. Still pretty lean though.",False,False

This will probably sound corny but you were so brave to keep listening to your body. It's such a struggle and you've got me inspired to actually eat dinner. I know I should cause I already worked out twice and it's not yet 5 pm and I'm hungry as hell but I was gonna skip dinner. Now I'm not. Thank you",False,False

This is just the ""extreme hunger"" part of recovery and it's absolutely horrible but I promise it does eventually get better and it does eventually go away.  &amp;#x200B;  I've probably shared this story a hundred times on this sub, but I'll share it again. One of the worst days of my recovery. I had a normal day, ate my breakfast and lunch. Was going out for dinner with my mom and sister to Cheesecake Factory. Was feeling pretty hungry going into dinner. I don't remember what I ordered, but I started with the bread and butter, then I had a 2200 calorie entree. It felt like an appetizer. Then I had a 1700 calorie slice of Red Velvet Cheesecake. And I know other people on here will understand what I mean when I say, that used to be my favorite cheesecake at cheesecake factory, but in that moment, **I could not and did not enjoy it at all**. It was almost like I was blocked from tasting it. Or feeling how full I was. I ate it because I was starving and knew I needed the calories. But at the end of the meal, I was like ""How TF did I just eat 4000 calories. Feels like I ate 800."" One hour later, I'm on my way home, and all of a sudden the hunger comes back. So freaking intense. I decide to stop for some sugar-free fat-free frozen yogurt (get some protein), again knowing my body was hungry for a reason and asking for food for a reason. Half hour later I get home and my stomach is rumbling and I'm getting hunger pains. I decide to listen to the hunger. Two and a half bowls of cereal later, the hunger subsides. An hour later, I'm in bed trying to go to sleep and I can feel the hunger returning and feel my stomach growling again. At this point I'm tired of listening to my body, so I get up, pop some drugs, and go back to bed and fall asleep. For sure 6000+ calorie day and one of the worst. Woke up in the middle of the night 4-5 hours later and me, my bed, sheets, everything is literally drenched in sweat, my heart is pounding. Hypermetabolic state.  &amp;#x200B;  I spent so many days and nights like that during recovery. Living out my worst nightmare. Choosing to listen to my body, accepting the weight gain it was begging for, **feeling the deepest hunger I've ever felt in my life that literally felt like it was coming from the core of my being** at times, and wondering how the heck I got to that point in my life. I never binged, but I would dream intensely about binging on desserts all the time, wake up crying, until I realized it was a dream and it never happened.  &amp;#x200B;  I thought it would never end, but it did. The body fat overshoot went away on its own and I'm far healthier now than I've been in years.",False,False

My fucking lizard brain just wants to ***eat!!***  Even if I have absolutely NO hunger, my brain just wants me to eat and taste something. Our brains are predisposed to love eating thanks to evolution. Survival, bish!!!  My brain just wants that teeny-tiny amount of endorphins that are released when I eat. It's a fucking drug and years of being obese and giving into it a million times a day have me addicted, even after 5 years of weight loss/maintenance.  **BUT** it's 2019. We're smarter than our lizard brains! Why is it still like thissssss????",False,False
