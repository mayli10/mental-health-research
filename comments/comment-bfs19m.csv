The sad truth is that most women we know get caught up in body image and yoyo dieting if not full-blown disordered eating, and they don't get any kind of support or help, so they end up projecting it onto their daughters out of fear. They want to protect their children from going through the same heartache they went through - how many times have we thought ""if I'd started \[X\] years ago I'd be \[Y\] today?"" But without proper education, they panic, and end up causing more harm than good.  I'm so glad you got to have that talk with your mother and get a better understanding of where this behaviour came from. I hope you two can move forward together too.",False,False

Parents mostly mean well but sometimes they just have no idea what the repercussions of their actions/words are. My mother is my closest friend and the best person in my life but god knows she's definitely contributed to my disordered eating. I think they never meant to fuck us up but because their own behaviors are messed up it kind of rubs off on us, ya know?    I hope this is the beginning of a stronger and better relationship between you and her &lt;3",False,False
