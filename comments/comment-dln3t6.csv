Makes sense as a business move since Coke’s diet drinks outsell Pepsi’s.   I haven’t tried it yet, despite curiosity stemming from hatred of their own formula &amp; loving Coke’s products. Coke’s not broken so I’m not interested in trying to fix it.   The drinks do still have some obvious differences Btw.   Note: Higher up on list = Higher percentage of the final product   **Coke Zero**  SODIUM: 40mg  INGREDIENTS   1- CARBONATED WATER, 2-CARAMEL COLOR, 3-PHOSPHORIC ACID, 4-ASPARTAME, 5-POTASSIUM BENZOATE, 6-*NATURAL FLAVORS,* 7-POTASSIUM CITRATE, 8-ACESULFAME POTASSIUM, 9-CAFFEINE.  **Reformulated Diet Pepsi**  SODIUM: 35mg  INGREDIENTS   1- CARBONATED WATER, 2-CARAMEL COLOR, 3-ASPARTAME, 4-PHOSPHORIC ACID, 5-POTASSIUM BENZOATE (PRESERVES FRESHNESS), 6-CAFFEINE, 7-CITRIC ACID, 8-*NATURAL FLAVOR*, 9-ACESULFAME POTASSIUM    **Key Differences**  1) Coke0 has more sodium/salt. Similarly; the citric acid in Coke0 is present as potassium citrate which is a *salt* of citric acid.  2) DPepsi relies on getting its taste from aspartame more than Coke0 does  3) In contrast, Coke0 relies more on their unique blend that makes up the company’s secret formula (*AKA “natural flavors”*) more than DPepsi relies on their own formula.  3) Coke0 has more Ace-K than caffeine. DPepsi makes Ace-K the least potent ingredient  4) Despite similarity in caffeine mg, it seems that the caffeine in DPepsi makes up a higher percentage of the final product. Caffeine powder is VERY bitter which might be why they have to over rely on aspartame     ***  I’m sure Diet Pepsi’s formula probably still varies by country",False,False

(*Im just assuming you haven’t switched to sparkling water, diet root beer, tea, or lemonade yet because both the carbonation &amp; caffeination help you out. If not I recommend the first two*)   Taking some chances possibly could result  in you finding one you somewhat enjoy because different artificial sweeteners (**a.s**), and different caffeine contents (**c.c**) can dramatically effect taste. So it may be worth it!  Medically *may* also help alleviate the stomach pain if it turns out you were sensitive to a specific sweetener or other specific ingredient. Also, not all acids have the same exact effect on teeth.  Carbonic acid, which all fizzy drinks have, doesn’t really do anything on its own but malic acid (**MA**), citric acid (**CA**), Benzoic acid (**BA**), phosphoric acid (**V Acid**)   can sometimes have a negative effect.
