I have lost 100lbs over the last 3 years. I would lose a big chunk, then gain, lose again...it was a horrible cycle. I have had issues with food since I was about 13 years old but it really ramped up again last year following a second spinal surgery and then an emergency surgery 3 weeks later to address a life threatening infection. It's also where my addiction to laxatives started. I've lost 30 pounds in the last 6 months which doesn't sound like a lot but it is all very noticeable now even though I just hit a healthy BMI.  The comments are the worst part. I know that people think they are being encouraging, especially when they saw me at my highest weight, but saying things like ""you're withering away to nothing"" are really not helpful. We had a family party yesterday for my mom's birthday and my cousin actually made an offhand comment about having to stage an intervention for me before the night was over. It wasn't funny and it made me feel awful and awkward. Especially when I know how much I have been restricting, fasting, and using laxatives.  Thankfully I have one good friend who is in recovery herself and knows my whole story and is super supportive when I break down, which is quite a bit lately. She lets me know that my ED is valid, even if I don't feel that way and has been gently pushing me to start thinking about getting real help. I'm finally starting to consider it just because I don't know how much longer I can go on doing what I'm doing. It's exhausting but I know that I won't stop on my own...  ",False,False

My weight was so low I was taken super seriously and given an appointment almost immediately when waiting lists are usually months long.

Recently I went back to the doctor to get help because I couldn't take it any more and it was getting way worse due to stress etc. Was waved out of the room and told to keep an eye on it and track my weight.
