Tbh Iâ€™m mostly asexual (but not aromantic). I just occasionally fall head over heels in love. Iâ€™ve only ever felt this strongly about my wife before, this has knocked my world sideways!",False,False

I think I had a lot of the same mindset in middle/high school, I would unconsciously look for approval in my parents and peers, so I kept spiraling without anyone noticing because I also didn't want them to; even if they did then what would happen?  But since graduation, now during my gap year, I've had a lot of time to think about while I'm doing and why and I keep grabbing at nothing, pining the problem on thin air, or something or another that made me feel bad.  But I guess I need to think, is my hate for myself greater than my want for love?? I probably sound like a poetic idiot but that's just how it is I suppose. Thank you for your kind words and motivation! :-)",False,True

I really really think I know what you mean because, for the first time in my life, I think I have realized that this is actually a maladaptive behavior.   Forever, ever since I first was diagnosed with AN when I was 15 or 16, Iâ€™ve had this fantasy that someone would just see how much I was suffering and they would save me from myself. Or at least VALIDATE me.   And then that happened with this guy, he told me I was killing myself, and there was my affirmation, but it didnâ€™t change things. So if that ISNâ€™T what has been motivating me, that means I really DO need to work through my own issues.   And I donâ€™t know if he would want to be with me, or if itâ€™s even possible, but I do know he doesnâ€™t want me to do these things. And I feel like often we do these things, starve ourselves, believing on some level that people will congratulate us.   So, when we are faced with someone we love NOT doing that.... what then? Then we have to take the hard look inward at ourselves and see what we see, and decide what is really there and what we value. And if we decide to try to do the hard work for them and for us? Then perhaps we only need to fight the biology and physicality of the disorder. I donâ€™t really know. Sorry that Iâ€™m rambling, Iâ€™m at a very strange point in my life and I felt like your comment really resonated with me.",False,False

I suppose I'm just scared because she *genuinely* makes me want to get better so we can be happy.,False,True

And the man Iâ€™m in love with rn doesnâ€™t seem to have been scared off yet after seeing my behaviors.   This is a chronic illness for many sufferers. For me, having partners who understand me is essential and believe me, those people are out there ðŸ’•",False,False
