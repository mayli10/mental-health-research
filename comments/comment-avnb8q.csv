My parents are both morbidly obese and do nothing to change. They always comment about how much they hate their body and want to lose weight but still get gallons of ice cream and overeat every day. It hurts to see them that way and I want to help but I cant. My mom lost about 40 pounds a year ago but gained it all back. To make it worse shes always like “well i gained the weight bcs you stopped going to the gym with me” but i constantly tell her that if she truly wanted to lose the weight, me not tagging along wouldnt stop her. So yeah, I feel you. It just hurts seeing all the side effects that come with it too. ",False,False

I feel largely responsible for them because I'm a lot more knowledge on what's healthy and what's not.   It pains me when they do things that are harmful to them such as overeating, but ultimately I have to keep in mind that they are responsible for themselves. If they need support from me it's their job to ask, I'm not their parent after all  Your mother chose an unhealthy coping mechanism back then. Her way of coping was not your fault. Thankfully, she seems to have overcome it. And even if she were to put the weight back on she'd know how to lose it again  One last note, it is normal, healthy even, to not eat the healthiest all the time. She sounds happy and healthy at her weight at this point and that's what matters. She's in a good place right now, try to remember that",False,False
