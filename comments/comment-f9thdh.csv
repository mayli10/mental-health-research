It’s really hard to gain a pound in one sitting because of how our bodies metabolize calories. Along with that; stools, food in your gut, and the status of your menstrual cycle (if you have one) all play a role in what the scale says.   So try not to freak too much! This is all stuff I have to think about whenever I binge and it’s hard but you can get through it. I’ve yet to truly gain more than 2-3lbs binging and that was after days of doing it.",False,False
