I lost my grandma (she raised me) over the summer and I understand how painful the first holiday without them can be. You’re not alone in this and I’m wishing the best for you ❤️,False,False

So sorry for the loss of your grandma, I lost mine recently as well and it’s def not the same. Keep in mind how you see you friends spending “quality time” with their families may not be accurate, they may not be sharing hard things going on too. It’s easy to compare your hardships to others good times. Not to invalidate you but just keep in mind it’s normal that there’s so much going on and you’re not alone ❤️",False,False
