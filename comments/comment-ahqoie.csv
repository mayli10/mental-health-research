I tried recovery and gained so much fucking weight on a dietitian mandated meal plan of like 1200-1400 or some shit. And I’m still angry about it, honestly. My doctor is baffled by it because my thyroid, while on the low side, isn’t in hypo levels, so no one can figure out what went wrong. It’s so frustrating. I too feel I can only lose weight by starvation. ",False,False

It's easy to just ignore ""just a bites"" and ""small sips"" but those add up easily. I usually tack on an extra 1-200 calories onto MFP just to be safe.  There even was a study that showed people who were trying to stick to a diet that were also mini snackers where not logging about 1000cal. That explained why they weren't losing weight  ",False,False

Either I fast and lose weight, or eat and gain weight. Doesn't matter if it's keto or not (although it has other health benefits), doesn't matter the number of calories, eating means I'll gain.  I don't see myself getting out of this dichotomy. What I do see is the possibility of fasting enough to reach my goal weight (15 pounds from now), which means I will be able to eat a bit more without guilt.",False,False

How the fuck do people have the patients to space their weight loss over like... half a year? Years? Good for them but I think I'd go crazy not seeing my goals for that long. ,False,False

My fasting glucose runs 80-110 ml/dl, and post eating its almost never above 125 ml/dl but my a1c was like 5.9 last time it was checked (6.0 and above is considered diabetic).
