Googled for some random #s - if you pee 6x a day, and the average urine output is 1800ml, you’ll expel 300ml of urine in an average bathroom trip. 1L of water is 1kg, so 300ml = 300g = ~2/3 of a pound.  Also, no sources for this, but I feel like people with EDs drink way more than your average person. Up the urine output, and up the ‘weight loss’.  That’s a lot of thought for pee weight lol",False,False

A regular deposition is about 150gr, and that's 0,3 lbs. 4lbs is closer to a newborn baby than poop.",False,False

It confuses me as well. Maybe both of us have little shits compared to everyone else?   I can't believe I haven't actually tested this. I have a set of scales and I live on my own. I can need a poop, weigh myself, poop, weigh myself and record the loss. Then work out an average poop weight over a week or something.",False,False
