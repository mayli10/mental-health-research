The environment was a lot and I was just telling myself “maybe this is one of those situations where in 30 years I’ll tell my grandkids I over came working for an asshole blah blah” but it’s not worth it and I needed to get out. Idk if that even makes sense but yeah my sanity finally comes first and have never put it first.  I’m planning on a break for at a week or two. I have enough savings for a decent time but I don’t wanna blow it since I wanna plan a big move next year.,False,True

I’m gunna go to the co cop and treat myself to non dairy ice cream, and the bulk nut thing and make my own trail mix. Maaaaybe get some chips. It’s always fun going there compared to Walmart lol",False,True

My therapist asked if i was manic but my doc completely agreed. The environment sounds awful anf if anything it would make bipolar worse. Take care of yourself and maybe take a break before jumping into anything if you can afford too. How i see it, you cut a problem off before it caused dramatic harm. And you exited pretty gracefully. I am proud of you",False,False
