It has effects physically but it’s mostly how your brain processes things. Tracking calories is not disordered itself but once you become obsessed with it to the point it is affecting your life quality then that’s when it becomes a problem. And not everyone with eating disorders track calories either! If you have a disordered relationship with food then you are definitely struggling and not a fraud. All eating disorders are different and not everyone eats 500~ calories and not everyone uses laxatives. It’s also very common for people with an eating disorder to think they are a fraud or faking so just keep that in mind as well. :),False,False
