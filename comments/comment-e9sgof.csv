I'm sure they miss you,False,False

I know she would be understanding about the way it made me feel. I’m going to build up the courage to reach out to her and schedule a meeting. Thank you for sharing your experience with this. I hope we can both feel better soon!,False,True

Anytime I go to a new doctor this type of situation happens. If you want to get better you need to find a way to forgive and move on and continue your treatment plan.,False,False

I understand that the interaction I had was typical and when looked at rationally, constructive. Unfortunately, disorders like the one I am attempting to recover from alter your ability to process things in a rational way.   I am on an ED sub venting about my ED; not a doctor.",False,True

They should be able to give you advice on how to deal with what the doctor said and did. Maybe they can recommend you a more understanding doctor. You definitely don’t have to put up with such behaviour from a doctor - she was very careless.   I’ve been spooked out of going to my therapist for a little while, and I really regretted it. Basically, my OCD was telling me to avoid her. I ignored her emails and felt so bad. But my mental health got worse and my girlfriend gently pressured/helped me to get back into contact with her, and it helped immensely.   You say you love your therapist, so please don’t give up that support.",False,False

Or their minds. Or the people around them. People who drink try will say all the time that they know its killing their liver so why is the doctor telling them agian. And that not even getting into the poor justifications for these behaviors. I'm not trying to come down on you just trying to explain what the doctor may be thinking. And it would be dereliction of duty if you went to a new to you doctor for a health checkup for some kind of eating disorder and the doctor did not mention the health complications associated with your disorder to you.,False,False
