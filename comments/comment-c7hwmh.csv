I wanna say- I've had severe depression for 6 years and it's really bad right now because of recovery and weight gain etc. But I can tell you, there will be days where you feel good about yourself and you dont know why. Hold onto those days with all your mental force. Remind yourself on your bad days that a good day will come around again and you'll remember that your body is a GOOD BODY cause it lets you do things you like to do.   I hope a good day comes soon for you &lt;3",False,False

I'm sorry you've been struggling for so long. It's very common for a person to go from anorexia to bingeing. That happened to me too. The book ""brain over binge"" really helped me. (I say that so much here people probably think I'm like a paid advertiser but it REALLY did, and I'm in no way affiliated with the book). It takes a different perspective than many treatment paradigms because it treats bingeing as a HABIT - connected to emotions for sure, but it treats bingeing like an addiction that you can break. I'd highly recommend that book... it helped me so much. Your dreams are not pathetic or sad!",False,False

I am sorry we all are. No one truly understands until you live this. I know I did not until I found myself here where I am today. I am 25. But I fell into anorexia when I was 17. It makes me upset so much that it has been so long. Not just months. Or days. Years. Years of my life stolen. I would now consider myself to be absolutely struggling with binging. Secretly at night. It has caused me to gain and become overweight where I previously nearly starved myself to death and my legs could barely support anything and it was so uncomfortable to sleep as my bones were pushing so much through my skin. It is sick that I feel it would be easier to be there now rather than where I am now. I feel as though I no longer have control. I thought I was fat when I was practically a skeleton, so I cannot even register how difficult it is now to be overweight. My life doesnâ€™t even feel real anymore. Like I am on autopilot and unrecognizable. My dreams are somewhat pathetic in a way; to have a boyfriend for the first time, maybe even lose my virginity, to wear shorts in the summertime and genuinely not feel shame. Isnâ€™t it sad? Wouldnâ€™t it just be so much easier to just sleep and dream it all away. How can it be so easy for some people. To do these things. To live. To eat and sleep through the night without an exhausting effort.",False,True

What are your dreams? Tell us more about yourself - how old are you? Yes, EDs are unfair and awful and horrible. We're here for you. We want you to live life too. It's possible.

Iâ€™ve felt that anguish and I can only imagine how hard it was to pour out your feelings like that. No matter how terrible you feel that you are, I promise that you donâ€™t deserve to suffer. You donâ€™t. You deserve to forgive yourself for existing.   It is okay to exist in your body. It is okay to live in your bodyâ€™s current state. Itâ€™s okay to make gradual changes to your body if you so choose. But you donâ€™t need to punish yourself for how your body is.   Iâ€™m sending you hugs if you want them.",False,False
