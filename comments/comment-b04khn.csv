You don't start smoking to lose weight....you KEEP smoking so you don't gain weight from the side effects of quiting; irritability, boredom, oral fixation ingrained into you because of smoking, general malease.   Don't start smoking.    And on my soap box- I just lost my mother to small cell lung cancer. She smoked from age of 14. She quit smoking on and off but quit for good about TWO YEARS before she was diagnosed. Small cell lung cancer is harder to treat than non small cell. It has a 5% survival rate at the 5 year mark after treatment.  Don't start smoking.",False,False

Also, you say only one cig a day but nicotine is really addictive and you probably wouldn’t be able to stick to that. So yes, it would speed up your metabolism but not by much at all and there are a lot of side effects.",False,False
