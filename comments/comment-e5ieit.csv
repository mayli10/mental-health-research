And for the life of me, I couldn't focus on studying; all I could think about was food, how 'fat' I was getting and when my next binge would be. I pulled Cs at best. I really struggled until I relapsed like 6 months later (because I wasn't being fucking monitored anymore).  It's completely irrational, but I still kinda blame that whole fiasco as the sole reason why I didn't get into a top-five university. Yeah. I know it's ridiculous.  ...Not that any of this even fucking matters anymore lmao",False,False

The semester that my ed was the worst was the first time I made the deans list. I could barley make it through a shift at work because I would only eat 200-300 calories but my grades were great.,False,False

I miss the kind of holistic put together and in control feeling I had months ago — it really becomes so much bigger than being skinny,False,True

When I was in recovery and had put on weight, my grades (and everything else) was at its worst.   Now that I relapsed (quite a while ago) and lost weight and etc, my grades are really good and so is everything else.   I think this is one of the reasons why it's so hard for people to fully recover. We have realizations like this and don't want to let go of it.",False,False

Mostly because I had NO social life. My life consisted of class, homework, and intense workouts every day. There was little to distract me. It's unsustainable though. I burnt out after one semester of intense starvation, exercise, and studying.",False,False

I do way better in general when my ED is bad. Something about having that control and structure over eating helps me to have control and structure over everything else.,False,False

I had this intense focus, I could literally study the whole day without getting distracted it was amazing and kind of weird lol. I was the best student at my worst.",False,False
