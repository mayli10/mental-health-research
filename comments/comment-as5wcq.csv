I get a massive dopamine rush, clear headed but I also (tmi, sorry) get diarrhea. It's like my digestive system flushes itself out. I usually only high restrict because needing urgent and unpredictable bathroom breaks isn't exactly nice (or convenient).",False,False

I didn’t get any electrolytes and I’ve involuntarily thrown up each day (not even a purger...). I feel a little bit better today because my boyfriend was like “you’re not doing anything about this craziness so I’m gonna go to the store and get you some gatorade” what a saint lol It’s definitely not just you with the brain fog I feel like a mist walker rn,False,False
