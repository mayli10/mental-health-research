I’m obsessed with getting all my goals marked off and hitting my calorie goal so it buzzes and congratulated me every day. When I don’t hit my goals I spiral into super depression bc I feel like a failure,False,False

It freezes up from time to time so I'm not always getting an accurate count and it bugs me. Which is why I started using Samsung health to get my step count.,False,False

I can check it 50 times a day sometimes. I has also definitely enabled me to over exercise. But it might be different for you. For me to see all the numbers layed out and to get recognition when I walk a lot or exercise of burn a lot of calories has made me thing about it even more. I can’t get rid of it either because I am fully obsessed with all that data.,False,False
f537o6z,t3_dmlkhd,t3_dmlkhd,OkWorking7,2,2019-10-24 17:45:39,/r/EDAnonymous/comments/dmlkhd/fitbit/f537o6z/,I have a FitBit charge 3 and I love it. It definitely makes me more conscious of my overall health and since it shows me TDEE it makes me freak out less about going over my calorie goal. Also you can track weight training as exercise with the charge 3,False,False

f52egq7,t3_dmlkhd,t3_dmlkhd,AngeloLacrime,3,2019-10-24 15:40:49,/r/EDAnonymous/comments/dmlkhd/fitbit/f52egq7/,I use Fitbit and I also use the Samsung health app on my phone. Idk which one is more accurate. They're pretty close when it comes to counting steps. CloseISH when counting distance. For yesterday my Fitbit app says I walked 14 miles and Samsung health says 15 miles. Calories burned is where they differ most. My Fitbit says I burned 2163 active calories and Samsung health says I burned 1701. That's a huge difference. So idk which to go by. But it puts me at ease either way seeing the numbers. As long as my calories burned is greater than the calories I consumed. There will be inconsistencies no matter what you go with because each one will use different algorithms.,False,False
