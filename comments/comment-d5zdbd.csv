Iâ€™m really sorry you have to deal with this, that kind of behaviour would drive me up the wall.",False,False

It can be so hard for people to realize and accept they need help, and it really does affect the people around them. I hope you can continue to be strong and make the best choices you can for you and your kid.",False,False

If you confronted her about her food problems and suggest she see a counselor, I imagine she would get super upset, yell, etc. but it may be something to consider, at least get the idea in her head. She may never get over that and even though it's easier said than done coming from an ED pov, it's silly to ruin relationships over food, and if she wants a healthy relationship with her grandchild, she should put in responsible effort to work on her issues.",False,False

It's the most frustrating thing in the world and I just wanted you to know that I can absolutely relate and you are not alone in this. I actually just read this out to my boyfriend who is dead tired and if he was less tired, he would've laughed and agreed. Thank you for making me feel less alone too.",False,False

Even if you deal with problems like this, as long as you're a normally intelligent human, you will be able to reflect on your own thoughts and behaviours. Like, you can still try and be sensible and not let it out on other people or if you can't at least get help for it. She sounds toxic.",False,False
