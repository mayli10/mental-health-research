Mixing cans of soup into potatoes and pasta might help a whole lot. If you were comfortable with cream of mushroom, that'd melt down well into a pseudogravy; it's been a long time since I had it, so I'm afraid idk how the canned kind does on sodium + macros.  If the canned kind isn't great, you could try making your own homemade soup with a bit of cornstarch or cream of tartar to thicken it?  Canned tomato sauce is going to have way too much sodium, if gravy does, but you could cook down unsalted canned tomato on the stove and add spices? It might be unusual to add to potatoes, but it might also be really nice hot food if you experiment and find a config you like.  Alternatively, would low-sodium soy sauce be worth trying out? Low kCal, no oil, and waters down rice. Idk if it'd go with potato, tho, or if it's be overwhelming to use enough to make a texture difference. Maybe soy sauce + veggie broth.",False,False
