We stopped by Dunkin‚Äô for coffee and I wanted an almond milk iced coffee.  My mom got flustered looking at donut flavors or something and just ordered iced coffee which came with cream or half and half.  When she handed me the drink it was wayyy lighter in color than almond milk makes coffee so I knew it was made with a ton more calories than I was expecting.  I refused it, told her to drink it, it was ‚Äúon her‚Äù so she should drink it, maybe she could find someone else to drink it, and finally got huffy and quiet.  My poor mother turned back around and ordered the drink I originally wanted.  I am not usually an emotional person and the only time I get worked up is when I plan to have a ‚Äútreat food‚Äù or drink all day, and then the treat ends up being wrong or tasting bad.
