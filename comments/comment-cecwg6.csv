The idea of having sex right now with my boyfriend makes me really uncomfortable, I know the girls in the porn he watches are much thinner and more toned than me. I need to lose weight more before I can let anyone other than myself see anything more than an ankle lmao",False,False

My sex drive is definitely higher than my SO‚Äôs and I am always ready to go. When I hit below 115 lbs, I was so tired and didn‚Äôt want any of it at the start.

I wasn't underweight but its was a severe difference between size 16 and size 6... Like when I waa bigger, I had more cushion lets say... Smaller I felt like I was constantly sitting/laying on bone even during sex. It was like all my insides shifted and had to compensate. I wasn't even underweight. Guess I should focus more on yoga moves.",False,False

I exercised as well so I started getting a bit more toned.   +1 for the sex drive, had been getting more horny and pleasure after upping my calories  My hair got longer and shinier, plus my face is now acne free and is more glowing. Really cant believe it!   Im still not yet fully recovered, and sometimes I relapse but my relationship with food had changed these past few months compared to my pro ana self last year.",False,False

I had ZERO sex drive during my most underweight times of my eating disorder. I always thought something was fundamentally wrong with me, but who knew that if your body is starvation mode, sex gets de-prioritized real quick.   I notice now, it is a constant battle with how I look vs feel though. While my sex drive has gone up since feeding myself adequately, I sometimes end up completely in my mind over how my body looks which is annoying. But I'll take it as progress ¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)\_/¬Ø",False,False

Your hair is thicker.  People start calling you attractive for reasons other than your body.  You can use machines at the gym you couldn‚Äôt before because you have a cushion between your bone and the machine (seriously couldn‚Äôt use the deltoid machine until I gained ‚Äúpadding‚Äù on my elbows).  Not quite as cold.  More independence/self reliance due to an increase in muscle.,False,False
