Society and recovery communities in general loooove â€˜streaksâ€™ and saying how many days free they are of x behavior. I have had to delete all the recovery apps on my phone and do old-school pen and paper for tracking successes, because I get down on myself for one dayâ€™s fuckup. Resetting a stopwatch sucks 100x more than just not checking a box, you know?  But in 24 days, say, you only purged once! Thatâ€™s a 96% success rate, which is pretty damn good. Iâ€™m proud of you ðŸ˜Š",False,False
