Nurse ""can you step on the scale please"". Me ""No thanks, I don't like to be weighed."" Nurse makes some comment about, I don't know, whatever. Me ""I'd be happy to discuss this with the doctor."" Just remember you are in control - you are in charge of your own feet and your feet don't have to end up on the scale.",False,False

The MA went to weigh me and I said ‚Äúdo you mind if I don‚Äôt do that?‚Äù She was absolutely fine with it and just had me self-report my weight. Don‚Äôt worry too much about asking, likely they will be just fine with it. You also don‚Äôt have to explain yourself. They don‚Äôt need a reason or justification to respect your boundary.",False,False

It‚Äôs a very real trigger for you. I would just tell them up front that you‚Äôd like to defer being weighed because of personal reasons. You could also ask them to weigh you (if you‚Äôre comfortable) with your back to the numbers and ask them not tell you the result when they record it. I promise you‚Äôre not the only person who deals with this and I‚Äôm sure that they‚Äôll be receptive if you emphasize that you have personal reasons why you don‚Äôt want it.,False,False

Once I did see my weight on a document they gave me though, so that was my own fault. I am not sure if your problem is knowing your weight or to be weighed, but I am sure they will be attentive to your needs, or at least I hope so. Good luck :)",False,False
