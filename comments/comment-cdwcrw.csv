I had the apartment to myself today, am feeling a little under the weather because of a minor cold that's exacerbated by my having run out of cold medicine, I don't have to work today and all I intended to today was chill while watching some horror movies, maybe a musical or two, an anime episode here and there. What did I instead do with my wasted time? Exactly the same as everyone else in this thread.   Those British diet shows have been popping up in my YT recommendeds more and more recently and it's too *tempting*.",False,False

It's def heavier/more depressing and more uncomfortable than for example ss vs. ss for me. I was expecting something like a shallow reality show but it really is sad. I kept expecting someone to break their leg or something under all of the weight; it looks so painful to move at all. Scary part is I can relate to their feelings about being addicted to bingeing. Even though I'm a healthy weight, I still recognize how powerful the cravings are, to the point that they're literally close to death and still make excuses",False,False
