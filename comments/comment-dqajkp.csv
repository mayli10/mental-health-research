You said yourself that you're good at self control so a 'binge' every now and then really won't impact you much in the long run, especially when the calories you mention aren't actually a huge amount outside of the ed mindset. I think the main thing is just to go easy on yourself and after you've binged just get back into the rhythm you're comfortable at to avoid spiralling into guilt and triggering more binges.  I know what I said might sound easy or patronizing but I promise, promise, promise that eating like you've mentioned every now and then will not skew your weight on the whole.",False,False

The only thing I will say is that if you are dealing with the panic from feeling out of control, meditation is phenomenal. Please be kind to yourself and your body. Note though: This uncontrollable urge is NOT a failure of self control, it is a survival mechanism to try to keep your body operating. Please do not see this as a failure of your own will, it is the success of a part of you that wants you to get better.",False,False

I bring a 1.5lt thermos with tea and just stay there.  I do this when I get the urge to eat garbage, because my family buys entire bags of candy for no reason and they are There. But when it is lunch time or dinner time I try to eat a regular amount, and I live with my family and we eat at the same time so they kind of control me without knowing it... And talking during the meal, watching tv etc. it helps to take my mind off things.  Idk if this is useful",False,False
