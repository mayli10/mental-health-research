Trintellix had no effect on my appetite or weight, for better or worse. In regard to mood, Trintellix has been very subtle and helps keep my mood stable, though not exactly happy/pleasurable. As much as anyone would like to feel their happiest, I'm pleased that I can at least avoid the extreme downs.",False,False

I’m also on Wellbutrin. Was just put on Vyvanse 3 weeks ago to help with my crazy appetite and binge eating. So far I’ve notice a slight difference with eating and it’s great for focus.,False,False
