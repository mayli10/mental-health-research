As sad as it sounds, you cant stay a bmi of lets say 15 forever. Our bodies are designed to survive and survival with such a low body weight is sadly v hard. so your brain will prob constantly sent you hunger signals to make you eat more so you gain weight.   I myself had once a v low bmi due to severe restricting and overexecising and i could not maintain it for more than 1,5 years. I ended up getting ""extreme hunger"" and gaining a lot of weight back in a span of just a month.  Sadly weightloss especially with an Eating disorder is not maintanable. You either spiral lower and lower, get skinnier and skinner or you develop a different eating disorder such as BED or Bulimia. And yes there is also a third option called recovery but...",False,False

Maintaining a low weight is difficult because of that, at least for me and what I’ve heard from others. It definitely takes discipline to stay where you’re at, both when it comes to gaining and losing. That and remember- if you’re eating a lot mostly at night, your weight gain in the morning is likely residual water weight and bloating from that.   IMO this is how I think people jump to the “starvation mode” BS where they claim your metabolism slows. You just end up consuming juuust enough more that you inch up the scale or retain a lot more water weight.",False,False
