I feel like taking my medicine on time may have helped. Or maybe a new one. I felt a lot better after I convinced myself to take the antidepression medicine. My mom is obviously still mad about me spendinf thanksgiving woth my SO but he's being depliyed so she can go somewhere if she doesnt understand,False,True

I was an hour later than usual taking the medicine so im starting to think that may have made it worse.   I feel like my mom has ADD/anxiety/depression/an ED too. So shes probably blowing my stories out of proportion in comparison to how I told them. My boyfriend was at the dinner and I asked him when I got to his house todat, but he didnt really feel like the stories I told were bad. So it's probably a her feeling self-concusious about her parenting since my anxiety/depression diagnosis more than anything.",False,True

I was once on an antidepressant that was meant to control migraines, and I had to discontinue it after two months because the thoughts of harming myself were much more consistent than they had ever been with or without medication. As in every single day from the third day I was on them. It was horrifying.   Definitely let your doctor know immediately if you're feeling worse after starting a new medication and ask them how to taper off if you plan to switch to a different one or discontinue entirely. This is very important.",False,False

Anti-depressants are a life saver, literally, but everyone is so different that some medications take you for a hard ride in the opposite direction. And maybe your mother also deals with anxiety or depression herself, and that could affect her reaction? It's hard to say as an outsider, but this kinda stuff tends to run in the family.  In the mean time, you absolutely need to give that sweet floof maximum cuddles for therapeutic purposes. ",False,False

It could be the antidepressants (not trying to discount your feelings, because they are very real &amp; valid). I was on too high of a dose of antidepressants for 1.5 years and it took me getting off of it to get enough mental clarity to realize the dosage was exacerbating my depression. I tried to off myself twice during this period, and had suicidal crises nearly every week. Now that I'm off of them, I don't have severe suicidal thoughts. Please please please talk to your doctor and tell them you're having a bad reaction to the meds. It just means you might need a different dose, or a different one entirely.  Good luck and stay safe üíñ",False,False
