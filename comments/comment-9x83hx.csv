They say on the packet that you can use them like spaghetti, but I'm a bit hesitant to try. I just found out that you can also get flat noodles (my local grocery store only has the round). I wonder if you could use them as a replacement for fettuccine?",False,True

I usually just add whatever random veg or protein I have and it pretty much always works out. My fav mix is mixed forest mushrooms, spring onion, low cal noodles and some ginger paste. Maybe tofu if I'm feeling fancy (I don't usually buy it though). Adding a little rice wine vinegar, mirin and low salt veg stock can really pimp it up too. ",False,False
