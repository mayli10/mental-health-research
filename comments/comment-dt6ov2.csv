What I did was eat a normal amount of calories per day EVERYDAY for as long as possible! And I stopped for good, your body doesn’t need repair. It’s an addictive response only.  You should really read Brain over Binge by Kathryn Hansen, it’s a life saver istg. I hope that helps:]",False,False

I think that the worst part about overchewing gum is the stress that it puts on your jaw/mouth muscles.  You’re right, I love it too but sometimes I end up consuming a bunch of bs calories from Gum. Honestly, I don’t think that the it will be too bad on you to chew gum, I chewed gum like a maniac when I was AN, it made no difference to my weight.  Just keep buying gum and only take like 5 pieces with you and leave the rest at home ect. I do this and sometimes I even break the sticks In half",False,False

At the same time, I also realize I could have a piece of fruit every day for the amount of gum calories I chew. However, the gum lasts soooo much longer than a piece of fruit, so I get more ""bank for my buck (calories) "" so to speak. But it's gotta be causing havoc in my digestive system.
