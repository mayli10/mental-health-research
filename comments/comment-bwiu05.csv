My therapist asked me if I had distress with restricting or SH. I told her no it makes me feel better.  The distress comes with gear of being found out,False,False

I started restricting to lose weight around the end of highschool, then when I got to college I switched to cutting for about a year or two intermittently. I have been clean forgive years now and basically never have the urge to self harm, but I think I just switched 100% to restricting instead. I get triggered into wanting to starve forever so much more frequently since then. it does make me feel happy, clean, and superior to not eat for so long",False,False

If I donâ€™t have the opportunity to b/p, then alternate SH urges like cutting/bruising/ exercise purging flair up intensely.",False,False

Its hell.  I get a lot of positive attention from the weight loss and I just lol because all im doing is making my pain show on the outside when im not cutting,False,False

(check post history)  I'm underweight as well and I *know* that I'm unhealthily thin, but I've been restricting my food and exercising excessively to self harm. (It helps with my clean streak from cutting, lmao). I'm glad that I physically can't seem to vomit-purge because if I could, I might very well be doing that all the time as well.   Please, please stay safe though :( You don't deserve all that pain and I wish I could say something to make it all better. Sending love.",False,False

I wasn't allowed alcohol and if I actually harmed myself (visibly, like cutting) I would have been kicked out and homeless. It was also a reaction to having no control over my life.  Not as much now, after leaving the situation that caused my ED.",False,False

Starve myself because I hate my body, starve myself because I deserve the pain. Sometimes though I guess I kinda eat as a form of self harm too.

My therapist says that both  self harm and restrictive eating behaviors are very similar.  I am a cutter who when I dont SH I will either binge eat or restrict my diet and increase exercise. Right now I am on a restricting pattern and increased exercise.  But since I am obese no one notices much. At least the restrictive eating and increased exercise is socially acceptable behaviors for someone of my weight.  SH is never socially acceptable.,False,False
