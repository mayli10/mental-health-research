That's especially true as a growing teen. For now it's best to focus on making sure you're not hungry and that you're eating healthy meals. And definitely don't get sucked into the idea that more calories means less healthy. Calories are energy, nothing more. If things aren't so bad yet it should be easy enough to reverse whatever you've been going through, just make sure to check your thoughts for negativity and try to get a deeper understanding of where this is coming from. In my case anorexia really snuck up on me and when it started I did start to feel self-conscious about my body, but I wasn't self-conscious before my ED. The real issue for me was about feeling that I was losing control over my life. I figured I could control my eating habits to lose weight and save money, so it seemed good, but I didn't realize until it was too late that it was really bad. Like, it was in the final month of my second year of college and I ended up saving $200 on my meal plan when the previous year I had to load extra on my plan for the last month. You've managed to notice it early though, so you can still do something about it before it spirals out of control.",False,False

I know it's easier said than done, but please, don't let this become a long term habit. You won't have any negative physical effects from two weeks, but by the time the really nasty stuff (hair loss, muscle loss, fatigue, dysmorphia, fear foods &amp; unbreakable eating rituals) sets in, it will be a much deeper hole to dig out of. Most of us wish we could go back to the beginning and talk ourselves out of it. Do your best to stay safe.",False,False
