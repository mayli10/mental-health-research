They may just know about the ED and be trying to correct it. When I went vegan in high school my mom refused to buy anything that didnt have animal products in it. Even veggies were those ones that have a butter or cheese sauce or something in them. Its F-ed up for sure but it's their F-ed up way of saying I see you and I care. Doesnt make it right.,False,False

For what it's worth, here's another Reddit stranger wishing you a Happy Birthday, you deserve to have a great day and I'm sorry if it doesn't turn out so. We care about you here!!",False,False

And I've been there...feeling like no one cares enough about you to make it special for you when you try to make things special for them.   At the same time, people have different things they care about and ways of showing they care. Some people might not even think to do any birthday thing for the person they love the most in the world. But I'm annoyed because I always have to do all the work and planning for my own birthday, as well as for everyone else's it feels like. But, I have learned that if I want something, I have to ask for it :(   Shitty of your parents to get a non-vegan cake though, and eat it in front of you on your birthday. Like w.t.f. is that?",False,False
