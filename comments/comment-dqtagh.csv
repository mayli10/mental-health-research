Either/all, Jabba the Hut or Green Plant Girl...Yes. I feel much ""healthier"" when I restrict. I am more organized and thoughtful. I am hydrated. I am funny and social and try new things. I dress well and feel put together. I get shit done. When I am binging I feel out of control. My room is messy, my style is messy, and I really struggle to leave my room. I can't stand to be seen. I am embarrassed to be alive. I am coming out of a monster 3 week binge and I want to hide in a cave and hibernate for at least 4. At least I've been running this whole time. My legs feel different.",False,False

It's 1000x easier to mix up some garbage, or simply open up a granola bar and munch it, than it is to plan and prepare healthy, well-balanced meals. Don't underestimate healthy eating, it doesn't come easy. But, in that same sense, the feeling of accomplishment when I cook a healthy meal is huge. I also have depression, so sometimes I can't even get myself to shower, let alone whip up a salad with a side sandwich.",False,False

I feel extra bad if I go over my daily calorie limit that I've set for myself or if after a meal I feel ""full"" (I usually eat juuuust enough to be ""not hungry"").

It takes patience and mental awareness.   I start binging when my SO wants fast food. This week, we've brought home Raising Cane's 4 times this week since we have coupons from it opening, free meals, etc. We'll be busy and we get it because it's easy. We also had Popeyes and Starbucks as well.  I noticed I ate a whole Box combo and felt extremely full afterwards. Was it worth $8.87 to eat all this food for one person?   I realized that a box combo is better to split. I'm eating less calories, it's cheaper to split, so a win win. If I'm hungry, I drink a glass of water to prevent a binge and I'm good.  My weight shot up when the 5 days of fast food started. I get restriction urges when my weight goes up, and it leads to me being aggressive, emotional, and irritable. Positive self talk and finding why I'm reaching out for a binge is essential. It's going down because I'm incorporating a quick snack of fruit to hold me down so I can  make a healthy dinner. Sometimes, a ready made salad for $6 is better to have on hand instead of spending $6 at McDonald's. I feel full with a salad. I never feel full with a big Mac combo  I also noticed that I should eat before I leave the house to prevent unwanted food purchases and binges. If I'm stressed, bored, or depressed, I realized that I will look for food. PokÃ©mon Go with friends is my binge brain crusher. I'm usually too focused on my friends, the experience, that food doesn't occupy my brain like it once did.  I hope this helps.",False,False
