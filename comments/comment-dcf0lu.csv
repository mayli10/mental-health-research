You go inpatient when it's medically necessary. That being said, that's not the only type of intensive treatment. IOPs, PHPs, and Residentials are all extremely helpful treatments that would honestly get you further into recovery than a hospital. A hospital will send you home when you're medically stable, not when your eating disorder is under control.",False,False

Unfortunately insurance (here anyway) is a bitch and doesn't want to help you unless you're actually dying,False,False

When you'd be at a point when you need inpatient depends on your exact behaviors. I have a friend with EDNOS who wasn't at a low enough body weight to be diagnosed w anorexia but was sent inpatient because she did a lot of dry fasts which caused medical instability because she was so severely dehydrated. Another reason can be blood sugar problems. It really varies a lot bc of the wide spectrum of ED behaviors,False,False
