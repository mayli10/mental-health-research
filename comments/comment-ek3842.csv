I think after so long it‚Äôs so hard to be normal round food. When I‚Äôm eating I just like zone out. It‚Äôs like I‚Äôm not in control.. I will try again. I don‚Äôt wanna be like this anymore.

It isn't easy at all and I have binged sooo many times when trying to eat normally. Zoning into your hunger cues takes a lot of time after binging and restricting for so long.  Recently I've read Brain Over Binge which has really helped me in suppressing binge urges. I would really recommend it, you can find a PDF online. I found mine by googling the title and PDF on reddit :)",False,True
