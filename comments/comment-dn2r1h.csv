I can't imagine not eating them. Big ass plate of veggies for 60-100 cal or something with less nutritional value for more? I'll take the veggies. I eat apples and bananas a lot. As well as frozen strawberries and mangoes. I like having fruit with my yogurt or oatmeal. And I eat a fuckton of kale and spinach. ðŸ˜‚ With as much green veggies as I eat I'm surprised I'm not turning green myself. Damn that's shitty. I don't really have any fear foods. There's foods I simply don't eat because I don't want to waste my calories on them, but I wouldn't call them fear foods.",False,False
