I’m vegan too, and I truly do have strong ethical qualms regarding the environment and the treatment of animals that preceded my ED by several years. At the same time, I would be lying to myself if I were to say that I don’t also heavily rely on and give additional emotional value to veganism for making restriction much easier and feeling like a way to be in control other than explicitly restricting calories.   That may not be the case for you at all, but my point is that the facilities are keeping patients like myself in mind because I and others in the same boat make up the majority within the group ‘anorexic vegans’ and you (assuming that for you it has absolutely nothing to do with calorie restriction or the feeling of control and is purely 100% ethical, which is a very hard distinction to make) would be the minority.   Additionally, it makes their job of helping you LIVE significantly more difficult if they can’t replenish your body with certain nutrients that are found mostly in meat and dairy and they can’t weight restore you quickly by feeding you any number of calorie and nutrient rich animal products.   Instead they would have to either: a) rely on a majority diet of higher calorie and denser processed vegan junk food (which could cause you to develop binge eating habits, defeating the purpose of treatment by trading one ED for another)  or  b) feed you an absolutely massive volume of harder to digest + lower calorie vegan foods that would damage your (most likely) barely functioning digestive system In either case they would also have to feed you the same few meals over and over with little variation- which is in itself restrictive eating.   Do you see the issue? It’s possible to remain vegan and weight restore yourself- and even to work toward a healthier mindset- but there is good reason that the facilities are making it hard for you to do it on their turf.   Your best bet would be to find an outpatient therapist and nutritionist team who work with you and with one another, which is what I did when I quasi-recovered. Had I stuck with them for as long as I should have instead of quitting after gaining the bare minimum, I might not be in this subreddit anymore.   Having pre-prepared meals to the nutritionist’s specifications delivered to my house by a meal service and knowing that I had to eat them or I would waste a ton of money and food helped me, because I can’t stand to be wasteful. I think this is a commonality among many vegans but I don’t know if it is applicable for you specifically.  DM me if you want further suggestions, because I totally get why you wouldn’t want to go against your morals and make yourself sick!

Nothing else works well enough at that price, and nothing else is as easy to digest. I can understand if you have qualms about it, though.  You can fix malnourishment and still hold a ketogenic diet, if you want to do that. It's kind of weird, and could further an ED, but that's biology for you. There is no deficiency syndrome for carbohydrates and the minimum required intake is likely zero.  Humans are naturally carnivores (having eaten brain and offal of land animals and fish which are high in DHA and EPA for most of evolution - a non-lacto non-ovo vegetarian diet does not naturally contain any of this, nor does it contain much B12), and don't try to convince me otherwise.  Your morals may be interfering with fixing malnutrition. I know not about you, but I'd rather put my health above some religious belief that animals are sacred.  Residential apparently usually makes people higher DEB, so don't do that, please.  #Option 1 - Break your morals  Go out and rent a boat, and get a fishing license. Bring supplies like macadamia nuts, toasted soybeans, coconuts, FORTIFIED nutritional-yeast and so on. BRING SALT, AND WATER - YOU MAY END UP IN KETOSIS IF YOU RESTRICT CARBOHYDRATE (as I suggest) AND KETONES MAKE THE KIDNEYS WASTE SALT LIKE THE NOUVEAU RICHE.  Bring chickpeas if being low-carb means you can't eat enough to get a semblance of nutrition.  Pick some oblivious large fish up out of the water and put it in a tank on the boat. Then hit it across the neck with a goddamn ice scraper or something sharp enough to decapitate an animal.  #Option 2 - Keep the morals.  You still need a boat and all the supplies I mentioned in Opt 1 (nuts, beans, coconut, fortified N-yeast for cobalamin), but this time it's to launch yourself off for diving (get a physician to clear you for this one). You're looking for algae, not fish.  That might be impractical. There are commercially available DHA/EPA supplements derived from microalgae, although I don't know what the prices would be and you'd need to megadose. If you go this route, you don't need a boat, but you DO still need all of the supplies (nuts, beans, coconut, FNY, chickpeas if you find low carb suppresses your appetite too much, salt and water). You'll very much want to add in   Your brain needs nutrients after 15 years of veganism and 12 years of patent anorexia nervosa. You need to refeed slowly because chronic anorexia puts the body in a deeply fasted state, from which a huge bolus of carbs and protein could kill you.  You also need to live outside (if you successfully avoid omega-6 fats) so you get enough vitamin D3. I am not kidding about this. If you don't practically live outside in a UV-transparent tent, you will not get any cholecalciferol because you won't get any in a diet lacking meat, and cholecalciferol deficiency causes rickets.
