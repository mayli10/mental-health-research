If you wanted any other options.   Good luck.",False,False

I use it at home so my roommate doesn't notice if I purge and so far I think it's been working (she would definitely tell me if she noticed and she hasn't yet)!  I am paranoid so I'll spray the toilet before and after purging and also spray some toilet paper a bit and wipe down the seat with that but I think you only need to spray a few times before for it to work. ,False,False
