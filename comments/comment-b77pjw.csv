OP: I have serious impulse control issues - binging/restricting are symptoms of it. I went through a shoplifting phase in high school ... my boyfriend at the time started asking me to do it for him as a way to control me, and I quickly ended up shoplifting for myself and almost exclusively would steal clothing that was one size or two too small because I knew the shame of it would ‚Äúinspire‚Äù me to restrict more. I felt so disgusted with myself it was a weird motivator to lose more and more and fit into whatever I took so that the shame I felt for stealing wouldn‚Äôt go to waste.   I wish I had gotten help for impulse issues an earlier age, because even now after therapy/CBT and more self awareness I struggle (I‚Äôm 29 now). I have a very difficult time putting down food or drinks once I start so end up either binging or restricting both instead of balancing, I struggle with constant shopping/impulse purchasing, and even though I am deeply in love with my husband I still have a really hard time staying faithful (and have had several stumbles - I can‚Äôt see myself as sexy or attractive or worthy enough for him, so I end up seeking validation from others).   I say all this not to try and diagnose you, shame you, or say/imply that you will also struggle with the same types of issues as I do, but that shoplifting + binging can be symptoms of larger impulse issues than can spiral. As others have mentioned, you should really try talking to someone and seeking out support ....even if it‚Äôs just posting to this sub every now and then when you feel like you need some support. You shouldn‚Äôt be ashamed because you clearly want to stop and you‚Äôre brave for admitting this. Thinking of you, bb üñ§. ",False,False

They come from similar parts of the brain. Maybe try to go shopping with a friend, or accept that you're going to binge and just bring your money. I know it feels bad and wrong, but in the long run, gaining a little weight is better than getting arrested. I've been on the verge of shop lifting twice and each time I feel so much relief when I just scan the item and actually pay for it . best of luck, and i really hope you can overcome this.

It's a downward spiral that only gets worse. It started out small - a chocolate bar here and there - but I started stealing more often and more per trip. Then I started stealing from my employer because I knew where the cameras couldn't see.  I worked at a grocery store for six years and loss prevention held tabs on a *lot* of people who presumably thought they were getting away with it. Truth is that employees start to notice when the same person keeps coming to the store with a bag or a large winter coat and buying nothing or very little. Even if you've got a ""foolproof"" system you'll eventually get complacent.  I quit when the fear of getting caught became overwhelming - several of my coworkers were getting caught stealing and the police was getting bulk notified of frequent shoplifters. I honestly don't know why I never got caught but still to this day, even though I stopped shoplifting years ago, I get mad anxiety whenever I go to a store. Like I make sure to never put my hands in my pockets and if I happen to enter a store with a backpack I genuinely start getting dizzy and sweating. Going alone to a store just to browse is terrifying to me.  If you can find the strength to stop, please please please do. Or seek help from someone you trust. This is an awful habit that can be so hard to break.",False,False

Hopefully it wouldn‚Äôt come to that and someone would be able to help you so that you can stop before it gets out of hand. ",False,False
