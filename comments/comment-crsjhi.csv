A lot of people think in terms of, ""if x pounds looks skinny on this person, then it must be a low weight and thus, anyone weighing x pounds is skinny and anyone who is skinny weighs x pounds"". If that even makes sense lol",False,False

My parents said stuff like that when I entered treatment—they assumed I was literally 20-30 lbs lighter! I guess the good news is that people are idiots and maybe we look lighter or something idk. People are dumb don’t listen to them,False,False
