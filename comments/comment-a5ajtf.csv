Everything bagel seasoning. It's great on salads, beans, toast, bagels. I occasionally just sprinkle some into my hand eat that as a snack haha.  They also do a blueberry lavender almond drink that is heaven cold, or a few teaspoons in black tea. It's about 60 cal for 8oz, I think. ",False,False

They have an organic wine &amp; a regular ($3.99 or $2.99). The $2.99 is just as good or better. Plus my SO &amp; I are kind of wine snobs and we both prefer the $2.99 Trader Joe’s cab to say $8.99-11.99 bottles  I was trying to think of all of my Trader Joe’s favorites.. if I think of any more I’ll let you know  There are a few seasonal..  Pumpkin &amp; cranberry crisps (w/ the crackers. 11 For 90 calories. They have other flavors right now that I haven’t tried but those were amazing around thanksgiving),False,False
