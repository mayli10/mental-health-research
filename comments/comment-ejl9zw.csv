I think they use ed ways and thinking without realising way more often than they would like to admit. and yeah they are not as healthy as they think that's for sure. especially all the fasting stuff and omad smells like ed. on the other hand I also think a lot of people have some disordered eating but on the other side - I mean not restrictive. when I look around at how people eat it's ridiculous. I haven't heard about this spectrum of eds until I looked it up like a year ago and I believe there are many with issues but as you said, it's so taboo to talk about ed (and mental health generally) because you get so much shit for wanting to lose weight.. like I feel dieting must be a secret regardless of if it's full blown ed or some minor healthy changes because you get lynched either way. idk if this even makes sense I'm pretty tired.. I hope I get the point across :)",False,False
