I don’t drink huge quantities, just a few cans or whatever to make me less aware of how shit things are. I’m small too so I don’t need a lot to much to end up MWI.",False,True

See I hate potatoes out of chip and crisp form, I just don’t do the kinda sandy texture of baked/mashed/ roast but for some reason chips are the exception. I’ve only ever met nice Canadians (I only know a handful which probably explains it). Also I don’t imagine we’re going to be in Britain much longer which is probably for the best.  Thanks, I probably could but I just like a bit of chemical induced escapism, as bad as it is. One day I’d like to be sober but I’m (ahem, an addict) not ready to try and recover yet. Trying to drink less but it’s not going too well lol. Mostly so I get fewer calories but I guess? Win some you lose some?  Oh well.",False,True

And so I think poutine (chips and gravy with cheesecurds) needs to be hanged.  Aren't there treatments you can go on to stop the ol' monthlies?,False,False

Is it alright to talk about that here?  Seeing someone speak about crisps is a mite jarring because I have been in Canada for 7 of my nearly 20 years. Here it's chips and fries, not crisps and chips. I split the difference; it's crisps and fries to me.",False,False
