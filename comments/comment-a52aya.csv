I may have lost them anyway, it was complicated. But the other night I re lived in a dream a ski trip we took when I was 19. We were both chunky but fit, drinking shitty beer and eating timbits out in the cold with no fucks given. Imagine [these guys](https://images.mentalfloss.com/sites/default/files/styles/mf_image_16x9/public/hoser.png?itok=oxRThxDN&amp;resize=1100x1100), only female, lol. Woke up in tears. My heart's still broken. Living with this illness is a reminder every day of how it's hurt people around me. ",False,False

So I used said body to get laid a lot over the summer... and then I relapsed, lost my libido again... and for what? Even if being a little lower made me more hot (it hasn't), no point if I have zero interest. The most beautiful woman in the world could come on to me and I'd feel nothing :( ",False,False

I just had no sex drive whatsoever, probably from my low weight and (then untreated) depression. It would come back when I ate more, but I would never want to after eating for fear of looking 'fat'. It got to the point that even when we did have sex, I could barely enjoy it because I was so ashamed of how I looked. ",False,False
