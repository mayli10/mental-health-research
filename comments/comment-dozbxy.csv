I just started trying to do yoga yesterday, I bought a mat and started watching a lot of videos and reading on it. I‚Äôm hoping to ease myself back into exercising and give myself something else to do. I don‚Äôt know if yoga is something you would try but the mats are like $6 or maybe you could ease yourself into another at-home form of exercise first?",False,False

Personally it also kills my appetite, so I focus on that neat perk. Like working out isn‚Äôt hard. I do like it. And it‚Äôs not like I have to do it for hours. I can go and run for 15 minutes. Whatever.   Like I dunno. It‚Äôs kind of a do it or don‚Äôt thing to me. Like do I want those things? Yes? Then go do it. I just kind of robotically put on workout clothes and leave. I just don‚Äôt think about it. Thinking about it is what gets me out of the ‚Äúworking out will be good!‚Äù Mindset. And once I‚Äôm in the routine it‚Äôs just natural.
