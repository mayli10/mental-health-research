Eat your first meal as late as possible. I'm talking 5pm if you have to! Window shop? Go visit the animal shelter. Dont eat when you first wake up. Just stay in bed as much as you can, get up , shower, clothes and go out the door. If you dont wanna leave your house, do something super productive that will take up a lot of your time like cleaning your whole house or knitting a fucking sweater. If you feel like you need something in your stomach, water, diet coke, tea. Anything 0 calorie. Postpone, postpone,  postpone. Save all your cals for dinner so that you can make it a big one and be full. ",False,False

Usually lunch around 12-1  Get out of the house about an hour or 2 later &amp; stay out til 5 ish to where I can’t eat. Then it’s almost time to make dinner  Cook dinner, eat with my SO &amp; kids. Drink some wine or beer. *some times* take Tylenol PM so I won’t stay up too late. Usually I’ve had a small enough amount of calories that I can eat a bit for a late snack without it ruining my calorie plans for the day. Sleep and try to wait til 12 or 1 again to eat   I’ve noticed it’s way easier to binge/ keep eating when I’ve already eaten for the day. I try to push my first meal back as late as possible",False,False
