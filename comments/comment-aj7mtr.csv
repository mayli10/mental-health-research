I’ve noticed when I’m eating more regularly my heart beat is higher (71ish) and when I’m restricting it drops (low 60s). That’s to be expected but I would be concerned because of your other symptoms. Heart issues are very common with EDs so it’s better to be safe than sorry! Please go to the doctor if you can!,False,False
