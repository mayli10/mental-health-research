Itâ€™s horrible. Donâ€™t let your anger against her turn into hate of yourself, then youâ€™re helping her win. You can defeat her by being strong and surviving. By eventually becoming independent and successful in your own right youâ€™ll defeat her, and show her that the abuse she showed you was futile    Stay strong and angry. Find a path.",False,False

You have so many days ahead of you, and they will hopefully be happier as you walk along the path of recovery. Some days will be hard like today was, but as long as you keep pushing forward, they will happen less and less.  And when you say that you don't have anything to keep fighting for, you need to remember that you do, and you said it at the very beginning of your post. You have your health, you have the people who love you, you have yourself, and you have an amazing future that you need to keep working towards.  Me and everyone else who commented on this post believe in you, and believe that you can get better, so please believe in yourself for us.ðŸ’•",False,False

Listen to what you want. You said you don't want to relapse, so keep fighting. You're worth it. Don't harm yourself on their behalf.   It's worth fighting for yourself. And, if fighting for yourself isn't enough for you in this moment, I'm sure all of us in this community want you to get better. Again, you're worth it and you said yourself you don't want to relapse.   I'm so sorry you have to deal with an abusive mother; I know the feeling. You're not alone.",False,False
