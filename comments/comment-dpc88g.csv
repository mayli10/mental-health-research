I never have to use laxatives, because I literally just shit water. I donâ€™t know why itâ€™s like this, maybe itâ€™s because Iâ€™m morbidly obese (maybe? Iâ€™m not quite sure what causes this when I restrict). Idk. I like to think that Iâ€™m literally shitting out liquid fat, but thatâ€™s hopeful thinking :(",False,False

It sounds like you cut out a lot of carbs. Dairy is also often a good probiotic source.  Personally my restricting has caused nausea, bloating, abdominal pain, occasional constipation (*not frequently, just when I don't get enough fiber*), and other symptoms not linked to my GI system.   It seems that I can't fix the GI symptoms though. Gaining weight made me more sick and no amount of healthy eating seems to fix it. Most medications barely help if at all. I can get some temporary relieve from the pain with CBD oil, but that stuff is expensive. I had to go for the lowest dose available to make it affordable. $20 for a vial that supposedly might last me a month. The recommended dose was over $100 for the same-sized vial. ^(Maybe it was just recommended because it costs more. ðŸ¤”) But a drop of the one I got only gave me an hour of relief. A second drop then did last longer, but it still doesn't help with my other symptoms.",False,False
