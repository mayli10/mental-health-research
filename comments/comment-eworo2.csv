Not just life experience but also academically. Feel really uncomfy giving advice to other people though, don’t want to ruin anyone’s life by accidentally making them turn out like me lol.",False,False

When I have a huge bowl of something with really low calorie density, my parents are always like 'wow! Your going to have ALL of that just for lunch??'.

My mom KNOWS I have an eating disorder and was shocked when I ate a caesar salad with very limited dressing. She was like,  ""I don't know where she puts it""  My giant bowl of leaves had half the calories of your pizza.

Doesnt mean I have one.   Like eating- getting proper nutrients to fuel my mind and body. Eating well is about making yourself feel better and not punishing myself. Making healthy choices helps my body function well. Seeing foods as good and bad isn't a healthy mindset.   Exercise is about celebrating what my body can do. It's also a way to keep my mind focused and maintaining mental health (or preventing it from getting much worse). Exercise shouldn't be all about burning calories and punishing myself for eating.   So many people without EDs are exercise as part of a weight loss formula, not something to enjoy. They see eating 'bad' foods as naughty instead of allowing themselves to just enjoy something that tastes good every once in a while. They think salads are strictly diet foods, why eat them unless you're trying to lose weight? They pick foods based solely on calorie counts and not on what they enjoy. Not saying these are inherently bad or ineffective for losing weight, but it's not a great relationship when you focus on food and exercise as a form of punishment for your choices.   I'm also not saying I don't do this, just that I'm very aware of what is an unhealthy mindset.",False,True

If only.   People think exercise causes weight loss, but you really can't burn that many calories. Like running 4 miles, I'll burn MAYBE 300 Calories.

Like, am I ever going to personally get there? We'll never know, but I literally feel like... a physical urge to correct people sometimes that I have to hold myself back from because ""wait, they'll realize I'm Disordered (TM).""
