What’s done is done and what’s won is won and what’s lost is lost and gone for ever. All that’s left for me to say is push on and don’t look back. For now, be selfish and look after You. Except the growth &amp; knowledge from the experience and live.",False,False

He ended up breaking up with me because he said I was being too crazy and I've been feeling really shitty about myself because I felt like it was my fault I was too insecure. I've realized now that he's just too young (20) and probably didn't know how to care for someone like me. I guess we just weren't fit for each other.   I'm glad to say that I'm much happier now and much more Zen. I'm also doing better than I ever have in school!,False,True

Any one of that tells you that you are crazy to have x emotion deserves an instant yeet out of your live. Your emotions matter and deserve to be addressed.,False,False

If he's with you then he shouldn't be after all these other girls.

Yes, Greek life expands your social scene and if he was just meeting new friends it's another story (he already knows all the guys at the party so the only new friends to meet would be women).   But using parties as an excuse to grow your list of insta eye candy, especially if he made it clear to you that he was following them for their looks, is not cool.   I'm sorry you had to deal with this, especially when he knew you were in a delicate place. Glad he's your ex.  There are good men out there and you deserve the love a healthy relationship brings.",False,False

Not two created the same. As varied as the animals that populate the jungle, the fish that swim the sea and the birds that fly the skies.   Men are merely flesh and bone. Cursed like all people with joy-sadness, anger-fear, trust-distrust, surprise-anticipation. Removed from nature facing ever changing science, economics, art and religion.  Or maybe men are born without souls and we have to earn them. Maybe that's where Man's problems lie. The extent or degree to which each man has earned his soul.....",False,False

First, I hope your life has become a little bit more Zen and you have had the chance to return to your studies or employment and a more holistic balanced life. I hope you’re working your victories and understanding your losses. Fulfilling your life arc.   I read your post above. I can only speak from my perspective and equate your comments to my own personal experiences.   You’re not “fucking crazy” what your boyfriend did seems like a breach of trust. The fact he is now your EX BF seems to show that you as person brought the relationship to an end. I know now you feel like you acted irrationally. You were pushed to it by disorderly thoughts and the sense of being fucking crazy, but it sounds like you looked at the facts. You Stepped back looked at the relationship. You asked yourself what standard you hold yourself to in the relationship (“I'd personally never meet a cute guy at a party and search them up on IG later because that just feels really wrong??”) Decided to end the relationship.   If the support wasn’t there in the relationship. If you were “literally cry every night because I couldn't cope with the weight gain.” The support you needed wasn’t there then relationship would have only gotten worse.   I know it can be scary when you’re recovering. Decisions, emotions and instincts are second guessed. Its recovery life vs your old life vs what you thought your future would be and what it might be.   Look above is only my opinions. I don’t know the full story. Does it really matter assigning blame? Right now, all that matters is for you to heal.  Hope my words helped. Its good to rant.",False,False
