I went thorugh a breakup during the summer, we klicked so well, he seemed so sweet and willing to invest time etc in me, I fell flat like a fool. And on top of that it was a guy that told me he was totaly serious. What my dumb ass didn't realize was that I was nothing but a rebound. I sleep for almost a week striaght after that breakup no joke, I barely moved i was feeling so down.   But then I realized, I'm not even sad, I'm fucking ANGRY. Like proper MAD. And honestly, you should be too. Be angry and be grateful because usually when they do you dirty like this, you've dodged a bullet.   Baby girl your worth lies only in yourself and not in the way others decide to treat you, so do not let that affect you. It's easy to stress over exes (I did too) and all that fun stuff, but in the end you have you, and you are worth more than a rebound. Try your darn best to take all this energy and put it into something that matters to you (I took all my rage and strated studyng for my exams like CRAZY).   Further more I have decided that screw it if I don't find the right guy. Sure I want to get married but not to someone I can't stand living the rest of my life with. In that case I'd rather just in vitro that ish, have my kids and live my damn life. My point is, feel free to join my post-breakup-I-hate-guys-in-vitro club.",False,False

She‚Äôs known and known is comfortable. If he was in love with her he will grasp at that straw if she said she‚Äôs changed. That is all.    There‚Äôs an episode of the Orville where a character gets broken up with because she‚Äôs going back to her ex boyfriend and he says, ‚Äúthat‚Äôs the point of being in a relationship in the first place, right?

You're better than that and better than him.   I had a new boyfriend a while ago who I was instantly comfortable with and who I really thought I would be with a long time. He did the exact same thing to me, the minute his ex asked for him back he was gone.   I pummeled myself with all sorts of negative thoughts but then a friend told me there's a thing that people do where they are still so attached to their last relationship that they crave the same thing and act like the new person they are with is basically the same person as the person they broke up with.  He had never accepted that they had broken up and instead just treated me like I was her. That included the total trust and familiarity of having been together for longer.  That arse made me feel like we had known each other for ever and that we were super comfortable together where as actually I was just a place holder for his ex until she came back.",False,False

You are probably gorgeous. My partner and I broke up at one point and I just never stopped loving him during it and we ended up getting back together. It‚Äôs their past emotional closeness and history that brought them back together not that she is prettier than you. I‚Äôm sorry though that‚Äôs such a sad situation to be in :( I sympathize with you üíï,False,False
