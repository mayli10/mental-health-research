Don't be afraid of salt! As long as you stay within recommended daily limits, it shouldn't make you bloat. Adequate salt helps prevent low blood pressure, which is what's making you pass out/get light headed.  One more thing I do is always stand slowly if I've been sitting for a while and avoid locking my knees when I stand up to make sure the blood makes it up to my brain.  Hope you feel better soon!",False,False
