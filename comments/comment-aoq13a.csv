I'm salty af that I wouldn't feel comfortable posting to progresspics because I don't want to condone unhealthy weight loss because ya boi has lost ~75 pounds in 6 months and gone from a BMI of 32 to a BMI of 21.5. I could be getting so many sweet sweet upvotes and validating comments about how good and healthy I look but NOOOOO my stupid morals are keeping me from doing that.  My house is absolutely freezing because my mom refuses to turn the heat up past 67 degrees because she's cheap as hell, even though we're both cold. My OMAD today includes two half pints of low cal frozen desserts which means I'm about to get out of my warm bed, where a space heater is blowing directly on my face, and put on the following: two pairs of socks, long underwear, insulted fleece pants, a t-shirt, a long sleeve thermal underlayer shirt, a long sleeve fleece shirt, a hoodie, and a beanie, just so I can go eat my damn dinner and not be shivering. THAT'S FOUR SHIRTS. AND I MIGHT PUT A COAT ON TOP OF IT. I HATE THIS HOUSE.   What a goddamn power move on my mom's part to fuck with my body image and put me on restrictive diets as a child and then when I hit the worst ED restriction phase of my life, refuse to turn the heat up no matter how much I beg because my fingernails are literally turning blue.  I can fit into women's size 6 jeans and medium tops now (I was somewhere around a 16-18 and 1-2x at my SW/HW and had gotten to a point where I shopped exclusively in the plus sizes). I was powerwalking at the mall to get my steps in earlier because apparently this ED has turned me into one of those old people who walks laps around the mall for exercise (but it's 30 degrees and windy af outside and that 15,000 step goal isn't going to be met outside in those fucking conditions) and as I walked past clothing stores I had the realization that I could walk into any of the traditional size stores and find clothing that fit me. I wouldn't have to stick exclusively to Torrid and the junior's plus section of JCPenney. Any fucking store will sell me size 6 pants and medium shirts. At this point, my struggle with buying men's clothes will now be getting shirts that are small enough since I've lost basically all of my boobs and my hips are pretty narrow, or finding pants that fit over my legs because I have hella runner's calves. I'm not calling myself thin by any stretch of the imagination but is this what thin privilege feels like? I've spent most of my life overweight/obese since I hit puberty and this is absolutely fucking wild.",False,False

I don't want him to get used to it, because now that I'm done with the homestay part of traveling and don't have to eat, I'm hardcore restricting.
