I legit just want something like Facebook but for ED users. I'm always worried well lose our Reddit, the Reddit alternative is barely used, MPA is hard to use on my phone and I don't like the peach format. I also feel like it's all so impersonal, you know?

I hate how you need to go on other sites to find people to follow on peach, and it makes it feel really pointless. It would be much better if you could just search by topic. I donâ€™t like the set up either.",False,False
