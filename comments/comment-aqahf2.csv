I still ignore it and it hasn't repeated in a while. Unfortunately it did happen once with my friends over, scared them really good but they were pretty rational about it, and told me to do some blood work.  I'm not 100% sure it's eating related for me, had a close call at work after few days of moderately healthy eating. But other times it was combination of drugs, lack of sleep and terrible diet, I think at least. ",False,False

I fainted last week from a combination of these. The advice I can give is to keep your electrolytes in balance with small meals, water, or pedialyte. Definitely rest your body after any sort of seizure or fainting episode and try not to exercise same day because it can affect your blood pressure and blood sugar causing it to happen again. When we put our bodies through ED behaviors they take a little longer to return to homeostasis when things like this happen, so even if you’ve eaten, it might still take time for your body/brain to bounce back! Any sort of seizure or loss of consciousness can potentially lead to mental impairment if you don’t care for yourself afterwards so definitely keep some sort of fluid and sodium intake! Keep an extra eye on yourself for a few days just in case, and give yourself permission to rest for the sake of your brain.    Again, only speaking from personal experience so if anyone has any medical experience pls chime in! Much love xxx",False,False
