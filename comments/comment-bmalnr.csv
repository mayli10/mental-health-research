Look at any(most)dairy label at the grocery store, it will say ""from cows raised without rbst""  (marketing pointed at a certain type of consumer) and then it will say something about how the fda claims it is safe anyway.  https://www.fda.gov/animal-veterinary/product-safety-information/bovine-somatotropin-bst  HOWEVER   I don't necessarily think added hormones are great, and I try to buy dairy/meat products labeled ""raised without added hormones/antibiotics"" (antibiotic use in livestock is more concerning to me then the hormones)   Sorry, at first I was upset with your comment because I felt it was a derail of the conversation, bu half way through my thought processes I realized you were not being preachy like I first perceived and this really is a conversation worth having, because the fact is there is not definitive proof and as consumers we should be looking out for our health.",False,False

It seems clear to me that there's no direct connection to diet, skincare regimes, etc. There are things you can do to make the best of your skin, but some people are genetically blessed and others are just not.  Nothing wrong with eating healthy or tinkering with your diet in an effort to help your skin look its best, but that doesn't in any way make it your fault if your acne persists.",False,False

Think about it, we're drinking what is essentially breast milk intended to help grow a baby cow? Anyway, the research here is not conclusive ([two](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15692464) [studies](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15692464)), but it seems based on a solid hypothesis.  As a teenager with acne back when these studies were published, I gave a lot of thought to the question of why some of my friends could eat whatever they wanted and never wash their face and still have perfectly clear skin. Do I think eating better (less processed food, less sugar, and yes, less dairy) as a teenager might have helped me? Definitely. But is diet the actual cure? Probably not, I think it's more likely a multifactorial issue.",False,False

My skin honestly broke out regularly until just recently, so ages 14-19 for me. Now, I rarely ever get any acne, which literally means it was hormones causing acne. I feel like teenagers are too pressured to look a certain way, especially when it comes to skin and having a ""skin care routine"" that probably won't help because they are going through major bodily changes :/",False,False

I remember when everybody thought fatty/greasy foods were what caused acne (as if grease in your stomach -&gt; oil on your face or something, lol). A few years ago everybody starting blaming dairy. Now with the keto craze, everybody's blaming sugar.  The thing is, food does affect hormones, and most acne is hormone-related, but it's just not as simple as people make it out to be. I think you're right that the age when most girls start getting acne (and the age they're most likely to be mocked for it) is also the age when they are most vulnerable to developing food issues, and that's a dangerous combo.",False,False
