Just food after food after food. If I restrict long enough without allowing some maintenance days I‚Äôll end up having a legitimate binge. They‚Äôre pretty nuts, honestly. And painful. I do not recommend lol",False,False

Well I guess it doesn't matter I'm still fucked up either way. I don't think it's a binge either I mean it only takes about 10min to ingest 1000 cals of junk and generally people binge for a long period. Plus I plan it out and enjoy it, I don't just go on autopilot or whatever happens when people binge.",False,True

Atypical anorexia sub purging disorder is a thing. Or just a general EDNoS situation.   ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è I‚Äôm not a professional though so I‚Äôm not the one who can give you a final answer. I just know the definition of binging is vastly different than what you‚Äôve stated you go through.",False,False

A mindless consumption of a large volume of food- as in, *thousands* of calories in one shot. Like 2k, 3k, 4k+. And then purging it. Often rinsing/repeating in one session.   Purging disorder is just as you described. You ate it? You purge it. You don‚Äôt binge. Like *actually* binge.",False,False
