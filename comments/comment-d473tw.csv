As it turns out, when you lose weight you just keep your same shape only smaller. So my legs still look pretty short and stumpy and there is no way I can just pull off wearing amazing skinny jeans without looking like a dork. And so of course my eating disorder tells me that if I lose even more weight I will finally be able to look awesome. And so the cycle repeats.",False,False

So you either regress back to a place where you feel shitty enough about yourself that it kicks your ass into gear again or you recalibrate and find new motivations that give you better momentum.        I found it very relatable!",False,False
