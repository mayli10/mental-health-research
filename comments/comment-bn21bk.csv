There is no tradition of real talks in our family, my parents seem a bit afraid of that.   That's true and I know she wanted to help. At the start I felt extremely in rage, but I've never unloaded it on her.   I'll try to come back on track, thanks for kind words.",False,True

It’s good that you recognize that your mom was simply worried about you and thinking that she was trying to help you even if her approach was misguided.   Have you ever described what it feels like when you have an unsafe food to her? People who don’t have eating disorders cannot imagine the panic that comes with it.   Also you should tell your mom what you need from her. I understand this is very hard; I feel like a burden when I express my needs or ask for support. But clearly your mom wants to help you.  You just need to tell her HOW to help you, so that she has an avenue to meet you halfway at. Imagine the panic your mother feels watching her daughter waste away, how helpless she feels watching you struggle. She must have been feeling desperate to try to sneak calories into your food like that. If she knew what would actually help you recover, she wouldn’t need to be sneaky about it.   Wishing you strength and healing. Please be kind to yourself.",False,False

There was a lot of this in treatment- they'd tell us there was no butter/oil/etc or just refuse to tell us what was in the food altogether (which was VERY problematic for people with dairy insensitivities such as myself). How does anyone expect us to recover when we can't trust those upon whom we're supposed to depend?",False,False
