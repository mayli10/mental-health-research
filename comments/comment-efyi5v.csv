It’s hard enough to wake up and say “Im going to wear something nice today” without being slapped by clothes I thought would look amazing not even fitting when I bought them a couple months ago.,False,True

I bought pants in size 34 and were like “oh, now I really have to make sure I don’t eat too much so they don’t fit”. Now they’re too big and look ugly as heck.",False,False

Especially since it's so cold out rn where I live so my frozen ass layers up multiple sweaters and a jacket indoors with just leggings for pants. The resemblance between me and Gru from Despicable Me is uncanny,False,False

This happened to me and so I bought new clothes that fit but now I feel too fat in them so I don’t want to wear them either. So my options are wear the too big clothes and feel fat bc they’re baggy or wear the clothes that fit and feel fat bc they’re not baggy enough. Wtf.,False,False
