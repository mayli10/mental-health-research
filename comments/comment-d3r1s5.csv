I’m so so so fucking sorry this happened to you. Most cities and large towns have crisis centers where you can go in anonymously and talk to someone. You’re not alone. But please talk to someone if you can, even if it’s just us here on this sub to check in with how you’re coping.   These things can follow you. Do you have a friend or community resource you can talk to?   If you’re in the US, [RAINN ](https://www.rainn.org/about-national-sexual-assault-telephone-hotline) can help. Call 800-656-4673 or visit the site for text/email options. If you can, I urge you to not keep this inside.   ❤️❤️❤️❤️",False,False
