I always refuse to be weighed and tell them I’m 110 (the minimum healthy weight for my height) when asked.   I didn’t find that going to a traditional doc helped my GI problems at all, but I’ve been working with a holistic gastroenterologist and I’ve made a lot of progress! I can give you the name of my doctor if you’re interested (he does phone consults + email correspondence).",False,False

Your doctor is there to help you not judge you or make you feel bad. I would just be honest. You could ask them not to weigh you, but if your having GI issues that could also be connected to your weight. I know it's scary, but it will be better to go to the doctor and get it figured out. Good luck. ",False,False
