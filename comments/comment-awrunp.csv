And when i stopped they stopped. I never went to the doctor for it or really sought out if it was true but its pretty possible. And in the end when i stopped with the laxatives there was no change in my weight when i kept up the other ed habits. Makes me mad i wasted so much money on them.,False,False

I think the problem is when you take them often enough that your body becomes reliant on them (not the same as needing them because of constipation).",False,False
