If you don't have written records of things, your memory could be altering it a bit (as you are human and this is what happens). Could even be something small, like you used to drink more coffee back then/did different type of exercise/were weighing yourself more or less/etc  Also, your body's response to things can change over time- for instance, I never used to bloat, but then I developed IBS and now bloat like hell from restriction/certain foods/stress/planetary alignment. If you have more muscle mass than you used to, you'll be more prone to water retention, which will cause scale weight plateau/bigger fluctuations. If you have less muscle, your metabolic rate could actually be slower. Etc.",False,False
