I hate this so much as a nutrition professional because people assume I'm going to jump on board with their pseudoscience and nutrition extremism.   Side story: I once had a boss who was trying to lose weight, but he was used to eating out a lot and drinking daily. He knew I was finishing my nutrition degree, so he asked for some advice. I told him to try and make a small change such as not salting his meals, going every other day without drinking, or working on portion sizes, but he didn't think that would help him. He decided he needed a diet with no carbohydrates, no alcohol, and calorie counting to succeed despite the fact that he didn't know the basics about nutrition, cooking, or balancing a meal. This diet would restart over and over and over, and the weight cycling ultimately caused him to gain weight. I wouldn't be surprised if he was still in this sad cycle.",False,False

I'm in a group chat of five including myself, and they're all my best friends. My closest of that bunch has disordered eating (not diagnosed) so she is as quiet as I am, but two others are doing keto and the other talks about wanting to do keto and cut calories.  Then I've got tons of people on my Facebook or that I talk to occasionally (okay, not tons, maybe like four people) who have posted about being x weight and wanting to be x weight or finally reaching x weight loss goal. Most of these numbers are lower than mine so my stupid brain has to be a competitive asshole.  I want to be supportive of those changing lifestyles in a healthy way or whatever, and I know this makes me a dick, but it's so disheartening when I'm eating a child's portion a day and they're at a lower number than I am.  Also, it's boring as hell to discuss the in-depths of diets like keto, ngl.",False,False

It's literally the most boring thing you can talk about.
