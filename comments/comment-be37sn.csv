I gained weight. I’m weight restored now. I miss having my BMI be in the low 15s but I’m trying to focus on the perks of being weight restored. The binges have stopped. The binges were bad. 10,000 calories was a normal binge day, I could probably go higher if the “binge-day” started in the morning. I would often have a few 5-10k days in a row. I was in a pretty bad binge phase after a prolonged period of restriction.   I still binge occasionally but they’re so much better and less frequent. And I have a history of BED prior to the onset of AN. It’s scary, but it will stop. You’ll feel like you’ll never be able to stop eating and that you’ll eat your way into obesity. I know this a bit morbid, but I was getting prepared to kill myself because I genuinely thought I would never be able to stop eating and I couldn’t cope with living like that.    It stops. It does get better. This is common after a period of restriction especially if you are underweight. Breathe. Remember to breathe, I wish I did that more often.",False,False

I've taken breaks where I've maintained and did intuitive eating, and for two weeks I'm never not hungry. I eat and eat and eat and generally gain 3 to 5 lbs, but after that my hunger stabilizes out into normal maintenance (I'm hungry when I need to eat and full when I don't). The first few weeks feel awful but I promise after a while your body remembers hunger and fullness cues and it's easier to resist binges.   &amp;#x200B;  I wish I could follow my own advice because I genuinely feel better mentally and physically at those times, but my ED is centered around me and my incessant control issues. hooray /s.",False,False
