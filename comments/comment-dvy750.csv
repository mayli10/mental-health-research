I guess?) &gt;!1500cal!&lt;, so before grocery shopping I go to Chipotle and get the exact same order every time, cause it's abt 100 cal above that, give or take 200ish probably. I haaaaaate eating that much, but it's quite literally the only thing that keeps me from buying heaps of binge food. Other food doesn't seem to work, regardless of whether it's from a restaurant or if I make it at home. I don't know why...? Maybe it's cause Chipotle always makes me feel suuuper sick afterward, idk. ^^^^As ^^^^a ^^^^bonus, ^^^^Chipotle ^^^^always ^^^^makes ^^^^me ^^^^shit ^^^^my ^^^^brains ^^^^out ^^^^the ^^^^next ^^^^day, ^^^^so ^^^^it's ^^^^basically ^^^^trendy ^^^^laxative ^^^^abuse  If you're interested in my ""guaranteed to make you queasy"" meal, it's:  \- **Burrito bowl**   \- **A double order of rice, one brown, one white** (rice makes me *real* fuckin full) [&gt;!345!&lt; total cal]   \- **Black beans** [&gt;!120!&lt; cal]   \- **Sofritas** (the double rice usually makes them give you a bit extra of whatever protein you get, so I count it was a double order) [&gt;!290!&lt; cal]   \- **Double fajita veggies** (cause they scrumptious lil bitches) [&gt;!40!&lt; cal]   \- **All three salsas** (not the corn salsa cause it fuuucks w me) [&gt;!65!&lt; total cal]   \- **Guac** (I really like guac even tho it's high cal, plus avocados are apparently good for you and I can't stand them outside of guacamole form, so I figure I might as well get it when I go to Chipotle) [&gt;!230!&lt; cal]   \- **Chipsies** (high calorie, yes, but you can eat the burrito bowl like it's chip dip lmao. Plus, the chips kinda push it over the edge into ""aw fuck I'm *sick* full"" territory) [&gt;!540!&lt; cal]   **Total calorie count: &gt;!1630!&lt;**  What I like abt this is it can easily be modded to be a much lower calorie count. Like, making the rice a single serving (which also makes the protein into a single serving), cutting out the guac, and not getting chips pulls the order down to &gt;!700!&lt; cal, and it still makes me feel p Not Great afterward (I think it's cause it's really acidic? Idfk man maybe I just have a weak stomach lol)",False,False
