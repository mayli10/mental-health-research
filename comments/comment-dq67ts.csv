I have crazy (undiagnosed... for now) OCD around all sorts of weird stuff that logically doesn't make sense.   If I eat something 'bad' I won't sleep in my bed that night because I feel like I smell of the thing I have eaten and I don't want my bed to smell like that. I know it won't though, but I can't help it. I set up a camping mattress and a sleeping bag instead. SO DUMB!  So after the supermarket didn't have the specific chicken I usually get, not only did I binge but I also couldn't sleep in my bed. All because of a certain type of chicken. I still had chicken. I can't even.",False,False

I really hope they install those self-checkouts soon in your supermarket. Here in the Netherlands it is quite regular now, also it depends on the supermarket and size of your town.

It throws me right off.
