My husband runs about 20° warmer than me constantly. I just have like 5 electric blankets all over the house. We have a kind sized bed, and I have a twin sized electric blanket under the duvet on my side; i stay warm and it doesn’t transmit heat to him.  I also have non-LED string lights on the wall behind our bed and they warm up the space but not as much as a space heater. We compromise on the AC never being lower than 73°F and he uses fans if he gets really hot (my ideal temp when I lived alone was 80°).  I do keep a space heater under my desk in the winter, but I only run it when he’s not home.   Ha! People assuming roasted flesh isn’t comfortable 😏🙄😂",False,False

It just doesn’t work so well when it’s my live in boyfriend and he genuinely runs hot and I run cold - then we need to compromise 😊thanks for the ideas!!   Dumb story time: my uncle had a fire pit going and I was so toasty and happy, but his gf kept complaining that it was too hot (and I didn’t say anything after the first time, just replied once “I’m really enjoying it!) - so she waited until I got up and I hear her go “I’m just gonna turn it down a tad” and sure enough I basically had to submerge my arms in fire the rest of the night to stay warm.   She had the nerve to ask me why I was so close and I was like “well you turned the heat down” and she looked super ashamed lol. I don’t think she turned it down to make me cold on purpose- I have a weird reputation between her and my uncle as being the stupidly optimistic one while she’s the “Debby downer” so I think she thought I was just making lemons out of lemonade and not genuinely enjoying being roasted alive 🙄",False,True

The end. Haha.   I haven’t tried an IR heater. I just have a twin sized electric blanket that I keep at my desk. And a small space heater u see my desk. Idgaf that everyone thinks I’m bonkers using a blanket in the summer. The office is like 65° and imma get frostbite and die.,False,False
