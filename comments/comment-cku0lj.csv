I've heard this mentioned around, I think, but hadn't read it yet.  Not surprised by the paper tbh. Studies that directly measure keto against CICO, instead of an unchanged diet, have supported this for a while. But it's great to have something that focuses on the actual thermodynamic and biochemical processes related + potentially related to macronutrient manipulation. Instead of just observing results in humans, then leaving the question open of whether keto diets are just easier to accurately track + stick to for most folks than weighing every apple is.  I get why some people thought that carb-manipulative diets were just veganism 2.0, since they do inherently cut out food groups (and that inevitably factors into successful keto loss too!! let's be real!), but I'm glad they weren't right overall.  &gt; The implication of the first and second laws of thermodynamics is that reduced efficiency has precisely the same result as reduced caloric intake. One conceptually simple means of reducing efficiency involves the process of uncoupling in mitochondria.  There's something funny, but fucked up, about a bunch of scientists sitting around trying to figure out how we can be *less* effective at surviving on our food.  Meanwhile, on your left, you can see other nutritional scientists trying to figure out how to feed people *more effectively*.  Society is weird. Human problems are weird.  &gt; The essence of the second law of thermodynamics is that it guarantees inefficiency in all metabolic processes. However, variation of efficiency is not excluded. In fact, the laws of thermodynamics are silent on the existence of variable efficiency. If efficiency can vary (as in the example of oxidative uncoupling) then ""a calorie is a calorie"" is no longer a true statement. The role of uncoupling proteins in humans, as indicated, is as yet incompletely defined [10]. However, thermodynamic principles permit variable efficiency, and its existence must be determined empirically.  The more I read through their examples, the more this reads like the missing theoretical half that I've been wishing all of our can-we-hack-macronutrients-4-skinny empirical data had with it.  Thanks a ton for linking this again. This shit's the most educational chat I've ever had with someone named ButtJam. üëçüëçüëç",False,False
