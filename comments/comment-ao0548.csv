It's annoying and it makes me a bit panicky, but if you're not feeling other symptoms of oxygen deprivation it's pretty much harmless afaik. It usually goes away once I stop hypwrfocusing on manually breathing.",False,False

I was having similar problems a few years ago and ended up going to the doctor for it. She told me that I essentially hadn't ""reset"" after being in fight or flight mode after a stressful episode, and that's why I wasn't able to breathe properly. There's a name for it, but I can't remember what it's called now. She gave me breathing exercises to do, so maybe give some a shot and see if it helps? ",False,False

I have figured out that for me, it’s anxiety, which definitely gets worse when I restrict. Again, not sure if it’s the same for you, I just wanted to share my experience in case it was helpful. Either way, I’m sorry you’re feeling that way and if you need someone to chat with feel free to message me :’(",False,False
