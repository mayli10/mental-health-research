Is it something you *want* to value? What do you fear will happen if you gain weight? I realized I moralize thin bodies, and also that I assume everyone else does, so that if I have a larger body my friends/partners/family will think I'm bad/lazy/weak.

Have you read the intuitive eating book? Even though I don't do the whole smorgasbord, reading it helped me realize how my behaviors were leaching joy in little ways and encouraged me to pursue harm reduction. I realized feeling growly hunger isn't sustainable and if I want to lose weight I have to figure out a way to do it that doesn't make me grouchy and tired and dumb :P I highly recommend weighing less, helps so much with mood! I had to ask my partner to keep my scale in his car/apartment in order to achieve this, because willpower is a limited resource.",False,False

I‚Äôm trying to break myself of the habit of weighing myself daily because I‚Äôve been letting the number reflected back at me determine how my day is going to go, subconsciously. It‚Äôs not a good way to start every single day when weight naturally fluctuates here and there for any old reason. I‚Äôm hoping once I lose the weight I want to, to gradually begin increasing my calories. Right now I eat around 800 a day and it‚Äôs (surprise, surprise) causing me to have binge urges. My ‚Äúbinges‚Äù still fall under my TDEE, but still come with their fair share of guilt and stress, so finding a healthy amount of calories to eat per day and maintain is my end goal. I do try and eat out here and there. I‚Äôve tried to be up front about it with my ‚Äùkind of‚Äù partner and my therapist. I just refuse to eat intuitively because after a decade of trying it off and on, I whole heartedly don‚Äôt believe it works for me. It has encouraged cyclic behavior that I‚Äôm trying to break. So whether or not people think that I‚Äôm still living in terms of my eating disorder by hitting a goal weight and working to maintain it, I‚Äôm still living in terms of my ED by eating intuitively, and cycling back to restriction. I‚Äôm a very petite woman, so a small amount of weight gain is painfully noticeable and triggering for me.",False,True

I've never been underweight, or honestly anything less than solidly mid-range healthy BMI, so YMMV, but I have been tracking/restricting for about 15 years. My ""recovery"" has mainly focused on noticing the ways in which my ED behaviors/thoughts make me unhappy and take away from my life, and implementing small changes over time to minimize those negatives. This has looked like recognizing/choosing ""bumpers,"" which are like mini personal red flags that my ED is taking up too much space in my life. Some of my bumpers (ED fallout I'm unwilling to tolerate for long periods) include (1) hampering my work performance due to tiredness, obsessive thoughts, etc.; (2) impacting my relationships due to anxiety/moodiness, unwillingness to eat out, insecurity from body checks, desire to lie to my partners; (3) any sort of weight goal ""deadline"". Currently I do track, and aim for a small calorie deficit (300 cals/day) most days with one maintenance day per week and one maintenance week per month, weighing myself as little as possible (about once a month). This is working well for me right now because the relatively high calories (1700/day) mean I don't binge, and I trust that my weight won't go up based on my tracking/experience, but it gives me some of the accomplishment/control feelings I like without the negatives feelings from seeing daily weight fluctuations. I'd say the other big part of my recovery has been brainwashing myself with pretty pictures of plus size models and dressing myself well so I feel attractive at a relatively ""high"" weight.   I've done a couple stints of intuitive eating and maintained my weight (note that I'm on the high end of ""healthy BMI"" for my height), but I was also maintaining it while tracking/restricting. I've been at this weight for a couple years, so it seems like my body likes it/isn't fighting it.",False,False
