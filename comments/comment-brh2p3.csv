I’ve been there, and I know sometimes it can be hard, but don’t let moments like this define you. I know when I’m at that point I can let it consume me, but you’re so much more than your eating disorder.  If you can now, start looking into recovery, don’t wait until it gets worse. The first step is recognizing the problem, and that’s such a big step. And if you’re not ready yet that’s ok too. ❤️  Just remember you’re loved and you matter💜💜💜",False,False
