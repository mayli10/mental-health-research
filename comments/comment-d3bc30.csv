There is definitely a pattern, but we do have a lot of fun and I can communicate anything to her... or so I thought. I’ll probably end up apologizing to her for unloading and being a bad friend because I’m pathetic and alone. I can definitely acknowledge that there is an imbalance in effort. Maybe I need to give myself a break and take off the pressure of maintaining a friendship like this but then I’ll be totally friendless. I’m just venting now, thank you for your advice kind internet stranger.",False,True

Yeah, I started out here being like ""wtf that friend doesn't even make sense, why did she ghost you?"", but if you kept going with the history between yall...I get the feeling that a relevant horrible pattern of some sort would start to pop out.  I had a friend once who went on an aggressive warpath because I didn't answer his apology after *he* hurt me. Tbh it affected me more than the ex who thought it was funny to punch me in the face - because I was close with that person for *years*. I trusted them.   Abusive friendships are underratedly damaging and isolating.   Definitely make those new friends. If she gets jealous, that's her personal problem to work on. You're not her toy to put on a shelf when she's bored.  And if/when the relationship's over...5 years+ is a long time, and that's worth grieving. Even when the other person is controlling and selfish.",False,False

She messaged me today only because I was commenting back and forth with another girl on Twitter. She’s really possessive and has kept me from making new friends because of how jealous she gets. When she doesn’t want to support me, I have no one else (aside from bf) who can.",False,True

Don't know why she even asked if she didn't want to be supportive about whatever was obviously bothering you, regardless of the specific answer.  Even if she doesn't apologize like she should, she owes you a few.  Sometimes it feels like we're screwed with this mess no matter whether we're honest or keep it to ourselves. But if you do confide in someone again, that's not a bad idea + I hope they're kinder than your fair-weather friend was this time.",False,False
