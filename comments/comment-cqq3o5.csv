Dry fry them and then use them as you would any other noodles. Between those and lentil noodles, I don't remember the last time I had regular noodles.",False,False

It‚Äôs better for stir fry if you have no moisture. I normally do soy, ginger, garlic, chili flakes, sriracha, veggies (Trader Joe‚Äôs has a really good frozen mix).   I‚Äôve done marinara and if you are feeling like you can splurge on calories you can do veggie meat crumbles (morning star) for some extra substance since the noodles are so little calories and you have spaghetti and meat sauce!   I‚Äôve also done veggie broth, noodles, frozen peas, canned corn, carrots, and celery to make veggie noodle soup. Asian markets sell different shapes if you wanna get the shorter shapes or you can just chop the noodles shorter so it‚Äôs easier to eat. I would just suggest saut√©ing the veggies and adding a good amount of seasoning so you don‚Äôt feel like you‚Äôre eating hospital soup lol.  I just got a pack that is ‚Äúmacaroni‚Äù shaped so I‚Äôm planning on just eating those with I can‚Äôt believe it‚Äôs not butter light (35 cals/tbsp) and parm (30 cals/tbsp). I know that might be gross but it was my fav meal as a kid and I‚Äôve been craving it for whatever reason.",False,False
