If he can’t respect your boundaries then he can’t be a good friend to you right now and I hope you create some distance while maybe encouraging him to get some help (if you can).,False,False

Maybe he knows, maybe he doesn’t. Either way he’s trying to push you into restricting/disordered eating so that you’ll fuel his own. He’s already tried to goad you into competing with him after you explicitly told him not to. He doesn’t respect you or your boundaries. You are a tool to him, a means to his ends, and you were strong enough to leave your toxic partner so you’re strong enough to leave this guy in the dirt. Good luck to him but he doesn’t get to drag you down too.",False,False

He sounds really toxic and not like someone who you can safely vent to without it damaging you. There will be other friends who will treat you with the kindness you deserve. My advice is to stop spending time with him and stop talking to him - friends should lift each other up, or at least make the bad times not so bad, not worse.",False,False

That's why I'm a 100% sure when I tell you that you need to have a serious conversation about it.   Don't just casually tell him ""oh this bothers me"". No, have a very serious conversation JUST about that topic.   As much as you want that person in your life, your well-being is more important than having a very awkward conversation.",False,False
