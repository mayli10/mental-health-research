I‚Äôm already losing weight rapidly so maybe it‚Äôs for the best that it‚Äôs at least a tiny bit slowed. I‚Äôm sorry, you don‚Äôt deserve to be punished  by those labels.   I know it‚Äôs hard for some people that some foods say 0 calories but really have a tiny bit more but I always just force myself to record whatever the label says, knowing I‚Äôm eating low enough anyway that I‚Äôm still going to lose weight and the difference would probably maximum delay me one day a month.   For example, I just learned from someone that a sweetener I like that I thought was 0 cal (don‚Äôt worry it‚Äôs not a very common one) was actually 7 cal a packet and I decided I won‚Äôt put that into my daily calories just because I torture myself enough already.
