Just throwing this out there so no one gets bright ideas. It doesn't always work like that. My friend who is still addicted (:() is overweight.   It's natural to feel jealousy when a sibling is getting more attention from your parents though. Be gentle with yourself and remind yourself it's not good attention and you deserve better.",False,False

For me the jealousy of her thinness was mostly the disorder talking. And the jealousy of other people expressing care/worry for her came out of my fears that I’m unloved or unloveable...and out of that fear, the belief that I have to make people to love me by being really perfect or really damaged.   I could certainly take horrible (hurtful, selfish) actions based on these feelings, but I truly don’t think that having these feelings makes me a horrible person. I think the disordered part of my brain loves to me I’m a monster because that keeps me away from hope - keeps me isolated and afraid and bent on damaging myself. But I’m not a monster, not really. I’m just a person. A person that’s a bit lost and a lot afraid and carrying some deep hurts.   Wishing the best for you and all your family. &lt;3 It’s hard to be in the place of pain and self-destruction, and it’s hard to witness someone we love seeming trapped in that place.",False,False
