I can't stress it enough!   &amp;#x200B;  I used to have graves disease (hyperactive thyroid) and too much thyroxine is so so so dangerous. You could literally have a heart attack. When my graves was at its worst I was not allowed to exercise at all because I was in real danger of a heart attack.   &amp;#x200B;  Although I've had my thyroid removed so I'm hypothyroid now I have horrible lasting issues from too much thyroid hormone 6 years post op. You can get protruding eyes like me, and once you have them there is nothing that can be done to reduce it except a risky eye surgery that is only done when you can't close your eyes anymore.  &amp;#x200B;  Just don't do it.",False,False
