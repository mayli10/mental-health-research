She recovered by herself after 12 years of Anorexia. You’re not alone and I also feel like I have no idea how to eat like a normal person. This shit is hard &lt;3,False,False

I guess I should just call my insurance company and see if they have any ideas. I'm in the USA if that makes a difference.   For me, I had little access to food unless I was at a friend's house, and they typically got pizza or fast food/junk when I came over, so I would just gorge myself on everything I could while I was there. Which, lead to the same thing but more frequently when I got an actual job. It really sucks.",False,True

For example I'm in the UK so at the minute my gym coach is giving me advice on that front.  But I plan to Google it later.  It really sucks huh? I got into an position from age 14, after being given chocolate and pizza etc whenever I wanted, where I had to start getting my own food.  I had no idea how.  So it was junk. Soooo now I crave bad stuff all the time and feel ashamed for it instead of indulging every now and then.",False,False

Are they like a private practice type of thing, or can you find them at the same place you would a doctor?  I'm sorry you had a similar experience to me regarding food access.",False,True

I'm sorry you're struggling right now, but please rest assured you absolutely deserve recovery regardless of your weight.  An ED is primarily a mindset problem, right?  Therefore you definitely can have help.  Please don't think you don't deserve it because you aren't underweight.   My best bet would be to seek out a nutritionist.  I too have problems with eating - food was hard to access and I was never raised to eat healthy so I eat junk all the time - and this is my next step once I can stomach the idea of gaining body fat.  I'm here if you need to message me!  I hope you can face recovery and get better!",False,False
