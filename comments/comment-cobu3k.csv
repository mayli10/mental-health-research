When I lost weight the first time, I had tons of muscle from being a swimmer my whole life (I was still chubby bc I liked to eat lol, but the muscle was there too) so when I lost weight, even just the first 10 pounds, my body looked more defined? Now I’m at a weight that i once thought I looked bomb af at, but I literally look like a blobfish. It’s so disgusting. Guess that’s what happens when you starve away all your muscle and then uhh...do no exercise in your recovery",False,False

It's entirely body composition. You may have a lower muscle to body fat ratio. I've had the same exact measurements weighing 15lbs more than a lower weight because I had a lot of muscle tone. If you were restricting your calories really low and lost weight fast, you lost some muscle, especially if you weren't managing your macros and keeping protein high and doing strength exercises (compared to cardio).",False,False

I woke up today at the the lowest weight I've been in a while, however, because the day before I had actually ate dinner and binge chewed/spit, I feel like part of what I was seeing was just the guilt from feeling like a fatass cause of what I ate. Also, sometimes maybe water weight disperses different despite the actual number on the scale. Restricting and binging SUCKS, I wish we could just eat 2 olives a day and be cool.",False,False
