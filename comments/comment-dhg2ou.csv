Hit my goal weight and maintained it for ~1.5 years, but stress and life being ugh resulted in me gaining around 10 lbs in the past 6 months. Still underweight but don’t feel like it at all and am just really really disgusted with my body. It sucks bc it wasn’t like my goal weight was ~never enough~, I was actually pretty satisfied and doing okay. I even felt comfortable in my skin for the first time. Right now I’m torn between just wanting to lose again vs. forcing myself to try to live at a somewhat higher weight. Depression/anxiety from gaining is kicking my ass though, so I know which way I’m leaning :’)",False,False
