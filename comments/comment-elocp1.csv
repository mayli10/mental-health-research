I purge low cal and healthy “meals” regularly now. I think I need to get back into the routine of having 1 safe food for a period of time and only eating that. Trying to diversify and eat healthy is a good idea for me to peruse but purging is so harmful to me. I am trying my best to get to a place where I don’t get freaked out by a variety of foods in me at once.,False,False

I’m a lunatic.,False,False

I used to idolize a day with zero caloric intake as a “perfect day”, though at the time I had never done it. And now that I *have* played with the napalm of fasting, my brain contributes ,“well, you could still have exercised more”. I don’t think there’s any winning - at least not within the paradigm of ‘find things the disorder will be ok with’. That bulls eye just gets smaller and farther away.   (I tell myself that when I’m ready I’ll really work on pushing back. Saying what is ok instead of trying to placate the demons. I guess time will tell what balance I find.)",False,False
