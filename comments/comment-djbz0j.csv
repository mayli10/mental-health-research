Other nut milks may be higher if you’re like me and not fond of the idea of whole milk, I’m allergic to peanuts so most other nuts are out of the question for me. Try adding cheese into your diet too if you’re not vegan or have any dietary restrictions as well.   I’ve not been completely on point with my intakes and have messed up my calories to be too low here and there so I’ve still been without one (but I’m absorbing some vitamins better probably, personally on day 171 without so I know the struggle)",False,False

I managed to restore my period thankfully, by eating maintenance to slight surplus calories of nutrient dense foods. As u/MajorArcanine said, dietary fat is an important part of this, not just for hormone regulation but also absorption of certain vitamins.  If possible, would you be able to see a GP or gyno? You deserve proper treatment and privacy in your healthcare.",False,False

In general I’ve always had an irregular as hell period, so skipping periods for months is pretty normal to me. So I might be too casual and confident about it being fine. As with everything on the internet, take it with a grain of salt.   Unless you’ve got some extreme symptoms alongside it- lots of pain, especially on either side of your lower belly (where your ovaries are- could mean ovarian cysts) or lots of nausea/vomiting/fainting/etc.; you should be fine. It doesn’t like build up and back up your system or anything if you don’t have a period. They even make birth control that keeps you down to one period a year, and even then it’s not completely necessary if you’re still feeling fine.   Regardless, if you’re an adult, even if you go to the doctor to discuss your worries about it, you do not have to disclose your ED and even if you did, your doctor can’t do anything about it. they’re not going to commit you or force you to do anything you don’t want to. Hell, the same goes for any illegal drug usage. They won’t turn you in or put you in rehab. They just need information to treat you properly and that’s all they care about.   If pregnancy is still a big worry, you can also stop by any womens health clinic or planned parent hood to get yourself tested with something more accurate. And it should be free.   Don’t let it all get to you. The human body is incredibly resilient and built to handle stress. And there are tons and tons of options out there to take care of yourself with. Breathe easy, you’ll get through this.",False,False
