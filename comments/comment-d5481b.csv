I am very sensitive to artificial sweetener (sad reacts only) but this one I can eat an entire pint of without getting dizzy and it tastes no different to normal salted caramel ice creams I've tried imo. Also really like vanilla bean and where I live they have a speculoos one that is really growing on me for autumn.,False,False
