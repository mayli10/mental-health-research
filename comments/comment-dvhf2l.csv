My dietitian told me yesterday that I could maintain at 2,100 and I didn't believe her but now I'm wondering.   On the other other hand, increasing intake is scary. So we'll see what happens.

I tried recovering for like 2 months a few months ago and I ate about 2,000 (give or take 100 either direction) a day like it said and I didn’t gain any weight, if that gives you any relief!   I was really happy my number was so high too because for years I honestly believed I only needed 1,700 and I fluctuated so much between binging and restricting that I didn’t really know if that number was right or not.

I'm a short female and despite being really active calculators usually put me at about 1300 a day, and I feel the need to restrict super low which makes me feel terrible as a result.
