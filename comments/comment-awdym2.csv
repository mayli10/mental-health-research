You are worth it, trust me. This guy sounds kind of crappy for telling you about a new girl even though he's been talking to you. I know he did a lot of good things for you but ultimately, he's not worth your time or emotional stability.   Please take some time to do something good for yourself and before you throw out all your food, try to let your emotions settle a little bit. If you need someone to vent or talk to, my messages are open. üñ§",False,False

Ive been hanging out with this guy i met in tinder and kept sending me mixed signals. He said he doesnt like me but he gets attached to me. I found out he is dating a new guy who ironically have the same name as mine. I fasted for 36 hours and binged alot after to deal with the heartbreak.
