Especially in regards to how natural it‘s become for me to lie straight to people’s faces, so they won’t get concerned/suspicious. I used to tell one lie and be up all night filled with remorse, and now it’s like I’m in pure survival mode or something, and it’s just like “do whatever you have to do”. Also, kind of want to cry at reading “I don’t even remember what it’s like to be able to think freely”, because it’s so relatable. This shit is SO consuming, and it makes me sick how the majority of my thoughts revolve around it.  I really hope you find some peace &lt;3",False,False
