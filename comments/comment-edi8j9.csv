I just think it’s unfortunate that I see a lot of people on here only thinly veiling their disgust for fat people when more often than not obesity comes from a deeply disordered place, and telling them that their existence is not okay only fuels that disordered fire, whether that be towards restriction or further binging. Also, I feel like the toxic part of the fat acceptance/HAES movement is definitely the vocal minority and gives this false perception of what the movement actually stands for, which people on this subreddit take at face value despite it being so far from the truth.  It just bothers me when people take issue with the idea of telling fat people that they’re allowed to love themselves, that’s all. I have experience being fat and skinny so I guess it’s just a personal subject for me having grown up overweight.  Everyone is deserving of feeling comfortable in their own body, regardless of whether or not they’re open to losing weight &amp; in spite of all of the health issues obesity brings.  (It feels so hypocritical of me to say that considering I hate myself until I hit a certain weight, but hey, that’s the inherent irony of eating disorders I guess lol)",False,False

And have been disparaging to those with EDs who are underweight. I'm so glad you got something good out of it though!,False,False

I agree with you, I think I'm absolutely disgusting and still think things about people bigger than me, mostly to reassure myself that I'll never be that bad again. Not mean things necessarily.  But I must admit it feels really bad when people say that they're scared of me, or use my fat as an example of what not to become, out loud. Like honey I know what you mean, I've done the same thing, but i haven't eaten in a week, I have no hair left and my teeth are damaged. If I eat anything it's too much. My internal organs are damaged. Today my fasting headache feels so bad it's like my brain is eating itself because it's so desperate. I'm still fat, I've lost all the weight before, and gained it back, and still struggling just as much. I still do the same things. It's shocking how many people think, even others with EDs, that a fat person can't have a severe eating disorder. This isn't you OP, I just thought it might be relevant.",False,False

A lot of what I’ve seen has been attempts to build up self esteem among overweight people, not trying to convince them their weight is “healthy” in the true medical sense of the word. Idk, maybe I’m just not seeing the same kind of HAES stuff as you.  I just don’t think it’s fair to bash a movement that’s attempting to help people on the other end of the weight spectrum to love themselves. It’s surprising to me how many people here disagree with that when we’re the ones who struggle the most with self love/self image. Before I started becoming disordered in my eating, I really only started losing weight as a result of accepting my body as it was which came in part because of recent fat positive movements. That’s just my 2 cents I guess lol",False,False

I feel like..talking about negative feelings towards fat people belongs more on fat logic lol (remember ppl w BED, ppl who are struggling with an ED but are still overweight, etc also belong on this sub and already deal with enough from people who don’t have eating disorders)  Obesity isn’t healthy but we can’t excuse being underweight as somehow better or healthier in comparison because it’s really not. all it does is allow us to say, “at least I’m not fat!” while ignoring that EDs and underweight BMIs do lead to both short term and long term health issues, and even death in severe cases.",False,False

I also don't believe an obese BMI is healthier than a measly 5 lbs underweight. Those don't seem comparable. I'd be interested in the evidence for that.
