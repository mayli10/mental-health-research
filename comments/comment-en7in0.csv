Seriously, you can and should be proud of yourself! Iâ€™m willing to bet money that you didnâ€™t develop you ED overnight, so it makes sense that you wouldnâ€™t be able to get 100% better overnight either, right? Itâ€™s all about small changes. Youâ€™re meeting yourself where youâ€™re at right now, and then pushing yourself one step further. You just gotta keep on trying to push yourself. Which, of course, is easier said than done, but look how far youâ€™ve come in just 11 days. Imagine where youâ€™ll be this time next year! Wow!  Additionally, I recommend finding some support, whether thatâ€™s in the form of family, friends, a SO, professionals, etc. Professional help is ideal for recovery, but I understand that not everyone is in a position to be able to get professional help. If the only thing holding you back from seeking professional help, however, is fear/anxiety/discomfort, then I highly hugest you push yourself to seek that help. I know itâ€™s shit-your-pants scary, but so is eating, and youâ€™re already making progress with that!   I believe in you, and I really think you can beat this thing ðŸ’›",False,False
