I couldn't stop myself, even if I was full I would just keep eating.",False,False

Hopefully this ends soon, lowkey I have been enjoying it but looking at myself in the mirror right now is probably the hardest task. i  may be skinny on the weight side by man do i look like a whale.",False,True

I was binging to cope with the fact that I had, through no fault of my own, lost control of many other aspects of my life. Maybe you should reflect on whether you’re going through any big changes right now and how those make you feel. Once I got handle on those other aspects the binging impulses melted away and I was able to get back to my usual routine pretty easily.",False,False

It's like an unstoppable force, there is no way to resist it, at least not that i know. The way i get rid of it is just, intuitively eating or eating normally for a few days. By normally i mean around 1000 cals or something, and just giving into my cravings. it's suuper hard, literally the worst thing to go through but, honestly that's the only way i know",False,False

I mentioned it in a reply to another topic:  &gt;I always thought it was my body going into ""survival mode"" after a certain amount of time being hungry. Like I imagined this red light going off in my brain and every other thought being blocked out by the ""holy shit for some reason we are starving, time to just eat everything in sight"" distress signal. Like an emergency override.  My fear of it happening again is what's motivating me to stay around 1k calories a day + occasional social eating without counting at all. I was considering doing the 2468 diet but the risk of Emergency Override™ stopped me.",False,False

For the longest time I was able to restrict with no problem and within the past year it’s been nearly impossible to restrict!!  I literally eat anything and everything in my path. Can’t really offer any advice, but just know you’re not alone.",False,False
