I know it'll come in handy when I'm older but for now I honestly only have nice bone structure when I'm at a nearly underweight BMI or lower. Anything above 19 and my face balloons out. And the worst part is I know it's not in my head bc people comment on it too ughhh.,False,False

My face is a bit on the flat side but god my cheeks make it 10x worse especially in photos. When I weigh more my face looks even softer and rounder. ,False,False

I'm a quarter Native American and inherited the high, prominent cheekbones and strong jaw, but at higher weights the fat just fills the area between the two and it makes my face look like a massive potato lmfao.

I have a picture from my low weight where I'm smiling and my chin looks nice, I have s decent jaw and my cheeks are cute instead of giant saddlebags on my face. It's in my thinspo folder lol. Sad?  Also, when in a low weight I don't mind smiling as much because it looks nicer, but right now it just looks like the lumps change placement when I smile.",False,False

Even underweight, I have the puffiest cheeks. Looking just at my face I feel like youâ€™d never guess Iâ€™m actually on the thinner side. My body is so disproportionate to my face.

I spent months when I was 14 shaping my smile so I didn't look horrible.  Now I tolerate my smile but I heavily dislike my face.  It does look better slimmer (I have a ROUND baby face so with any weight I look like a potato).  ,False,False
