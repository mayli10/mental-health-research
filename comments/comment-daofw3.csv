And I've had an ED since I was 16, so I have no way of knowing what my body would be like naturally as an adult if I was always a healthy weight.         And thank you for linking good recovery channels!!! I've looked at some but I was always like :/ u don't seem very recovered....a lot of them on Instagram just develop orthorexia or BED.",False,True

I'm currently 21 days into this attempt and it's the longest I've made it yet. The thing that helped me stick longer this time is I'm trying to remember how eating and being fed makes me feel. Like yes eating is making me gain weight but I can also think clearly and I feel so much better / happier. When I restricted I felt like trash all the time but I liked how I looked but nothing else.  The constant struggle isn't worth it to keep the body that you want if you have to suffer to keep it.   The overeating is normal in the beginning. Your body doesn't know if it'll get more food in the future so it's trying to get what it can now. If you continue to eat enough and eat consistently, the overeating will stop.   As for the weight going to your stomach, this is also normal. In the beginning you gain mostly in your stomach until you have eaten enough for you body to feel confident that the famine is over. Then the weight will you distributed throughout your body. I have this now, huge belly / legs and bony everything else.   Even knowing all of this myself, I still have the pull to go back to restriction but the more I continue to eat despite what my thoughts are telling me the quieter they get. Opposite actions are what help push you further towards full recovery. If your thoughts tell you to go buy low calorie restriction food, you buy the opposite (cake, cookies, fast food). By doing that It'll help to stop the disordered thoughts.  I find these three YouTube channels helpful in understanding the process and keeping motivated.  kayla rose kotecki https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCGV3pXwwGVoXu0cqZPI16Kw   Tabitha Farrar https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCa7G1P5WQopVMc9qTSP_lgA   Megsy Recovery https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCey1WBhNthBx0vDy-pHe9uw",False,False
