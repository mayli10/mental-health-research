First thing you need to do is tell your doctor that your appetite has increased to the point where it is negatively affecting your daily life.    You also need to really check in with your body and take notes about your dose and how you feel. As you move up and down on hormones, this will be really good information to get you to were you feel and function your best, I promise.    If you are up for it, lift weights. I’m 100% serious, when you go on testosterone, lifting weight, whether it’s body weight or actual weights helps mentally and physically. Not really sure why, and this might not help the appetite much, but just something I’ve seen.    Good luck, the hormone adjustments are a bitch, but hang in there, it’ll get better.",False,False
