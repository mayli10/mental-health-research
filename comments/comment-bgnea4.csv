Tell them you're having concerns and because they don't seem comfortable diagnosing it themselves, you'd like a referral to a specialist. No doctor can know everything.  However, the interaction as you've written it sounds like you're a new patient. Depending on if anything was transferred from your normal/old doctors, this one may not have known whether you already had a diagnosis or not, and was simply asking.   You went to them because of the disorder; is this a specialist already? If so, be open about the need for a confirmation/assessment. Literally say the words: ""I'm concerned about my eating habits, what's the next step in assessing whether or not I have an eating disorder?"" If they know, they'll start the process. If they don't, they'll refer you to someone who does.",False,False

It sounds like she is taking it seriously but doesn't really know what the criteria are, if she was asking you whether \*you\* think you have it instead of asking you about specific symptoms or behaviors. Finding a therapist/doctor on your own will be hard, as many require a referral, but your current doc might be able to point you in the right direction",False,False

Maybe the doctor was trying to get a sense of if you consider yourself anorexic or bulimic? Agree it's odd they didn't ""assign"" a diagnosis.",False,False

While it does sound like this isn't a terrible doc if they have an open mind to EDs at least. But clearly they don't have a good handle on them.,False,False
