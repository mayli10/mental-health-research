MUST SHOVE FOOD DOWN UR THROAT"" approach. then i could've told her abt my goals and my current (unhealthy) practices and upon seeing a supportive reaction, i'd have been a lot more open to upping my calorie count and reducing my exercise a bit until i could work my way to a semi-normal diet/workout routine.  so if you can, next time you see her look at you funny, ask if she's doing okay and see if you can start talking about it. if you don't feel it's a good time to confront her about that though, i think you're doing a pretty good job so far already by being conscious about what you say. it's clear you truly care about her. until you can have ""The Talk"" with her, i'd suggest just trying to have fun with her. like find sometime to hang out and do something you both love together so she stops seeing you and associating you with body image but starts seeing you as just her sister who she loves being around  i'm sorry i can't be more helpful &gt;_&lt; but i truly hope you two work something out! sending my love üíñ",False,False
