I was wearing boxers that hit my sides weird and switched to these lace top ones that are more forgiving for my hips so they don't create a weird squished bit anymore. Might help to have some underclothes you feel bangin' in. :),False,False

My fiance (m) has a lower sex drive than I (f) do and I know this but it still drives me crazy when we dont have sex for extended periods of time because I think it's because he thinks I'm fat, ugly, gross, etc. But it definitely boots my confidence and makes me feel better about myself and body when we do have sex.

I tried explaining it's how I feel about myself and it's not him... I think he takes it to mean that he doesn't make me feel beautiful. He really does but the negative self-talk is just so intrusive. It's complicated. ,False,False

I hate when his hand runs down my side and I become hyper-aware of the flab in my muffin too area. It becomes ALL I can think about. ,False,False
