I mean, I love him, but sometimes I high-key feel like he ""caused"" my start down the ED path. If nothing else, he definitely contributes to it (unknowingly) and my disordered ass likes it on some level because yes absolutely I have issues and I love the attention he gives me as I get smaller. üò™",False,False

He‚Äôd always comment on how skinny I looked and felt. If it seemed like I lost weight he‚Äôd mention it. (I think he thought I was losing weight in a healthy manner, so not his fault.)   But he also wanted me to ‚Äúget better,‚Äù whatever that means. That led to me gaining weight and guess what. No more comments on how ‚Äúskinny‚Äù I was. No more praise for losing weight, and so on. I haven‚Äôt mentioned it to him, of course.. but it for sure has encouraged me to get serious about losing weight again. I never recovered. I just got fat.",False,False

Am I just expecting too much from people who don't have experience with EDs or..Because to me it's so obvious you shouldn't praise someone with an ED for being tiny and skinny.,False,False

I know my guy definitely likes me on the ""skinnier side"". He has always seemed to be into girls with issues... Whether it is publicly displayed self harm, alternative goth chicks, girls with problems, girls with disorders LIKE ME. We met and I had self harm scars, I'm pretty alt. looking. They've healed over time. We have been together for 6 years now and I pretty heavily fluctuated through weight. Now that I'm tiny, AND HE KNOWS i have an ED, he will ALWAYS comment on how i'm such a ""skinny mini"" and how small i am. He will grab under my rib cage while we are cuddling. But gets mad if i experience ED type behaviours while around him. I've asked him so many times if he'd still be as attracted to me if I got better and gained weight. He always says yes, but it seems really not genuine (at least in my eyes), so I fear gaining weight and not being ""skinny mini"" anymore. Especially since now he jokes about it like I was ugly when I was chubby, almost like skinny me is better me. I don't think he realizes how much it damages my chances of getting better when I fear looking like the old me.",False,False

I‚Äôve done that before... I had a friend who was obsessed with being skinny so when she Lost white a bit of weight I kept telling her how she super skinny and how if she lost another pound she‚Äôd disappear. I has hoping maybe she listen to me and see how skinny she was already and how she didn‚Äôt need to loose anymore. But I can see how it can be interpreted in a different way ... but the rela question is did he ever say you‚Äôre prettier now ? Or is he just pointing out that you‚Äôre skinny a lot ?,False,False

I've had people do shit like that to me and it still torments me. I met my current partner (5+ years) when I was at my ULW, then recovered, so I know he likes me skinny...and I've been relapsing for a while so I'm a little afraid of that situation.  The attention is like gasoline on a fire!   You say he knows, and wants you to get better, but then announces your behaviors to your friends? That seems very much like he's bragging or trying to encourage you by telling others. Do you think he actually understands what an ED is like?   I'm sorry this is happening to you and I hope you can find some common ground to heal.",False,False

I'm sorry you're grappling with the emotional challenge of getting positive reinforcement like this, bc it is honestly one of the most ""valuable"" things about having an ED, and one of the biggest roadblocks to recovery.
