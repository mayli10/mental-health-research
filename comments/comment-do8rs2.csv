For breakfast I have eggs, tofu, and a protein shake, lunch is two protein bars, and dinner is a protein and veggies. Lately after dinner I’ve also been snacking on protein cookies. An iron deficiency is possible but iron supplements make me sick, unfortunately. My day actually went much better than anticipated. Thank you again for the kind words.",False,True

I had the same issue as you and as far as the energy goes maybe try to integrate more protein in your meals when you do eat. It’ll feel heavier but it might help you a lot. Do you have any type of iron deficiency? Supplements for that might help too.   Don’t feel bad for posting a bunch it’s what this sub is made for anyway ✨",False,False
