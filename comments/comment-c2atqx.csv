This is how I manage to maintain my average weight largely through being active at work and exercise, despite binge eating an additional 3,000 or so calories every few days. Being tall means you expend hella more energy.",False,False

Maintenance is certainly easier than losing weight but I still think they are not eating a lot or as much as people think, especially for their height and activity level.",False,True

So they’re not trying to lose more weight and don’t need to be at a deficit, they just need to maintain the weight plus stay toned.  And a lot of them are 5’10 or 5’11, which helps too.",False,False

I’m a hair short of 5’8 and I’ve always naturally been a size 4. I am super active walking 10,000 steps a day and working out for an hour each day and when I am not skinny like they are. Even when I ate at a 20% calorie deficit I never got to be as skinny as they are. Toned, sure, but being that lean takes a fairly large calorie deficit.",False,True
