I do this too though pasta is usually bingey for me (I can’t stop eating it). I don’t get why. It was my favorite food as a kid but I only ever ate a few bites of it at a time lol. One kid’s size plate used to last me days without active restriction and now that I restrict, I have to have it ALL.",False,True

It sucks because my body was actually looking really good for a FULL WEEK and then I ate pasta once and I’ve had a distended belly since I posted this. :( And my husband noticed I lost weight (I was 96 lbs and I get weighed by my job every Wednesday and I have to be 100 lbs or more) so he’s been trying to slip some more calories into me (hence he’s making tortellini alfredo with turkey tonight). He’s totally in the right here but I just. Cannot. Stand. The distended belly.  Plus I did work out vigorously three times yesterday so I know there’s gonna be water weight as well.  The increase in calories (though still below my TDEE) coupled with the increase in exercise really bums me out when I look in the mirror lol ugh anyway thank you!,False,True

Water aids digestion so drinking a shit ton makes it move faster through your GI system resulting in less bloat,False,False
