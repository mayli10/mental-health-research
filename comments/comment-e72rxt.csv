That is an incredibly cruel, and an incredibly immature thing to do. You are under no obligation at all to take this treatment from him. He sounds pretty toxic and I really hope you find the strength to break away. It doesn't have to be super dramatic, perhaps just reduce your contact with him and he might just realise that treating his friends like punching bags will push them away. You deserve so much more than this hun xxx",False,False

Hell, he’s purposely hurting you. Confronting him isn’t being hurtful for the sake of being hurtful, and it’s only fair that he should have to confront how he’s making you feel. I really hope this gets fixed if you do decide to salvage the friendship. If he doesn’t change, then please distance yourself for your own sake.

I’m hoping it’ll pass soon but I’m at my wits end. It’s already triggered my ED to act up- I won’t go into details- and it’s made me feel worse. I made good strides in recovery and I was proud of it but this whole thing is making me slip up. You’re not harsh, that’s super reasonable and something I wish I could do.

I’d be scared of being like him and letting my hurt feelings hurt others, especially knowing how bad that feels, but choosing to defend yourself isn’t choosing to be careless of others, both are possible and necessary :)  Hoooowever... there’s also the very real possibility that he’ll lash out at you if you make him confront his actions, and honestly if you’re not in a position where you can be the martyr, then yeah I’d just get some distance, a forced confrontation would hurt you both if he’s not there imo.",False,False

He knows about your ED and youre eating only 1000 calories, he sees and knows this and still continues to bully you?? He really doesn't sound like a friend at all. I could understand maybe a tiny slip up coming from him starting to diet. But he is actively deciding to say hurtful things and he keeps doing it. Even to a non Ed person this is incredibly offensive. He sounds like he has some issues and is taking them out on you which isn't fair at all. If he doesn't listen to you and continues I think you should distance yourself from him especially if it could trigger your ED. Maybe I'm harsh but if someone were to comment on my weight and eating like that I'd drop them entirely, I wouldn't ever sacrifice my mental and therefore physical health to keep someone happy.",False,False

Not shifting it at all!! I’m worried about him but I can’t sacrifice my own stability for someone else right now.
