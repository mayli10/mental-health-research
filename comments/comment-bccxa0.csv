I remember deep in my binge cycle how a regular meal was never enough because my body was used to gorging. I relate so hard to that extra 10 pounds that makes me depressed. To be fair, a slight calorie deficit helps loosen a lot of water weight that makes the 10 pound gain look far less after like a week or so. You can do this!!",False,False
