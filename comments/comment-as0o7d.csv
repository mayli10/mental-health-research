They're old studies and I wouldn't use a single study as a reliable source of information, but it's still interesting to read. Most of the research about bulimia is about therapy and side effects.     * Purging and calorie absorption in bulimic patients and normal women (1983)  &gt; Self-induced purging with laxatives is common among bulimic persons, who assume that purging reduces intestinal absorption of ingested calories. However, the efficacy of purging in reducing calorie absorption has never been studied, probably because the standard calorie balance procedure is expensive and time consuming. With a recently devised method, calorie absorption during a single day was measured to determine to what extent Phenolphthalein or saline purge reduced calorie absorption. In two bulimic patients who regularly used laxatives for weight control and five normal young women, **even extreme purging producing 4 to 6 L of diarrhea caused calorie absorption to decrease by only about 12% of calorie intake.** The theoretical basis on which laxatives are taken for weight control is unsound.  * Amount of calories retained after binge eating and vomiting (1993)  &gt; While caloric consumption during binge eating has been measured, it is not known how many of the calories are retained in the gastrointestinal tract after vomiting. In 17 normal weight bulimic patients, there appeared to be a ceiling on the number of calories retained after vomiting. That is, **whether or not bulimic patients had small (mean = 1,549 kcal, SD = 505) or large (mean = 3,530 kcal, SD = 438) binges, they retained similar amounts of kilocalories (mean = 1,128, SD = 497, versus mean = 1,209, SD = 574, respectively) after vomiting.**",False,False
