I weighed myself yesterday morning after we grabbed a pizza the night before so we could focus on the holiday cooking (I was up 2 lbs from normal) and then this morning after the big dinner (4 lbs up from normal).

Just a place where all of us can come to chat and vent and cry. Yesterday's page was flooded with self posts with 1 or no comments because it was hard to keep up.

If it is 10lbs of fat, you can loose that by cutting out ~250 cal/day you can loose that in about 20 weeks. Not bad. And 250 cal isn‚Äôt too too much to be cutting out. I wouldn‚Äôt start that until after the holidays tho, it might be stressful. For now I‚Äôd just focus on avoiding binging/starving behaviors (which I know is very, very hard. But take it one step at a time).   Secondly, it‚Äôll be a lot healthier if you just face the fact head-on that yes, you so have an eating disorder. Most of us here do.   Thirdly, I know it can be stressful to see family around this time, especially when you have an ED. But try to direct the focus of conversations away from that. Talk about anything else. Jobs, friends, hobbies, pets. If they are persistent about talking about food or your ED, excuse yourself from the conversation and talk to someone else. Or, just frankly tell them ‚ÄúI‚Äôd rather not talk about this.‚Äù And change the subject. I‚Äôve had to do it before.  Lastly, no, this isn‚Äôt proED, but I get similar vibes here. We were obviously all affected by its shut down, but it seems like we‚Äôve been able to rebuild that loving community. If you need help, or if you need someone to talk to, I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôd be able to talk to someone here. We‚Äôre all in this together and we‚Äôre all here for each other.  I hope this helped you‚ù§Ô∏è please take care of yourself and feel better üíô",False,True
