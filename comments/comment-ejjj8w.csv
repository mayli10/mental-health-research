I want to start enjoying foods again and eating new things rather than the same safe foods every day.   I am challenging myself once a day, with something small. Trying to portion control and not binge. So I'll make my usual safe foods and have just a little bit of a fear food. Also going to try and go out to dinner or buy something special for dinner once a week.  Keep us posted with how this goes for you!",False,False
