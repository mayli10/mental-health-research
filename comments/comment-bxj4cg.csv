When I think about doing it, I’m like, “Oh, that’s not that many calories,” but when it comes time to actually doing it, it’s a lot harder. But, I’m going to try ‘cause I really don’t want to be referred to a higher level of care.",False,True

If you find doctor’s familiar with ED’s, I don’t think they’ll see you as fake. I also often want to know BMI’s of people to feel more confident getting help. I’ve seen lots of people on here with normal weights (and higher) get treated seriously. Don’t let your ED convince you that you’re faking it; it’s just an excuse your mind makes so that you don’t get help and the ED stays alive.",False,True

How do you feel about trying to do 1000-1200 calories a day? Not sure what to say about if they decide if you're at too high a medical risk, aside from I imagine that does feel very scary.",False,False

More like oh they might actually think I'm not a fake. I hope they treat you too!!",False,False
