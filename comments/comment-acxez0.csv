Don’t have much insight to say about your situation except that you’re not alone; my boyfriend and I are roughly the same weight as well (except he’s 5’9” and I’m 5’5”) and he also tries to help me lose weight for health reasons except it’s incredibly triggering for me. I know he has only the best intentions for me and I’m building up the courage to communicate my issues with food to him but until I do so I’m kind of suffering in silence as well.  Stay strong, I’m sure we can get through this!",False,False
