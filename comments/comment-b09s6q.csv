Sorry, I didn't mean to make this all about me. I just had to put this out there because I couldn't tell anyone else. But your boyfriend sounds so lovely and caring and I'm so happy you've found someone like that!! I hope things will forever stay happy between you two. Wishing you all the best :))",False,False

I'm lucky enough to have a boyfriend like this as well. I went through a really rough time in the past summer and fall and if I didn't have his support I don't think I could have avoided relapse. I'm really happy that you have someone in your life like him to support and love you. ,False,False
