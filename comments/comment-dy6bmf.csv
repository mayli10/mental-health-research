Then you can be allotted extensions/ incompletes as needed.   As for your professors - as someone who has taught college students, i think it's much easier to help/ accommodate students if we at least have an inkling of what's going on. I wouldn't give any details, but sending a short note saying you are dealing with health issues can go a long way.  Have your advisor or the learning accommodations office be in communication with the prof.",False,False

If there is none, you should ask the administration who to contact if you have a chronic health condition impacting your studies.   I wouldn't tell any individual professors, or tell anyone the specifics of the medical condition until you know you're going through the appropriate people. I say this just so you can avoid discrimination/prejudice.   They will likely have a defined procedure and specific forms for your doctor or other treatment provider to fill out too.",False,False

Your university is required to have an office for learning accommodations under ADA, which includes help for students with eating disorders. You should get in contact with them and they should be able to contact your professors on your behalf and provide you with extra time for your work if needed. This of course varies from school to school, but I hope yours has good facilities and can help!",False,False
