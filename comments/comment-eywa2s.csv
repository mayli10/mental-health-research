Don’t sit in the fear of the future.   Right now, you are OK.   Look around, really look around, see where you are, the space you are inhabiting. Smell the space, listen to it. Be there. Breath it in, breath it out. Is it light? Warm? Dark? Quiet? Touch parts of your space.  In this moment, a bit of healthy food is good for you, the future that you are anxious about, is not going to happen.   Revel in the enjoyable parts of your Shepard’s pie. Does it smell good? Is it warm? What good memories are associated with it? Try to let the parts that invoke anxiety fade to the back of your mind. They will still be there, but they are not the focus.  And finally, let that good part sit in your mind. Breath that in. Actively ruminate in the good part.   If you are strong enough, think about the good parts filling in the empty desolate parts that are hanging around in the back of your mind..  let the good parts fill and heal those desperate and empty feelings.  I don’t know if this translates the way I hope, but my therapist is having me do this exercise and it helps me so much. I’m not fixed, but it’s better.   Good luck today. I have faith in you.",False,False
