Yeah I will never admit it irl. It took a lot to even comment on the ED subreddits. People have asked me about it before because I was underweight, but the whole thing started with a chronic medical issue causing nausea and when I gained a few pounds back after it was treated I hated myself and how I looked and Iâ€™ve been hovering around ED territory ever since, and now itâ€™s way more than just hovering.",False,False

I'm more comfortable drinking my calories (while also getting tipsy enough that I'm less obsessed with said calories) so I keep finding myself at bars for dates. I recently went out for drinks with this guy who is a photographer and had the most magical night until we were on the roof of a parking garage at 4 am and he tried to take my picture and I got so triggered because it reminded me that I... have a body? ,False,False

But I doubt she knew the number of times I was fucking dying inside when eating with her, knowing I wouldn't be able to bring myself to eat again that day.   I was very sad when she left, and ofc my brain tried to make me blame myself, and re live every time I so much as drank a diet pop around her, insisting that that was the REAL reason, instead of the completely unrelated reasons she gave for leaving.

I always felt bad about wanting to go out to eat but I live in a town where there really isn't much else to do. So we always ended up just going out to dinner. With one or two exceptions, I would find a menu online beforehand and plan exactly what I was going to order. I would either make the dinner my OMAD or find something low enough to have a light breakfast or lunch. But when the online menu didn't match the in-restaurant menu it was anxiety city.  I felt bad with dinner being my top recommendation because the girl I was with didn't seem to enjoy eating either. I suspected she too had an ED but I never figured how to go about asking her about it. I'd bite your head off *(and spit it out)* if you blatantly asked me about my ED unsolicited. So we were just two people who genuinely hated eating, eating together. It didn't last.",False,False

Always try to go for coffee whenever possible 3. If we go to a restaurant I look up the menu for calories and make it a OMAD 4. Going out for drinks I only eat some protein beforehand and then ofc try to get the lowest calorie drinks I can and plan what Ima get... when they want me to try beer or whatever I jist say Ive tried it and dont like it (even if I do)  Those are just some tips cause there are a lot more situations I just canf figure out what to do with... like when habing sex and my stomach wont  stfu and stop growling ðŸ™ƒ,False,False
