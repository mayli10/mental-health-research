Today I felt horrendous so texted my bf and just told him to tell me that everything will be okay. Then I tried to distract myself by watching YouTube.  Besides that, going for a walk or just doing a mini workout in my rooms helps me feel a tiny bit more in control. ",False,False

I dunno of any other way and TBH I don't want to figure it out until I reach my goal. ,False,False

Itâ€™s a terrible feeling that you kinda learn to sit with :( . Iâ€™ve found what helps me is to remind myself why I need to eat (concentration, fuel, health) and that itâ€™s okay that I do eat (even if I overeat). I remind myself Iâ€™m not ruining myself by eating. If these mental reminders donâ€™t work, I just write out my feelings or try to do something that requires all of my focus. (Watch movie, play games, yoga, talk to a friend). If I distract myself, I find the feeling leaves faster.      Hope you feel better soon ðŸ’œðŸ’œðŸ’œ the feelings get more manageable the more you practice. ",False,False
