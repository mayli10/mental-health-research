This applies mainly to whole foods and gets murkier when you add processed foods into the equation.  Someone posted a really fascinating article about this a few days ago — will update if I find it.   I can’t help but comment that since you’re so young according to your flare, eating disorders really mess with these cues, particularly while you’re still growing. I wish when I were that age, I’d have known more about how my body worked before I damaged my digestive system.",False,False

They say “I feel hungry, so I’m going to eat” and don’t eat when they’re not hungry. Sometimes they’ll overindulge but then the next meal/day they eat less because they’re not as hungry.  It’s basically what “intuitive eating” strives for.",False,False
