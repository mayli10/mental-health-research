I've been in the psych ward a few times and when they discharge you, they refer you to IOP which is 9-12, 5 days a week for four weeks. If you can't do that, your only option is to find a therapist yourself and this is not covered by OHIP. If you can't afford that, tough luck. You're on your own until you try to kill yourself again or have another psychotic break and then they just imprison you for a couple weeks, despite the fact that you didn't commit any crime, and you just sit there in a room, slowly losing whats left of your mind, until you manage to convince the doctor you've seen the life and really do want to live now.",False,False

I'm lucky enough to live in a country where I don't have to pay for ED treatment and the wait time wasn't *too* egregious (about 4 months and then once you're in, you don't have to wait for appointments unless you're discharged and then referred again.) But all the groups were offered between 10:00 AM and 2:00 PM. Even individual appointments with the therapist, psychiatrist, or nurse practitioner all had to be scheduled between those times on Tuesdays and Thursdays. I don't know how someone with a full-time job is supposed to be able to keep that job and support themselves while taking two mornings off every week (and when I was leaving the program they were talking about adding in a Wednesday group as well! Madness!) All the girls in the group with me were either students, self-employed, retired, able to work from home, or receiving disability checks like me. I feel bad for anyone who wanted to get help, but wasn't able to get the time off work to attend the group. How fucking hard would it be to just run the groups after 5? But then I guess that would be inconvenient for the staff and we wouldn't want to inconvenience people.ðŸ™„",False,False

Sucks to be told to go wait in a queue till youâ€™re close enough to deathâ€™s door to be considered valid.  I feel like America has more mental health options but only if you can pay. Iâ€™ve had eight free weekly appointments with a therapist so far, she doesnâ€™t specialize in EDs but she has helped a bit. $400 dollars for a one off and a go fuck your self for a few months just makes me feel for you guys.
