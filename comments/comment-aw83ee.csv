Enjoy food; itâ€™s fun it nourishes is full of joy and flavor. Then be sure to go climb a tree, or join an acrobatics class, stay active and have fun doing it. And for each slice of pizza do one push up, one squat, and one sit up. Not to burn the calories, but to create an all around ritual where you get to indulge in the tasty slice, but you pair it with being fit as a positive association with wellness. Food give us a happy moment. Link it with fitness. And fitness + joy = well being. And throw away your scale, you have a beautiful sexy body. Celebrate it",False,False
