She has had an ed in the past, and in the past half a year (at least) she has been going back through the shit. Hard. I contacted her (we are acquaintances from being on worship team together, but not close) and told her that i see struggles in her that are familiar to me own- if she would like to get coffee or tea and talk about it. But she answered saying that while she would be down to get tea, she didn't want to talk about her own struggles and that she doesn't think its the same that I'm going through. That was a bit ago, and now I'm pretty sure she is in a daily outpatient program, and she still doesn't really want to talk about it. All i want is to help her in any way that i can- she is the sweetest and kindest person. But i have been nothing but a bother. I guess its best to leave her space to work through what she needs to  on her own.",False,False
