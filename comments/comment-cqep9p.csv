Finding a therapist that gets you and makes you feel safe can be really hard but this therapist is not that.  I was talking to my therapist about when I was bullied as a kid and how it was obviously my fault, and she shut that down immediately.  because your therapist didnt say it and bc you deserve to hear it: what the bullies in your life said to you and how they made you feel is a reflection of them, not you. their words and actions were fucked up and you didn't deserve to go through that, and it's fucked up that they did that and said those things to you.   idk you op but what i do know, just from this post, and the fact that you're in therapy because you ""don't enjoy hating yourself""  is that you're strong, you're brave, and you're bad ass. I'm proud of you.  &lt;3",False,False

You’ll be anxious about opening up to her about anything new in case she has another unpredictable and criminally stupid reaction.   I know it’s not the same but maybe at some point you could try finding an online therapist or a therapy app or something (like Better Help or Talkspace) if you can’t find a better one in your area. Anything is better than nothing (except the one you’re currently seeing).,False,False

You just started and sometimes it takes a while to find the right fit. This person is NOT going to be helpful to your mental health. You need somebody who gets you. And anyway her example was inbred levels of stupid, if the wall was built crooked then of fucking COURSE IT WAS THE BUILDERS’ FAULT.",False,False
