I'm talking about a _lot_. I worried. It's obviously not completely fine. I thought it might be a factor. The way you phrased it made me think ""oh, I have had serious problems before (not to long ago), maybe it's going to be really bad"" I could have said way more than ""I actually do"", I wish I hadn't said it like that, or ""literally doesn't effect my health"", but I was worried, and then felt bad and tried to explain in a way that wouldn't make you think I was just relying on a subreddit for medical advice. I will mention it to my doctors next time I go. I guess I'm just not very good at explaining myself. Sorry.",False,True

For 99% of people excess sodium is not even remotely an issue and trying to add potassium or electrolyte-free water to your diet can cause arrhythmias and is not a good idea. For people with renal disease, who are on renal diets and get dialysis, a huge sodium intake can be dangerous, which is why the response was prefaced that way.",False,False

I don't have extremely severe problems with my kidneys. I have had issues in the past with my kidneys stemming from drug use. I'm okay. It literally doesn't affect my health, I just said it since you mentioned that not having healthy kidneys might be a problem, so I worried. Even though I know it's very probably not even a concern. I wasn't asking for medical advice. I was asking an eating disorder subreddit how to flush out extra salt in my body, because I have an eating disorder and have been binging and purging high amounts of sodium. Nothing about medical advice.",False,True

Of course you can alter spice levels and everything too! Obviously you can skip the salt that goes in if you want and it lowers the sodium levels :)   [10 Minute Chickpea and Spinach Curry](https://www.hungryhealthyhappy.com/10-minute-chickpea-and-spinach-curry/)  I wish you the best of luck regardless!,False,False
