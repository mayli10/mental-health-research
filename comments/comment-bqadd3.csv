It wasn’t hard to tell just from looking at me and being around me. Last Valentine’s Day after we’d been dating for about 3 months we were about to have sex when he told me he couldn’t because I was too skinny and he didn’t think I’d been eating and he had to see me eat first. He made me a cup of ramen noodles and watched me eat it then we proceeded lol. He started questioning me more after and it just kind of unfolded.,False,False

I don’t look visibly sick (enough, anymore) and I eat around him (because I want to spend time with him, I don’t eat during the day otherwise), it doesn’t stick. I sort of wish I had never said anything so I could pretend he doesn’t seem to care because he doesn’t know, but it’s just out of sight and out of mind for him. This, as you can tell, is not very much of a help.",False,False

After seeing my eating habits they put it all together and were like, ""oh... ok"" we never really bring it up unless they're concerned about me or I need to talk.",False,False

I was a puke smelling, crying mess so I called him at like 1 am begging him to let me sleep over because it was a lot of blood and I was scared to go to sleep alone. He kept asking what was wrong and just let me lay in bed while rubbing my back and said I could tell him anytime what was wrong. I said “I’ve been making myself throw up my food” and then he started crying and held me super tight, only thing he said after that was ask why I hadn’t told him sooner.  With the current one I told him when I was drunk and cuddling by a fire, he just held me a little tighter and said he’d known before he kissed me. His two best friends are my bosses and I had to tell them to get days off for treatment so I think one of them said something since they introduced the two of us in the first place. He still doesn’t know I purge though I don’t think, the only hint to that was him realizing I don’t have a gag reflex but I doubt he’s connected those dots.",False,False

Though I’m sure he’s figured it’s a bit more than that. Also, he’s kind of accepted that sometimes I’ll purge Idk it just organically came up a bit at a time",False,False

I don't think he understood the seriousness about it back then, he was all ""oh, but I'm sure you'll overcome this"". HA. Let's just say he got to experience the ugly truth a bit later. We're not together anymore, partly because of my eating disorder. He couldn't really understand how severe and all-consuming it was, and thought I was just being a shut-in and hysterical because I chose to. Yeah. We've spoken since then and he understands more now, but I don't see us ever getting together again.   Sorry, this wasn't exactly a happy ending!",False,False
