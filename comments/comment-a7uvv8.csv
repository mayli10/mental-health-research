The idea of recovery is so big and abstract, and the fact that as you said, the thoughts never go away, just makes the whole thing seem so overwhelming.   I feel like if there was any sliver of hope that I could recover and be Ed free, and happy I would give it my absolute all, but like there’s not? It’s always there and when choosing recovery you have to fight it every single day of the rest of your life. Like that’s an awful lot to commit to.   I’m sorry if this is discouraging to anyone, I truly believe recovery is worth it these are just my personal anxieties about the situation. ",False,False
