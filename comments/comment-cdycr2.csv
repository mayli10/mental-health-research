Had someone else look at the number. So my skull weighs 7 lbs!! Thatâ€™s pretty much pure brain matter and skull, so I felt 7 lbs lighter for my true weight.   Iâ€™m guessing you could do this with your hair ðŸ˜‚",False,False

""Turns out, if your hair is very long and thick, it might weigh around 2-5 ounces. If you tend to keep your hair shorter than around mid-back length, you wonâ€™t even notice a change on the scale at all if itâ€™s a little shorter or longer. When your hair is wet, it will likely weigh more, but itâ€™s almost impossible to estimate the extra water weight accurately.""  so unless you got some mermaid length hair and chop it all off, you wont even see a tiny difference. do what makes you feel good",False,False
