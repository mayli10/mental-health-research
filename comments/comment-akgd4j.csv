This said, I have a pretty intense tolerance for stimulants of all kinds, and I use it in moderation- just to dull the pain of cutting when I'm already this lean, not to cut more aggressively than I'd otherwise be able to.   My resting heart rate is about 50, and when active I can get it over 200. On or off ephedrine. ",False,False

Now I am terrified of caffeine and alcohol and ephedra. My brother went through same thing when he was going crazy with energy drinks.   I was on it for about 5 years intermittently.Super easy way to suppress the appetite..I thought taking breaks and eating clean would protect me but no.,False,False

My resting bpm is around 70-80 sitting and 100+ if I'm walking. If you have a heart condition I recommend not using ephedrine because it could definitely make it worse, even if it doesn't necessarily cause it. It wears off in around 4 hours anyway and for me, any dose past the first one doesnt really affect my appetite at all. ",False,False

Your appetite eventually comes back on it anyway, so there's really no point in it after the first several weeks (I think you should stay away from it completely, but harm reduction is best, if you're going to do it anyway).",False,False
