Lots of fiber can give you diarrhea and constipation (yes it's terrible and I know cuz i had the worst fucking bathroom trips when i binged on a whole bag of dried mangos.)    Maybe try eating more protein like eggs whites or Turkey slices instead of fruits?,False,False

It's normally only an issue in like babies/toddlers but with restricting it might be making it worse.  If you avoid sugar it might get better. If not you should see a medical professional.  Make sure to stay hydrated and get some electrolytes!,False,False
