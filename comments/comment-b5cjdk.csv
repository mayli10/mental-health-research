I'm weight restored, but not mentally recovered and it's so hard. All the same habits, all the same self-hatred, but only like 50% of the motivation so I just keep gaining weight. If I could be fat and happy that would be one thing, but I'm fat and just as unhappy as when I was regularly restricting. It's unfair and frustrating.",False,False

I am just so exhausted and discouraged and I wish you didnâ€™t have to eat every day to stay alive  feeling this. we put in all this psychological effort and pain and misery and it amounts to NOTHING. you've made yourself suffer, and for what? you have NOTHING to show for it  ",False,False
