Like the amount I ate doesn't also make me feel like a blimp as well, lol. I'm hoping one day I eat like a normal person, maybe one day I could loose weight normally. I hope you get rid of that little voice, it's horrible. The guilt is really bad and it's hard to get past that.",False,True

You ate more because you had restricted so much for a while. That's ok! I do the same when I restrict. One day isn't going to make you gain weight. I usually have about one day a week where I allow myself to eat like a normal person. I'm doing it slowly, but surely. One day I hope to eat normally &amp; not hear that awful voice in my head beating me up for it.",False,False
