The harder you tr to fight your body or mind, the harder it fights back. This journey is very individual though, and there isn't a one-size-fits-all solution to the problem.  &amp;#x200B;  People who have huge appetites tend to struggle more with physical hunger. They don't really care much what I they, long as I feel full afterwards. If you restrict calories in someone like this, eventually they get so hungry they end up overeating or binging because their hunger cues get messed up and stop ""turning off"" when they eat, because their bodies are just craving calories. I remember this well from when I was very thin. In this case the solution is to increase daily calories across the board, so the hunger never gets to the point where it feels like a ""cheat meal"" is needed or justifiable.  &amp;#x200B;  Other people, it's much more of an emotional thing. First off if you're eating to distract yourself from depression or other serious problems, getting therapy for that does wonders. But some people binge on junk food simply for the emotional feeling of pleasure they get from eating.  At some point they might have an epiphany and decide ""I'm never eating candy again"". After a couple weeks, however, they go crazy and down 100 Snickers bars in one sitting. The solution is to allow them a moderate quantity of the foods they're trying to restrict every single day. For example you might force yourself to eat one and only one Snickers bar every single day (which won't impact your overall calorie intake all that much). This ""feels"" like cheating while you're doing it. If you do this, eventually you will actually get tired of eating Snickers bars, believe it or not.  &amp;#x200B;  All of this is a huge oversimplification. There are people who eat for other reasons than these and people who fall somewhere in between. The journey to finding a solution is individual and always difficult, involving lots of trial and error. But you can see the symptoms and treatment are actually somewhat similar for the ""hungry folks"" and the ""emotional eaters"", and it begins with not treating food with such a black and white mentality, which is a huge problem for those of us with eating disorders because (this is well studied in AN patients), calorie restriction literally leads to a decrease in brain mass that causes more black and white thinking.  &amp;#x200B;  Anyway, my biggest issue still to this day is body image, so I hear you there. I will always perceive myself as being fat. But I don't have to listen to that negative voice in my head. I can choose to come alongside it like a parent alongside their child, trying to use neutral language to describe myself in my head ""6 foot white male, brown eyes, brown hair, etc"" instead of letting that emotionally charged voice berate me.  &amp;#x200B;  I definitely have no qualms with you going plant-based and all that jazz, solely from a sustainability standpoint, but I personally don't do that because if I were to, it would stem from an orthorexic mindset I don't want to take hold in my mind. Have you considered perhaps your ED might be trying to get you to shift from AN/BN to orthorexia as a distraction from the fact that you're still in a disordered mindset? I ask because my own mindset is still very much disordered to this day, and the disorder is hard to turn off. I simply try to keep both eyes open and do what is objectively good for my body.",False,False

You're right, we all already know what we need to do deep down and thankfully, I'm on the right track. I stopped fasting for days and binging on massive amounts of junk food after I fell ill and my body was having so much trouble fighting off a simple cold. I stopped taking laxatives as a regular solution as all it did was mess up my digestive system. Thankfully, after months of constipation and major issues with my bowels, I'm finally seeing improvement; I'm finally regular again after almost three years!  I'm on the right track. Proper dieting has been the biggest struggle for me but I'm now plant based and am cutting out meat consuption. Hopefully I'll be able to completely cut out dairy by the end of the month but it's so hard - I've already cut out cheese and now the only animal products I consume are honey and milk. The problem comes to comparing myself to the women my ex's lust after... they all look like better versions of me. And honestly, that feels completely unattainable to me because I constantly criticize myself in my head - I'm never enough for myself.   I'm fixing my relationship with food and just begun seeing a therapist to fix my body image issues. It's just proving to be a lot more challenging than I anticipated and it's discouraging. This morning, I deactivated my instagram account and decided to no longer browse models' pages. That's not me and never will be. I have unchangeable flaws but there are things that I can work on withing myself. Guess I just need to hunt them down and begin the work. ",False,True

Don't overthink it. Don't over-FEEL it. Overeating and undereating both stem from the same problem - an unnatural obsession, either with the pleasure that comes from eating food, or the pleasure that comes from obtaining a certain body image - neither are objectively healthy for our bodies.  &amp;#x200B;  If we want to have normal bodies, we have to start listening to them. When I was obese, I didn't really understand what that meant, and didn't care to. I didn't understand that there were two systems in our bodies that influenced food intake.  &amp;#x200B;  * Our bodies have a built-in biological system to tell us when we physically need food, and how much we need. We feel physically hungry, our stomachs growl. We eat, and a feeling of satisfaction comes over us as we eat. We taste our food less and less as we eat more, until we no longer desire food. * The hedonic system controls our emotional ""want"" for food. Hyperpalatable (aka ridiculously good tasting) foods, typically high in both fat and carbohydrate (eg cake, donuts, etc), are able to sabotage the above system, simply because they taste so good and our bodies are designed to want those foods for the purposes of storing fat for later use. This is how we end up overeating even when we are physically satisfied. * The easiest way to differentiate between physical and ""mental"" hunger is that when you are truly hungry, you will eat anything. Ever been so hungry, you'd even eat your least favorite food? That's what physical hunger is. Ever been so full and yet someone gives you a slice of cake and you can't resist? That's the hedonic system.  Most people eat for a combination of physical and emotional reasons at different times. This is perfectly natural. There are consequences for depriving yourself both physically and emotionally. Intuitive eating is about getting back to using physical hunger cues to dictate how we eat most of the time, staying active to keep ourselves healthy, etc.  &amp;#x200B;  If you eat for physical reasons 80% of the time (stopping when you feel full), stay active (exercise regularly), the 20% of the time you splurge on a cheeseburger and fries, or eat a slice of cake with your dinner, won't cause you to carry excessive body fat. I also think dietary education is important. Tracking calories for a short time in Myfitnesspal or Cronometer can be beneficial just to help understand the world we live in these days, where most of the food is extremely good tasting, extremely high in calories, and literally built to get us to overeat on it. It's essential that your diet contains sufficient protein and fiber to achieve physical satiety on the regular from eating. If you eat nothing but generic fast food, this is difficult to do.  &amp;#x200B;  You can science the shit out of all of this, but it's really just a matter of doing what everyone knows they need to do deep down. Eat more ""healthy"" foods and less junk foods, stop eating when you aren't hungry (this may require psychological counseling for those who eat for emotional reasons), etc. I'm not saying you have to eat foods you don't like - to the contrary, definitely don't do that. You want to eat foods on the regular that you enjoy. If you follow a flexible dieting approach (look up flexible dieting lifestyle on YouTube), you can find ways of incorporating ""healthy"" foods into your diet, prepared in a creative manner to where they taste good enough that they're enjoyable.  &amp;#x200B;  And one last note on ""healthy"" vs ""unhealthy"" foods. There really is no such thing, I'm just using these terms because everyone knows what I mean when I say these things. Cake isn't inherently unhealthy in moderation, to the contrary, it's great for your ""mental health"" at times, it's just that there are physical consequences for eating it all the time and overeating on it. If you want to look at yourself and ask ""Why is my body carrying so much body fat?"", you have to be willing to ask, ""What am I feeding myself that is causing me to be this way?"" or ""What about my lifestyle is causing this?"" because at the end of the day you're the captain of the ship.  &amp;#x200B;  I was between 330 and 350 pounds for half my lifetime so I know the struggle. It took me 2 years where I exercised my butt off but lost almost no weight at all, before I finally decided to do what I knew deep down I really needed to do the whole time - give up the food. Give up the boxes of donuts. Give up the neverending high-calorie beverages. Give up the huge portions of high-fat high-carb foods, and eat what I needed, rather than what I wanted.  &amp;#x200B;  Hope this helps.",False,False
