My ED is definitely a control thing too, and I find that I fall into the first fantasy more when I’m bored/have an open schedule and the second when I’m stressed/busy.",False,False

However I think it's really people that are able to eat intuitively and maintain and already slim build. The probably think they eat a lot while really just maintaining. I hate the feeling of eating a lot now but I am definitely jealous of ppl who can eat and just...not think too much about it? It's a wild concept lol. But I get what you mean for sure.",False,False

I like having the control and ability to change for the better and to mold my reality (well, my body). People who pride themselves on being skinny without trying don't impress me because theyre not doing anything to achieve that body. Also, metabolisms slow down so... idk.",False,False
