I‚Äôve had AN for 25 years now and though I‚Äôve had some periods of ‚Äúremission‚Äù it was only my body that I had healed, I‚Äôd never healed my soul. Healing the body only is just papering over the cracks, and they‚Äôll keep showing through if I don‚Äôt address the root of the problem. It showed me this by triggering the first episode that really scared me (even though it wasn‚Äôt the worst episode by a long shot).

Just their reactions made me realize that I had really let myself go.

Part of me wants to say he didn‚Äôt mean to hurt me, but his later behavior and the fact that his sister nearly died of anorexia tells me that it was willful. I was eating 1000-1200 calories a day, which is lower than is healthy, but not horrible. I was still able to eat with my family or have a dessert without panicking or anything like that. Weight loss was rarely on my mind.   One day, out of the blue, he snapped and told me I deserved what caused my PTSD and threatened me. I left and pretty much immediately was with someone else because I can‚Äôt stand to be alone.   That guy had another girlfriend (gross ik but I was desperate) who he was ‚Äú‚Äù‚Äù‚Äùhelping‚Äù‚Äù‚Äù‚Äù recover from anorexia. He was always really nice and supportive of her, and meanwhile was emotionally abusive towards me. I asked him why he treated us so differently and the way he spoke about her illness was just... disgusting. It was fetishistic and romantic. I don‚Äôt want to repeat it or even think about it because it was so immensely triggering. The summary is that she deserves love and I don‚Äôt because she‚Äôs sick and I‚Äôm not.   *Every. single. day.* he told me all about how she ate 200 or fewer calories a day and that weighed 80 pounds (she actually weighed 86 so idk why he lied to me?), so I made that my goal. Honestly, even though I sometimes make extremely unhealthy goals in the moment, I‚Äôm lucky enough that reason always wins out in the end, so now that‚Äôs not my goal since my BMI would be DE.AD and I medium or high restrict most days, depending on what you consider high restriction. I feel guilty about it sometimes even though I know I can‚Äôt afford to be bedbound like she was. I‚Äôve left him now, but what he said still effects me.",False,False
