My therapist often talks about how she's trying to untangle ""what's the type 1"" from ""what's the eating disorder?"" Because the reality is that even in a perfect world, where I can just accept that food is a good thing that I need, I'm still going to have to measure carbs to bolus insulin for them, and there's still going to be that very vocal part of the type 1 online community that says carbs are the devil, and there's still going to need to be hypervigilance because yay fun I'm also celiac.",False,False

Both have smart pumps that they program their carbs into and then it automatically dispenses insulin and the pumps are also set up to monitor blood sugars and dose accordingly/also set for both people's specific metabolism. Though I think that part took a bit of time to calibrate. I'm sure they are pretty expensive but seem to be invaluable to these two people.,False,False

Her parents can not figure out why her blood sugar is always wonky when she knows how to correctly use her insulin and when. And how to dose properly,False,False

I was told to get a food scale and weigh all of my food down to the gram. I was told to exercise more (even though I was doing ~2.5 hours of exercise already everyday for my school sport). I seriously believe that developing my disease caused my ed to be triggered into a full blown disorder (when before it was “just” disordered eating). And I was rewarded for engaging in disordered behaviors because I was just following my treatment plan. Growing terrified of food and refusing to eat because I didn’t want to stab myself with a needle? That’s good because I’m taking my health seriously!! :) (yes I’m salty)    Also your body stops feeling like your own when you develop a chronic illness. I felt completely disconnected from my body and food felt like the enemy. I turned to my ed for some semblance of control and quickly spiraled. Now I’m here years later and still in this shit so... yeah. Plus I feel ashamed of having my chronic illness because so many people think that I got it from eating too much sugar or something (though type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune disease that develops due to genetics).   Sorry for leaving a big long comment about this on your post, I have a lot of feelings about this topic since I deal with it every day",False,False
