I had a breakdown of sorts recently because “I’ve been in recovery for 7 months and all I have to show for it is more weight”  Keep at it, we are working through some bleak issues, but we will make it. Remember, one step at a time.",False,False

So far- I’ve not had too many negative side effects (increased lethargy but I think it will get better) and I told myself that I would give it a month to see. I’m not having self harm thoughts anymore so that’s a plus.,False,False

I definitely enjoy food more while restricting, and I am constantly sleeping now as well. Please let me know if you find that the antidepressant helps you. I am desperate.",False,True

I have no advice to offer since I’m in the same place. I just started an antidepressant to see if that helps my mood any. I “feel” more enjoyment from food when I’m restricting and now? I hate everything. I sleep all the time and only barely function (except at work- where I devote most of my energy and still enjoy). I just wish I could sleep until I’m “ok”.,False,False
