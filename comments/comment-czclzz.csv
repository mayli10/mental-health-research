IMO, as soon as you develop disordered habits is when you should get help before your mental and physical health get any worse from this. Eating disorders aren’t defined to one “look” or bmi or weight and I’m sure if you open up to a professional/therapist or loved ones, they will most likely try to prevent you from going any further down this road like anyone would. Your furture gets bleaker and bleaker the more you engage in these harmful behaviors and I’m sure anyone who cares for you would try and prevent that.",False,False
