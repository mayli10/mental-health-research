I'm going to talk to him about it, and if things continue to go well I'll stay with him; if not, I'll definitely leave. As if right now, the only thing odd about all of this was him lying about his age, so I'm just going to keep testing out the waters and thinking on it before I make a real decision. ",False,True

I am DEFINITELY on Team Red Flag. Imho? Run. Run for the hills. Run now.  I’m 31 and could NEVER imagine dating an 18 year old (and I’m kind of an immature shithead lol). I don’t care that it’s technically legal! It’s gross! On his part! Or legitimately worrisome at least. :/   Honestly, it would seem concerning to me even if he hadn’t lied at all, which...may or not be related to some of my own horrific experiences with grown men as a mentally ill teenager, heh :/, but still... .....  Don’t get me wrong; you are an adult, yes. And you can totally do you.   I hope this doesn’t come off the wrong way—and of course every individual varies to some degree—but there is always going to be a world of difference between 18 and 30+ in terms of general life stage and literal brain development (18 and 25+ even).   The power dynamic is inherently skewed in this guy’s favor, and that makes me suuuper fucking nervous no matter how wonderful he is (or how wonderful he’s been thus far, or how wonderful he seems to be). Even if he says he’s never been with anyone younger before (and even if he really never has been), it does kinda strike me as predatory.  Gah. I don’t know! Trust your gut. But if you ask me, there are lots of less creepy fish in the sea.",False,False

Only one person asked when I was 19 (they were 29) and I thought that was super weird, we were friends and had sex but how was a relationship going to work? Would they want to get married soon, move in together soon, have kids? Because that would be a very long time off for me.   The lying about his age thing is also massively weird - I don't think I would trust someone who would do that to me. Making himself appear younger and then dating someone 19 seems pretty sleazy to me.   My boyfriend is six years older than me, but I was 21, nearly 22, when I met him (only a couple of years older than you, but the difference between when you are 19 to 21 is huge in terms of development, and I met him naturally through work and we worked out we had a lot in common before dating - it has all worked out for the long term, but even I wondered if he was too old for the first few months or so, and I was a few years older than you and my bf had *half* the amount of years on me as yours has on you. If it was 12 years I am not sure it would have worked out, even a few more years and I think my boyfriend would have been in too much of different place to me, and if he wasn't I would have worried about his maturity and ambitions as an adult - I would be wary if I was you.

I knew a couple where the guy was 23 and the girl was 13. Legal age of consent here is 16, so this “relationship” wasn’t even legal, but hey, meth heads don’t really give a fuck about the law. They were horrible for each other and it was a super toxic and trashy relationship.      I also knew a couple where the girl was 15 and the guy was I think 27. He was an alcoholic druggy and Id say a pedo as well since normal people don’t willingly fuck trashy 12 year old girls (15 year age difference for them + its illegal) in the bathroom of a book store. I wasn’t very close to either of them so I don’t know how the girl was effected very much but I do know that he let her get drunk enough at least once that she was barely conscious and sitting in a puddle of her own puke in late fall when its freezing out.      I was also in a relationship when I was 18-19 where the guy was 11 years older than me (so 29 when we started, 30 when we broke up). He was the most abusive person I ever met. An abusive, narcissistic sociopath, possibly a pedo, druggy, asshole. If he had it his way, he probably would’ve raped me when I was 16 and he was 27.      So if hes lying about his age, Id be worried about what else hes lying about. I don’t see any reason why someone would want to be with a person that much younger than them unless they want to control/abuse them or they’re to fucked up to find someone their own age.      Even if hes nice now, he could easily change. D-boy (most abusive person Ive met) was nice to me and he was the only person taking care of me when I was a homeless teen on drugs. I honestly thought he had changed and wasn’t the creepy guy who would say stuff like “nice panty shot... if your even wearing panties” to me when I was 16. But then he became so controlling and abusive that I wasn’t allowed to talk to anyone, even my own family. I couldn’t even go see my own mother for a few hours without him accusing me of cheating and threatening to kick me out so Id be homeless in the middle of freezing Canadian winter. I would also get raped and molested everyday, and he was also emotionally and financially abusive. When I left for good, I left with bruises and burst blood vessels from him.      So like I said, Im unable to be unbiased. If you think things are going ok, than good for you, but watch out because things could easily turn to shit with such a big age gap. Im not trying to scare you or shit on your relationship, Im just trying to warn you about the possibility of him trying to hurt you later on because your not someone that I would want to be in an abusive relationship because of a naive choice.",False,False

I was in such a similar situation to you a few years back! I was barely 18, taking some time off college bc super depressed, this cute guy who sometimes came into the cafe where I barista’d asked me out. We had a great first date, starting seeing each other, etc. He asked me to guess his age, I guessed 28, he said he was 30. Months later I found his passport and saw he was actually 33 - he told me he was worried I’d think that was too old so he’d split the difference between my initial guess and the truth, and that when he asked me out he thought I was older than 18 anyways. I couldn’t get over it and broke it off w him   For months afterwards he would send me barrages of crazy texts, and I would block his number and then he’d find me somewhere else and keep harassing me. Calling me a slut, an immature child, etc. He never displayed this behavior while we were dating but it all came out after. I’m not saying your man is like this, or that all older men dating young vulnerable girls have bad intentions, but to me the lying is a BIG red flag. It’s not the age difference that’s the ish, it’s that he wasn’t honest - men in their thirties should have no business misleading teenage girls. ",False,False

The risk of this is it can lead to unhealthy/unequal relationship, even manipulation. To me it is a red flag that he lied about his age, almost like he was purposely looking for younger girls. But it's also possible he's more immature and you guys are a good fit for each other. I can't really make a judgement on this information alone. Maybe try /r/relationships?",False,False

Like you said, if it's just sex that's one thing, but I think big age gaps like this (when one person is quite young) just bring problems to relationships. I cannot imagine being 30, saying I'm 27, and choosing to date an 18 year old (an age at which someone has just graduated high school). Yes, you're legally an adult, but even 18 year olds are still developing emotionally and mentally. The difference between 18 and 22 is large. On top of that, if you feel like you have to keep his real age secret from your parents, to me that's another problem.  It's just my opinion, so of course you're free to do what you want. Just be safe, aware, and follow your own instincts and comfort level.",False,False
