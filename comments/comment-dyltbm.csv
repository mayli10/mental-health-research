I'm bordering on 130lbs, why on earth can I not touch the 120's?! I am also worried because I slaved off this last 10lbs on my stationary bike, which is actually broken now and I have been plateaued ever since even through restriction. I don't think I could possibly restrict any lower, and I fear I will be stuck here forever.",False,False

It’s like I refuse to let myself be successful even tho it would’ve only probably taken 1-2 days of fasting to lose the weight,False,True
