This week has been hell for me. I had a severe toothache and legit tooth pain is the worst.   I have always had bad teeth. Partly because of malnutrition, genetics, depression, anxiety and tooth grinding, and sooo much diet Coke. But I also have severe anxiety and agoraphobia. I couldn't bring myself to get help and often didn't have insurance to do so anyways.  But luckily I do have insurance now and it was such bad pain I decided to see a dentist on Thursday. I was terrified, having major panic attacks. I had to go alone because my husband worked.   But the dentist was very kind and understanding of my anxiety.  I have a bad infection. And they told me I have bone loss. I go back next Thursday to check how the infection is doing. But they said I'll likely have to have all or most of my bottom teeth pulled, all of the front ones and have a partial.   I'm terrified the world over. I think I'll have to be put under for it because I'm afraid my anxiety will be too high. I have to also figure out my other insurance and find a doctor to make sure I'm healthy enough to get teeth pulled. And I'm shallow enough to be so worried about them pulling my teeth and not having the partial yet.   I'm so embarrassed. I'm so scared.",False,False
