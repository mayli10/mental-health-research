And the weight loss is just making them visible due to the loosening of your skin. Stretch marks are completely normal. I got them on my hips, butt, thighs and breasts because of growth-spurts during puberty. I didn't even know about it until I lost a bit of weight. You shouldn't compare yourself to thinspo because everyone's body is different.",False,False
