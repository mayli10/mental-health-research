Lately I’ve been experiencing your mood as well so I get where you are coming from. That’s why I wanted to let you know that I support you and understand you. To give you some insight, I’ve been binging this week on candy, cake batter, toast, you name it. It’s almost like I want to fail in losing weight since I’ve been doing “too well” lately. So, this evening I decided to regain my focus as of now. No more binging, only OMAD. Which helps me in my overall craving and getting enough nutrition like protein.   I know it’s a hard and long road. But we’re here for whatever you need. Stay safe, big hug!",False,False
