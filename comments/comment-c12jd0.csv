In the past I have asked doctors to refrain from corresponding with my parents but my parents still email and call them with concerns, because apparently it’s still legal for doctors to listen to them as long as they (the doctors) don’t respond or divulge medical information. This bothers me because obviously if my parents express ED concerns to my doctors they’ll believe them and this will affect my medical care",False,True

You can ask your doctors to only speak to them about billing.   That doesn’t mean they - your parents -  won’t ascribe consequences for your actions, if they realize or find out. So you need to figure out what’s more important to you right now: having your parents financial support, or the ability to continue in your ED. your ADHD meds may be negotiable- especially if you’ve been on them for a long time and consent to dose changes or being more closely monitored. If you go to a ED facility they’ll likely take you off them- and some residential MH places even do that. I had a hard time finding residential treatment for that reason. Vyvanse actually helped me gain a good deal of weight, and when I’m off it I can’t focus and my emotionality is really bad. &gt;.&gt;",False,False
