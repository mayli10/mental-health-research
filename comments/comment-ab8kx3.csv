In the past 2 years I've been trying to lose weight and be more healthy, and I've managed to lose around 50 lbs (honestly most of it in the past year). I acknowledge that I've lost weight, but at the same time it doesnt seem like enough. I and female 20, 5'4/5, and between 136 and 138lbs. I want to be a healthy weight for my height, but also look a certain way.   I started dating someone while studying abroad in Korea land of the thin people and I think it's getting to me. He's sweet to me (and much slimmer than me), but I cant help but worry that he thinks I'm too fat so I've been doing Keto, exercising, and eating about 1200 a day average. It's bad I know, but my mind keeps telling me you still have all of that thigh giggle and a pudgy belly so you gotta. But at the same time I'm worried I've become too thin and I still wan to be attractive and ""feminine"" shapewise. These two ideals really dont work well together and it's driving me up the wall.   My entire day is spent thinking about what I can and cant eat. Watching nutrition video after video and searching new work out videos to try. I visited friends over the weekend and couldn't find anything i could eat there so I ate eggs, cheese, and berries for 4 days. And I may have picked up another bad habit (chewing and spitting) bc they had candy everywhere and I missed it so much I just had too. I only did it a little, but if I'm being honest the only reason I didn't do it more is because i heard that slows your metabolism and makes you fat.  I'm really worried that I have an issue and I want to stop, but the thought of gaining weight makes me to anxious. I dont know what to do.",False,False
