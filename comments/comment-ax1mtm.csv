The last thing I want to do is to push them away by being too pro active.  It's fine line I will gladly tread if it means i'm helping them, without being over bearing of course.  Again thanks and wish you all the best too.",False,True

Everyone’s different I guess, but in my situation my ED has not always made it easy for my loved ones to support me. If they’re too proactive in trying to help me my ED sees it as pushy and it can dig its heels in; i don’t envy you in your position. It’s a fine line to tread, you sound like such a great friend though and your friend is lucky to have you. Best wishes",False,False
