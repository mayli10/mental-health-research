One of those things was a whole pizza, of which I ate one slice and then threw the rest out. I’ve still got half a pint of ice cream, 2 lemon tarts and almost a whole thing of brownies but I’m going to have to throw those out tomorrow.  Yay for having a binging problem and wasting food and money! And that $52 was the majority of my money. Pay day is next Thursday and I’ve only got $10 left so I’m going to have to dip into my travel savings to get by. Go me. ",False,False

Sometimes food is better in the trash than in your body. Putting that little amount of food in the trash is nothing compared to the amount of food that restaurants and grocery stores waste. It was a one time deal. It's okay, alright? Ya, you lost $40, but you don't have to deal with that regret from eating it! ",False,False

This disorder really skews what you find acceptable.",False,False
