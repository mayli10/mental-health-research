I read a really good post on the Binge Eating Disorder sub the other day that I personally found helpful, which might help you, quote below (it won't let me link to the original post, titled **Dieting vs Healthy Eating**):  ""I’ve posted here before but not recently. I’m a long time binge eater and now that I’m getting older, it’s catching up with me FAST. My friends, husband and I have decided to do a BMI/weight-loss challenge this summer. I’ve noticed that if I don’t say to myself “im dieting, so don’t binge eat or eat this or that blah blah,” I don’t feel the need to eat it. Instead of treating eating like my mortal enemy, I’ve been accepting the issue and replacing the thought of “let’s eat this whole pan of $1 box brownies” into “let’s eat this whole pan of $4 homemade brownies made with healthier ingredients.” Yes, the issue is still there but I’m binging healthier foods (if I binge at all)which in turn makes me feel better about myself which then makes me not want to eat my feelings even more. Overall, I haven’t lost any weight but you know what I have(n’t) done?  1. I haven’t binged in a week 2. I haven’t cried because I looked in the mirror in 6 days 3. I haven’t made myself throw up after eating a meal in 2 weeks 4. I have enjoyed my meals without worrying about how I will feel after 5. I have looked forward to going to the gym because I feel that much better about my health 6. I haven’t forced myself to eat until my plate was clean The healthier ingredients I’ve been using have made me more self conscious about how much I eat because I’m living on that broke, college student budget. Changing my outlook from a negative “diet” to a positive “I’m going to fill my body with the best ingredients I can afford” has been everything to me. I am so excited to see where this takes me because this time, I can really say that i am ready to combat my eating disorder by accepting it and becoming one with it.""  I also think you should talk to a therapist just to have a really good vent and cry and unload all of this. Sometimes therapists can be helpful, sometimes not, but it's worth finding one just to see. A nutritionist could also be a good idea in terms of managing thyroid issues/PCOS.  You can always PM me if you need to talk, and I know it's annoying when people say this but please try to remind yourself you're beautiful and worthy regardless of what you weigh! 🖤🖤🖤  **ReplyShare**",False,False

We don’t get to chose our ED type, yanno? I’ve never thrown up but I really feel for those who purge, etc.   Your past IS NOT your future. I get really mad that I wasted my 20s being anxious and depressed and EDNOS and on and off restricting and wasn’t even underweight since I “recovered” from AN in high school. I get so mad that mental illness has stolen my super youthful years from me :( ofc I’m relapsing now in my 30s, so wtf.   The lack of support for BED is such fucking bullshit and I’m so sorry you are floundering and have to deal with this crap yourself. We don’t have the same ED and I’m really sorry I can’t straight up understand exactly what it feels to be you rn, but it just made me so sad to read your post so I wanted to shout out and say I hear your pain. I feel like the anguish of EDs is just so crippling and painful, that’s why we group together 💕  Do you have a therapist? I was wayyyy too scared to get one until this year but it’s actually been really nice so far. I told him all my crap and he wasn’t fazed - it’s nice to have a professional to talk to as well, who can help check destructive thoughts (or at least help you challenge the validity of them!)  Seriously, your body is NOT ruined. Hating your body does absolutely fucking suck, but it doesn’t mean you are doomed to be exactly where you are rn forever! Instagram reality can be helpful sometimes but also triggering af. :/ Idk, I’m rambling rn and idk if I’m making much sense, but I’m happy to listen and be an ear to vent on! (As I’m sure most others here are 💕)",False,False
