I won’t lie to you, it was fucking terrifying. But it was EXACTLY what I needed. I NEEDED to be reset, to be without my phone, to confront my disease in the presence of trained professionals. You are in my opinion making an incredibly brave decision. Treatment saved my fucking life and I’m sober today. Yes, it’s scary and unknown. But the discomfort means you’re growing. Growth is hella uncomfortable. It’s worth it. You’re worth it. Short term discomfort is a small price to pay!  I’ll be thinking of you and hoping for you. You can do this : ) (ps sorry for the total inspirational mom speech lmao)",False,False
