I was in recovery for like 10-11 months &amp; went from 82 lbs to 125 lbs, actually felt okay about it, partially cause I was really into the gym &amp; lifting weights, so I was still pretty lean, just looked really fit  honestly. I relapsed for various reasons I won't get into but now that I have decreased my calories by almost half and lost about 15 lbs from my recovery weight, I actually somehow feel fatter than I did at a higher weight during my last relapse a couple years ago. I don't understand that at all and it's really miserable.",False,False

They had a strained relationship to say the least and he feels deeply conflicted about her death.  “My mother is dead and everything is worse now because now there’s no chance for things to get better.”  I think that’s what you’re feeing right now. Weight at one point was a magical solution to all your problems and now that it’s proven not to be, you don’t have that promise of things getting better anymore.  But things will get better, even if they don’t seem like they will. Not because once you’re a certain weight it’ll all make sense and the world will start to shine, but because time passes.

I'm 6 pounds from a normal weight and it's so frustrating because when I was obese &amp; I was losing weight the healthy way I thought I would finally be happy, but when I first got into the overweight range I was sickened with myself. All that work and I'm still! fat! and! gross!   I was invisible when I was obese and you become so used to that. People would come up and introduce themselves to my friends and ignore me, no strangers made eye contact with me when I walked down sidewalks, people refused to acknowledge me and it was peaceful but I was so, so unhappy. Now cashiers make small talk, people make SO. MUCH. EYE CONTACT and I've had to learn how to carry conversations for more than 6 minutes because people aren't literally rushing to get away from me. it's exhausting and I'm still unhappy.  When I started restricting and fasting no one was concerned, it was easy to say I was on a diet, but now that I've lost a grand total of 90 lbs from my heughest weight I have to be SO careful around people. It's awful, and I'm so tired of losing weight but I've still got 50 pounds to go and it's horrible. I'm going to waste away and still be clumsy, awkward, and annoying. It's horrible but I can't stop.   It's been so long since I wasn't losing weight that it's part of my daily routine that the idea of not counting calories, of not going to bed hungry, of not being lightheaded and tunnel-visioned makes me panic. Despite all of my flaws, I've been able to do one thing right- starve, and since I know I'll still hate myself with a 16 BMI I cling to being proud of my consistency, commitment, and self control. If I'm not starving, then I really am just not good at anything.",False,False
