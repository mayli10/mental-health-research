Also, I find working and being productive actually makes me feel less hungry then when I sit around all day. I also LOVE to draw and collage. Although working at Starbucks makes me feel less hungry I still feel weak. Today, was especially difficult to the point that pumping the syrups took so much out of me. I hope I burned a lot of calories though.",False,False

Like it kickstarts my energy again somehow? My go-tos are caffeine, housework, going for walks, picking up shifts at my job, doing my own gel manicures( takes HOURS) and tackling projects I’ve been putting off. Feels like there’s always something I SHOULD be doing and getting it done gives me a huge boost.  But the correct answer is that we should probably just eat something.",False,False
