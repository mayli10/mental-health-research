I mostly just ignore it, I get mad at my mother because she is wild with it, like I am VERY nervous at restaurants, and my immediate family likes to go out a fair amount. My mother likes to ask me across the table what I am planning on ordering which invites the entire fam into this conversation about my food choices which makes me even more anxious, and I've told her SO MANY TIMES not to do this, but she does it regardless. So yeahhhh, we fight a lot ahahhaha       Tbh, my ED started back in 2008, and I cut out pork and beef in 2010/2011 and would only eat chicken and turkey, and went full veg in 2015, honestly, I got SO MUCH BETTER. It was the first time I actually was able to recover say I had actually ""recovered"" since 2008, and I think it was because I was able to feel a lot less guilty about the food I was eating, and when I say that I mean like ethical guilt, not my normal ""food guilt"".      The same thing happened a year ago when I started eating a close-to-vegan-type-diet. I have a yo-yo type relationship with recovery hahahahah doin' our best!",False,False

I got that SO much when I was underweight from everyone in my family and I have a BIG family. It just makes every single event with food SUPER stressful.  I'm so sorry.     The only thing you can do, if they don't listen to you when you ask them to not comment on your food, is to ignore them as much as you can.

I try to eat mostly vegan for ethical reasons, but because I am in recovery I try to be flexible, so when people ask me about my diet I say that I eat primarily plant-based and I try to eat vegan as much as I can. I'm not a pushy person I sincerely believe that no one should be shamed for their food choices, and that no one should feel guilty about what they are eating. Ever. Anyways; I try to be flexible with my ""label"" because if by some miracle, I feel like I have the courage to eat something, and that something is non-vegan, then I am going to do it because I am attempting to get better, and I am trying my very best not to restrict food (its a STRUGGLE but I'm doing my best) but the second I do, friends, family anyone around who knows me is like ""Um, you do know that's not vegan right?"" Sometimes I have actually had people yell at me because I was eating something that I felt brave enough to eat, and it's like bitchhhhhh???????? what?????? One time I had literally been fasting for \*too long\* and I had worked up the courage to eat a pop tart, and one of my friends (who of course isn't even vegetarian, and knows about my ED), literally tore me to shreds because it wasn't a vegan food item. Normally it's mostly my mother too which is SUPER frustrating (she is also not vegetarian or vegan). She literally goes ""well I'm only kidding."" but she knows how self-conscious those jokes make me because it draws the attention of everyone in the room to me and my food intake which makes me super nervous. She knows that I am trying to get better, and she knows that I try to keep my diet is pretty flexible. BUT shes also constantly ""you're too skinny"" ""You need to eat more"" ""how about a H A M B U R G E R. YOU NEED MEAT ON YOUR BONES""... Literally 10/10 vegetarian, 8/10 vegan....      Or even better, I'm here trying to get better, and I've finally brought myself to a healthy weight, I had a family dinner where I am the only vegg, and my only food option was potato, and half my family criticized me for not having enough food on my plate, but then good ol' grams got me with : ""You're starting to look fat, You're not really thinking of eating any potatoes tonight are you? You'll never lose any weight by eating that.""      TL/DR my family sucks bc they police my food and think its funny to draw attention to what I am brave enough to eat.",False,False
