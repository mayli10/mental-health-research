Then I feel guilt/shame bc I’m so jealous. Then I see a snap or pic and I vow to restrict more. Then I want to just unzip this meat suit I’m trapped in bc I can’t stand how it looks. And the whole time, I’m aware of how disordered this thinking is.",False,False

It’s not so much that she’s skinnier than me but we are around the same size and she’s blonde and 2 years younger and gorgeous. I kind of got mad at her the other day for posting a half naked pic on insta because I saw all these skeevy guys from the grad program I’m in commenting on and liking it. At first I thought it’s just bc I’m protective but maybe it’s also because I’m so insecure and worry that these guys in my program think she’s so much hotter than me. Also get this: when I was in residential ED treatment and she visited me, my friend was like “your sister is SO gorgeous!!!” It’s like yeah. I know.",False,False

I live with her so I see what she eats (soooo much junk) and how much she exercises (which she doesn't) but she's so effortlessly beautiful I can't help but get jealous... She looks like all the pictures I scroll through for 'thinspo'... I think I got handed the fat card and it's so upsetting",False,False
