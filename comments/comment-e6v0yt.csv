With my ex I would constantly try to downplay in order to avoid drawing attention to my ED. Then if he ever agreed with me, I'd get upset because he was agreeing that I'm not sick enough.  Me: ""Don't worry, it's really not that bad, I have it under control.""  Him: ""You're right, it's not that bad.""  Me: WHAT? Yes it is, clearly I'm sick and need help. Are you saying I'm not sick enough?!  &amp;#x200B;  Like what lol",False,False
