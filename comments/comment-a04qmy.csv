I found my sweet spot is to shop at Leviâ€™s, where they do it like menâ€™s jeans: waist and length!! I wore the same size in both styles that I bought. Never have I walked into a store, tried both jeans on, and walked out with both pairs within 20 minutes. Easiest and best experience of my life. And the quality is great for the price",False,False

I went to Macy's for black Friday bullshit and walked out with three pairs of size 5 jeans, but lmao those fucks are too small. BUT AT H&amp;M they fit gucci.  legit, one of my Macy's pants even had the waist size (28"") I needed, but it still didn't fit and I'm all, ""excuz I just measured my body. now I must fast"" but lolwait, jk, period crept up.   moral of the story: new clothes are hell. ðŸ™ƒðŸ™ƒðŸ™ƒ",False,False

Iâ€™ll find a store where the size is so much smaller than I can believe. Iâ€™ll even buy it. Wear it. And still believe in my heart of hearts that itâ€™s a lie. ,False,False
