I mean, I'm super nerdy and awkward and have been a destructive tornado of mental health issues......soooooo....very few friends at this point, but I do still have two friends that I'm connected to and that makes a world of difference. The post-facebook world can give this image of needing tons of connections...but even a few good friends can really impact a life.",False,False

My life has been really hitting rock bottom lately and I guess this is just what my mind's normal reaction is.  And I'll try and talk to him but idk if he will take it well. I just find what he did a bit odd and idk I don't want to get into discussion cus I feel like it seems at this point he wants a reason to get mad at me. I guess it's better to just distance myself though. Idk why I kid myself sometimes and think I'll ever have friends. People either stick around to use me or just say bye bye. Only place I felt accepted is this subreddit and I've only been here a few days.,False,True

Sounds like it’s stemming from their own issues and insecurities (and I suppose who knows what else is going on in their life).  Though even when I know someone’s anger is not my fault, having it directed at me can still be pretty distressing. I don’t have any great advice - if it were me I might just detach. If I really wanted to keep the relationship I might try to talk with them about what was really going on. Break out that good ol “I feel *** when *** because ***.  I’m sorry to hear you’re feeling suicidal. For me that usually stems from feeling overwhelming pain or weariness, which in a word, sucks. I hope you’ll keep reaching out - here, IRL, crisis lines, or just walking into the ER if necessary. For me, attempting has only led to a loss of freedom and giant bills...it’s gone much better to reach out for help first instead.",False,False
