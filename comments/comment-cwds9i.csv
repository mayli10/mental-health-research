For some reason I always weigh 2-3 pounds more in the morning than I do in the afternoon, regardless of drinking water or eating. I can't figure out how or why.",False,False

Weight can change a lot from day to day for a variety of reasons anyway... do you weigh with clothing on? That can make a big difference, as can the amount of water you're drinking.   My weight does the same thing, 3-5lbs difference each time I weigh. It's frustrating for sure.",False,False

If you’re female, regardless of whether you’re currently getting a period or not, your weight can vary up to 20lbs per month just from hormonal fluctuations alone.  You’ll weigh .5-3lbs more if you haven’t showered in a while. Showering helps reduce water weight.  You weigh 1-5lbs more at the end of the day than the second you wake up (whether you’ve eaten or not!) because when we sleep our cells rejuvenate and flush out toxins that can weigh you down. This is actually partially why we sweat so much when we sleep.  If you’ve exercised or done some sort of strenuous activity, you can weigh .5-5lb more because your muscles are holding onto nutrients and water that would otherwise be flushed out in order to heal themselves.  Between all of these factors, your weight gain could be easily explained away. You have not magically defied the laws of physics. Try not to worry about it because the weight you’re seeing definitely is not fat.   Here are some tips that could help prevent unnecessary worry in the future:  * Weigh first thing in the morning, after using the restroom. You can shower before you weigh and you’ll weigh less or drink a cup of coffee to encourage an early morning BM, but I personally prefer to wake up, pee, weigh.  * Shower the night before you weigh or, like I said above, you can also shower in the morning before you weigh if that’s how you prefer to shower.  * Don’t weigh after a sudden diet change. If you’ve suddenly started eating more or eating less healthy foods, the scales are going to go up even if you’re eating at a deficit or maintence.  * Try to only weigh if you’ve had a healthy BM within the last 12 hours preferably, 24 hours at most.  * This one may be difficult, but it’s the best possible way to accurate gauge your true weight loss/maintence trend when combined with the other tips. It’s also mentally healthy for you. Here it is: weigh at the same single point of your cycle every month. ~~When I wasn’t obsessing over my weight,~~ I weighed the day after my period stopped every month and only that day. I didn’t think about weight so much and my weight always did exactly what it was expected to do based on my intake. I’m not sure if this is possible for you, but you might decide it’s something worth working towards.",False,False
