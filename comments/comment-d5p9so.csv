That means you got so little nourishment that your heart, bones, skin, teeth, and various tissues are still breaking down. There isn't enough energy to fuel heartbeats properly, or enough raw material to maintain neural health     I don't say that to be scary, just to reassure you that you didn't do something bad. If 1090 is less of a restriction, I'm really really glad you restricted less. But that's still a major restriction, and you should definitely take a vitamin at least because 1090 is nowhere near enough to sustain life.     I'm sorry you're so hard on yourself. It's okay, I frikken pinkie swear.",False,False

I don't know what to tell you to convince you I'm being honest but from the pics I've seen of you, you're about as thin as you can be while still being healthy. And I'm someone who's pretty familiar with fitness! You're very pretty and don't need to be doing this to yourself. DM me if you wanna talk",False,False
