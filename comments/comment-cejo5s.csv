It’s a very tough place to be in bc transition seems to be the only “treatment” that’s seen as viable. I would look for gender critical women and detransitioned females to connect with. Detransitioned females have a lot of wisdom to share about truly accepting their bodies bc they went through all those changes before realizing that changing their body wasn’t helping their mental state. I used to be very upset by my breasts and my period — I can totally see how starving until those go away sounds like an appealing option! It sounds corny but reading Who Cooked the Last Supper? and learning about ancient religions that originally worshipped primarily femaleness helped me get over a lot of gender stuff. Going to female only spaces where I could see all kinds of women existing in their natural state unbothered by men also helped me become more comfortable with my female body.   It’s good that you can recognize your healthy part, and the part of you that is controlled by your ED. You should listen to your healthy brain telling you that it needs to end! Obviously it’s not going to be like you decide you’re done with it and never engage in serious behaviors, but you can decide to take the first step in that. Please please get a therapist. Tell a close friend or a family member that you are suffering. You need support in your life if you really want to fight this.  I believe in you.",False,False

I can't imagine how hard that must be. I don't have any sage wisdom for you but if you ever need to talk you can message me. I'm a good listener and occasionally something resembling good advice comes out of my mouth. Just remember that you aren't your body but you need your body in order to continue to be you. You have to take care of it or else you might lose yourself.,False,False
