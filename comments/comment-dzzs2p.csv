It‚Äôs weird how ED mindset has helped me figure out how to make 400-500 calories a very filling meal. When I was trying to do 1200-1500 i was so much hungrier and sadder about my meals.",False,False

Screw calorically dense food, I‚Äôll fight granola with my bare hands.  Vegetables are your friend! Recently my meals have mostly comprised of a mix of roasted and raw vegetables + an unholy amount of leafy greens. You get to eat so much (genuinely) and it keeps you full",False,False
