Cooking is one of the activities that I would gladly pay someone to do for me; if I could afford it.   Cooking not only requires patience (which I don't have), but I also consider it a waste of time (that I don't have). All this to ingest something I will probably not even enjoy since I'll feel guilty afterward... I admire people who like to cook and are happy to cook for others. They must save a lot of money too. I just can't.   I would rather just eat pre-packed things or go to a restaurant. Or even better, not eat anything. ",False,False

While Iâ€™m in school, friends want to do things spontaneously, so I always want to be prepared / not sweaty (but I WILL walk several miles to make up for it). I always always always make something healthy, though.",False,False
