I think whether or not I go fully vegan, I would never ever promote or be dogmatic about my diet/lifestyle the way I see a lot of vegan acquaintances do because my perception of food is forever warped lol (also tangentially- it‚Äôs always been super disturbing to me how many orthorexic and malnourished vegans esp. on YouTube are glorified AND the fact that a lot of their past eating disorders are never seen as relevant when it definitely is..... and they‚Äôre advocating their lifestyle to often really young people??? Bit of a rant sorry)  The social eating is also very tricky to navigate around because I have a lot of cultural attachments to certain foods and people that would make it very much of a dilemma to turn down food in specific circumstances :/  You‚Äôve definitely helped me realize I need to have more of a recovery mindset if I want to tackle this battle so thank you! There‚Äôs no doubt in my mind that I‚Äôd be doing this for the right reasons and not just a shitty disguise for my ED. I generally make eco and socially conscious decisions for as many aspects in my life as possible, so being vegan seems like a less daunting achievement in ethicality for me vs a lot of other things like fossil fuel and plastic consumption. When my ED is just background noise and I‚Äôm not being a complete fucking control freak, being plant based comes super easily (except the cultural thing), so I guess besides my health, the goal is for me to shift my guilt around food towards feeling guilty over supporting a horrible industry rather than guilt about calories and illogical fear foods, and basically choose my health and morals over my ED.

Before that, I was pescatarian for about 3 years. While I was transitioning to pescatarian, I spent approximately 6 months eating NO meat during the week, and eating ANYTHING on weekends. It gave me a chance to get used to balancing nutrition, cooking without using meat as a flavor crutch to make other food taste better, exploring all the food options I never touched before (Lentils! Jackfruit! Edamame! Curry! etc) because as a meat eater I ate the same dozen staple American meals over and over (Chicken breast! Ground beef! Pepperoni pizza!) ad nauseum. I had to re-learn how to cook. I had to find restaurants, both fast/ cheap and also fancy, which have options for my diet(Taco fucking Bell!). This all takes time. It is hard and weird at first. Seriously, it‚Äôs OK to ease into it.  Above all, remember this: *It is NOT ‚Äúall or nothing.‚Äù Eating **less** meat, eating **fewer** animal products, is a good and worthy pursuit. Eating just one meal with no meat, or no animal products, is a victory.*   Better for you, better for the animals, better for the planet.   Make sure you‚Äôre getting a balance of macronutrients. Especially complete proteins!! Fat doesn‚Äôt make you fat; it‚Äôs just a macro. And it fills you up so you eat less.   You‚Äôre great. Follow your good heart ‚ô•Ô∏è ",False,False

I feel kind of uncomfortable about the ED/veganism connection, mainly because I feel like I'm making veganism ~look bad by having an ED too. I don't find veganism restrictive, personally. I don't have any desire to eat animal products, and when I'm eating more normally I have a pretty varied diet. I've gained weight as a vegan, lost weight as a vegan, maintained and just about everything else, depending on how badly my EDs been flaring up. I don't see veganism as being tied, or even connected to my ED. HOWEVER. I do see how people could try to switch to veganism for the wrong reasons/when they're not in the right state of mind and really having it backfire.

I‚Äôve always felt vegans were ‚Äúright‚Äù but it was never an issue i cared about deeply either, especially as i got further into my disorder and began to lose empathy for any being. it‚Äôs a decision i felt it limited me when i tried for recovery (unfortunately that didn‚Äôt work out).  my opinion is VERY controversial in the vegan community (hence why i don‚Äôt practice what i preach) but i think in 9/10 cases, people with restrictive eating disorders shouldn‚Äôt be vegan. not because veganism is always a way to avoid food, but because when you‚Äôre in that headspace it‚Äôs impossible to trust your own reasoning. if veganism is meant to limit harm to all beings, i think people should wait until after recovery.  to expand on why i think it‚Äôs harmful, veganism allows people with eds two things 1) to turn down foods in social situations while remaining undetected and 2) it gives them a community where it is acceptable to talk and obsess over the details of food. of course vegans aren‚Äôt inherently disordered, but as a result of the lifestyle you necessarily have to plan your diet, take supplements, look up menus, check food labels, etc.  if you truly think you‚Äôre morally motivated, go for it! but also keep in mind that the movement has to be very careful at promoting a healthy, well-planned diet. if you don‚Äôt think that you‚Äôd be capable of that, please reconsider. it‚Äôs both harmful to the image of veganism and (more importantly) your health as certain nutrients that can be obtained on a restrictive omni diet can‚Äôt be obtained on a restrictive vegan diet.   if you have any questions about veganism with an ed, just ask :) ",False,False
