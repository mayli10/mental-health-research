To be honest my derm  said it needs to be taken with oily food which I was like.... bruh. And I was trying to fast too! So some days I'd eat keto like have a bit of avo, or PB or a bit of full fat milk.   My family actually doesn't eat much oily food so we asked him if it's ok to just have with a fish oil pill instead and he said that should be fine :) So I stuck by that route and found it worked for me (+ added benefit of the fish oil for the smarts lmao)",False,False

The main concern is that a fat-soluble pill won't get absorbed unless you take it with food that has fat.,False,False
