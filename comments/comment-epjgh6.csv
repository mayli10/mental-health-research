I ate almost an hour ago and I’ve yet to feel the heated bubbles disrupt my peace... 🤢😩  But seriously, I feel that. It’s absolutely horrible. I’d rather be sick (like flu sick) than make sure I have a healthy relationship with food head-on. Or at least have to consistently manage myself. It just sucks that it feels just “easier” this way. When it’s been bad, I’ve caught myself thinking how it’d be so much nicer if instead of b/p there was a switch in our brains that was like “okay, after I eat this food, I’d like to get rid of it from the other end as soon as possible, ty!” I didn’t even enjoy anything I managed to eat this whole time either. Sorry for the rant.",False,True

I have thoughts in my head and you all just pour them out before I can say them.   Im currently fighting off the flu and I'm miserable but all I can think about is how much this is going to supercharge my weightloss lol,False,False

I'm really lax (no pun intended) about proper refrigeration and food hygiene, because I'd love to get sick for a week. Isn't that horrible?",False,False
