You‚Äôre such a great and genuine person for putting in the effort to learn more about EDs to help your girlfriend through her struggles - the world needs more kind, patient and understanding people like you! I hope she stays strong and it sounds like she will with you by her side üíï",False,True

I try not to calorie count because I have a history of getting obsessive with the numbers. I do try to have a guestimate, but it‚Äôs hard to trust that my weight will stabilise (which I know deep down takes time) or that I won‚Äôt gain fat because of my obsession with stepping on the scale multiple times throughout the day and seeing the number fluctuate :(  My after-vacation challenge is to reduce my reliance on the weighing scale - hopefully I‚Äôll keep to it!   A great piece of advice my boyfriend has given me is to put yourself outside your comfort zone at least once everyday. It has helped me progress exponentially because all it really takes is to put yourself outside your comfort zone once (eg eating a fear food, drinking lots of water, eating a snack you didn‚Äôt plan for) and going through and overcoming the emotions it inevitably comes with. I hope it helps you too! All the best! üíï",False,True

I really appreciate it and hope that we‚Äôll both be able to continue taking steps forward in recovery. I‚Äôve been trying to drink water freely while on vacation, and can see that I‚Äôve been going to the toilet more and more (10-12 times a day vs an average of 5-6) and losing more overnight! Gotta trust our bodies, I guess üòä All the best too, my dear!",False,True

If you are restricting water intake you will retain it and can cause further damage in the long run from dehydration.   If you are not eating more calories than you burn by living (and taking the pilates burn into account) you will not gain and gain. There will be gains at first until you stabilize. Weight will fluctuate, it‚Äôs what it does. It‚Äôs not a definite thing.   In my experience it is best to stay away from tracking your calories if you are attempting recovery because it can trigger a relapse but if you are very afraid of weight gain, look up what your approximate TDEE and BMR would be to get a range of how much you should eat to maintain. Add the extra calories that the pilates will burn and add further if you want to gain muscle.   I am currently trying to loosely start recovery after failing at it for the past few years and my best advice is to start combatting your habits immediately. Reduce the reliance on the scale until you can go a few days totally forgetting to do it. Try foods out of your comfort zone (don‚Äôt need to right away) and pay close attention to how your body reacts to different things.",False,False

Reading your story reminded me a lot of my girlfriend who seems to be going through a similar situation. I‚Äôve been lurking these subs on and off the last few months to learn and understand more about EDs and I‚Äôm grateful to find someone else that faces similar obstacles.  I just want to say stay strong and well done on how far you‚Äôve come! I hope someone pulls through with the advice you need.  ‚ù§Ô∏è,False,False

I weigh myself constantly and I‚Äôm obsessed with figuring out how even *water* intake affects my wake-up weight. Thank you for sharing your story. I wish you the best of luck ‚ô•Ô∏è",False,False
