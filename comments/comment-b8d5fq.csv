Ask yourself if you'd punish someone else by starving them. If you were raising a kid and they made a mistake, would you starve them for it?  Would you kill them for it?  Would you make your child have to earn every meal?  People should earn luxuries and joys. Not basic survival.",False,False

There are neutral foods that can do this. It's mostly going to be meat, eggs and offal though. An off-day meal could be liver and scrambled eggs, with the scrambled eggs being bulked out with heavy whipping cream. Neither appealing nor unappealing, if you ""dis-hate"" the taste of liver, and should have at least most of the nutrients you need (vitamin C, thiamine and magnesium might be a bit of a question mark). On an on day, you can expand it with tomatoes, meat, fried mushrooms, fried asparagus, really anything. The side should be a cup of clear tea.  Carbs? Have them if you want. If you find they're a trigger to disordered behaviours, you probably don't want them. I didn't have an ED but I was dealing with something of a carb addiction over a year ago. Fixing it took me off of the road that I was on, which was to binge-eating disorder and diabetes.",False,False

Get very bland, unappealing foods that I would never buy or don't like for when I fall into this mindset. I think I can trick myself into thinking thats another kind of punishment by eating that, if that makes sense? Only trouble is, now I have to figure out what foods I genuinely don't like ... (Before my ED, and during lapses of normalcy, I tend to be a very unpicky and adventurous eater. The only food I don't like is pickles... Will have to expand on that)",False,True

I'm completely the same, where my brain can't seem to truly understand that I genuinely need food to keep going. I enjoy it, so I must not need it seems to be my rationalization. I'm constantly thinking of myself as a glutton, any desire I feel has to be gluttonous. So even a desire for food falls into that category. ",False,True

I feel like anything I eat is an extra treat and unnecessary, as if I'm eating it on top of the calories comsumed to meet my TDEE. If I have coffee in the morning, I'm okay with it because my order is 200ish calories, but that's my reward/treat for the day and if I want another snack or meal later it's because I'm a glutton and have no self discipline.  I don't look at food as something I need to survive anymore, it's just something that brings me pleasure and I need to highly moderate my intake because I don't deserve that much pleasure.
