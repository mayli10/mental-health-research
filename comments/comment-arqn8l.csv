My last therapist was amazing and really helped me find coping skills for my anxiety and depression and helped me increase my self-awareness (which is half the battle for me). However, I haven't been back to therapy since I developed my eating issues and I dunno if I can go back to the same person. Or at all. You get out of it what you put into it, so you have to really want to get help for it to be effective. ",False,False

I think it can be helpful, but only if you're totally comitted to the process and open to what your role will have to be. I was never that open to it so it didn't do me any good, but I acknowledge that was mostly my own choice. ",False,False
