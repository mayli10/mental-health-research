I'm your mum now, ok? &gt;!I understand you're struggling and doing the best you can given your circumstances, and tho sometimes I might be angry about unrelated things (or even angry that I can't seem to help you and I'm worried about you! But that's about me and my feelings, it's not your fault at all) I would never take it out on you. You're going through a seriously difficult time and it would be low and disrespectful of me to use it against you just to win an argument I'd rather not be having in the first place. It's a difficult time and I want to be there for you so you can make it out OK. We're in this together.!&lt;",False,False
