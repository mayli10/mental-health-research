I viewed it as the last significant step in the recovery process, a palpable accomplishment that meant I was “recovered.” It was only when I realized that it was better to be open with someone (told the current person I’ve been seeing about my problems with an ED on the second date) that dating became manageable.   I very rarely purge, but binge eating is still something I struggle with... which makes dating hard.",False,False
