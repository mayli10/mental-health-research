My psych said I could take it whenever I wanted and never specified to take it with food, but now I'm paranoid and def think I should take it during a meal. I had no idea zoloft could be that painful.     I actually didn't know that about antidepressants and restriction. :O And I was vague with her when she asked about my relationship with food..hmm ok THANK YOU &lt;3 ",False,True

Or take some eno or fruit salts (powder that fizzes in water to make you burp and helps with stomach acid)   Hope you feel better soon xx,False,False
