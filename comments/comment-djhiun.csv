People always called me fat, and was bullied for being ugly. The boys I liked, when found out I liked them, would tell me that they would never even consider me. I never thought I was pretty back then, but when I lost weight, I suddenly got attention from boys, (funny how those boys who said they would never consider me are in my DMs now) and got compliments about how pretty I was. It’s so sad that now that I’m thinner, I’m suddenly “beautiful”. At 5’6, 116 lbs, I look nothing like I did back then. Personally, I do think I have a pretty face, but because of my past, I am terrified of gaining weight, in fear of being considered ugly again.",False,False

I’ve always been called hideously ugly and have never received any sort of complement on my appearance. I’ve been bullied about my appearance my whole life. I can’t change how disgustingly non-human I look, but i can make myself thin. Maybe then I’d have at least one redeeming quality.",False,False

Some other people laughed with him.  A few months later he committed suicide because I guess he was just horribly depressed.  Anyway, he’d never see what I look like now.  I always wonder if he’d still find me repulsive today if he were around but I’ll never know.    Now I have a hard time thinking I am attractive.  Some people say I am pretty, beautiful, gorgeous and the compliments feel good for about 5 minutes.  It’s weird because with my body I know it looks awesome when I am thin.  That is clear as day to me, no question about it.  My face however...I don’t know.  The word *repulsive* just stays in the back of my mind at all times.  There’s no point to this comment, I just get how you feel.",False,False

I picked apart every single feature in the mirror until I avoided looking as much as possible. I have dealt with hating my face for so many years and I have finally started to accept it. Mainly because I got into using makeup and learned to appreciate my features through artistic expression. But I still am very far from loving my face. From sleep and nutrition issues along with my pale skin I have the worst dark circles and I look sickly without concealer. I do feel like getting skinny and in good shape compensates for my short height and lack of attractiveness. It keeps my face from being as bloated and it helps me be confident. It is a journey of acceptance. Sending good thoughts your way.,False,False
