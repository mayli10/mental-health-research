They are (hopefully) calibrated and zero-ed before you get in but any additional blankets or pillows will count as weight.   But definitely IV fluids weigh a lot! Last time I was in the hospital I was bolused with two liters and weighed 10 pounds more when I got home.,False,False

At least I'll get the best woosh of my life (hopefully. Please.) They've had me on steroids the past week too so that causes water retention too. I still ordered a new scale and I may or may not be double checking my math to see if I can be under weight by my birthday.",False,True

I arrived in an ambulance because my blood pressure was so low that I wasn't able to stay fully conscious, so what do they do? They IV bolus a FUCK TON of fluid to try to get that pressure up. I was admitted and moved to a bed with a built-in scale, and the number I saw was literally so much higher than I ever could have expected. I completely broke down.  But here's the thing. IV fluids weigh *so much more* than you realize.  After I got home, over the course of less than a week, I literally lost 15 pounds. And I wasn't even actively restricting, because I was so terrified I wouldn't fully recover from the infection and die or something. It was all water weight. I was seriously peeing like a monster.  I can pretty much guarantee your post-IV weight is not an accurate reflection of your normal day-to-day weight.",False,False

It sucks to be ambushed with the numbers like that when you couldn’t prepare for it.   It sounds like they weighed you with clothes on etc, and maybe not first thing in the morning. It’s really unlikely that it’s your true weight.",False,False
