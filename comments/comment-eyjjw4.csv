And I feel like I look even fatter than I started? Even though I must have been bigger, I lost 19 lbs and I'm back 10, but I feel it so physically, I feel so much bigger and my clothes feel so much tighter! And it feels like losing those 10 lbs I gained back is so impossible because all I want to do is eat and get drunk. Otherwise I just feel so hungry and so empty.   I'm sorry you're here too.",False,False
