My stuff started the second week and went until almost seven weeks inâ€” I was repulsed by the way food smelled/tasted/felt which on top of the nausea was miserable. Everything i take that can fuck up my stomach will, but this was an emotional thing that sent me spiraling. Even with that said loss of appetite and stomach problems are a reaction thatâ€™s only documented in 2% of patients. Try to stay on top of it in the meantime and track your symptoms (writing down a log of what happens at what time etc) and please please talk to your doctor and/or parents about this before it possibly develops further.",False,False
