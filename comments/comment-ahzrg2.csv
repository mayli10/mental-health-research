Short lived though because very soon they were too big and the extra cup material just looked stupid. I need to get some pasties so I can just go braless though they are still big enough that's probably not appropriate. I love bralettes now and refuse to waste more money on nice bras :(,False,False

Iâ€™m refusing to buy new clothes because I canâ€™t face the trauma of shopping, and Iâ€™m kind of enjoying hiding in baggy stuff.   Iâ€™ve switched to dresses with tights instead of leggings because at least the tights fit ðŸ˜†",False,False
