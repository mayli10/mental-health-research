It genuinely sucks. It's like I'm there but I'm constantly justifying it with ""I'll stop tomorrow and restrict back how I used to"".  Never happens. Hours and money wasted. It's so depressing.",False,False

I underate consistently for a long while until something in my brain just snapped, and now I get binge urges every day, and every single time I eat. It’s a nightmare.

I tried intuitive eating and gained twenty pounds which makes me at five five look so fat. Yeah it gets harder and harder. I used to be able to restrict so easily and now not eating cookies for breakfast is a win and then I just binge them later. I wish I never tried to recover,False,False
