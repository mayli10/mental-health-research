This part, though,  &gt;However, just like we're not going to stop prescribing short rounds of opioids for broken bones,  I think it's important to note that one of the greatest ills of ""diet culture"" is that it indiscriminately proposes weight loss as the solution to all problems, including to and for women who really do not need to lose weight. There's the sense that no one is ever really good enough, that you've always got to be on guard for excess calories, etc. *Even if you're not overweight.*  We don't hand out opioids to the population at large, telling them, ""Just take a little tiny bit every day, just in case you think you might be developing a hairline fracture.""

On the flip side, I am now firmly in anorexia territory once again, and yet I don't think I look as underweight as my BMI would seem to indicate. No one has expressed any concern. I've seen a couple of doctors in the past few months and no one's brought up my low weight or vitals or anything.

In fact, there is a neurobiological basis to eating disorders, where being in a state of negative energy balance (whether through intentional restriction, illness, or other cause) triggers a cascade of physiological changes that create and sustain disordered eating behaviors.   ""Individuals with eating disorders may have distinct responses to energy restriction and food consumption. For example, individuals with AN may have a paradoxical response to negative energy balance (i.e., taking in less energy than one expends, ([Bulik, 2016](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5711426/#R24)), such that caloric intake is associated with dysphoric mood ([Frank, 2012](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5711426/#R66)), whereas caloric restriction evokes a calming, anxiolytic, or euphorigenic effect ([Bulik, 2016](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5711426/#R24); [Kaye, 2008](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5711426/#R98); [Kaye, Wierenga, Bailer, Simmons, &amp; Bischoff-Grethe, 2013a](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5711426/#R101)). Non-typical responses to other behaviors such as physical activity and purging (as both positively and negatively reinforcing) are also reported in individuals with eating disorders ([Berg et al., 2013](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5711426/#R17); [Giel et al., 2013](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5711426/#R79); [Kaye, 2008](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5711426/#R98); [Klein et al., 2010](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5711426/#R114)).

Similarly, many, many, MANY for-profit diet plans that are ""sold"" (either thru purchased supplements/foods, thru purchased support groups, thru purchased access to methodology, etc.) rely on unsustainable, somewhat disordered eating patterns.   So it's somewhat of a meaningless tautology to say ""dieting increases your risk of ED,"" because many for-profit diets promote ED behavior. After all, they lose you as a customer if you have a truly comfortable, sustainable relationship with food. If anything, they are priming you for the next thing they want to sell you. it's conditioning, both from the food and diet industry, to keep you a customer for life. Just like the pharmaceutical industry - it's much more profitable to MANAGE diabetes with a lifetime of blood glucose monitoring and medication than it is to CURE diabetes.  Telling me ""you're 18x more likely to have ED behavior if you go on a diet is like telling me that people who go outside are at an 18X risk of sun exposure. It might be true, but it's sort of dumb, and not useful, and I still gotta go outside, and maybe a small amount of sun exposure, monitored and controlled, is actually normal?  I bristle pretty aggressively at the medical community's hypercompartmentalization of ED acknowledgment and treatment, too. you can have the most devastatingly upsetting relationship with food, but only after certain physical markers occur (e.g. your weight gets too low or too high, you initiate self-harm behavior) do they snap into action and intervene and take you seriously, often months or years after the dangerous patterns have had a chance to take hold and become ""normal"" of ""comfortable"" for the person suffering.  I'll also say - maybe lots of those people going on diets already had ED or ED behavior. maybe going on a diet just makes you 18x more likely to acknowledge that you've had an ED all along, since most/almost all diets include acknowledging, focusing on, and attempting to change your relationship/behavior surrounding food.
