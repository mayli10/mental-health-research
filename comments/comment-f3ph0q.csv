But here in EU the nutritional labels are for 100 gr most of the time, not per serving.   I can assure you that 560 calories is per 100gr of chocolate, which is the equivalent of a whole tablet of chocolate. Usually the small thumb sized pieces are about 10 gr, so you ate 56 Calories, not 560.",False,False

That is not uncommon in Switzerland, if I remember rightly from the last time I was there. 560 Calories is a pretty average amount of calories for 100 g of chocolate. If you know how much the chocolate weighed, you could work out how many calories it was.  But it definitely wasn't 560 Calories for that little chocolate, I know I can't really reassure you, but I hope you feel a bit better soon.",False,False
