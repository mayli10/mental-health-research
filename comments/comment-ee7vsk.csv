Is it over scars?   If itâ€™s small and not over scars, then yep protein bar should be sufficient. If itâ€™s going to be larger, and itâ€™s your first, and/or itâ€™s over scars, Iâ€™d strongly suggest having something with more calories/carbs/sugar.   I got my 9th tattoo recently, it took 2.5 hours, and I ate 4 lollies and a muesli bar before. Keep in mind that by my 9th tattoo I know how my body responds and what I need.",False,False

I donâ€™t know how common that is - maybe my response was atypical - but depending on where youâ€™re at with SH it might be worth having a self-care plan in place just in case.   Food wise, Iâ€™d agree having something beforehand makes sense. Iâ€™d maybe bring a quick-energy type snack along, especially if itâ€™s a longer appointment. Again â€˜just in caseâ€™. Hope the tattoo turns out great!",False,False
