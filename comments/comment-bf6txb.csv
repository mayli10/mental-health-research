Finally went after 3 years and I had 1 cavity filled but they told me I have like 4 more that will need to be filled if I don't floss religiously. So they're gonna need to be filled because no amount of floss can save my teeth from bile and sugar lol,False,False

But it occurred to me that  having them diagnosed is better than blissful ignorance because it means I'll get them take care of sooner rather than later. Just wish I'd never caused them in the first placeðŸ˜­,False,True
