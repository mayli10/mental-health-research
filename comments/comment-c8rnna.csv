I had friends in HS when we first struggled with our EDs and they were 5'0, and could easily get below 100 lbs....I felt like such a fucking whale when I worked &amp; worked and still never broke into the double digits.  These days, I see people who have the same body as I do (from what others tell me) as fit/thin and people who are medically underweight as thin. Everyone else is a mesh of ""average"" to ""\_\_\_\_\_\_"".   Not cool, very distorted &amp; totally unhelpful!",False,False
