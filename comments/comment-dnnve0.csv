So, the simplest explanation is that the TDEE number is simply underestimating your current energy needs.   (Nerding out a little...) To wit, the biggest component of TDEE is BMR. The Mifflin St-Jeor equation is the one I see used the most, but lots of equations have been proposed over the years. Why? Because (as I understand it) the equations are essentially a curve fit to BMRs from study participants. And that curve fit can be optimized for all sorts of different populations. (The best prediction equation for say, tall folks with low body fat might be different from Mifflin St-Jeor.) Basically, the common equation isn’t necessarily a great predictor for all populations, much less all individuals.",False,False
