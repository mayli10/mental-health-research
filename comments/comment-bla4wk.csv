Just yesterday I was going to eat pizza since my parents both yelled and texted for me to come downstairs. I grabbed one slice and my dad told me I was gonna get fat if I ate that. Even though it's a joke, comments like that still hurt. I've grown up with my mom talking about my sisters and calling them fat behind their backs which is probably part of the reason behind why I'm obsessed with how much I eat. Eventually you just have to realize that you're better. It sounds hard but you have to ignore what they tell you and live your own life. Please don't let this define you or control your mind ❤",False,False

I know it sounds silly but don’t let them control you this way. Stay strong ❤️",False,False
