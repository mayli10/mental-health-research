I'm not quite sure either but I've been using a TDEEspreadsheet which is a bit volatile and it will give me anywhere from 1450-1700, often somewhere in thr 1500-1625 week though. Lower numbers tend to come out when I had some bad eating days and get bloated with water weight. I've only seen numbers in the 1700s recently.  1389 felt like a lot last night but I think I'll see if I can take a bit of time to get comfortable with 1300-1400 or if my weight is still dropping to bump. Since CICO still applies I want to try and increase my weight slowly and more steadily instead of all at once but I may wind up working against myself.",False,True

Even if it takes some time to see your doctor, I think it would be a really good step to do. Talking to someone about creating a meal plan you can slowly increase would be good too. As far as gaining ""real"" weight goes, CICO still applies. You will have to eat at a surplus to gain weight and restore your menstrual cycle. Not sure what your maintenance calories are, but eating at least 1500 is a good goal to start with. Best of luck to you &lt;33 it's not an easy journey but it's so worth it.",False,False
