If you really want to talk to her about it, maybe you should ease into it or wait for her to start a conversation, and listen to how she feels, without giving advice, or telling her what she should/shouldn't do. At least thats what i wanted when i was seeking help. I just wanted to be heard. I hope this helps you in some way ^^.",False,False
