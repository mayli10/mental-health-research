It's even harder when you live in one for months and then get discharged, and you're left completely alone. I've been discharged for less than two months but I've been missing it the whole time. I kinda want to get sent back.",False,False

Itâ€™s good to have some perspective on it though! Thank you for sharing ðŸ¥°,False,True

If you fit the textbook temperament a littler better than I do it might actually give you what you want though. I just can't relate to the common perfectionism, desire for control, competitiveness/ambitiousness, etc. I was really jealous tbh, and I always felt like an intruder in group sessions because my experience was so opposite.

Like when I did php, I hated it because I felt like I was missing out on life. And I was fucking broke. But now I miss it so much because the folks there got it. They didnâ€™t yell at me for not wanting to eat and caring about my appearance. They challenged my disorder thoughts in a kind, helpful way. For this reason, I really want to go to an ed support group but Iâ€™m afraid that because Iâ€™ve relapsed, Iâ€™ll be shunned. ðŸ™ƒðŸ˜…",False,False
