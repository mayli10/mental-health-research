Firstly the saving calories for drinking, like theres no way I caneat and include alcohol as well. Needs to be one or the other. I get genuinely angry internally at my partner for ordering food I like or offering it to me. It's completely ridiculous, because he's just being nice. I've done the exact same before, leaving and crying. Even watching others eat is too much sometimes. Or the smell of their food. Its so hard, but I just can't eat it. why why why.",False,False
