It's fine, hun. I know the anxiety about moving up in sizes and numbers. I HATE numbers. I gone up the scale this week and it's driving me into an anxiety attack but I'm just trying to chill out and continue on my ""diet"" and workout. It's tough but we have a whole life ahead of us so we might as well take every step rationally and with some form of self love.",False,True

I had to pick a dress for the funeral. I picked a dress in my ""usual"" size and they didn't fit. One after the other. I held it down and cried after I got home. I had to go up 2 sizes.  Trying to shop online scares me. I try clothes on and they never fit.",False,False

I'd rather get clothes that's too big so if I grow into it, at least it won't feel like a fail on my end... But I like tight clothes and I feel like I should be taking advantage of wanting to dress dainty and ""hot"" while I feel good about my body (which is like once a week). Maybe we should stick to dresses? haha",False,True

I tried on something and it was too small but she insisted on seeing it. When I opened the dressing room door she laughed, it was such a big deep belly laugh everyone in the area looked to see what was going on. That was 6 years ago and I honestly don't think I'm gonna be okay with trying on clothes while shopping ever again.",False,False

I too have horrors over the idea of buying something and then someday *not fitting it*.  And it is tough when you deal with size fluctuations, just on a practical level. It's hard to think about amassing a wardrobe when it feels less like buying clothes and more like collecting possibilities, contingencies, good luck charms, emergency gear....shit's just rough all around.",False,False

I fully embraced the ""skater/punk"" chick style of late 90s-mid 00s much to her horror üòÇ.  Worked fairly well with my ED lizard brain too. Walk in store, grab size my brain is convinced I am, get home and realize they're too big. Tbh, I probably didn't choose that stlyle. More like fell into in by accident.  But yeah. Always hated shopping. It's not fun. It's not relaxing. It's hell. Even before ED I was a thinnish (way too) tall for my age kid. Shopping was my least favorite thing to do.
