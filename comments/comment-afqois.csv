Unfortunately I live in an illegal state so I canâ€™t really pick whether itâ€™s going to be indica or sativa when I get it   I kept myself sidetracked with video games and didnâ€™t eat anything but the next time I smoked I ate one thing and then ended up eating everything lmao",False,True

And while I'm high I just constantly get distracted and forget it and have to reheat it in the microwave. But its warm in my stomach and tastes good I love it.  I will not watch TV while high unless I have something to eat otherwise I'll be obsessed the whole time. Mostly I smoke sativa which gives me energy and I use it to clean or read a book or go for a walk. I only use indica if I'm ready to go to sleep.,False,False

I'm resisting the urge to make recommendations bc I'm sure you know what you're doing but I love smoking weed. It helps so much with my anxiety and stress especially during school. And that would make me crazy.,False,False

But even drinking water will send me into full on munchy mode &amp; I canâ€™t stop ðŸ˜¹",False,True

I had to stop smoking because I got a job that did random drug tests, but then I transferred and started smoking again. Gained 10-15 lb in 2 months. I'll be heading to the kitchen for food and I have to stop and think, ""Bitch, you're not even hungry???"" and go find something to distract me. I've been meaning to have some healthy snacks on hand just for the munchies but lol haven't gotten around to it",False,False
