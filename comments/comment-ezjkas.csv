The effects of the implant definitely depend on the individual person, both my friend and I have been very fortunate to have no real adverse effects, but I feel as long as you're mindful of CICO it won't impact you - as in it won't make you more metabolically sensitive to weight gain.",False,False

Because you hear so many bad reviews about gaining a bunch of weight on it all of a sudden and then there's the few, like in your case, who it doesn't affect in regards to weight. Of course, every body type is different and will react to things differently but still. The implant seems to have a lot of weight related issues tied to it.",False,True

No cravings or fluid retention.  However, because it's altered my menstrual cycle I can no longer pinpoint and justify what's period bloat or not until I've become more familiar with my new cycle patterns - which is a bit anxiety inducing for me.",False,False

I‚Äôd describe it as a ‚Äúsharp cramp‚Äù if that makes any sense lol. As the OBGYN explain to me- I‚Äôve never been pregnant and nothing has ever been in my cervix before, so the motion of trying to add this foreign object to a space that has never been touched before was very foreign and my body was trying to reject it. I didn‚Äôt know what I was in for and didn‚Äôt take any ibuprofen or anything else, and I literally almost shit myself. Don‚Äôt want to scare you, but definitely want you to be as prepared as possible! Take ibuprofen, Xanax if you can, and relax as much as possible. I know some people don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs as bad as I thought it was, but you can never be over prepared! It helps knowing you only have to go through it once while the benefits last years :) good luck and you‚Äôll handle it like a champ!!",False,False

The most common side effects are heavier + longer periods. My periods were already long and heavy and I didn‚Äôt notice a significant change. I‚Äôve had it around 7 months and first few periods I did notice increased bloating but it‚Äôs mostly gone now  I love my iud but it‚Äôs different for everyone",False,False

I got my first at 17, and replaced it at 21 with a Kyleena, a 5 year very low dose one.    The first time they didn‚Äôt offer me anaesthetic and it was the most painful thing I‚Äôve ever experienced, but with my second they did and TAKE IT. ASK FOR IT if they don‚Äôt offer it. It made it just mild discomfort and weird feeling?? But not painful. You will be scared to shit for a couple of days after insertion but it‚Äôs safe lol.    The first one I got I spotted for about 3 months which sucked, I went through soooo many pantyliners, it was so wasteful. But since then my periods have lightened significantly. I get less acne around my periods, and maybe less severe mood swings but I have PMDD so that‚Äôs pretty hard to measure. It had no effect on my weight loss, I was able to lose ~60 and ~40lbs with it at different points. I have gained since those losses but that‚Äôs def not to do with the IUD, that‚Äôs my own shit. I don‚Äôt get any particular cravings, but I do have EDNOS that is primarily BED but again that is not IUD related. For me it‚Äôs had no weight/eating impact, positive or negative.    It‚Äôs one of the most reliable methods of contraception, I love that I have to pay it essentially zero attention for the 5 years it‚Äôs in.",False,False

Is like a cramping pain but extreme or is it sharp? I have a high pain tolerance so I can handle cramps but sharp pains turn me into a major wimp. I heard that you can Ibuprofen beforehand so I wonder if that would help alleviate the pain in a preemptive way?,False,True

It sucked getting it put in and the first few months you will probably notice your PMS changes a lot due to the new hormones floating around in there. Your period will also be very different - you'll get random light bleeding the first few months, but after all that, your period drops off significantly, which has been great. You'll still get PMS symptoms and related bloating each month.   Thankfully it hasn't impacted my weight or my ability to lose long term. Definitely some bloating when it was first put in but it went away for me.",False,False

To me though, it is absolutely worth it. I‚Äôd rather see a little bit of bloating while knowing that it‚Äôs keeping me ‚Äúsafe‚Äù than the alternatives. I love my IUD, and knowing that the bloating is from that helps my Ed mindset as well!",False,False
