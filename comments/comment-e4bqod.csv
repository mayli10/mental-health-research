Sometimes they’re hurtful completely without meaning to be (though other times being a jerk *is* a factor). Plus the whole “attention seeking” question always drives me up the wall. I want to shout at them, *”YOU ARE MISSING THE POINT”* (but mostly I just kinda shut down).  After interactions like that, I try to affirm for myself that I don’t need to amp up hurting myself just because someone hurt me...but since when was this ever about sense... It’s hard.",False,False
