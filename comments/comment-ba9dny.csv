I’ve found that real foods help me a lot to not binge. Like today for brealfast I had an acia smoothie bowl pack, a daily greens crystalized superfood pack, maca, hemp seeds, and freeze dried strawberries. Lunch was egg whites and ketchup. Dinner was a kale and purple cabbage salad woth chicken and toasted sesame dressing. I snacked on 2 pieces of cinnamon raisin ezekiel toast with a thin spreak of amond butter, more cinnamon, topped with apple chips and some dried mango. All together about 800 calories. I feel satasfied, all my food was yummy, and I’m not at all bloated or feeling bad. I fueled my body and mind and am still losing weight/living a healthy lifestyle. I allowed myself to eat during my intermittent fasting window and had no incline to binge because I’m not being to restrictive or making myself only eat bland food and day dreaming about all the things I can’t eat.",False,False

Like obviously ultra low cal is appealing but it ultimately 87.99% of the time leads to binging. For me personally- when I would low restrict then try to eat normal for a day to go to an exam- that eating normally would fuck me up so badly.   Like case and point- my sophomore year of college I had been restricting for several weeks when I decided to have a ~~real~~ breakfast before a big exam. I ended up skipping the exam to b/p. It’s a risky business. ,False,False

Maybe try it on a day when you don't have a test and see how you feel? Or use practice exams to gauge how it affects you.  &amp;#x200B;  I did want to comment to say that a fad diet isn't going to help you. Eat a healthy balance of macros, whatever you do. Your brain will function better if it has easy fuel available.",False,False

Just make sure your carbs are from leafy greens and some berries and get fats from avocado, nut butter, egg yoke olive oil. Get protein from eggs, grass fed meat. It really helps me focus for finals ",False,False
