But 350 is 1/10th of a lb. Nothing to panic over in the bigger scheme, and if you can restrict to 350, 1/10th of a lb is really nothing to even worry about.  It would be a good idea if you had a bf or a friend who can talk you down from freaking out. Freaking out over nothing is normal. But if you do that a lot, having someone to talk to is a big help.",False,False
