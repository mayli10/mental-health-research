Because the shitty feelings aren't constant I don't think food is all that necessary as I just need to wait for my next coffee or my omad.  I know that if I just eat a normal amount that I wouldn't feel shitty but to me the weight gain isn't worth it. If anything I feel superior to others since I have more willpower then them to restrict and tough it out.   I know all of this is fucked but I can't stopüôÉ",False,False

After restricting heavily I just found out I‚Äôve made it to my lowest weight in years (still overweight atm though). I got so happy about it I spent a couple hours planning a ‚Äúnormal‚Äù eating day as a treat to myself. A few hours later I deleted the whole thing because I stressed myself out over trying to fit a whole jar of peanut butter and some ice cream into the day without going over 1,500 calories. Decided I was being too greedy/kind to myself and didn‚Äôt deserve my own reward üòÇ eating anything over the bare minimum I need to perform well at work is also messing with my head too cause it seems so unnecessary lol",False,False
