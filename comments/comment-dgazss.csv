If one of my besties did something and they failed, what would I say to them?  I understand logically that it's impossible to be perfect, I just need to get there emotionally",False,False

I'm sure as you go through it you will feel more comfortable. Just be easy on yourself.   I have a huge inner success/failure dichotomy. Where everything in my life is either a success or a failure.  As a result this influences my problem behaviours depending on where I am on the scale or where I perceive I am.  Failure will result in punishment of some kind. If I have feelings of the threat of failure when I should be able to control the outcome it makes me restrict hard. For example, school, work etc. Restriction is representative of effort I should be putting in.   However, when I do actually fail at something, this causes a binge because I'm out of control and the failure has been materialised.  It's exhausting and so much more complex than just I don't want to eat because I want to be thin.",False,False
