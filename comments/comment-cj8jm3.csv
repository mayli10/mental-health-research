I actually had my meeting with her today, and these were actually pretty spot on what I presented to her. She already asked me to establish care with a pcp, and I had made that appointment this week for the end of the month, and I wrote down all of the tests she wants run to check for deficiencies And abnormalities. Iâ€™ve never been ritualistic about food, but here was what I presented her with:  1. Keep my boyfriend involved with present goals/challenges to help maintain accountability outside of my work in clinic.  2. Gradually reintroduce fear foods.  3. Decrease/eliminate compensation behaviors in relation to food and calories.  4. Be a better caretaker to my body.  She was pretty satisfied with the list. :]",False,True

That being said, I'm a bit confused as to how general these goals should be. I think if I were asked to write generalized goals, I'd really only have one: ""to deal with food in a manner that does not cause me anxiety severe enough to negatively impact my emotional wellbeing"". However... that might be *too* general? So here are some suggestions that may or may not work for you regarding what behaviors you have:  * If you engage in binging and/or purging you could try to reduce the frequency/eliminate these behaviors  * If there are certain fear foods you want to try you could do that  * I don't know how much you're eating but if your intake is restrictive and you want to increase it, it sounds smart to ask an RD  * I dunno if this counts as a goal but you might have certain deficiencies that an RD could help you with  * maybe you have certain food rituals that you might want to get rid of? (might be more emotional though... idk)",False,False
