I mean look at us, all three people in this room are overweight.‚Äù  Big fuckin mood I wasn‚Äôt even overweight, I was like 150lbs which is a healthy weight for my height. I wanted to melt away and die. This being after ‚Äútrying to recover‚Äù too... struggling so much  about gaining some weight back, just to get called overweight by your own dad (when you aren‚Äôt) fucking sucks.

I was never actually overweight as a child but ""slightly plump,"" I guess. I remember having a strong desire to do active things like learn gymnastics and my mother told me that it was for thin, athletic girls, that I would be criticized and embarrassed. I was encouraged to diet and my food was often restricted. I also had brothers who occasionally commented negatively about my body.  I learned to associate being thin and denying myself with being worthy of love and all that was ""good."" And food, consumption, and a general meeting of my own needs became associated with what was ""bad"" and undesirable. It's a mentality I still haven't gotten out of.",False,False

One day me and my parents were having lunch at my grandparents', I was eating a banana as dessert and my grandpa made a comment about how much I liked bananas, and joked that I was gonna ""grow up to look like a monkey"". I was so insecure in my appearance as a little girl (think I was about 7 or 8 at the time?), and that comment really hurt for some reason. Maybe because I always thought of monkeys as a not especially cute animal? Anyway, my grandpa repeated this joke in many other occasions after that, and everyone would laugh, to the point that after a while I became extremely ashamed of liking bananas and I stopped eating them in front of others. My mom would buy them for me and I would let them rot, and she couldn't understand why I suddenly didn't want to snack on bananas anymore.   I'm doing pretty good in recovery and I regularly have bananas now, but to this day if a member of my family offers me one I always refuse. It's really fucking ridiculous, I know üòÖ",False,False

It was stupid because she used ""we"" but i KNOW it was always aimed at me.

I put the chips up, and after that I often struggled to eat chips without a level of guilt (still do obviously lmao), way before my ED actually developed.  What really pisses me off is that I didn't develop my ED until years and years after that, I flirted with disordered behavior some, but overall I DID keep eating 'like that' (normally) and I didn't get fat, never was.

I wanted to take dance lessons -- I remember I wanted to do ballet, it looked like so much fun spinning and leaping and the dancers are all so *beautiful*, how could I not want to do that? I remember getting into a petty argument with my dad about it, nothing heated, just a tug-of-war thing between me wanting to take ballet lessons and him thinking it was foolish and wanting me to take karate or something instead. Then he told me   ""*besides, you can't do ballet -- you don't have the body for it. Dancers have to be skinny*.""   I was five. I was in fucking kindergarten. Maybe it's just me, but I've got this image in my head that up to age eleven is supposed to be that magical time where everything seems possible, where you're meant to be encouraged to try as many things as possible, where aspirations like astronaut or mermaid or whatever are plausible, and I was a five-fucking-year-old and that was the first time I felt that shut down. Even now, when that memory floats up in my brain it feels like a blow to the solar plexus or something. That was probably the first time I felt like I couldn't do something because of my body.   I'm ashamed of how much it still sticks with me, how much I want to cry when I dwell on it longer than I ought to allow myself, and it's even worse when my friends tell me that they took ballet and I dodged a bullet, that they hated it and *I never got to hate it*. I never got to try and decide for myself and I feel so petty and ashamed when they say ""yeah it was shit you got lucky"" and I can't help but wonder: did I? Am I really that lucky for missing an opportunity because I was too chunky to dance? Am I wrong for envying that you got to discover that you hated to do something that I had once dreamed of?   I can't help but wonder if my life would have gone down a different course had I been in dance. Would I still be doing it? Would I have made a career out of it, started my own studio to teach other children? Would I have had friends from those lessons that I would have grown up with? Would I be skinny? Would I like myself? Would I have the friends that I have now, would I have closer friends, would I have nobody but the studio floor and the pointe shoes?   I hate how much I let my dad hurt me with his words, and I hate how close to my heart I keep them after all this time. I know this is going to sound dramatic as all hell but I do regard it as the first time I had my dream crushed. But, I imagine it's for the better -- I was definitely a chubby little kid and kids -- kids love to pick on other kids, yeah? Maybe I'd've hated myself more. But we'll never know now, only way left to go is forward and try our damndest to do damage control ¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)\_/¬Ø",False,False

The one that stands out to me is my brother frequently calling me ""fatso"" and my mom never reprimanding him for it. I wasn't overweight, just on the chubbier side.

I had a healthy relationship with food as a little kid. I had my own garden, cooked delicious meals with my grandma (I remember saut√©ing mushrooms at 6 or 7 for my spaghetti and her gushing over how proud she was). My parents divorced, I went with my mom and was neglected to the point of being taken by CPS at 10. I would go weeks without eating a whole meal, making sure my little sister ate over me.  After an emergency removal from one placement, the new family we were placed with commented on how rail thin I was. They made us delicious chili from scratch, down to the sauce and upon eating it my body instantly rejected it. The next morning, maple bacon and eggs, it went the same way. It took months to put my stomach back into a normal state.  Two placements later, we wind up with my now adoptive family and things start going the other direction. My adoptive dad loves food and we're very poor so we eat what's cheap rather than what's healthy. I was put on antidepressants, and suddenly I couldn't stop binging. I started eating competitively (I won a lot of contests at the county fair and wanted to move up to the big dogs one day), demolishing whole pies in a matter of minutes and sweeping whole White Castle Crave Cases at the age of 13. The weight crept on, and despite never becoming overweight the fluctuations ruined my body. I stopped wearing shorts. I started becoming more self conscious, but I told myself I was fine for years until I was 19 and developed an addiction to Adderall, and later starving.  I blame adult me, but I know it's been a long time coming.",False,False
