I'll never fully relapse because I'm scared of all the side effects but yeah this disorder is here to stay. I used to do artwork when I was not so food obsessed but now I just don't have the energy or motivation. BMI calculator yup use that regularly to check my weights and the weights of others. I check my body fat on the scale every day and use the tape measure. I feel like I'm a hamster on a wheel.",False,True

Though, the way I tend to view it is that the ED sucks up all my energy and dominates my life to such an extent that everything else falls by the wayside. The disorder is a thief, stealing my intelligence, my humor, my interests.   I’ve been fortunate to spend most of my adult life pretty well recovered, but over the past year I’ve been cycling in and out of relapse-type thoughts/behaviors. I’ll fall down the rabbit hole for a few months, then see my life crumbling around me and manage to stuff the ED world back in its cage...and it crawls out again a few months later. And when the ED comes out to play I see a massive change in myself. In the better times I play cello, I follow an array of reddit subs. I get books from the library and actually read them. I interact with people more frequently and more easily (which is still not that frequent and not that easy...but it’s all relative). When the darkness comes out to play it quickly turns into compulsively refreshing ED subs, checking a BMI calculator multiple times a day, sitting on the couch under multiple blankets and staring blankly out the window. I don’t have the energy to try to fake normal human interaction, so I don’t interact. I look at my journal entries that are just pages and pages of thinking/planning re: restriction and think ‘god I’m boring’. But it’s the disorder that’s boring, not me!   I *feel* so boring and broken during these months that I start believing I *am* boring and broken. I lose track of who I am and what I enjoy. But it’s all still there - it’s sleeping, waiting for me to find my way home...",False,False
