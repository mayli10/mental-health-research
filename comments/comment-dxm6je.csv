It's super important to enjoy time out and I'm sure he was thankful for that too.  Korean BBQs are amazing tbh and a very good and safe option. Lots of veggies options :),False,True

I suggested that we get the “all you can eat option” and joyfully ate the meats and sides with him (except any rice) and never complained afterward about it.  He was so happy all day and we were both excited about how far ive come.  I thank solidcore because everything is going straight to my muscles right now and I’m extremely happy with it.,False,False
