The other day I wrote and erased the same two alternating sentences in an email (because I was afraid of everything getting fucked up if I phrased something wrong) about 10 times before just sending whatever. I do things like that a ton. I also get a bit neurotic and controlling when I watch other people cook. Like, holy crap you’re doing that way wrong and it’s gonna end up terrible! I’ve learned to keep my mouth shut, so now I just stare in silence. My roommate calls it “Big Sister Syndrome” because I offer way too much “constructive” criticism or unsolicited advice. But damnit I really struggle with sitting there and watching someone do something wrong when I know exactly what they can do to fix it.  Basically I suck and if I said everything out loud I would probably have no friends haha.",False,False
