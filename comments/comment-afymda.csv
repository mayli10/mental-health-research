The girl my ex is dating is thinner but way shorter than me. I love being taller. She’s also not as pretty as me with a huge, long nose. She’s plain. Nothing sparkly about her. Although when he started dating her, I was definitely her weight, but a good 4 inches taller. I’ll get back down to that weight in 2 months, holiday weight gain is real. (Fingers crossed).   I feel weird for saying I’m prettier so I’ll say I’m conventionally more beautiful than her.  ",False,False
