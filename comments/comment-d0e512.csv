Realistically, that's not a lot of weight. I understand that it probably feels worse because it came suddenly, from binging, but from the perspective of an average person it's nothing. My best friend was on a diet, she lost around 4kg, then gained it all back, and honestly, I really couldn't tell the difference. She's not very tall either, 1.63m I think.  I'm actually exactly 3kg above the weight I'm comfortable at. I see a clear difference *on myself*, but I would have to stare at another person for a bit to notice that. Firstly, I would have to care enough to check, and almost nobody is that obsessed with other people's weight. I would maybe attribute it partially to different lightning or water retention. Also it's very easy to hide it with clothing.  Anyway, I would like to lose weight, but I was in a binge-restrict cycle for a pretty long time, I feel physically bad when I restrict now. I decided to just pause and maintain for a bit. Even though uni starts in a month, whatever, I'll just wear something more flattering.",False,True

Over the summer I binged quite a lot due to depression and anxiety and therefore gained a lot of weight. 3-4 kg, and schopl starts in just a couple of days and I am deadly afraid everyone will notice, and even if they'll not say it in my face, I know they'll think it. I'm trying to be rational, no one noticed when I lost that amount in a couple of weeks so why would they notice it now, I mean, they saw me heavier than that and I've been at this weight before. But just the thought of it makes me feel like trash. No one gives a shit, I know, no one looks at me like I do, realistically no one notices if I lose or gain weight, fuck my brain.",False,False
