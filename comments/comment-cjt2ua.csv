In the game's BSA files every NPC has a file with data regarding their appearance. I'm not sure if this file includes their weight or not since the rest of the options all control facial stuff, but I don't see why they wouldn't. An NPCs weight setting does need to be recorded just like any other appearance setting. I don't see why Skyrim VR would change the way that works when all they needed to do is to change the controls to work with a VR headset and controller.",False,False

So if you use CBBE (Caliente's Beautiful Body Enhancer) the same thing happens. All characters of the chosen gender share the same body model.,False,True
