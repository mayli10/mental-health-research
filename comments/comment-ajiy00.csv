I didn‚Äôt eat for around a year, maybe 18 months... only consumed skim milk with sugar. I took multivitamin&amp;mineral daily though, which is probably why I didn‚Äôt get scurvy!  I habitually use supplements, bc even though I eat pretty well I‚Äôm vegetarian and don‚Äôt eat eggs or cheese either, so my lifestyle kind of restricts my diet a little bit. My ‚Äúmain‚Äù one that I consider most important is omega oil capsules, but I also take multivitamins and minerals, antioxidants and an extra iron supplement prescribed by my doctor bc I have a deficiency.  Idk how much of it is placebo effect but I feel better for taking them.",False,False
