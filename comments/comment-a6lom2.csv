It had been around 30-40 minutes since they had called by the time I got the message; it normally took me around 15 minutes to get home, and it took 55-65 minutes for them to get to my house from theirs.   Well, I got home in record time that day. Literally ran to my car as soon as I heard the message and hauled ass. I had to put away my scale, food scale, measuring cups, food diary, paperwork from therapy/dietician/physician, and various other ED paraphernalia. I literally just put away the last of it right as I heard the key turn in the lock. If Iâ€™d missed one light (or driven the speed limit), they would have beaten me there and I would have been completely screwed.  The best part was that my friend and I had similar schedules that semester so carpooled a lot, including that day. I had to make up some excuse to leave again so I could go back to campus and pick her up. I think she had to wait around an hour for me.",False,False
