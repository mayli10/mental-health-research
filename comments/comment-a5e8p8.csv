Some days I imagine a scenario, let’s say I’m on a solo vacation in Bali(or Thailand) I’m wearing a perfectly loose yet fitted linen blend tank top. My high waisted denim cut offs are a little bit baggy on me, a madewell tan leather belt cinches it to my tiny waist. My thighs are skinny and toned, my arms are skinner than my thighs. My ankles are dainty, I might be wearing an anklet I picked up in a local market. I magically have cheek bones and collar bones. My boobs are small and my stomach is impossibly flat, like I haven’t eaten in 3 years. I also have an ab crack. I hate coconut water but in my fantasy I’m sipping on a cool refreshing glass of coconut water.   I don’t care if anyone finds my body attractive, I want to look a certain way for ME. I’m almost invisible to everyone around me, but I watch everyone. I’m confident and secure in my own body.   Don’t judge me but this keeps me going on a treadmill. ",False,False
