Something that helps me when I‚Äôm in that terrible mindset is to just leave, get in the car, panic for as long as I need to, distract myself with Reddit if possible, then decide on one safe thing I can eat. For me, it‚Äôs usually a protein bar or a container of noodles. I usually go somewhere else to get it- gas stations or convenience stores might be easier since there are fewer options and it‚Äôs much smaller. Go in, get the food, go out. There is no shame in feeding your body. You need to do it to survive. Everyone else eats every day and you are capable of it too! Sending you love and support üíì I always feel much more grounded after eating on those days too.",False,False

I legitimately almost cried in the frozen section over a lean cuisine.",False,False
