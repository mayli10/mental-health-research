Personally when my cals are super low I basically turn into a sloth.",False,False

The ""starvation mode is a lie"" studies generally refer to the fact that reduction in thermogenesis (body heat) is minimal compared to the calorie reduction. So, starvation mode is a lie in that you will not /stop/ losing weight at very low calories, but the rate of loss may be somewhat reduced compared to expected. We know the body does things to slow weight loss (menstruation cessation, lower body temps, reduced motivation to move/do things), so in that way there's something to the idea of starvation mode, but it will never stop a person from losing weight. In this case I think the bowel movement suggestion is more likely.",False,False

[Many studies](https://stevenmkemp.com/why-starvation-mode-is-a-myth/) have proven that 'starvation mode' is not real, ans the only thing that has consistely proven true is CICO. As for promoting fat burning effiency long term, the evidence I'm aware of is the effect of [keto diet](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/healthy-weight/diet-reviews/ketogenic-diet/) and [HIIT](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2991639/).  While I believe you don't mean any harm, spreading misinformation often does more harm than good.",False,False

You’re body probably got used to eating 400ish calories for so long so your metabolism slowed down. When you did that calorie increase you sped up your metabolism because you’re body no longer has to slow down and be in starvation mode. Which makes your body more efficient at burning fat long term.,False,False

It's just hard for my brain to accept that I can eat that much and not gain even though it makes sense rationally,False,True

When I fast over 24 hours or restrict less than 500 a day I get really backed up and it looks like I didn't lose anything, until I eat and can get it out. Your maintenance is probably at least 1700, right? So you'll lose weight at anything less than that.",False,False
