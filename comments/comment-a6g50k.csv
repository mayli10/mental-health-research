Salted caramel and mocha are pretty good, too. I bought all of the pumpkin flavors (pumpkin spice, pumpkin caramel, pumpkin cheesecake) and they all tasted the same (pumpkin pecan pie was the only one that stood out), I'm guessing similar to what you're talking about. Same with vanilla and the seasonal sugar cookie, they taste pretty similar. I use artificial sweeteners so I still like them even if the flavor isn't as pronounced as others.",False,False
