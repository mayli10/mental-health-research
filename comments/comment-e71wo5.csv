You cannot gain 'actual' weight/fat if you are eating below maintenance, which I'm sure you are -- I really don't think one day of 'normal' eating would be able to cancel out the deficit you have accumulated from restricting and purging.    please take care, and eat as much as you feel able to. it's even likely that consistently eating more would allow your body (and metabolism) adjust to the higher intake, and gains are just temporary. Sending hugs.",False,False
