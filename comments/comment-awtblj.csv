Tell your sister it's your birthday, your body, you can eat what you want, and refuse what you don't want, and that you appreciate it but to please not buy a cake you won't eat. If she does buy it, don't feel guilty for refusing it, since you told her that's what would happen. This is food control and so many families do it! I hate it.  My birthday was recently and I made myself a ""cake"" out of a watermelon, fat free whipped cream, and raspberries! It was so fun to make, my family loved it, and I didn't stress about it. It was a win win win. Maybe you could do something like that?",False,False
