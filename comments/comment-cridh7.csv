Then he said it's probably because of my diet (I'm vegan), that he was doing some reading, idk what about though. Then he added I can always talk to him or mother if I have a problem, that even though she'll blow up, she'll calm down eventually. If I didn't want to tell them before (I didn't) I sure as hell don't now.   Now I'm fighting with the guilt of eating, since he always seems to do this when I'm about to make food.
