Don’t get stuck on the “i already told you” instead think of it like training - repetition is key, which means explaining the same thing over and over again.  For me i explained that when something is wrong it starts out as a just a feeling. I’m bothered but not even i know what’s bothering me, so I have to quietly reflect and analyze, like sifting for gold in a muddy creek. And i explain this analogy repeatedly as if it’s the first time he’s heard it.  2. Find an easy to express code. When I’m obviously upset but can’t talk about it yet, that lack of communication drives my husband nuts and throws him into full insecurity mode. He thinks the same things: that I don’t trust him, that i’m judging his ability to help, that i’m stubbornly choosing to suffer rather than ask for help. So we both came up with short phrases that are easy to express (because he’ll shut down when he’s angry in an attempt to avoid lashing out, and i’ll get insecure and demand an explanation too 😜) for me it’s “i’m upset, i’ll tell you when i know why” and for him it’s “i’m angry, give me time.”   It might seem kind of clunky and unnatural, but after a good 5 years of arguing, misunderstandings, and unspoken insecurities, it’s what we agreed allows for the communication that the other needs and allows us to more confidently respect each other’s desire for space in order to work through something.   Hope this helps!",False,False

I'll have a bad anxious episode and not explicitly tell him that's what's happening, then he'll be sad when I mention it later that I wasn't specific enough about how bad I was feeling. I can't say I have solid working advice on how to deal with that, but thought I'd chime in anyway to say you're not on your own. I hope things work themselves out for you! &lt;3",False,False
