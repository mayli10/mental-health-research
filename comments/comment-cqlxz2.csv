Their scared when they are born into this world and their scared when they are leaving this world. In-between is when they are capable of their most destructive and constructive tendencies because they’re scared.   Unfortunately when you’re at your weakest. That’s when those who will cause you the most harm seem to seek you out. Your pain hide’s their pain. They will exploit and revel in your venerability.  Don’t give up just yet.
