I know how you feel, and it’s so awful that you have to go through this. I’m in year 11 and I’m so fucking done with everyone here, but I keep telling myself that theres only 6 terms left and then I’m free.

Everything will be better when its over. Whats really helped for me is focusing on blocking everything out and focusing on doing my own shit.",False,False
