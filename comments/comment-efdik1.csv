I know that she has been going through some depression for awhile now and I really think from what I can observe of the situation that her family would not take the depression seriously and so she feels like she needs to do something or say something is more extreme. Because literally the day she started saying she loves purging and purges 24/7 they sent her to inpatient and put her on meds. There wasn’t anyone catching her doing it or anything or any weight loss it was purely just because she won’t stop talking about purging.   And like I said I know that weight loss doesn’t have to be there for it to be serious, I’m still obese and I have an ED you know? So I am really stuck between hating myself for being so judgmental on outward appearances and behaviors and thinking this girl is faking it for attention.   If I didn’t have an ED this would be so much easier. Ugh I just hate this competition feeling. I really honestly feel like even if I do get to a BMI of 10 or something everyone will just think I’m doing it to copy her, or just tell me to go to her for advice because she’s the ED queen of the family. Or chastise me because I’m older and I should know better than to develop an ED. Even though I’ve had mine since I was like 12. Sorry, venting.",False,True

How old is she? I am wondering if there is some other reason (like...a personality disorder) as to why she is hella over sharing.  Your feelings are valid and you won’t get any judgement from me. I totally get it.",False,False
