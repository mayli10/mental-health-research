Im adopted so people loooove trying to guess ‚Äúwhat I am‚Äù lol  The one big thing is, I don‚Äôt go crazy with my hair maintenance, I give it everything it needs to succeed and let it live on my head üòã like I said, the simplest things make huge differences, especially with hair AND nails.    Also, don‚Äôt comb or brush too much now that it‚Äôs curlier, that can stress your roots so much but it‚Äôll feel like you have to brush more. You don‚Äôt, don‚Äôt worry",False,False

I used to have straight hair but testosterone has made it a little curly (i forget the name of the scale but basically 1a to 2a/2b or so) and it's sooo much thicker. Conditioner is absolutely a must anymore,False,False

My hair is full though, so instead of 15 min of hot water on my head, I stick to cooler temp. The day three years ago when I stopped applying heat and DIY hair dye was the day my hair came back to life haha   And you‚Äôre definitely making a good choice! A lot of those chemicals are present in ‚Äúdrugstore‚Äù hair products because they‚Äôre mass made. You never have to go broke, but spending one more minute and one more dollar for sulfate free works WONDERS.",False,False

I've been trying to take better care of my hair recently but all I've got is a sulfate-free shampoo bar and silicone-free conditioner. To be fair, just those two changes alone have totally changed my hair for the better haha",False,False

Well since I started about conditioner, I recommend cowashing, especially for those with kinky curly hair types. Basically, instead of shampooing every day (shampoo can have some harmful and drying chemicals), you condition, and only shampoo a couple times a week, after workouts especially.   Also, check for things like sulfate or alcohol type things in your shampoo. If you‚Äôre wondering why you have oily roots, thin hair, split ends, a lot of the time shampoo is a big reason. Run it into your SCALP, and let it run down your hair when you rinse üòäüòä   P. S. For those struggling with EDs and hair loss/growth, Mane N Tail has been mentioned a lot for getting more length. I know it‚Äôs in places like Target or Walmart so not super expensive either. It‚Äôs better for those with straight hair though.",False,False

Also, PSA for everyone who doesn‚Äôt know: when using conditioner, leave it in your hair for 3-5 minutes. Wash your body while it sits, or listen to a couple songs. Conditioner needs a couple of min to sink in! I‚Äôm a plethora of hair care info if anyone wants to know lol",False,False
