It didnt occur to me that I could do something like this to make it less accessible, thank you!  Eventually I did have some of that cheese, but I was able to keep it at just that slice of  cheese after having a drink of hot chocolate with it, satisfied me enough.  Now I'm busying myself with netflix :)",False,True

Maybe it’s like someone saying “Just eat right and exercise!” to me. But I’ll suggest it anyway just in case it helps? Can you freeze it? We do this because we simply don’t go through it fast enough and I hate throwing food away. I just take out what I need. Make my husbands sandwich for lunch with frozen slices and it’s perfect at lunch. Only takes maybe 20 min (or less) to completely unthaw. And it also toasts just fine without needing to toast it longer.   Sorry in advance  if that is a dumb tip or if this is annoying.,False,False
