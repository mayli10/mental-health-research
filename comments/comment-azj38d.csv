Sounds to me like your dad being unable to adult and get his own a$$ up for work on time is him needing *your* help. Sorry dad, it's not the kids job to make sure you get to work like a responsible adult. Honestly, you'll be 17 soon, I know what I would do: I would make my own schedule, keep my own job, start living my life in the way it made sense for me. You seem to have all the responsibility in the relationship, maybe if you act like the responsible adult you're sure to become they'll watch and learn. What will they do, call the cops? ""My daughter is going to her job, cleaning my house, and studying for her GED, but she's not waking me up at the butt crack of dawn cause I can't adult on my own."" You're clearly not a delinquent. Is there an 18 year old friend you could move in with? I feel like your parents are just enjoying the power trip and free labor at this point maybe a cold hard reality check is just what they need. Don't threaten, don't hint you'll go, just pack what you want and move. You're a person, you deserve to be treated with respect, and if they won't do it you'll find people who will.  Just my thoughts *shrug*",False,False
