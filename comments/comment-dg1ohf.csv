You don’t know what the other person is going through. If you notice a change in someone else and you feel the need to say something nice about them, why targeting their body shape? Point out their nice hair or look instead.   On the other hand, if you notice a change and you don’t want to say something nice but just give air to your mouth, than just shut up.  In my opinion.",False,True
