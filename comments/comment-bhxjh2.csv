I used to regularly have issues with my hips and knees where it was so painful to use them that I couldnâ€™t move at all (once this happened in the middle of a hike and my SO had to half carry me back to the trail head - it took three times longer than it should have and I was in agony the whole time) but this has stopped happening except for the occasional twinge since I started doing regular RMT. So maybe itâ€™s worth trying for you as well?,False,False
