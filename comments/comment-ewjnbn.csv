I'm sure things are difficult for you at the moment, but I  guarantee you it won't last forever. Things will be hard right up to the point they get better. Tomorrow when you wake up, the sun will shine bright, things won't seem so bad and you get to start again. Life is a marathon, just take it one day at a time. Be strong. Smiles.",False,False

Youâ€™re asking to be recognised for the struggles youâ€™re experiencing. We see you, we understand. Everything youâ€™re feeling is completely valid.   Tonight it might seem impossible, but there are ways to get through this. Youâ€™re young, you have so much to live for. At your age I couldnâ€™t imagine my life would ever amount to anything, had no idea the path I would take, was terrified of facing it. Within a few years I had travelled to 20+ countries, lived and worked in Africa, got married, bought a house, got a dog. I never could have planned or predicted any of that, especially the marriage part.   If thereâ€™s someone you know you think you could reach out to, please do. You donâ€™t have to tell them any details. Just say hi, start a conversation. Ring or text or email a helpline if you can. Or, if youâ€™re able, contact emergency services. You deserve and need help. You donâ€™t have to live with these feelings. It will get better.",False,False

Maybe there are beautiful things in store for you &amp; beautiful things for you to do. Maybe, you can grow and overcome all of these struggles. There is nothing wrong with seeking attention, especially in such a fragile state. You deserve to have someone. I'm sorry you feel alone. I'm here for you. I believe you; that it really feels you *can't* live any longer. Have you ever felt this way before? All those other time you survived &amp; I really hope this can be another time.  Things will not always be as crumbly as they seem right now. But it is true that sometimes life fucking sucks and feels undoable. But I really really think there is a reason you are here, and a reason why you posted &amp; a reason that I saw this &amp; commented. That hints that maybe life can go on a little bit longer.  Feel free to message me, I will respond if I don't fall asleep! Please call someone, if you have someone. You can also call a hotline or 911. They are there to help you. Try to do something kind for yourself. ðŸ’œ",False,False

I know, inpatient is terrible. I've been before. But don't you think it's worth at least one last shot? I mean think about it, worst case you can make good memes about IP, and you can always attempt later. But surely it's worth one last shot.   Consider texting CHAT to 741741 if in the USA, and looking up hotlines if not in the USA. I know, hotlines aren't a cure-all, but if you're set on it, it's worth one last shot, hey?",False,False
