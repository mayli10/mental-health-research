You wouldn't say to a PTSD veteran ""yeah I know the sound of popcorn popping gives you flashbacks but don't try to police my food choices I eat what I want :////."" It'd be such an insensitive thing to say, just like what she said was insensitive  You had a specific reaction to something that had nothing to do with her and yet she decided to make it about herself. That's incredibly rude of her. You deserve better friends than that and it's not your fault at all",False,False

It sounds like she's insecure about her own weight, but that's her problem to cope with and good for you for not letting her use that to make your problems worse.  She doesn't sound like a very considerate friend. You deserve better!",False,False
