With the career I'm going to grad school for, once you graduate you have to choose between the mental health or physical health aspect of it and then you specialize. After yesterday i def want to do the mental health. It was such a great experience!  It was amazing seeing doctors, psychiatrists, social workers, OTs, PTs, RTs, registered nurses and pharmacists working together as a team to help everyone!  I hope youre doing better! &lt;3",False,False

I know I shouldn't be proud of myself for hurting myself but... FUCK it. There's nothing to hold me back from spiraling anymore, except for those momentary glimpses of reality, and even those are fleeting.   I hope you are having an enjoyable December 2nd. I love reading your posts and comments.",False,True

I was committed to a psychiatric facility when I was 17 for a suicide attempt. You guys are what keeps this broken system still functioning. You guys are what helped me get through that time; not the doctors and not the pills. Thank you for doing what you do, even when you are so clearly struggling. I hope that you find some comfort in your day, whatever form it takes.",False,True

I remember that feeling though and it’s super heady and intoxicating.   (Maybe b/c of co-occurring mental health issues, my being in that place was usually followed by an epic destructive crash. I heccin miss the high, but staying out of the psych ward takes priority, for economic reasons if nothing else.)   Wishing you a good Dec 2nd.",False,False
