If you‚Äôre too tired or weak to do intensity workouts you should really seriously consider throwing on a yoga video from YouTube and doing some gentle stretching exercises. It will increase your energy levels, improve your mood, improve your strength and flexibility, and ‚Äútone‚Äù your muscles.",False,False

For the first like 2 months after I developed the disordered eating I was exercising (I'm obese so not crazy amounts, but I was power walking 40-50 minutes like 5 days a week) and one time I caved and ate like 5 popcorn chicken pieces and spent about 40 minutes pacing around my bedroom. I would purposefully park super far from where I needed to go and take stairs wherever they were etc.   But the last 1.5-2 months I have become so fatigued, short of breath, weak and depressed, I just can't face it. But I am also eating less than the first 2 months (averaging about 700 back then, now I have fasting days and lately tryna keep to under 300 calories, but no more than 500) and I am still obese so I'm still losing heaps of weight.",False,False

I low restrict every day and know it‚Äôs just unsafe for me after doing this for too many years, but I still feel super guilty and gross for not running like I used to.
