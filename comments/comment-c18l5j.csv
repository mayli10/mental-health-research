But taking a fiber supplement with 16 oz of water after breakfast or lunch makes me feel totally satiated for hours, so I donâ€™t get that crash  partway through the day that causes a binge.",False,False

My experience is that they all suck. There's another appetite suppressant, probably the only one that comes as a pill that actually works, which will fuck with the ability of medications to work, particularly SSRIs, but also others. None of them are a good plan for your health and as someone who has abused them, they're not the best way to lose weight anyway because as soon as you stop taking them your appetite comes back",False,False
