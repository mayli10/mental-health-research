My mother does simialr to me. Unfortunately I've learned that you just can't trust them. Because if you do give in and take it they will lord it over you and mock you with it or use it to invalidate you.   I'm so sorry you have to go through this x,False,False

Cause depending on your age there could be resources around you or support groups to deal with his narcissism. Like it doesn't sound like he wants you to recover :/   I wonder how much it would fuck with him if you pretend to go along with it? Like maybe he wants a reaction to get off on!,False,False

My own dad grew up with a scarcity of food, so when I visit, he gives me hell for “being too thin” even though I have a BMI of 23. And tells me I need to gain 20 pounds. Then turns around and makes fun of fat people. It’s like, what? He himself is also a healthy weight so idk. ",False,False
