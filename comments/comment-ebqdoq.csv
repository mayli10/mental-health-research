Growing up as an Asian girl around Western cultures/ideals is hard. I remember so much of my teenage years wishing I looked more white. And on the other hand, East Asian beauty ideals are really toxic too, so we kind of get a double dose of standards projected onto us.  Also definitely understand feeling fetishised. I've straight up had guys tell me they have a ""thing"" for Asian women. Honestly even if they have a preference, it's still kind of gross feeling...  Really sorry to hear that he responded in an immature way! What helped me w these feelings was just focusing on the kind of person I was/my personality. The fuckboys faded away/I met someone who loves me as a person, and I grew into liking myself and my face more. Obv still not 100% since I'm here, but things get better",False,False

Dating sucks.  I'm sorry you struggle with this, you said you are just used to spice up men's sex lives and I can see that every day. There's a huge issue with men fetishizing Asian women like that and it makes me sick. We are all equals worthy of love.  Good luck sister",False,False
