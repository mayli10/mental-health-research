However, if you’re more willing to drink juice, orange, prune and grapefruit juice all have levels of potassium. For lower cal options, I suggest leafy greens, like spinach! Cucumber is also good, because it is super low cal, and you can eat way more of it. Beans are also a good source. Also, check salt &amp; salt substitutes for their potassium levels - some of them are good for that!  Please be sure to take care of your vitamin/mineral levels, they are very important to bodily functions! Good luck ✨",False,False
