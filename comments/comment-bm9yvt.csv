Also Iâ€™m sure he wonâ€™t judge you even if you said no and ate it. If he is, heâ€™s an asshole and you deserve better.",False,False

That's ED logic, not normal people logic. If I told someone their sandwich looked good and they offered it to me, I would think something is up with them. If someone said your rainjacket looked nice, and it was raining, would you offer it to them? If you said someone else's shoes looked neat, would you expect them to give them to you? Same goes for food. You need that, it is yours, you are welcome to share it, but you are also welcome to eat it.  Again: if you want to share, share, keep some for yourself, but you're not fat for eating food when you're hungry.  You do not owe others your food just because they find it appealing. People who find your food appealing may not even want to eat it.",False,False
