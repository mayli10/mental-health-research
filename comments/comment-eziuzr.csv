When I bought the three corsets I have I think they were charging US$120, but I'm Canadian and I didn't realize so I thought it was an amazing deal. At least until I saw how much came out of my account. ðŸ˜¬ I feel like there's no reason for them to be so expensive.",False,False

For my corset I was mesured. I have a naturally small waist but back when I bought it I actually bought it to get a tinier waist. But now I just use it for comfort and my spine,False,True

I own some corsets, but the store I bought then from said on their website that they can shrink the waist up to two inches and that the size I bought was good for a 25"" waist. I'm already underweight though, so that's not really helpful for making me look thinner. I really just bought them for fashion.",False,False
