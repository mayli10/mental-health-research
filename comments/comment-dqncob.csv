I actually ended up throwing the last 10 oatmeal packs away. I donâ€™t like wasting food, but...itâ€™s either throw away food I donâ€™t need or eat it and feel even more shitty.  And then ate a couple of fake chicken patties.   Fasting after this is gonna suck. So is pooping and looking at the scale. Why do I do this to myself",False,True
