She also sounds like she is the type of person who tries to heal and help others. I agree with other commenters that this was her overstepping and I would feel the same way you do.   I would say something like “The other day when you checked up on me I felt violated and like my boundaries were being overstepped. Yes, I do purge sometimes and that is something I am dealing with / working on. I need you to stop checking up on me. My health is my responsibility and mine alone. I value our friendship and appreciate that you care enough to reach out.”  Obviously you don’t need to say exactly that, and that is me using some of my own personal feelings to help write, so it might not express exactly what you want to say. But it’s a start if you do want to talk to her.   I would say you could try and set boundaries with her. Maybe asking that she doesn’t confront you even if she knows you are purging. You could also tell her how you are working on this (idk if this is true for you but maybe sounds like it since you wrote about progress), and you are not comfortable talking about it with her.   I don’t think you need to apologize. You are valid in your anger. You can let yourself be angry.   If you do talk to her about this, I would do it at a time when you are less angry and more calm. This will help you get your points across more clearly. If you do talk to her, think about your goals for the conversation. Do you want to ask her to stop checking in on you? Do you want to set boundaries with her? Do you want her to respectfully ignore if she suspects you’re purging?  Just some things to think about. And i do suggest checking out “DEARMAN” worksheet from DBT workbook. If you google those you should be able to find it online. I think the dbt sub has it too. I’m doing DBT therapy and I find it a helpful acronym to help me structure difficult conversations more effectively. I can try to find a copy too just after I post this since I don’t want to accidentally delete all I’ve typed.   Let me know if you have any questions or need any more help. I could try to help you figure out how to talk to her and what to say if you’d like.   And again some of the sample conversations I wrote above are from my own interpretations and might not necessarily reflect what you think and feel.  &lt;3",False,False

I don't think she was trying to make it about her - genuinely. It would seem she just went about it the wrong way, but ask yourself, is there a right way to confront someone about this sort of issue? Because I'm not so sure there is anymore, having had people do it to me in a variety of different ways all of which felt uncomfortable and embarrassing. I think she probably let her emotions get the better of her and said it incorrectly, it sounds like she cares about you.",False,False

If she wanted to feel better about extending help, she should’ve done just that and left it at that. That would’ve relieved her guilty conscience. I told my boyfriend recently about my struggle, and he told me he was worried and to seek professional help, but he did not push the subject. He said he “would not shove food down my throat” or try to control my habits. He expressed his opinion and concern, extended help and his ideas, and left it. I appreciated his approach very much and think that offering help, rather than pressuring and getting angry, is the right approach. ",False,False

She probably doesn't even go on the internet a lot somehow. Her opinion of you does not matter and you of course you shouldn't apologize. You didn't do anything wrong. She should be the one apologizing.,False,False

You just have to give her the space to grow. You’ve said your piece and she said hers and that’s that. If she loves you, and it seems she does, she’ll accept that you are where you need to be right now and when/if you need help, you will ask for it. She can’t force you into wanting help. It’s awful that happened with her friend in the past, but that really has nothing to do with you and sounds like something she should work through, but not at your expense. ",False,False
