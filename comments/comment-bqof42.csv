It's not just fasting after binging that triggers your binges, its ANY fasting ANY TIME.    Don't fast.  If you stop fasting, you'll stop binging.   Trust me.  I've been binging/fasting, repeat for about 5 years now.  The only times I've successfully stopped binging was when I first stopped fasting.  PERIOD.",False,False

I either couldn't keep anything at all down besides a very few select foods in small quantities or I'd go ham and eat everything in sight. Every time the pendulum swung one way, it'd swing back the other way twice as hard.  The only time my eating has been normal in the past few years is when high restricting or not caring about what I'm eating at all (and probably gaining weight).   Not sure if you're the same way, but it's so easy for me to forget this fact. Whenever something stressful or disruptive happens it's right back to the same cycle until I can knock myself out of it. If you could go a week eating normally it could be very helpful for your sanity's sake.  Good luck and hope it works out for you.",False,False
