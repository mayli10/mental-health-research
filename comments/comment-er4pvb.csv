It gets much easier when you're comfortable with them too. Add to that when someone appreciates you and your body you get an honest glimpse of how other people see you (spoiler alert, they don't see you like you see you). It's a nice feeling.  Being a virgin is no big deal though so I'm just saying don't lower your standards just to be able to say you're not... I did that and uh yeah *regret*. You're the only one who has to know you're a virgin.",False,False
