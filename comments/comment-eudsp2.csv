I live in Los Angeles.  The waitresses here, the girls who came here because they were the most beautiful girl in Shitcreek Nebraska are basically 6s in LA.  I've seen people so beautiful its painful to look at them.  Meanwhile, if you live in Mogadishu (spelling?) I'm sure you see a lot more of the ""holy shit what happened there"" side of things.  So, it's context.  You may be an LA 1, but you're an Africa 7.  You get it?  Then there's the problem of how you see yourself in the mirror.  Like I said in a different post, your mirror image is literally not what you look like. It's inversed.  As a fun experiment download a couple faces of celebrities and flip them horizontally.  You would be amazed how many 'good looking' people suddenly turn into average schlubs when you flip them",False,False

I compare myself to everyday people, people Iâ€™ve gone to school with, worked with, see in shops, walking down the street, or on the train. Thatâ€™s real life, and thatâ€™s the yardstick by which I measure myself. A 1-10 scale of ugliness/attractiveness is, to me, based solely on real life people who I have seen with my own two eyes.  Iâ€™d argue that there have been plenty of people who have treated me as though Iâ€™m not human, so perhaps a 1 is accurate after all.  If only I had the balls for an actual picture.",False,True

They absolutely do. They impact how we see ourselves, feel about ourselves, how others perceive and judge us, how we relate to others, and how they relate to us. Itâ€™s a part of life, part of culture. I figure (hope) that other things matter too at least. In the context of substantive interactions, Iâ€™m definitely drawn to people for more than their appearance. Intelligence, knowledge, mutual interests, sense of humor, kindness, honesty...I think these are equally why I want to know someone better. Casual interactions are a different game admittedly, which I hate.   Iâ€™m 33 (F) and I feel so sad that my face will never be pretty. Iâ€™ve even been mistaken for a boy quite a few times and it fuels so much shame. My body proportions are such that regardless of BMI and gym dedication Iâ€™m never going to be hott. On the upside, Iâ€™ve never been hit on or harassed...which is a relief, but I also feel like it means Iâ€™m not attractive or feminine enough to be worth noticing. I guess Iâ€™m rapidly approaching (or already at) an age where hotness matters less socially, but that doesnâ€™t really quell the sadness.   Iâ€™m so sorry that people have not treated you with the care and respect that you deserve - that all persons deserve. I hope someone will come into your life who will take your hand and walk with you. Who wonâ€™t try to make you believe anything, wonâ€™t try to change you, and wonâ€™t try to take anything from you that you arenâ€™t ready to give. Who will freely offer safety and respect and love, and give you all the time you need to feel safe enough to let those things in &lt;3",False,False

""Oh, that was the worst movie ever"" after coming out of the new Cats.  No, the new Cats is critically flawed and off putting, but on a scale on 1 to 10, it's probably a 5 or a 6.
