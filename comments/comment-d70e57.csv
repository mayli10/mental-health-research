The doctor obviously did not take me seriously as my labs are normal and I am actually just overweight (very short, have always had natural muscle, and over a year in recovery) which made me so mad but Iâ€™m letting it go .. or trying to lol",False,True

I had been made to visit a doctor because I hadn't had my period for half a year and she told me she'd send me off to a nutritionist and I VERY SPECIFICALLY asked her to sms me instead of mailing because I live with my parents and was underage at the time. I don't think my waiting time was much more than like 8 weeks but it's not like I was severely underweight at the time. So might prove your point about weight being too much of a key factor...   But yeah, about a month or two later I received an invitation to the ED department of our hospital in the mail and since it was also addressed to my parents you can just guess what happened... I was FURIOUS, I felt like my wishes weren't respected just because I wasn't considered an adult. Also, once I turned 18 and had regained the weight ang gotten my period once, my therapist was completely okay with me quitting, even though literally nothing had happened to my mentality around food and I just got straight back to my bullsh. My friend who now in her adulthood freewillingly went into recovery (she quit 1st time when she turned 18 as well) was told by her doctor that ""she's completely fine and her weight is high enough"" after like a week of eating normally despite still looking like skin and bones... So the emphasis put on weight is way too great, in the end we're talking about a mainly mental issue that weight loss or gain might be a physical side effect of.  Sorry for ranting so much, I just feel strongly about the whole weight thing too ðŸ™ˆ",False,False
