No wonder eating 1200 calories a day wasn't giving me a noticeable difference and ive plateaued with my stupid weight. Now to be at a 500 cal deficit to lose 1lb a week I need to eat 900 cal? I  mean im totally down to clown here but my thought life toward food is already taking some turns that have me a little concerned and here I am posting in this sub. I feel like until I hit my goals and my full body scans are where I am proud of them im going to be obsessed with counting calories and exercising. Im so glad im broke and can't take myself out for food and I haven't had any sweets in so long that now sugar drinks taste awful. Positive note, the full body scan at my gym is way more accurate than any pics I could take on my own for a body check. im gonna be so scientific with this ",False,False

I never had it until I started urging my grandmother to try it for her severe pain once oxycodone wasn't even cutting it. I had researched it thoroughly and it's legal here and I had her doctor's unofficial permission (he was a total stoner, but legally couldn't recommend it but I kept him in the loop on dosages).   I used myself as a guinea pig and noticed it virtually wiped out my anxiety and PMS pain. Using pure CBD helped, but a bit of THC helps.   I've been looking for a job and too scared to use it in case they drug test. Even though it's legal, some employers don't allow it still. I know once I had the job, it wouldn't be an issue. Or even if I had a medical card, but I don't need one.   Plus, by not having a job, I can't afford pot at all and therefore haven't had any. I'm just irked because I don't have insurance and can't get regular anti-anxiety and anti-depression meds right now. And pot helps, but I don't have money or a job. And it's so frustrating.   Hire me please so I can stop being in pain.",False,False
