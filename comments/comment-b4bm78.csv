Seeing your therapist is definitely the right way to go. I did exactly the same as you but deliberately chose not to fight with the thoughts, but justify and agree with them instead (depression and self-destructive behaviour related). I’m happy with what I’m doing for the time being but I’m also really glad my destructive behaviour didn’t stop me from doing myself a favour and still confiding in 2 safe people (my psychologist and a close friend) as soon as I started wondering whether or not I should. At the very least, once you get it out there’ll be a certain comfort in knowing that they know and it makes it much easier to talk about a second and third time. And at this point I have a lot of faith in you being able to successfully work on quieting the hell out of those urges. Proud of you for asking for advice (online is still tough) and wish you the best of luck man. I’m hoping your therapist is a decent one who’ll instantly validate you (I was told straight up that EDs are very common amongst transgender and gay men - instant comfort).",False,False

I reckon you should doctor and try to push forward the appointment, and if you cant, call your GP and talk to them.  I really help everything works out for you, good luck with your transition by the way man!",False,False
