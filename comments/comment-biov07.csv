I have hip dips and my butt is basically a super perkey square. No amount of squats is going to give me that hourglass figure :/,False,False

Add in really wide shoulders and ribcage along with zero boobs or hips or ass and it's like I was spliced together from two different bodies. My upper and lower halves are a complete mismatch. And I'm short which highlights the effect. Wish there was plastic surgery to edit your bone structure, but what can you do.",False,False

My weight has fluctuated over 80 lbs over the years and I’m sitting just above my low weight right now but I still don’t like my figure. I have prominent hips but I’m still somehow very rectangular. I have small boobs and wide shoulders, so while I wear a size small in tops the only way I’d be a real size 0-2 is if I were really under weight. The only thing that seems to help is finding flattering clothes or trying to keep my weight down. I feel like I would be a lot less neurotic if I had a better frame :(",False,False

All my weight is in my trunk, specifically belly and flanks. And I know it's not in my head - boyfriend's family got me extra large pajama bottoms for my birthday and Christmas and I've got a BMI of 20.",False,False
