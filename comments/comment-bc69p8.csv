If you’re in school maybe try and hit up some type of club event that might be serving food, I was briefly couch surfing and I did that sometimes. I remember being broke and someone giving me a frozen dinner, it just tasted like shame, I totally get how you’re feeling. Maybe try getting something small from a good bank for yourself, it’s hard to accept help sometimes but good people make it available for other just like you when you’re on hard times. Good luck and I hope things get better for you soon",False,False

I have also had periods where my ED had capitalized on my finical situation and said that I can’t afford to eat, and I also really really relate to not wanting to feel like a burden or have to rely on anyone. Please take care of yourself, I’ll be thinking of you and I hope things get better soon",False,False
