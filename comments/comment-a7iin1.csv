I’ll def go back to maintenance for a few weeks then. I know I need to find a healthier way to lose weight but fasting is just so easy. ,False,True

The body prioritizes eating muscle first.  Don't want to worry you but you might need to be.  I've had a heart murmur for awhile now, but I honestly can't find it within myself to care.",False,False

Before I went into treatment I used to get some worrisome palpitations but they would pass. I was restricting heavy for like a month and half before that happened. Now almost two months out of treatment, I feel hyper aware of my heartbeat because of comments the nurse told me when I was discharged. However, I feel my a lot of it was driven by the fact I was doing ec stacks and smoking. I’ve stopped doing ec stacks and try to cut back on smoking. For the most part I think I feel fine as I haven’t experienced any scary palpitations except for one day when I was walking up the stairs. (I was restricting to like ~800 cals for a week and carrying a bunch of heavy stuff?) 🙃😅   Anyway that’s all word vomit but drinking Gatorade and taking a vitamin makes me feel better. I also try to eat bananas. ",False,False
