It's not failure, it's just ending your fast early. If you're underweight you really need to be careful fasting unless you're used to it. If not, keep trying!   And sugar really is poison. I was helplessly addicted but haven't had much this new year (well I'm sure some but no candies, chocolate, fruit etc) and it really gets easier the longer you fight it. You deserve to take care of yourself, so nourish if you need to but try and fight to avoid the poison.",False,False
