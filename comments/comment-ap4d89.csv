Maybe there is a way to find a compromise with yourself. This is something I struggle with as well. It feels like it's all of nothing, either completely in the disordered eating or fully eating ""normally"" (over eating) I know it's scary but telling someone, even if it is an online friend can really help. It sounds like you might have some obsessive compulsive issues, with how you talk about keeping track of your food and stuff. An issue I think a lot of us have. I think understanding the problem yourself can help a lot. I know things feel bad right now, and I hope they get better for you. ",False,False
