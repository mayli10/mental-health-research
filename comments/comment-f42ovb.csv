Keep in mind results won't be visible right away, but if you're truly dedicated to relieving physical symptoms and remain consistent over at least a few days, you'll begin to notice a difference in appearance and feeling.    1. Massage the affected gland.     [Drag your fingers from the tragus of your ear to the point of your chin--both sides simultaneously.  You'll know you're successful when you feel yourself salivate.]     [Drag your fingers from underneath your ears, following your jaw bone, all along to the point of your chin.  Again you should experience salivation].   2. *I have not tried this personally, but the science is valid.*  Apply warm compresses to the affectedÂ gland.   3. Rinse your mouth with warm salt water.  [I personally use Biotene Dry-Mouth wash to increase moisture--the same way a salt-water flush would work].   4. Suck on sour lemons or sugar-free lemon candy to encourage salivation.  This has legit been my primary go-to.    5. Then of course, you can use anti-inflammatories such as Tylenol to help combat your symptoms.  This is not recommended for long-term due to adverse health consequences prolonged use can have.  If you notice apattern, it's all about reducing dry mouth and encouraging moisture-flow in your salivary glands.",False,False

I had an EMT feel up the sides of my face recently for a completely unrelated reason for the original 911 call, and I was AN-P at that time. He kept asking questions that I knew were related to potential causes of swollen salivary glands--thankfully he couldn't quite pin it on the ED.    ""Chipmunk cheeks,"" as they are colloquially known, will go away when the purging does.  10lbs in weight gain won't make someone immediately think ""swollen;""  swollen is disproportionate to the rest of your size.  While still not the best thing to hear, I hope it makes you feel more comfortable since there are actions you can actively take to reduce swelling, lovebug.  &lt;3",False,False
