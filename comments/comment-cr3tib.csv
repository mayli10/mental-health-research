Unless it is intended to be mean, it usually comes from a place of caring. Perhaps it falls under the ""tough love"" category. That doesn't mean it's ""abuse"" or ""bullying.""",False,False

This has zero to do with an Ed and everything to do with being rude. I don't think I'd ever tell anyone (even as a ""joke"") that they're getting chubby. It'd be different if YOU were complaining about your size and he said ""I think you look fine, but if it bothers you do something about it"" (my husband has said something similar ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è).  But to insult you, and then throw that out when you get upset because you've been INSULTED? Hard no in my book.",False,False

It's objectively rude to tell your gf (or any human being on this planet) that they are getting chubby as a joke.
