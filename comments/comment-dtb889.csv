(Not a doctor, just guessing.)  Personally I experienced the fainting (a lot), but never shortness of breath, even when I was severely underweight and had a slow and irregular heartbeat.  You could tell your doc that you read about very low calorie diets and thought that was a good idea to lose weight fast because of your health scare, but now you have these problems and want her to check if they are related.  It lets her know the problem without telling her that you have an eating disorder if you're not comfortable with it. Telling doctors the truth usually gets the best results, at least in my experience.",False,False

I think the fainting may just be orthostatic hypotension, and I don’t think there’s much that can be done for that.  I might mention the shortness of breath as it is a bit concerning.  Yeah I know you’re right. Do you happen to know how long it would take to develop heart issues from under eating is you are obese? I’ve only been under eating since August, and just more extreme under eating the last month and a half or so.",False,True

Anorexia nervosa does have a high risk of death – about half of the deaths are sudden cardiac deaths. These are the result of cardiac arrhythmias. Why patients with eating disorders are prone to sudden cardiac death is not known for certain.  (Cardiovascular Complications of Eating Disorders)  The body requires folic acid, Vitamin B12 and iron (among other things) to produce RBCs, as well as hemoglobin. A lack of these nutrients, commonly experienced by someone who is restricting food intake, often leads to anemia and inadequate oxygen transport throughout the body. It could also result in fatigue, weakness, pale skin, irregular heartbeat, shortness of breath, dizziness, chest pain and/or headache. (5 Potential Medical Complications of Anorexia Nervosa You May Not Know About)  Orthostatic hypotension can lead to fainting and is common in people with anorexia.  If you tell your doc that you have an eating disorder she'll probably do her best to check everything she can to make sure you don't drop dead soon.",False,False

I think she probably tested for vitamins as well. I just said I was a bit tired lately and not sleeping well and my doctor is extra cautious with stuff so she sent me for them.  So that’s why I think maybe it’s all good and this is just from not eating enough but not serious enough to need addressing. It is the shortness of breath that most impacts me. Plus the fainting is annoying. But if it’s only from not eating enough I’d rather just deal with it and keep doing this. But I’m paranoid that maybe it’s something else or my heart or something. Idk I’m torn lol. It’s like I want to care for myself but also don’t!   But yeah you’re probably right, I probably didn’t get tested for potassium so maybe I will bring the issues up. Thanks!",False,True

You may think it’s fine because you’re obese, but obese people who are encouraged to lose weight through extremely low calorie diets do do under supervision of a doctor and take supplements.   I think you should go to the doctor and find out what’s wrong. If it is potassium deficiency, for example, you need professional diagnosis and help because too much potassium is toxic.",False,False
