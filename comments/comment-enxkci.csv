Feels like I should have transcended the need for food by now ðŸ™„ Also sucks how there are positive reinforcements everywhere when it comes to fasting, so I constantly tell myself Iâ€™m being some sort of Heath Goddess, when in reality, I am destroying my sanity among other things. Ughhhh. Holding your hand right back.",False,True

I honestly donâ€™t think any amount of fasting would make me feel accomplished anymore.  Itâ€™s like... needing food to survive is a personal failure?  Idk.  Iâ€™m sorry, I feel your pain, I canâ€™t offer advice because Iâ€™m there too.  I can totally spot next to you on the bus and hold your hand though.",False,False

I keep upping and upping my minimum step count for the day. Iâ€™m averaging 30,000 steps now, and i want to push it to 35,000. Iâ€™m in so much pain, Iâ€™m exhausted, and I donâ€™t enjoy doing it. Iâ€™m powerless to stop though.  Iâ€™m sorry youâ€™re having a similarly challenging time â€” the above is a selfish way of saying that I feel your pain. I hope things get better for you very soon",False,False
