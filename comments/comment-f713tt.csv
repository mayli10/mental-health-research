I know nothing I say will really help and that this hell is very complicated. Even if my words means nothing, Id say youre still underweight and by no means ""fat"" in any way (as ""normal"" may feel etc). Skinny is hard to point down as many of us will never see ourselves as ""skinny enough"". I dont like talking about whats normal or not as its a very sensitive topic - but I hope to try and reassure you that it isnt something to freak out about and that you havent ""done"" something bad. (probably worded that very wrong, Im sorry).  My apologies for this cheesy text, but I truly hope you feel better soon! Sending love n positive vibes &lt;3 :^(",False,False
