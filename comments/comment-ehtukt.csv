I've been binging on-and-off for the past couple of weeks, including today (gotta love when that happens), so I'm really hoping that 2020 will be a good year. Realistically, I'm gonna binge at *some* point, but I'll try my best. Good luck to everyone who's doing this! Even if we don't get it right away, we've totally got this. &lt;3",False,False

But I'll be trying to reach a goal of at least 10 binge-free days each month, rather than trying not to binge at all - just because that's a more realistic goal for me. I also tried no binge November and it was a catastrophic failure, lmao.",False,False
