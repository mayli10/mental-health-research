Especially compliments. Like, 1. You’re definitely lying to make me feel better about being a disgusting mess and 2. Stop reminding me that I exist and other people have perceptions of me. Let me dissociate through life in peace.",False,False

Which felt awesome!! And reassuring to know that he hasn't caught onto my ED, because if he had he'd be concerned about the collarbones or avoiding giving me compliments around body features that are common on really skinny people.  But now I'm hyperfixated on it and I'm like ""cool I can never gain weight ever or lose these collarbones because they LOOK GOOD""",False,False

If they noticed I lost weight then surely they’ll notice when I gain it too... at the end I just wish people would keep their mouths shut :/",False,False
