It seems like you are generally about 50-60 which is a good rang to be in. I don't really trust heart rate phone apps, I always use an actual cuff.",False,False

I have no idea how that would even calculate your HR. Did it say how when you downloaded it?,False,False

Tried for a few weeks but that just isn't me. I prefer riding my bicycle.  Like i said in another comment i think that's just normal for me. I don't feel any pain near the heart, i just saw that post and completely freak out.",False,True

The average of the last 3 measures gives 64 so it seems about right.  I think i can trust the other values because i always had trouble checking my beats. I don't really feel any pain in the heart, i just saw that post and went full panic mode.",False,True

Fitbit has some that work very well that are more affordable! Apple Watch is just the best. Do some digging and you‚Äôll find something that works for you üòÅ,False,False

Multiple the number you get by 6 for 60 seconds, and you have your BPM.   I don‚Äôt exercise but mine is anywhere from 40-50 on a normal day, and if I binge it shoots up to like.. 80-90 and I get super hot and thirsty :/",False,False

So it's not always indicative of the need for immediate hospitalization, but it is worth getting checked out, I say. Better safe than sorry.",False,False

If you can afford it, Apple Watch series 3 has the top performance in HR monitoring. I think it had like a 4% error rate?",False,False
