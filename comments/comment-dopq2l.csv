If it lasts a few days, then you might wanna see a doctor or up your intake even more/eat a normal TDEE.   I find that if it is blood sugar out of whack, eating something ""normal"" helps within 15-20 mins after eating. If it is my potassium levels (Bulimic), sodium (I take Lithium for psychiatric meds), or hydration levels, then eating ""normal"" or closer to my TDEE takes about 3 to 4 days for me to feel ""Okay"". But I strength train about 3 days a week.   You're doing a good thing for your body with the electrolyte drinks (just watch for the sugar and carbs in it to prevent blood sugar spikes). If it bothers you, keep a log of when it happens the most and consult the almighty internet for further help on which doctor to take it to.",False,False
