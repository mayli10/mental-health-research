I genuinely do not think there is a strong ""yes"" or strong ""no"" to your question because it is completely unethical to research prolonged starvation to the highest clinical degree. Most of what we know regarding chronic starvation is observational in the aftermath of an event like war or genocide. However, there is literature regarding how long-term restriction and weight cycling can alter metabolic processes in the future.  In addition, research does not branch into how to prevent ""fat storage"" in the perceived ""starvation state"" because it is seen as a positive physiological process to prevent people from dying.  I suggest continuing your research in GoogleScholar or PubMed rather than basic Google searches because a lot of information provided outside of journals is misinterpreted or anecdotal.",False,False

Mini explanation: it is true that as you lose weight and eat less food, your TDEE goes down. However even in extreme studies of starvation and weight loss, the expenditure only reduced by 180 kca. This is not all that mysterious—if you lose fat, you have less mass on your body to haul around, thus burning less calories through physical activity. You’re eating less food, so your digestive and circulatory systems slow down and burn less calories. Also you fidget less due to tiredness, which burns less calories. So yes, as you lose weight you may need to adjust your calorie consumption by 200 calories at most. But this is not due to extreme restriction. Somebody who lost 10 pounds after 3 weeks of extreme restriction would have a similar reduction in TDEE to someone who lost 10 pounds in 15 weeks with mild restriction.",False,False
