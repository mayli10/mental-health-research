Those are the only ones I eat personally. I can’t do quest bars or those other protein bars because of the sweeteners they use and how they trigger my rosacea, not nearly as serious as your problem but I do get how it sucks missing out. The diet soda thing is the worst! It’s such a treat but it literally makes my hair fall out. Zevia doesn’t though. Can you not have stevia either? If not then sparkling water, like lime flavored perrier, is really nice. Would definitely recommend.",False,False

It’s a calorie-free natural sweetener from Thailand, in case you haven’t heard if it. You can get it in “sugar” form and also in a syrup!",False,False
