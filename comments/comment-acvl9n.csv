It's obvious she's still purging, and excessively so. If she hasn't damaged the heart itself, prognosis is usually good as soon electrolyte levels are appropriately restored, but the risk remains and worsens with continued purging. Electrolyte imbalance can be deadly.   Eating disorders are notoriously hard to treat, and if a grown adult who's had an ED long-term doesn't want to get help, they won't. ",False,False

I don't know if I have any answers, but I think it's important to keep reminding her that you care. Can you make plans to hang out with her when she's out of the hospital, and try to avoid plans involving food (like go bowling, instead of ""lets do dinner and a movie"")  ",False,False

I told her I was worried about her a few months ago and she broke down and admitted she wasn’t eating and she was depressed and had taken an overdose. I said I’d support her to get well but a few days later she said everything’s fine and she wasn’t really depressed it was just a symptom of a virus. Every time she has one of these crisises she gets everyone worried and then when it’s over she writes it off as nothing to worry about. She’s an island :(",False,True

I think mine took two “banana bags” which took only about a day and I was released w huge potassium supplements. I’ve only purged a few times since, I wasn’t in for very long (time is weird cuz I went in v late at night and am on Medicaid so I wasn’t billed so idk if it was one or two) so I can’t say if five is normal. I’m also in America and the people at the hospital kinda just got me walking and sent me home.",False,False

It sounds like she is lost in her disorder, deeply.  It’s a demon.  I’m thinking about my boyfriend when I say that the most profound effect he’s had on me was when he loved me unconditionally and showed his pain when I was hurting myself.  To be loved without judgment And without condition has made me feel safe to be healthier and stronger.  Rejoice with her if she tells you she’s getting better even if she’s not.  Try hard to empathize with her when she’s struggling.  That’s the best you can do.  It may feel helpless but it’s not.  Love is the best way to fight off this demon.  ",False,False

Obviously I don’t know your friends health, and if she has heart issues I could see it being more complicated, just wanted to let you know my story turned out fine.",False,False
