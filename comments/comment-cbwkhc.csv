The vast majority of normal people don‚Äôt even get that weight loss is based on calorie consumption but going so far as to have a shared doc (which only really could serve to compete with each other to have lower intakes) is just messed up,False,False

Even if you dont tell her the amount of calories you're eating, she may get frustrated if you're making more ""progress"" than her but seem to be doing the same things. At the very least I believe you should tell her about your ED and tell her, I would love to give you advice for healthy and sustainable weight loss, but I would not be able to handle logging my calories vs yours, it would turn competitive for me. And you could give her some advice for mental thoughts to look out for to ensure her relationship with food stays healthy.  HOWEVER, you do not owe that to anyone, not even your friend. If you are in a place in your ED where you do not think you can handle divulging it, that is understandable. Long run, it may benefit your mental health, and your relationship with your friend, to tell the truth, rather than making excuses to keep your secret short term.  Good luck either way.

I can't tell her I can't because I'd have to tell her about my ed  Nah, you don't have to divulge it. Sometimes the half-truth is the least of three evils. Just tell her ""I don't want to keep up with updating that, sorry lol"". She'll probably assume it's too much effort.",False,False
