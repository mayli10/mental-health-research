I used psyllium husks to finally get things moving when it was at the worst. They’re just insoluble fiber and swell inside you to basically push it all out.   If I’m restricting, my BMs are still infrequent, but usually my morning coffee is enough. No more lax for me that was scary :(",False,False

Going vegetarian about half the week helped me immensely. I didn’t even mean to do this but after I got food poisoning from chicken I’ve only been making meat substitutes like tofu, seitan, etc. They’re faster to cook and come with very straightforward calorie counts so it feels safer and usually has more fiber/water. I try to bring a low cal fruit, roasted chickpeas, or edamame as a snack because I work 8-8 six days a week. At work I drink like three 24 oz water bottles a day and then have either a beer or Lacroix with dinner, this week my jam has been a spiralized zucchini and poached eggs. If it gets really bad I find that oatmeal, kimchi, beans, baked potatoes, and rice help move things along. A square of dark chocolate for magnesium also goes a long way.  I used to not eat until 5:00pm for years and the feeling of having food before then, or being bloated, ruined my ENTIRE day. To the point that I would turn down social events or lie to get out of them (maybe even cry lol) if I had to consume food before that. It can take a long time to get used to the food but I feel so much better. I thought my digestive system would never work again.   I’ve kind of been half assing recovery lately but not having to worry about running to the toilet at work has been incredible. It’s going to feel like hell at first but if I can do it, most could. The water helps more than anything and buying a cute cup made all the difference.",False,True
