I have been doing IF for most of the past year and I almost never get hungry anymore so it’s easy to not eat but I try to eat a little something just so I can still exercise without passing out. If I end up feeling full I just hate myself for the rest of the day and wonder why I even ate in the first place when I wasn’t hungry :( ,False,False
