Ice cream is easier to resist (cause them low cal hoes are 4 bucks a pop!!).  I guess it saves me money never having to buy milk and cereal literally every other day, and in turn I don't go to the grocery as often aka buy a bunch of binge foods.   Cereal and nuts can go to hell. Even though I love both. I'd kill for a big tub of Costco's honey roasted nuts. Ugh.",False,False
