I have severe anxiety. It seems like half the time if I tell someone they tell me they have anxiety too. I don't want to dismiss their issues, but I can almost guarantee they are not talking about anxiety to the same extent that I am. My first memory is a panic attack. I had to leave high school and get my GED at 16.  For the past 5 years I have been pretty much working on managing my mental health full time, doing school and work part time.    Honestly I don't have very much advice, just want to say you are not alone. I usually bite my tongue in these situations and make the other person feel like they can relate, when in reality, they don't know my struggle at all. At the end of the day, it's not a competition (even if Id win) so I let them talk about their issues and only talk about mine with people I trust. If it gets really bad, then I would say something like, ""I know you are struggling, but talking about eating all the time makes me uncomfortable"". I'm sorry I can't be more helpful. ",False,False

She doesn't know what it is like, and you do, so of course her attitude bothers you. I hope you have a good time tho and this doesn't get in the way.",False,False
