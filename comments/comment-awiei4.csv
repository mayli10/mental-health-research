I find that I lose weight fairly quickly, so maybe? In the past, most of my fasting weight would come back once I resumed normal eating, but I found that after reaching a lower weight, my weight doesn’t go up once I re-introduce food. I think anorexics tens to be metabolically inefficient which may account for that, but I also don’t know anything about science and may have just pulled this outta my butt.",False,True

My resting pulse is also through the roof, like 120-130 when just sitting, constantly. GP doesn't seem too worried as my ECG finally came back normal for once, not just ""normal for me"" (aka inverse T-Waves etc).  I hate to ask, but after the periods of a higher intake, did you feel you'd lose even more rapidly once you started restricting again, or longer? I'm so terrified of fucking with my metabolic rate if I go back to restriction and then try again in the future to recover again, etc. ",False,False

It’s tiring, isn’t it? I mean there’s restriction weakness, but this feels so incredibly different. I feel as though I need to sleep for a few million years. I was so excited for the “food party” of recovery. Yeah, hot flashes, rapid weight gain, bloating...real party.   I know things are rough, but kudos to you for trying to recover. Whatever you decide on doing, I hope you begin to feel well soon :)",False,True

When I was on 75mg, it suppressed my appetite &amp; started my restriction, but at 150mg it lowered my guard and I ended up in this.. Weird mess I am in. It's my first time trying to refeed in my time with AN, so swelling up like a balloon is just.. It's really horrible. I completely understand how you feel, I wish I could wave a magic wand for us all, hah.   I keep getting that fucking voice going ""come on, just fast for a few days, you might've become a binging pig but we can fix it.."" And frankly idk how much longer I can keep going, I'm exhausted. Ironically, I remember daydreaming about this romanticised idea of recovery in the throes of restriction, it sounded like the best - having to eat thousands of calories to gain due to hyper metabolism etc.. Except reality is more like hell :/",False,False

Way back when I was diagnosed for BED and given a Vyvanse script, until I got an upgrade to AN, That ended the Vyvanse party.  I ended up getting a script for luvox. It’s a medication normally used to treat OCD. It actually mentions BED is an off-label use, and I’m hoping it can help with the hair pulling as well. If you are underweight, there is a very minimal chance you’ll get a medication specifically for BED, but a psychiatrist or APN may be willing to work with you to find a good anti-anxiety medication to cope with the stress of refeeding.",False,True

A lot of it is not necessarily staying if you stop binging and eat only at maintenance.   Congrats for not owning a scale though; 86 is very low! ",False,False

I have an appointment with a psychiatric APN later today. I’m basically just going to beg her to give me a “band-aid” medicine for the BED until I can get to a treatment center this summer. It’s odd to think about, because body changes are always assumed to be long-term processes.

I binged exactly 50% of February (14 ""good"" restricting days and 14 binge days in the same caloric ballpark as yours). Today is Day 4 of me back to restricting and I feel exactly like you do.
