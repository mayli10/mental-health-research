Most of the information on the cephalic response is from studying fasting and classical anorexia, not chsp itself, so that doesn't help much.  But it's [got some decently established data](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4994215/#!po=77.1186) that was aggregated in 2016, and I feel like [this source](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2675143) from the journal of physiological behavior in 89 is surprisingly key. They saw an unanticipated spike in insulin + co. *after showing pictures of food* to anorexic women who had been fasting.  Guess what happened when they saw the food?  They salivated.  Cue a significant insulin spike.",False,False
