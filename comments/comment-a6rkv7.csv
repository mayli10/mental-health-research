Sweet breads and fruit/veg cakes (like banana bread, zucchini bread, carrot cake, pineapple upside-down cake, apple cake, etc) require a lot of oil to maintain a dense crum. The high water content from the fruit and veg evaporates pretty quickly in the oven and can turn out dry and crumbly. So there's usually a LOT of oil in the recipe to maintain a moist and dense structure. Add to that the calorie cost of cream-cheese frosting, and the calories (and fat grams) are SKY HIGH.",False,False

Carrot cake has sweet carrots, usually sultanas, flour, sugar, butter and eggs, then there is cream cheese mixed with powdered sugar for frosting. It's a total calorie bomb.  My mums recipe for coffee walnut cake had a full 2oz of butter and 2oz of sugar per slice plus flour and walnuts.  Scones are calorie bombs too, especially with cream and jam.  The lowest calorie is chocolate Ã©clairs. Not sure what the lowest calorie vegan dessert is - they are all really sugary and high cal. ",False,False
