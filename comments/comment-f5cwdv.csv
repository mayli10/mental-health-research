Shit. 30 goddamn years of counting and calculating. I did outpatient therapy at 17 (bulimia started at 14) and have been in and out of anorexia, binge eating disorder, bulimia, and my personal favorite, the one my initial therapist coined ""Bulimarexia"", now I am doing OMAD, but hey that's okay because it's trendy now. I am tired of never feeling thin enough. But I am terrified of being fat again. Especially after 2 pregnancies that I am still trying to get the weight off from. Where did the time go?
