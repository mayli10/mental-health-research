Then I’d suddenly remember “wait you’re not supposed to lose weight anymore. Caloric deficit !== good now remember?”  Then my motivation to go out with friend just evaporates :(,False,False

I just want to spontaneously order a Cinnabon with friends while shopping or randomly decide to have some 12AM Denny’s pancakes because why not. I do miss some of my favorite restaurants too, such as The Cheesecake Factory or The Melting Pot.  I get really jealous with Thanksgiving/Christmas dinners or other family gatherings. So many desserts and good food, but nothing I allow myself to have (and if I do, it’s a binge long after everyone’s left).",False,False
