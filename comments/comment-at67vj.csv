The first time I lost it I was incredibly happy and felt free without stupid thoughts like that taking up my headspace. However my second time around I had just gotten into a new relationship, and it wrecked my self confidence and put me in this weird spot of ‚Äúhate my body and have sex with someone I love, or be skinny but never please them.‚Äù And now as I creep into my lowest weights i find my libido decreasing but not gone completely, and I‚Äôm trying to find ways to keep calorie count low, but protein somehow decent still so I can manage to keep myself in the mood when I may want to be.  ((That being said my sex life and sex drive has dramatically decreased, especially since I‚Äôm completely sober now))",False,False

When I was underweight before hospitalisation I had no feelings for anything for a long time. Honestly, it is just a case of your body prioritising certain things. I actually now feel like a fraud as my libedo is back, so think ""clearly you are a fat piece of shit"" but quickly try and reverse it as ""it means I can get my life back on track and achieve my dreams"" (continue to progress in my career, have a family etc.).  I know it's not easy, speaking from experience, but if you can please try and get out of this before it sets you back (could be a year or a decade). Not saying just walk into the kitchen and start eating but start slow. In hospital it was different as I had no choice but when I got out I went back to old habits and realised this is not good, so I started slowly - one meal at a time. Doesn't matter how much but eating regularly helped",False,False
