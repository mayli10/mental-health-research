But i first started purging and then restricting when i was 12. I didnâ€™t know what calories were but i would skip meals and and only eat dinner with my parents. In high school i never counted calories but i would skip meals and cut out entire food groups like bread/sugar/meat.

I went to a girlsâ€™ school and there was a lot of obsession around calories and being thin. I stayed away from â€˜classicâ€™ caloric dense foods like crisps, pies, sweets, cakes, etc. and are little portions of veg and fruit. Iâ€™d sit with my friend group for lunch and most would have an apple, some celery sticks, or nothing for lunches and skip snacks. Youâ€™d be an anomaly if heaven forbid you pulled out a sandwich for lunch. I used to write down calories in late high school on a notepad, Iâ€™m a bit older than you and didnâ€™t get a smart phone with tracking apps until Iâ€™d finished school (I suppose thatâ€™s when the technology first became accessible). Iâ€™ve been tracking daily using apps for 7 years now. Iâ€™ve had a few short breaks from it in that time but old habits die hard I suppose. That being said I donâ€™t reallly need to track with an app since I have pretty much revised the calorie count of everything after all these years of logging the data.",False,False
