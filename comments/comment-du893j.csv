This keeps me treading water like the cartoon character Cathy. I see a lot of people maintaining the goals where I really want to be but they're mostly younger than me.   Another thing that is gross about my body is that it gets wider and bulks out when I exercise. I've tried zero protein diets and it's just hard for me to maintain the image I want which is that of an opium eater. Is there any way I can stick to a 600 cal diet without problems. I quit low carb because it created muscle on my body which I do not want.,False,False
