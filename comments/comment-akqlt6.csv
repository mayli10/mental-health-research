My wonderful boyfriend doesnt even mention my weight fluctuations, except a couple of months ago when he said he was worried about the weight loss I recently had.  At that same time, I started to get attention from boys at my college - Ive had multiple ""negging"" experiences (""I usually prefer girls with more curves"" etc) and had boys ask why I wear baggy clothes when I could ""show myself off"", ive had someone tell me I'm ""not like other girls"" because I'm ""more mature and not as shallow as most females"" whilst he gave me a non-consentual backrub.  One boy (who is 23 years old and should bloody well know better) followed me to my train station platform for WEEKS. He didnt even get the train home himself. At first I was polite and engaged with him in conversation (where he talked about himself and his mental health problems the WHOLE TIME) but I soon just blanked him.
