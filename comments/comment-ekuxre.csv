And even if you are it's actually really difficult to build lots of muscle. Initially it seems easy and you'll look more toned at a higher weight and your skin will probably be tighter, but beyond training what you already have to be functional it's... Hard. You won't get bulky by accident, don't worry about it.",False,False
