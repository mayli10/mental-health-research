I also don't like cooking in the morning, so either I make a week's worth of hard-boiled eggs to store in the fridge (they keep for a week), or stock up on Trader Joe's 14.75-oz wild Alaskan salmon with the bones kept in for calcium. They're $3.49 each which is an incredibly good deal and the entire can provides 84 g of protein. I usually eat 1/2 or 3/4 because they taste sooo much better/saltier after being put in the fridge for 2-3 days",False,False
