I still don’t tbh because I’m not as ~disciplined~ as before. But i think the moment I realized I was disordered and i couldn’t let it go was when I was in treatment and compared myself to a picture before treatment. I never cried so much over my appearance and that’s why I’m stuck in this pseudo recovery but mostly disordered phase.    Also waking up in the middle of night at my friends house to cry hysterically over the Taco Bell i had eaten (even tho it was a normal amount!) was another red flag for me LOL,False,False

We were eating them at pre drinks before going out for the night. I think I ate like 2 or 3 when I had only planned to eat one so I went to the bathroom and made myself throw up. It was only the second time I’d purposely purged (was high restrict/excessive exercise) and crying on the bathroom floor while everyone was in the next room having a good time totally unaware of what I just did was an eye opener. Later that night I heard somebody whispering about how thin I was.,False,False

I knew immediately. But I didn’t understand the extent or severity of my eating disorder until I sought treatment through my university roughly a year later. I thought that a few counselling sessions and a couple months of seeing a dietician would be enough to fix me. But then my dietician gave me a meal plan (and it was a pretty reasonable one, not as insanely high as people get in IP and we compromised on the things I was really uncomfortable with), and I couldn’t fucking follow it. I’d prepare my meals and snacks as she’d told me to, but I couldn’t bring myself to eat anything outside of my very rigid anorexic comfort zone. That, combined with my therapist flat out telling me that she believed I was in serious danger of dying in the not too distant future if I couldn’t manage to eat/gain weight.

Eventually I just stopped eating the dessert but continued to shave off more and more calories for the ‘just in case’ moments that never happened. I felt my old habits creeping up on me and I completely welcomed them. I shoot for about 700 cals a day and make sure I get enough protein and vitamins.
