She got an afternoon pass and went to Starbucks. She's lactose intolerant so she ordered the same. 10 minutes into a video chat with her husband and he noticed welts creeping up her neck. She was so upset she just came back to the house and they took her to the hospital. I was ready to go down there and kick their ass.,False,False

I have had that thing many times I am also intolerant but vegan so not an issue. Thing is many people think it is funny to mess up with vegans food or plain do not believe allergies of people.

I don't drink dairy milk in anything anyway because i don't like it, but ESPECIALLY not with coffee.  Sorry you had to deal with that, I feel super annoying but I have just accepted that I have to be the person that makes it extremely clear I want soy milk and double check with the barista that it's definitely soy before I leave (I use a reusable coffee cup so they don't write on it, otherwise I would check that).",False,False

I hope you feel okay, maybe report it to the manager? Disregarding customer requests where dietary needs are concerned could have big legal consequences for the company. If you had a severe allergic reaction, it could be super dangerous. They need to know that one of their employees is behaving this way. Just my opinion, but regardless of what you decide, I hope you get feeling better!",False,False
