Remember that because you are a perfectionist, the bar you set your expectations of yourself at is much higher than everyone else's and the voice in your head telling you that you're not good enough, is flat out lying to you. Nobody will be a more merciless critic of you than yourself, and I find it helps me when I have a random self hating thought, to tell myself to shut the hell up and then force myself to speak out some random reason why I'm awesome.   I think if you've been diagnosed, getting on legitimate medications will help you loads with not feeling so overwhelmed by everything. I have ADD and that was one of my main problems. ",False,False
