This is a harm reduction sub, so yeah, people are gonna post potentially triggering material, and even anti-recovery rants and the like. And that's okay, because this is our space to voice socially unacceptable thoughts related to our mental illness. There are other subs that are explicitly pro-recovery, and people in recovery do tend to leave this sub (temporarily or not), because it's kinda inherently triggering. You may find that the pro-recovery subs are a better fit for your health goals &lt;3",False,False

For me, it feels like thinspo is pushing people into more dangerous behaviors, and when I see what people write here supporting getting thinner even when the person is saying they are on the edge, it does make me greatly uncomfortable.   Imaging a sub that actively celebrates the very behaviors that are detrimental to a person's health would make me stay away.   I am also pursuing recovery as well, and another facet of this sub is how many people actively avoid recovery and the support around that as well. I know people are in different places with their mental illness, but it is still eye-opening to see a lot of denial here and how it is embraced.   So, I am sorry that you miss the old sub, I know that we all need support. I hope you get the right support you need to beat this.   hugs.",False,False

Yet they think a sub for people with an illness trying to cope is somehow more horrible. I can only imagine what the reddit mods are really like.,False,False

Sometimes we just need an outlet to talk about things. Like maybe some people will get worse using an ED forum, but I think the benefits can outweigh the negatives. If I didn’t have these outlets I wouldn’t be here today, 100%.  I doubt anyone would develop an ED just visiting a site. EDs take too much time an dedication and aren’t formed just through seeing something online. I mean maybe in some rare cases, but I don’t think it’s all bad.

I feel like the vibe here just isn’t the same :( like ik most people are also probably from the old sub but I always feel like i’m walking on eggshells? it’s still cathartic but not to the same degree... i rlly feel like i’ve lost a close friend or smth,False,False

The current sub is in a wonderful state, the mods are such selfless people and they're doing an amazing job at keeping it orderly and safe, people are sharing their thoughts and feelings, we support each other and it makes us feel understood. However, I miss the things you listed too :( ! I think that sharing all of these small victories, getting food ideas, flairs, diaries, etc, weren't  encouraging ED behaviours, they were a way of sharing how we felt. It was almost cathartic, in some way.   This subreddit and the old one are  platforms on which we would project our feelings, and I imagine them like a shared online diary. Banning the old one and imposing restrictions literally meant that from then on, we weren't able to use certain words in our diary. Now I must ask the question:  what if these words expressed out feelings/thoughts? Not using them anymore doesn't mean that they're gone just like that! No! It means that simply we can't voice them anymore, while they are still confined in our minds! Unfortunately, nothing is black and white, and some people might actually hate those things, which means that the sub now is in a better state for them! Which is great!   In the end, I think that we must appreciate the sub in the way that it is! I truly love it just as much as the other one. While some features are gone, it doesn't change the fact the core values of the older one are still being held intact now: emotional support through harsh moments, an understanding and warm environment full of kind and lovely people!  Maybe we could actually do something about those old features and reincorporate them somehow, but in a different manner!   &amp;#x200B;  As of other subreddits, idk if I am allowed to share them here, so please let me know if I have to delete the part of this comment, but u should try r/EDfood and r/EDanonymemes !!",False,False
