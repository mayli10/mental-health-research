It's like how when someone dies and everyone is all like ""Are you ok? How are you?"" like... how do you think I am wtf. People don't think about the implications of what they say yo.",False,False

I was so shocked that someone would consider me a survivor. I don’t feel like a survivor at all. I’m so suicidal all the time, and too depressed to get out of bed most days. That’s not surviving, I’m barely even existing at this point tbh   I know I’ve not said anything helpful but I guess it’s nice to know that other people feel the same way ",False,False

I can't call myself a survivor because I feel like I died that night.   Survivor is such a heavy word. It has all these connotations that I can't live up to. I'm not strong. I'm not brave. I'm not okay. I'm not a fighter. I'm a teenage alcoholic who smokes pot all day and dropped out of school. I can't say I'm a survivor because I'm slowly dying. Even though my ED developed before my assault, it definitely redefined it. I lean way more heavily toward the ""b/p"" part of ""an-bp"" now and it caused this shift in motivation. Before I was just swelling attention with t. Now I use it as a way of expressing my feelings of helplessness. Sort of like continuing to victimize myself because that's the role I'm comfortable in now.   I'm kinda rambling now and I hope it doesn't come off as trying to highjack your post. I got hella long winded but all I'm trying to say is I get it. ",False,False
