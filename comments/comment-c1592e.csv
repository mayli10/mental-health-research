I just trust in the fact that I know I'm eating x calories and that there's no way I'm not actually loosing. My water retention holds on so insanely long like it can take weeks to see a woosh and you feel so jiggly and watery in the mean time because you're just loading up on so much water but yeah.,False,False

It's so hard to stay motivated when the scale isn't remotely corresponding to one's behavior. I've developed terrible issues with water retention these past couple years, and honestly I've just stopped weighing myself every day. Instead I choose to trust that it's physically impossible to gain fat when eating at a caloric deficit.   It totally sucks, but it sucks less than the blood-boiling, FURY-triggering sight of gaining a pound after a day of fasting.",False,False
