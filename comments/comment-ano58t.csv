Mix it in a little dipping bowl and cut up an apple. Dip the apple in the mix - it gives you like a creamy/refreshing hit, and all the other ingredients mask the sourness of the yog, you just get the creaminess counteracted with the sweetness and the sharpness of the apple, with just a hint of nuttiness. It works out about 170 cals. Also, I prefer the full fat version - it's way creamier, less sour and more filling than the 0% stuff you can get.  &amp;#x200B;  I don't eat breakfast and have this as a lunch/afternoon snack around 2pm, then I have soup for dinner and somehow find myself not hungry, but losing weight. I think the protein in the yoghurt is what keeps me full.",False,False

I eat greek yogurt as sour cream replacement I love the taste so much.   Siggi's Icelandic skyrt yogurt has some good flavors and are low sugar. Siggi's is really thick.  the chobani brand has a low sugar variety out now.   I have put p2b in mine but I would reccomend a toucb of honey with it. If you want to use fruit I suggest maybe using frozen and letting it thaw with a little truvia or your preferred sugar substitute.  I found a new product called Quark labeled as ""better than yogurt"" ""German cheese"" it is really thin like a Yoplait yogurt and has 12-14g protein. The flavors I found were sweetened with erythritol.",False,False

I allow myself a bit more calories to make it tolerable (actually pretty delicious) and put it in a smoothie. Its easier for me to drink my nutrients rather than eat them, too!
