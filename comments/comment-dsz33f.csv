Everyone says after having kids you will inevitably be heavier than before kids and that it ruins your body. I dropped to like 20 lbs less than prepregnancy weight (which was my weight since like 5th grade) after having kids before I even had these eating disorder problems    Most people get less active with age and eating habits either stay the same or get worse. TDEE (‚Äúmetabolism‚Äù) may drop but I feel like most people with eating disorders or anyone generally aware of CICO will take that into account and adjust their calories accordingly  People are just doomed to gain weight as they get older. Hormones, age, less activity, etc. will all cause your calorie needs to change. As long as You take all of that into account you‚Äôll be fine  Although... I‚Äôm significantly underweight and my boobs are like a 32D so that change is something I can‚Äôt get rid of",False,False

I do agree a lot of it is lifestyle changes I have a job where I‚Äôm on my feet every day and burning almost 500 active cals a day when I‚Äôm at work and over 1000 the days I‚Äôm off when I ride horses.

That has always been the ""magic number"" I've heard where shit starts to really go down hill for women specifically in terms of weight gain. I'm honestly not stressing about it because I've already seen changes in that regard. Like, I'm currently at the lowest weight I've ever been, and I'm underweight to boot. BUT...I look at pictures of myself from 5 years ago, and even knowing that I was 10-15 lbs. heavier at that time, I still think I looked much thinner then than I do now. I'm honestly not sure if it's body dysmorphia or if I actually *did* look thinner back then at a higher weight because now my body is carrying weight differently with age. It'll fuck me up for a minute, but I know objectively that I am thinner than ""normal"" for someone my age and height, and that keeps me from spiraling too much.",False,False
