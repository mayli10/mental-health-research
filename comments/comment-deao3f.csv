Don’t be surprised if she gets defensive or a bit hostile tho either... can be pretty confronting when people pick up on it (I was pretty horrible when people first asked me),False,False

I'll try to talk to her about it. She is pretty open about everything at least with me so I think I might be helpful.,False,True

For some reason, some people’s bodies are insanely resilient and don’t start crashing until it’s really really dangerous or severe or sometimes not even until after they start recovery... that doesn’t negate the severity of the mental anguish at all - and even if she’s not willing to recover, sometimes just knowing someone knows and still wants to be your friend is helpful... becomes a safe space where you don’t have to constantly hide",False,False
