A fat person? In MY opening credits? No way, everyone knows that Jonah Hill (and possibly his sister) are the only people allowed to maybe be fat onscreen. Every other fat actor is a rISkY investment. They're taking up sPAce that could be occupied by an actor with a Known Name.   It would also require writers to be interested in BED, which they are not. For one thing, writers' rooms continue to be dominated by male voices, and there is lower awareness of EDs among men in general. They also tend to consider EDs a """"girly"""" issue that's unfit for a broad audience. And also, frankly, people in the creative classes of NYC and SoCal (where these rooms are located) don't know much about BED. The more common eating-related ailments in that crowd are restrictive, or binge/purge-related. BED is hardly on the radar.",False,False

That, and they'd tell you that portraying overweight people means inherently limiting your talent pool to no-names. They have a million and one excuses, always.  But it's hardly even discussed - unlike racial issues, which now get discussed, but with barely concealed resentment - bc honestly, the idea of deliberately putting humanized fat people onscreen is just THAT pointless/laughable to them.",False,False

However I actually reckon a part of it does come down to the fact that the general population is just so fat and eat to comfort themselves that it’s not anything interesting to them?

(i know BED is more than loving food don't worry, that's just why i think general society doesn't think it's a bad thing)  i think BED is much more common than we know, and that's also why people don't recognize it as a disorder. american food culture enables it and seems to encourage it at times, and most people are overweight so the physical symptoms of it likely won't stick out as much as the physical symptoms of a restrictive disorder.",False,False

People want to believe that being fat is always a choice, so acknowledging a disorder is out of the question.
