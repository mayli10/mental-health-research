I don't know my weight bc my treatment team refuses to fucking tell me, but im pretty sure I've gained back literally half my body weight from my LW. I hate it so much. It's gonna take forever to lose it all again.",False,False

Its on spotify or at https://www.stitcher.com/podcast/ed-matters. I believe it was episode 39 (Medical complications of eating disorders) that talked about that stuff specifically. But I've listened to about half a dozen episodes so far and really like the series!,False,False

Trust me I know it feels shitty to see the scale go up but your brain will tell you its bad and all fat and you gotta fight that with some facts. I was listening to a podcast by some ED clinicians and doctors the other day talking about how much purging fucks with hydration levels and its easy for people who stop purging to appear to gain weight due to going back to normal levels of hydration. And how people who stop purging will likely gain (water) weight initially but over several weeks/months it will slowly go down if they keep eating normal and not purge/use diuretics/laxatives.   Its fucking terrible. The scale going up makes me want to cry, and when I go from purging frequently to not it happens and makes me want to go back to doing it more. Even knowing all this water weight/physiology stuff it's still hard to fight what your brain is saying, so I feel you. ",False,False
