My meals consist of mostly leafy green vegetables and other vegetables (about 2/3 of my meal). Then the rest of the 1/3 is mostly a protein and then have a healthy fat source.,False,False

I did up a rough meal plan and my dietitian made changes where appropriate to bring it up to where it should be and then made changes where appropriate.,False,False

You don't deserve that! You deserve to live a full and happy life, and eating disorders get in the way of that. Recovery is very hard to do alone, so if you do have a therapist or doctor that you see regularly you should reach out to them and ask for help with this. If you're not seeing any professionals (like a nutritionist or an eating disorder specialist) I think that's something you should consider. Having someone in your life that knows exactly what you're going through and can help you through everything and help you stay on track is extremely valuable.   In order to recover you're going to have to gain weight and you're going to have to eat far more than maintenance, so while working towards maintenance is a good first step, you will have to keep going, which I know is scary. That's why having someone to keep you on track is a good thing.  When I first started working to recover I continued to count calories, but switched all my intake goals from restricting to amount that I would gain at (which was determined by my nutritionist). For me when I have a goal to work towards I'm much more determined to get there, so when I was immersed in my disorder, being under a certain amount would make me feel good, but as I began recovery I forced myself to switch my mindset to getting above a certain amount in order to trigger the same feeling. This might not work for you, but I found counting calories very helpful to be sure that I was eating enough.",False,False

If they gain weight from it they don't know because they dont weight themselves all the time.   Obviously I am not a professional and this is how I cope without seeing a professional, but the strategy is really just playing dumb.  Also, you gotta reconcile with the fact that if you want to recover you will probably gain weight. You gotta fight that mentally because there's no right, perfect way to recover without your weight changing.",False,False
