Have you told your therapist about this? I’m obviously not a psychiatrist but I’ve been through the long process of finding the right meds and sometimes (often!) you need a combo, or snri vs ssri, or calcium channel blockers etc.   There are tons of medications that can help even with treatment resistant depression.   The fact that you brought this up here sounds like you recognize that these urges are coming from somewhere else, which is a really positive realization! One of the best ways to stay safe if you are afraid of your own impulses is honesty. Tell people, with specifics, how you are feeling, what impulses you have, and if you feel there is an imminent risk. Unfortunately, a lot of people hear “I’m depressed” and think “oh, they’re sad” not “oh shit my friend/family member is in serious/imminent danger!”  It’s really hard to say those things sometimes so if you want to stay safe and accountable, maybe think about people who would be most receptive/helpful. And! For real, if you ever are scared of what you might do, that is literally exactly what the emergency room is there for. Several of my friends have gone, some more than once, and once the spell passed, have been glad to have been kept safe.   I’m sorry this is such a wall of text, I just have a lot of my favorite people in my own life who have dealt with and are dealing with this too, so I’ve got a strong protective urge :)",False,False
