What makes it ""not-keto"" is that you are not training your body to metabolize fat preferentially (*nutritional ketosis*).    We all go into and out of *ketosis* on a daily basis, as we enter a fasted state overnight and our bodies turn to stored fat.  Once we eat again, our bodies return to preferentially burning carbohydrates from our food.  *Nutritional ketosis* is a metabolic adaptation that takes several weeks to several months of eating a consistently ketogenic diet (and only fats are ketogenic), and that metabolic adaptation is the source of the health benefits.",False,False
