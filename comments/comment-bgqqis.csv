I tried Cooking Mama but I found it kind of uninteresting, but it's free if you want to give it a shot. I also really really love the food items in Animal Crossing, so I love crafting them in Pocket Camp (I have almost all of them lmao). If I find any I'll let you know!",False,False

I wonder if this is why I always liked manually feeding my pets when all the friends I knew who played the game just put them in the hotel place...",False,False
