I doubt that she has an ED,  she just probably has a small workout routine and eats healthy in order to maintain. Sounds pretty achievable to me, good luck",False,False

It is such a poor indicator of what people will look like at a certain BMI. Have you tried searching for other bodies with the same BMI to see how it can look different?  I think any body type is attainable without an ED - they are mental disorders not physical ones. From memory (and mine isnt perfect) Christian Bale or Jared Leto talked about their experience losing so much weight for the machinist and buyers club, respectively, referring to how their weightloss triggered disordered thoughts (rather than the other way around). My point is that they were rail thin and didn't have EDs, were conscious of how much danger they were in, and dug themselves out pretty quick .. which tells me that we cant always tell from looking at someone whether they have an ED or not. Personally, I find having a body goal by using a body that isn't mine is really triggering.. as you have as well. You have to see what your body will do for you if you treat it right.. you might be your own body goal.",False,False

I can actually imagine her eating a lot but exercising as well idk she's definitely a more healthy 'thinspo' in my eyes,False,False
