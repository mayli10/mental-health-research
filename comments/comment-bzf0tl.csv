When my binging was at its worst in college I got strep throat for the first time in my life. It was almost a blessing in disguise bc, like you, I couldn’t eat anything bc it hurt too much. So this started my binge / restrict cycle bc while I was too weak to even stand up some days, it kinda felt good in a fucked up way. When I had to study for exams tho I realized I couldn’t focus when I was restricting. So naturally my lack of control would spiral into binging. When I came home from college my mom took one look at me and sent my to a dietitian. That helped a bit for a few months. Also recently have been seeing a therapist and have been in a dbt group which was even better. That was with my college tho and I’ve just graduated. Kinda back on my bs again but I know we can get through this.",False,False

I got strep BAD, couldn’t even swallow or think of eating solids, so I wound up barely eating for nearly two weeks (it was the worst case of strep I’ve ever had), and I rapidly lost weight. Not to mention, I was on so many different antibiotics that just killed my appetite. I’ve been recovered from my ED for a few years now, but now I’m back to crying over meals and feeling drained all of the time since I can’t bring myself to eat enough to function. Feels awful. I hope we can both snap out of this illness-induced relapse soon.",False,False
