They can't be a good doctor to you if they don't have all the information. They can't force you to stop, only advise you on the dangers and then monitor your health. It's better for them to know.",False,False

You should be honest with your doctor (even about other things like drug use) because it can help them get a better picture of you as a patient and can help let them know what some of your additional risk factors are that you may have that an ""average"" patient may not. It's a lot like finding out someone smokes, doc can advise them to quit and explain the health risks but that's all they can do. But they can know that because your a smoker you have a bunch of increased risk factors for various things if that makes sense as an analogy, I'm pretty tired lol. ",False,False
