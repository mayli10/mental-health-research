Also, you might have some underlying malnourishment your body is dying to correct. It’s really hard to go from purging to normal eating.",False,False

Eat enough and regularly. Maybe it's reduced the binges a little bit, both by number and calories in a binge. Though it's far from solved the problem. Planning meals and eating regularly sound so easy, and should be easy, but it's so fucking hard :( I'm so proficient and dedicated in other parts of life (as I'm sure we all are) and yet when it comes to food the smallest problem feels completely unsolvable. Thanks again for your answer. While it sucks that other people feel this, it makes me feel a little less lonely.",False,True

I know that during the times I've tried to quit purging, this has happened to me. To be honest, I don't think I would recommend intermittent fasting for this because in my experience, when I IF to get out of a binge cycle, I still end up binging. I could seriously hammer down 3000 calories in an hour. Are you making sure you're eating an adequate amount throughout the day? Even if you are, it's still really hard to stop binging because your fullness cues might be all fucked up. In that case, I find it helpful to pre-plan all my meals throughout the day and plan out times to eat them. When I'm recovery-focused I usually eat 4-6 times a day. It might be helpful to work in conjunction with a nutritionist or dietitian, so that you can know exactly what your body needs. I wouldn't really recommend jumping right into intuitive eating for anyone recovering from an ED because after going through these phases of restricting, binging, purging, or whatever your behaviors may be, it's hard to tell what exactly your body needs. This is going to take a lot of time, and patience not friend. It's hard, and it's going to fucking hurt, but things will come out better on the other side. Please just hang in there.",False,False

You tell yourself you can eat whatever you normally eat between 11am and 7pm (or 12pm and 8pm, or 10am and 6pm, or whatever 8-hour window works best for your schedule), then gradually dial back your daily calories over a few weeks until you start losing weight. It's helpful because you get used to the feeling of being hungry and waiting to eat without truly restricting or feeling like you're depriving yourself. And I have definitely found that I eat fewer calories when I have fewer hours to eat them in.",False,False
