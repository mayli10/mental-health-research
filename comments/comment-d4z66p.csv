I haven't fasted in 3 weeks because people keep fucking up my schedule. I tried on Thursday, but my dom wouldn't leave me alone until I ate something. I ate 50 calories to shut him up then I was a wreck the rest of the night. Like fucking people just let me fast in peace. ðŸ˜’",False,False

I wanted to lose 10 more lbs before then, but that's not gonna happen. I might be able to lose 4 or 5 if I fast.",False,False
