I was binging and weighed 85 pounds so I hated myself and stopped weighting. I’ve been restricting and haven’t binged which I’m really proud of and I’ve eaten really well. I feel like I’ve lost some but I just don’t want to weight myself for a month or two because when I step on the scale I want to be less than 75. I also feel like when I look at the scale I’m like oh I can eat because I lost weight and then that leads to a binge.,False,False
