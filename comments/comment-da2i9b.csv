I ate Mexican tonight (after only having a protein shake all day) and wanted to purge since it’s not “clean” food. And my belly is bloated so I feel gross as fuck!!  I’m sorry you’re having to deal with such shitty circumstances now that you’re trying to heal. Hopefully soon your body will readjust.   I just did a little googling and read that someone’s (person who also hands free purges) doctor said they have a weak esophageal sphincter. She goes on to say that she has found that not drinking too much water with food seems to help a little.  Another poster agreed that not drinking a lot during meals helps and that you shouldn’t feel discouraged! She said it got better over time even though she was scared she would never heal. She said she didn’t drink water with meals for 6 months until she could start keeping everything down.   This was on bulimiahelp.org. I didn’t want to post the link as it’s a forum with real peoples’ faces as their avatars.   Don’t get discouraged! It might suck for now but it seems others have been through the same and have healed. You’re doing awesome, it’s just going to take your body a little time to not be confused. It just doesn’t understand what to do right now and needs a little time and guidance.  I also wonder if maybe sleeping with a thicker pillow will help. Maybe acid is rising up near your esophageal sphincter and aggravating it while you sleep. I’m no doctor and this is a totally random thought. But maybe elevation at night could help heal your GI issues. Idk I’d ask a doctor for sure. But I do think maybe the types of foods (ie acidic foods) could trigger it as well.   You’re strong love ❤️ You got this",False,False

I'm left with a hernia and it's horrible. I don't purge anymore but i struggle with my stomach because of it. I wish i could go back to that first day i stuck a tooth brush down my throat and stop myself. I feel your pain,  it's such an awful thing to go through.",False,False

I already know how to purge and it's hard for me to unlearn it as it is. I havent purged in like a month or so but that's because I'm way to depressed to bother.,False,False
