While I don’t disagree it slows your metabolism, it still needs energy.",False,True

It’s a cycle. Losing weight takes work and thought and it’s simpler than you think. You don’t need low calorie snacks or crazy fasts. Literally stick to eating whole foods and avoid any drinks that is not water. Eggs, meat, fruits and the weight will come off.",False,False

It works to a point.  Knowing my body is using the fat makes me feel better.  I know it’s silly and I also wouldn’t have to be worried about extra skin if I lose too quickly, but I dunno.  I *feel* like I had enough calories this morning.",False,True

It takes longer but more effective. Restriction will end up in a damaged metabolism. All lost weight will be back faster and you might end up gaining more than you lost due to a slower metabolic rate (calories you burn at rest). Not to mention, the extreme urges to binge.",False,False
