Haven't bothered to weigh myself hardly at all because my body has gone through so much shit lately that I thought it was probably best to just let things settle out. But I'm going to start again soon, because I know I will get back on my binging bullshit if I don't start keeping tabs on my weight. For me, it is a valuable (but unpleasant) tool for staying as not-disordered as I can be.   I didn't even really backslide. I didn't binge. I made some entirely reasonable little mistakes- the unfortunate thing is just that I made them in a short time frame.   \-Went on ADHD meds, which I'm paranoid lowered my TDEE by making me fidget less (this is backed up by the fact that I've now been adding to lifts supposedly while eating a hair under maintenance for a week... then again, I also just had a mesocycle of active rest + a big dose of artificially administered hormones, which could also do it... progesterone isn't exactly known for its anabolic properties, but I could see it giving my body a little boost, since I'd previously been deficient...)   \-Went on holiday, had extra alcohol and junk food. This is actually a victory, because I cheated an entirely reasonable amount and didn't freak out too much over it, but fuck was it badly timed XD  \-Had the aformentioned blast of medication, which lead to me having my first period in years... my research tells me that you DO need a little more calories when ovulating (like 100-200 a day, which makes a difference if you're really strict), but if I was eating over maintenance already... fml  \-Was just really damned hungry, and allowing myself a little more food, because in the past, spells of hunger like that (when supposedly eating maintenance) have been followed by unwanted weight loss. Again, this is a victory, but the timing is bad, because it may now compound with all these other things.   So, this week, while the bleeding wraps up, I'm eating what used to be my slightly insufficient maintenance calories, and adding to lifts, because I'm able. Once my period is over, I'll start weighing in again. Worst case scenario, if my TDEE is now lower and I've gained a bit extra, at least I've also got some strength gains out of it.
