I was suicidal for most of 2007-2018 and itâ€™s a dark and scary place that no one needs to be.  Iâ€™m so proud of you for sticking to recovery! Let yourself be proud of that because it a big deal. If you ever need to vent or need a shoulder Iâ€™m here.  Feel free to DM me ok?,False,False

I appreciate this a lot, its really kind. &lt;3 It feels really hard and I donâ€™t really know what to do. I have looked at support groups locally but there isnâ€™t really anything for transgender people, and Iâ€™m already in a group at my recovery center but there isnâ€™t really anyone like me there. Iâ€™m at a point where Iâ€™m physically recovered and eating well, itâ€™s just keeping relapse away and dealing with dysphoria thatâ€™s hard. Thank you very much for the kind words, they really do mean a lot at this point. :â€™â€¢)",False,True

Even if you donâ€™t feel like it, you are important to someone, even if that someone is me.  YOU MATTER.  The fact that you went through that and came out at all is amazing.  YOU kicked ass ðŸ–¤ðŸ–¤ðŸ–¤ all the love from my corner of the internet.  And I know this sounds cheesy and might now work, but have you looked for local support groups? Itâ€™s always good to have someone in person that can relate or at least be there to support you.  Going alone is hard and you donâ€™t deserve it ðŸ–¤",False,False
