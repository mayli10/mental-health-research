Report her to HR, 100%! I used to work in HR and verbally abusive supervisors are so under-reported because people feel like it's difficult to accuse someone who's above them in the hierarchy but please please do!! Any good HR department should immediately deal with it. If there are witnesses too, then it's likely she's done this to others and they're also afraid to call her out.  Hope you feel better soon!!",False,False
