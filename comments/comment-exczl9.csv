Currently taking 20mg of Zyprexa (Olanzapine) daily and I don't exercise at all (tried going to the gym but I hated it with my guts).  On October 22nd 2019, I weighed myself and came in at around 100kg, but fast forward to February 7th 2020, and I'm 113kg. That's 13kg in like 3 months!!!  Really worried since I'm allegedly obese according to BMI calculators and I'm only 19 years old. Don't know what to do at this point although I'm fixing to clean up my diet even more.",False,False

But some antipsychotics have different influences on weight. Abilify and Vraylar, for example, make you gain less weight than others. - a psychiatric nurse practitioner",False,False
