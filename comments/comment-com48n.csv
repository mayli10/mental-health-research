""All I know is I never weighed that much or looked like that."" It didn't make any sense considering she became overweight after her teens and having kids. I am not saying this to diss her as as I love her so much and would never want to hurt, but it fucked me up to hear that.  I would stay in my room and not eat all day because I knew she would judge me. I would come out in the afternoon to get a snack and she would say stuff like ""all you do is eat"" or ""omg there is that much left?"" even when I had a little or normal amount of food... I would often wait for her to go in the shower or to leave the house to eat. I was a bit overweight in my senior year of high school and in first year of uni and I honestly suspect that had some part in it.  it wasn't until I developed an ED that she stopped saying anything about my food or weight again. Even to this day as an adult, I still find it difficult to go to kitchen and get a snack. And when I do, I always be careful of how loud I open the cupboard for packages of food or when I am grabbing dishes. I still afraid she will say something or comment on my weight, even though she hasn't in over two years.",False,False
