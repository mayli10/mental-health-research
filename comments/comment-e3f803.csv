I don't know what is available to you but [a pocket scale like this goes up to 100g.](https://www.amazon.com/Weigh-Gram-Digital-Jewelry-Kitchen/dp/B06Y61YW7S) And then you can weigh your drugs too if you're into that sort of thing :))",False,False

Then youâ€™ve got the total cal in one rice cake.,False,False

As Cronometer uses mainly/many US-entries, you could try it out, because when you choose a generic entry for ""rice cakes"", it should give you, in many cases, a serving size, too.",False,False

Hey, I can always use a new food scale, just impossible to calculate without one I suppose. I use a food scale at home in the USA but if I didnâ€™t have one I could survive, guess Iâ€™ll just need to have one for overseas ðŸ˜…",False,True

It's simple - if you eat 50g of a product that has 250kcal/100g then you're consuming 0.5Ã—250=125kcal. Sure, it requires a scale but it's far easier and more accurate than all the ""about X servings per container"" type of American nonsense because if you have ""about"" an amount of something then there's your one point of inaccuracy, then there's the use of cups and tablespoons and all that which is inherently more inaccurate than weighing something, not to mention all the cross multiplication you have to do to figure out how many calories you're actually consuming because the serving sizes are random amounts that often fail to reflect how much a person typically eats. Plus, it's WAY easier to compare the calories and macros in different products.",False,False
