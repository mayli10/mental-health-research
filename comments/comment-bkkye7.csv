It's exhausting. Especially when I have traumatic dreams. It's so validating to see other commenters talking about having dreams so vivid they feel real because that has been me my whole life.   About 2 months ago I was put on Zaleplon. Holy fucking shit dude. My anxiety is manageable for the first time in 5 years.  It's a sleeping medication like Ambien. Idk what medications you're on or if you are interested in that kind of med, but it's something to consider asking about if you can't be on blood thinners. As with any med, your mileage might vary.   I still have anxiety, but it's 100x better and more manageable than it was with insomnia/vivid dreams. I feel a little stupid it took me 5 years of treatment to figure that out but honestly I never knew what it felt like to get a good night's sleep. 11/10 would recommend",False,False

Sometimes theyâ€™ll prescribe another med to try to help with the nightmares. Iâ€™m seriously thinking about asking about it at my med check this week, but the med (prazosin) is actually a blood thinner so not sure if my current doc will be on board with prescribing.  Talking about appetite changes with your prescriber is probably a good idea. With SSRIs my appetite went back to normal after a few weeks. With some antipsychotics I was just a ravenous hunger beast the whole time. (With the usual caveat of your mileage may vary.)",False,False

We'll see I guess.,False,False

Right now it's seriously blurring the line between dreams and reality. Sorry you're having to go through this. Perhaps ask your doctor for an alternative?,False,False
