At my lowest, people were saying how much better I seemed, and I never cried. But I had a date, a method, and an exact location picked out for my suicide. You can never look at someone and tell how much they‚Äôre struggling mentally.",False,False

This garbage is exactly what we need to stop spewing to people. A person with Anorexia or any eating disorder can live a normal life without needing to be ""signed out"". Not every person with an eating disorder wants to die or wants to cause irreparable damage to themselves. Everyone's eating disorder is unique but it doesn't make it any less valid. Fuck.   This person just pissed me the fuck off.",False,False
