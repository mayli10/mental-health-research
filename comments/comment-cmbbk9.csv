Basically it makes the door hard to open so that you can feel when its locked, but if you really wamt to you can still open it with force",False,False

They messed up my ng feed a few times to, i forgot to add that to my post. I was supposed to be fed with 2250 ml of a formula that had 100 kcal/ml every day, but for a few days the nurses accidentally gave me the wrong formula with double the amount of calories. I almost got refeeding syndrome. My body felt really shitty (nausea, exhaustion, shortness of breath, racing heartbeat). Eventually i noticed it and notified my doctor who filed a report",False,False

I can hardly remember because it was such a petty, disorder-fueled fight, but I think  it was about something being added into the recipe (probably a fear food of mine?). I stormed out as the fight escalated and had to debrief the next day with the clinical director. It was totally stupid, and me and the other patient are friends!   That dietitian sounds like they didn't approach you in the right way, honestly. I know it's really hard for health professionals to work with eating disorders, so I try to have some grace. I have definitely had good and bad health professionals in treatment centers, and you can always tell when someone just doesn't get it.",False,False

While, I enjoyed hearing your funny stories, the two serious ones you shared (especially the one about the transgender patient, considering what was going on at the time) were really powerful.   You also reminded me of this one time I was exiled from the table during a meal outing. Me and two other girls hadn't touched out plates yet after five minutes, and the dietitian might as well of called me a lost cause because she singled me out and told me to sit alone a table away for the remaining half hour. I probably looked like some moody teenager. Oh! And here's the kicker, afterwards (even though one of the girls also didn't touch her meal) she called me to her office to tell me how disappointed she was in me and that I was ""creating a culture of restriction"". Like excuse me? Most of the patients here have anorexia!",False,True

Really powerful because of all the backlash regarding restrooms in the US. * I forgot I had an activity monitor on (they thought I was overexercising because of weight loss in residential) and I masturbated lmao. * My grandma was dying when I entered residential. I had my last conversation with her while there on the phone, and I will never forget that. When I found out she died (while in treatment), more than a dozen patients wrapped their arms around me simultaneously. I'll never forget that. * Meal experientials in IOP and PHP were always a hoot. We'd get lots of funny looks. * Its always interesting to learn the reason behind some of the stranger rules (there's too many to name, but I'll make a list if anyone is curious).  * There was a Starbucks across the street from residential that everyone always stared at longingly. * One girl would entertain us by popping out her entire eyeball.  I'll add more if I remember anything.",False,False

Most of them are pretty shitty and I sometimes have actual traumatic flashbacks and nightmares about it, but here are some fun ones:  * me and my roommate giving all our mental illnesses goofy personas and drawing pictures of them. depression was named martha, anxiety was iggy, etc. they all had cute outfits and some had cat ears. * watching the same movie over and over until it became a meme and everyone could quote it word for word. i can't listen to the greatest showman anymore * printing memes during school hours and taping them in the bathroom. my favorite stall had a photo of nicolas cage screaming right above the toilet * the nursing staff were always the most supportive, good-natured people there, more than the TAs (glorified babysitters) and therapists. they sometimes sat with us at meals and made everything so much less terrible. * me and my two best friends liked to do ""cult meetings"" in the hallway just before bedtime, where we'd strip our beds and wear the blankets like robes and goof off like we were summoning a demon or something.

I can't believe they would punish you for getting a sunburn! Or force you outside!  Thank you so much for sharing the exchange with your dietician. That's actually super helpful.   I can definitely relate to the contraband thing, at my residential we had a contraband closet where we kept our forbidden things. I would take two things out and only return one. Worked every time ;)",False,True

You're right, that does sound weird"" and everyone lost it. The care tech told us not to talk that way but she was laughing too.  I remember them making me eat so much food one night at dinner that afterwards all I could do was lie on the floor and cry silently because my stomach hurt so bad.  I have serious anxiety about being in the sun so I brought an umbrella to an outing where we were going to be outside and just didn't tell them I was using it as an avoidance thing. It was reasonable though bc we got punished if somehow we got sunburned. The first time they forced me to go outside I seriously considered just biting my hand open with my teeth so I'd be put on self-harm precautions and not have to go outside. I wasn't brave enough and just ended up curled up in what little shade there was with my notebook over my head.  I remember telling my dietitian that I was afraid to recover because I wouldn't be pretty anymore and she took me to her office where she had this massive collage on the wall of people, all different shapes and sizes, all smiling and laughing and reminded me that they were beautiful because they were happy, and that no matter my physical appearance I would radiate beauty and joy because I was happy and healthy. That was a big thing for me. I still think about that a lot.  They used to give us our meds before breakfast and sometimes if you take pills on an empty stomach it makes you nauseated and so when I went to the computer to Google why that was (to distract myself bc I have a horrible fear of vomiting) I clicked one link that seemed to have answers and immediately realized it was MyProAna. I frantically clicked the back button over and over so no one would see and get me in trouble.  When they were searching my things, they somehow missed one paperclip that I'd left in my glasses case. I held onto it as a kind of symbol of rebellion; it was the one thing that I had not because they allowed me to but because I wanted it, and it made me feel a little more human. I had no intention of using it to hurt myself or anything. My friend knew about it and brought me another tiny paperclip during her visits just because she knew it made me feel better. I started hoarding all the tiny contraband items I could get. Eventually they searched my room and caught me and I was punished. It was worth it though.  Tldr; naming children inappropriately, basically being forced to binge, heliophobia, a reminder that beauty is in the inside, accidentally visiting a pro-ana site on the public computers, and hiding paperclips",False,False
