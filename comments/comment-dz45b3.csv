I’ve never wanted kids but fear of passing on this and my bipolar disorder definitely adds to that,False,False

My parents and brother are obese. My dad loves to cook and generally buys healthy groceries but also gives zero shit about using lots of cooking oil, fatty meat, etc. My mom went through every fad diet, and there were times when all the food we had were atkins bars, crystal lite, diet soda, low carb bread, meal replacement shake powder, weight watchers popsicles, low fat yoplait, sugar free jello, that kind of thing. So my whole childhood was moving between home cooked whole foods and disgusting diet crap. But my mom would just binge on that stuff. And it was really normal for my brother and me to have after-school snacks that were basically meals, like veggie burgers on bread. There was always ice cream in the house too but my mom would hide it until special occasions but my brother would always find it. I dunno it was fucked up.  My mom was/still does constantly complain about how fat she is. When I was in middle school I was obsessed with being good at dieting (I was overweight) because my whole family was always doing it and failing, and I wanted to be better at it somehow. My first ED behavior was in high school (I'm 29 now). I just stopped eating for a month until I lost enough weight that no one called me fat anymore. ED got really bad my last year of college and the year I graduated, was barely eating for extended periods of time. I'm still really fucked up about food and I think have just had variations of bulimia after I started mood stabilizers and birth control. So I'm fat and obsessed with my diet and fast for fun but then binge on chinese takeout.   I know it's fucked up, but I'm genetically predisposed to be overweight and short, and I hate the idea of having kids and having them go through being fat kids and how shitty that is. And I know my obsessive ED behavior would just rub off on them. It's weird because I am able to hide a good extent of it from my husband, but I don't want my kids to have the BED that my mom and brother clearly have or the restrictive/bulimia ED disorder that I have had since like 5th grade.",False,False

A person is born with a predisposition to manage an emotion or a set of emotions through disordered eating behaviours, but they won't actually develop an eating disorder if they're sufficiently armed with healthy coping strategies early enough, and live a life free enough from the environmental risk factors.",False,False

I wish I had something more positive to say. I do think it is possible to break the cycle and not pass on ED behaviors, but likely only by recovering yourself and making sure that your children are not exposed to those behaviors and patterns.  I grew up with a bulimic/anorexic mother, who not only had bulimia and anorexia but has weird food habits (only eating one snack food like fruit or rice cakes, if anything, all day, then having a large volume eater healthy dinner - so basically OMAD). I have the exact same food patterns and have always had those patterns and I don't believe I will ever really be able to break them.",False,False

I have a daughter. I never talk weight, calories, healthy vs not, etc. in front of her. We talk about food being fuel, food helping us grow, food giving us the ability to do the stuff we find fun. My daughter eats an incredibly well-rounded diet and has a very adventurous palate, to which I’m grateful.   I don’t know if I’d survive my daughter having an eating disorder. There’s no way for that not to be my fault. If my daughter went through this, it would destroy me. My husband has a very normal relationship with food, has never dieted or “tried to eat healthier”, and never binges. I want her to watch him and not me.",False,False

Family style dining is also very helpful in these situations. For meals, you can serve them while also allowing them a say by asking questions like ""How hungry are you? Is this enough?"" and making helpful, encouraging comments like ""If you're still hungry, you may have a second helping."" Or ""If you're full, you don't have to finish everything on your plate."" Around snack time is when you can allow them to serve themselves as practice as well as make it a math game or something. Bring in a bowl of grapes and a few smaller bowls and serve yourself before asking them to do the same. Eat with them  Basically just exercise healthful food autonomy around them.",False,False

My one year old was severely underweight (preemie) and we had him on high cal formula etc as he struggled to eat (cleft lip). It was a life changing experience for me. It revolutionized how I view calories and food. I make sure to eat in front of my second grader and I'm very careful about making sure I'm not under feeding them and giving them good, nutritious food. However, I frequently catch myself slipping back into old habits and I have to remind myself that if my baby can fight and gain weight and become the thriving one year old he is, I can face my issues too.  The 7 year old wants to be a ninja so we tell him fruits and veggies are ninja foods and sweets are for treats. He's quite thin himself (built like a bean pole, tall and skinny) but has made great strides trying new ninja foods. It was harder when he was at home all the time as a toddler and always wanted to share his food with me.",False,False

I make sure to eat volume foods when they're home and express how good the food is for them. I think EDs are a personal battle that we'll have to come to eventually, but right now its my job to teach them how to manage their emotions and feelings in a healthy way.
