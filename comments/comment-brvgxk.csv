Speak, now that I remember it, was trash absolutely never mind.",False,False

The main character was so unlikable, but maybe she just reminded me of myself. I do remember a part of that book where she sits down and describes how her thigh fat fans out, back when I thought I was the only one with that experience/shame.",False,False

I really enjoyed it at 14 but five years later I couldn't get back into it when I tried it again.   It also have in it the essence of the dead/dying pro-ana culture that nobody is really still down with which doesn't win it any points in 2019.,False,False
