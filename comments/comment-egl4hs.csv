Most importantly every calorie counts when you're doing that few, so no crap. Make sure all your calories are from healthy fats, veggies, protein, and you eat a variety so you get in all your micronutrients.",False,False

My doctor gave me a prescription. It doesn’t *give* me energy, but once the caffeine kicks in and I’m doing things, it *prevents* my fatigue and exhaustion starting to set in, if that makes sense? It would get to 12pm and I’d be ready to pass out from exhaustion, but when I take the armodafinil that doesn’t happen and I’m fine all day.   You could talk a doctor about it if you were interested. The problem I have is it’s very expensive where I live (Australia) (I’m not sure about international prices though).",False,False
