So supportive, loving and caring. We’ve dealt with similar issues and it hasn’t been easy but we’re working on it. But I must say something you probably won’t like - talking to him about it is the only solution. If you’re planning to be with him long-term, if you’re taking this relationship seriously, you must tell him. You won’t be able to hide it forever, believe me, I tried. I’ve been with my bf for two years and telling him was the most stressful, nerve wracking thing I’ve ever done but believe me, it was worth it. When you explain to him what you’re struggling with, you may be surprised how well he takes it and how understanding he is. But now you can’t punish him for doing what in his eyes is what a good bf should be doing, if he doesn’t know the whole picture.",False,False
