I struggle so badly with isolation and agoraphobia too, I've lost all my friends. It's really rough and lonely, stuck in the house with my obsessions. I don't have anything useful to say other than 'I relate' and 'me too'. Please don't beat yourself up over this - recovery is incredibly difficult, and you deserve kindness. I want to give you a hug. It's okay to mess up sometimes. It doesn't cancel out the incredible progress you've made. This binge is nothing compared to what you've achieved. Recovery isn't just maintenance, it's getting back up after you've been knocked down.",False,False
