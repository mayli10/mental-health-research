Losing too many electrolytes will make you pass it and will eventually kill you.  Harm reduction to keep you from passing out as much and to keep your heart pumping: take 1/8-1/4 tsp of nosalt (potassium) and 1/4-1/2 tsp of salt on days you purge to replace those electrolytes along with a bunch of water.   It is better to not purge but just saying ""don't purge"" is not very helpful lmao, take care of yourself ❤️",False,False

I'm not an expert on purging and don't do it myself but I've heard it can really mess with your blood sugar levels (fasting too) and dehydrate the hell out of you.,False,False
