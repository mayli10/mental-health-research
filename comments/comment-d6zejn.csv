You may also have some nutritional issues that are making you look sicker to them. When I was a teen at my lowest weight I maintained for like 8 months. I looked way worse at month 8 than month one despite weighing the same. My skin was thin, my eyes sunken, my hair was falling out, stuff like that. Especially as a teen, your nutritional needs are different than an adults. It's hard to manage vitamins and stuff by yourself, it's not super accessible information.  I completely get why you feel like your privacy in being invaded!  Until you're 18 it's considered your parents responsibility to make sure you're eating right and are healthy, so they have to bring up the concerns to your parents. Sometimes they'll make you see the school counselor before telling your parents about concerns, but that's falling out of practice. It's not really recommend to just talk to you and not your parents anymore, just talking to the student tends to just make the student better at hiding their ED. And they sort of have to treat the situation as if it's a severe problem. They'd much rather be too careful than miss a student that really needs help. If you have multiple teachers concerned I would probably try to gain a little weight, regardless of what your friend thinks. Your teachers have the power to really affect your life, so it's more important that they think you aren't ill.",False,False
