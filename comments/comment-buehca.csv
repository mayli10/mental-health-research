I usually thrift American eagle jeans I've found that old navy jeans rarely last more than a year for me. Maybe I'll try banana republic? I like H and M but their store always makes me feel uncomfortable? I think it's all the people coming to talk to me. F21 is a zoo. I'm going to try going out before work tomorrow when it's less busy, it's good to know I'm not the only one struggling",False,False

I'm trying to get out of the men's section. It's hard to find a balance between looking decent and covering most of my body. Like why does no one make long sleeve black floor length sun dresses.,False,False

I personally like the Jean's at American Eagle better, but Old Navy often has good sales, and I never feel judged there for my size. Shirts: Walmart, and H&amp;M. Also Forever21 can be nice, but I find that some of their shirts fit a bit tight, and the store is always too bright/loud for my tastes. Also I personally like the shirts at Target, but the dressing rooms are overwhelming. I usually buy things I think will fit, and try them on at home. If you're anxious in a store, there's always time to leave and walk around for a bit. Purchases dont have to be made on the spot. Also, as a size L/XL I have to remind myself sometimes that if they dont have my size in stock, it's generally because it's a popular size, and that makes me feel less alone. I hope things go alright. I'll be sending you good thoughts.",False,False

And have a look online at what kind of style or clothes you like then when you‚Äôre shopping pick up similar things? Idk this is all coming from someone who also has breakdowns shopping so it might not be helpful.,False,True

I need to go summer clothing shopping and I could use any tips y'all have to actually be able to successfully get clothes from a store and not have a breakdown.   I'm usually fine to go to malls, or clothing stores but it's always with other people (usually my partner) who are looking to get something for themselves. I cannot stand shopping for myself when other people are around. My mom used to make clothes shopping a nightmare when I was a teen and I think I just project her vibes on who ever I'm with.   At the same time though if I go alone I   a) don't have to motivation since I mostly don't enjoy the act of shopping.  B) have literally no idea what looks good on me.  C) just don't have like store knowledge? Where do you buy jeans that are good? Shorts? Is this an old lady store?   I bought a pair of pants online once which I thought would be fine since they used inch measurements but even though they fit those parts they still fit poorly and I would never have bought them in store had I tried them on. I have a weird body so I can't really do online shopping for things that aren't T-shirts.   I'm also not wealthy so I can't afford tailoring or well made clothes for the most part. Most of my clothes come from the Walmart little boys section (one of the only places I'm comfortable shopping?) or are thrifted stuff that I do generally like but it's like chunky sweaters and stuff like that.   I'm sorry for the rant. This isn't something I can talk about with ""normal people"" because it's insane. And maybe someone has some advice?",False,False
