However, I will let this stay up as per rule #2.*   &gt;   &gt;""Triggering posts that do not warn other members (eg. no trigger warnings or nsfw filter) AND/OR do not recognise that ED may have warped your perception, will be removed.""   &gt;   &gt;*Even though OP flaired the post as a shitpost, they clearly state, ""I think this has got the be the most fucked up disordered thought that has come across my mind. I almost wanted to slap myself for it lol I AM SO SORRY.""*   &gt;   &gt;*This sub does not censor disordered thoughts- we talk about it openly since it is not uncommon that disordered thoughts like this can pop up intrusively - and it is better to acknowledge it, share it, AND acknowledge that this is warped ED mentality. It is not healthy, not normal, not right. However discussing it with others can ground us back to reality that it IS ""fucked up"", whilst hiding it under the rug can mean that, in isolation, disordered folk stray further.*   &gt;   &gt;*If OP thought that their Parkinson's thought was acceptable, or refused to believe that the thought was disordered or controversial, their post would immediately be removed. Likewise if any of the comments had actively encourage disordered thinking or applauded OP's train of thought.*  OP I'm glad that you can acknowledge that this is definitely a disordered thought, but your light-hearted tone may make some people think you are (quote) ""being quirky"" or making light of the disease. Also changed your flair from ""shitpost"" to ""oh no"".",True,False

Maybe it would help to remind yourself that while yes, you with CP might burn more calories than you without CP if you did nothing all day, you with CP would be called disabled because CP is (not surprisingly) disabling. So your daily tdee would be negatively impacted because your very autonomy of voluntary movement is restricted.",False,False
