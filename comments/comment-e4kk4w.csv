That being said, if I eat anything, even “just a bite,” I’m in full-on binge mode for the rest of the night. I try to keep the urges at bay by drowning myself in 0 calorie liquids. Going for a walk or distracting yourself with some sort of hobby is really fun while stoned too, and it has the added bonus of keeping you from eating :)",False,False
