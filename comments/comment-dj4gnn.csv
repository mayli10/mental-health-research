My boss called me fat to my face one time and made me cry (this is when I was at my highest weight). I cried for the entire day. I felt so much shame even being at work. Now that I am thinner the same boss sexualizes me constantly.   Please take care of yourself, and again I‚Äôm so so sorry you had to hear that :(",False,False

I read somewhere that if there's something up with someone's appearance that they can't change within like 10 seconds don't make unsolicited comments on it. Like if they've got food in their teeth, yeah, quietly let them know but don't comment on shit like the size of their feet or something like that. Idk, I reckon it's a good guideline.   And thanks for the words of encouragement my fellow comrade!!! Baby steps.",False,True

And everyone would weigh themselves on the scale in front of everyone else. Guess who went back to severe restricting for a couple years while I had that job.,False,False

This makes me wonder what goes on in there head sometimes. Like legitimately I can‚Äôt understand the need to comment on someone else‚Äôs body..? Idk how I was before I developed an ED, but I don‚Äôt recall ever feeling the need to comment or tell someone that they looked ‚Äúskinny, fat, etc etc.‚Äù It‚Äôs so strange to me.  Idk maybe it is different with older people. My grandparents do this with me. They don‚Äôt say so much anymore, but back when I was near the bottom end of a healthy BMI, they always talked about how ‚Äúskinny‚Äù I was and how I needed to eat. It was constant. My grandpa used to come up behind me and rub my shoulders, but I‚Äôm pretty sure it was just to feel my collar bones. They still say stuff now, but it is less intrusive. Idk, OP. It seems like, with older generations, they make such comments in a nonchalant manner, but I‚Äôm not able to understand how or why.  Anyway, I‚Äôm sorry that this happened to you. I find it completely absurd that this happens and that it is able to affect someone‚Äôs life so much. People can think what they want, but why can‚Äôt they keep it to themselves? What merit is there in telling someone something like that? I don‚Äôt get it either.   Take care, OP. You‚Äôre doing fine, friend. We‚Äôre all gonna make it brah",False,False

My boss commented on my weight all the time and I wonder if I ever went through recovery if he would eventually call me fat....  But fr those people exist and they are fucking assholes.
