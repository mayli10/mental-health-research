I reccommend trying to put together some meals that you can get but aren't like 2000+ calories.  I'm not sure what you consider high calorie but some reccommendations  McDonalds: Hash brown- 140 cal, plain hamburger-250, ham and cheese pocket- 250, cheeseburger- 302, nuggets 3 pack- 132, nuggets 6 pack-265  KFC: pretty much nothing exept for the regular coleslaw- 96 cal  Subway: just get wheat bread and chuck some veggies in it, if you want a meat then cold cuts are the way to go",False,False
