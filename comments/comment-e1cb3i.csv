It was a hellish debate on whether or not I should order actual food or just stick with coffee say I wasn't hungry. I ordered food but I couldn't bring myself to eat it so I brought it home where I promptly sabotaged it by pouring gardening soil all over it. It's so fucking hilarious that I can binge on all of the shittiest foods but when I'm restricting an apple feels like too much. I'm losing weight again and I can feel it in my face and collar bones. I want to see my boobs disappear. I swear the boobs make me look 20 pounds heavier.,False,False
