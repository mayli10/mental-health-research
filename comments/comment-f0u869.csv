Reading it all over again I can see that I took your comment the wrong way. It seems we both misunderstood each other at some point...genuinely didn‚Äôt mean to make you feel invalid or anything.

Im genuinely sorry for the confusion, I wasn't trying to call you shallow or not disordered at all, I'm sorry it came across that way!   When I was referring to 'shallow' and 'disordered' i was talking about the two different pro anas that you mentioned in your original post with some words that you used to describe them.  Reading your comment in reply to the person at the start of this thread made me think that I myself was invalid, but I was able to recognise that that is a symptom of the disorder. That was the point I was trying to make, and was just trying to discuss if you had thought about that!   Sorry again",False,False

If a couple of cranky, pissed off, bitter comments are all people are using to judge me by, then I can understand why and how one would come to those conclusions. (Whether or not those traits are wholly representative of who I actually am is debatable, but beside the point.)  I still fail to see where you‚Äôd get ‚Äúshallow‚Äù and ‚Äúnot disordered‚Äù from.   Am I ‚Äúshallow‚Äù for thinking it‚Äôs fucked up for people to go on crash diets whilst declaring themselves to ‚Äúbe ana‚Äù and encouraging others to engage in harmful behaviours? To be giving people dangerous weight loss ‚Äúadvice‚Äù when they have no idea what they‚Äôre talking about, or for seeking out tips &amp; tricks? All so that they can lose five pounds, and once they do they‚Äôll abandon the ~ana lifestyle they had so proudly glamorised? Am I shallow for taking issue with people who trivialise a serious, potentially fatal illness that millions of people legitimately suffer from, thus perpetuating the belief among the general population that EDs aren‚Äôt serious at all? Please explain to me what part of that makes me shallow. I would genuinely like to know.  And as for ‚Äúnot disordered‚Äù...well, I‚Äôve got 14 years and counting of AN under my belt. Not ~aNa, and not ~~mia. Anorexia Nervosa, which I‚Äôve had for nearly half my life. AN that I cling onto not because I want it to make me beautiful (as it happens, there are very few people who find actual emaciation to be beautiful), but because I want it to fucking kill me.  But no, I‚Äôm not disordered at all. Just shallow! Thanks for clearing that up for me!",False,True

It's like all the tumblr people decided to come to Reddit. Anybody who supports this shit, if you're listening, get some help. Stop promoting these disorders. It's a disorder not a lifestyle. People die from this. Every night I go to sleep wondering if this shit will kill me in my sleep. Wondering if I'll wake up in the morning. And y'all are out here acting like it's a fucking cutesy little diet that you can just go on and off of. No. If you truly have a disorder you know that you can't just stop. You can't just decide that you don't want to do it anymore and be fixed in a day. I don't understand y'all. I'm fucking sick. This is the kind of shit that was fed to me when I was early on in my ED at 10 years old. That this is a lifestyle that it'll make me beautiful that it'll make me happy. None of that is true.

There are those who do have legit body image issues and possibly disordered eating, and I think you are probably looking at it from that perspective. I can understand why you feel for those people (and I suppose I feel for them too, or would if I wasn‚Äôt such a cranky bitch at this point.)  But there are others who want to lose x amount of pounds so they can look ~hot in their bikini on their upcoming trip, or wanna be a ~skinny legend at prom, or whatever else. Sure they‚Äôre not 100% satisfied with their bodies (I‚Äôd say very few people in the world are), but they aren‚Äôt coming from a place of actual distress and there isn‚Äôt any sort of mental illness at play. They are just shallow and vapid and vain. And I don‚Äôt believe the people who fall into this group need or deserve help and support. What they need is to get their heads out of their asses and stop being ignorant little shits.

I always assume that anyone who would post or lurk on a pro-ana type platform genuinely has issues with food or body image that should be addressed. Heck, I spent my fair share of time lurking in those online spaces as a young teen, too, and I was definitely already disordered.  It's horrible that they're putting this sub and other support or recovery focused ED subs in danger. It absolutely  should be shut down, and from there it's not a far throw for someone to say this sub should go, too. I really hope that doesn't happen, but Ive been around the internet long enough to have seen it many times. Either way, I think many of those people would benefit from a supportive group like this with harm recuction tips and support to recover when youre ready.
