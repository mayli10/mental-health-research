Anyone who has been through refeeding has been through the bloat phase. It feels like it will never end but it eventually does, I promise!",False,False

Also I think I ate a bit more than you during the recovery phase, but I’m not sure if that would make a difference (I also had similar stats to yours, 5’9, 110–&gt;130). Anyway everyone’s body is different, I’m not sure what the norm is.  Try googling “ED recovery and Gastroparesis” and see if you could find some more info about the length of time.",False,False

It’s called Gastroparesis and is common during refeeding. It will eventually go away. Basically, your stomach is emptying slower than prior to your ED, causing the bloat. Plus you’re probably retaining more water still. It should eventually go away once your body gets used to the higher intake, although 4 months does sound a little long. Just stick with it, it will get better and your stomach will eventually go back to normal.",False,False
