I enjoy the process, I find it therapeutic and I like the creativity it allows me. I love baking vegan treats or paleo bakes for my sisters when they ask me for them. My dad loves cake but can’t bake and is always so excited when I bring one over. I am underweight and don’t try or eat anything I make because it causes me too much anxiety. This year I’d like to help do some cooking at halfway houses and maybe prepare more meals for my parents who could use the help. Maybe that could be something you look into doing too since it would be for the benefit of others which is satisfying in itself",False,False
