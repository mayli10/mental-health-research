Maybe not in the way you planned it to be, but it will still be ok. When I was 18 I was miserable, incredibly depressed, and disordered. Eight years later I am on psychiatric medication that has changed my life, I'm finishing up therapy, and I'm engaged to the love of my life. I never would have guessed it would be ok. I never believed it could be.   But you will figure things out for yourself. It might take a while, it might be a bumpy path, but you will get there. ",False,False

Even if you have to ""disappear"" (aka maybe just be a tad antisocial and focus on school/work/health/self care/basic necessities) for a while, you'll  eventually come out of the other side of all of the struggles you're going through and you'll be a lot stronger for it. You're **so** young. You literally don't need to have anything figured out by 18, as long as you haven't killed anyone or anything you've got a million chances to make and remake yourself into whoever you want to be.  I'm 20 and when I was 18 I genuinely thought I'd ruined my life and that fixing all my problems was impossible (lowish college GPA, sky high BMI, catastrophic problems in my personal life), but now two short years later, all of that has been fixed and I'm working on new goals (law school, therapy). I also frequently feel like I'm a horrible person and not good enough, but behavioral patterns you see in yourself and don't like can be changed if you're motivated and get the right help.   You can do it, where there's a will there's a way! Make this year your year :)",False,False
