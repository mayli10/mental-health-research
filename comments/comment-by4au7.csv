Like ""if you drop below x pounds or practice ABC behavior x number of times a week we'll have to go up a level of care"" because EDs can be tricky and a lot of times patients will try to push the boundaries further and further for what would require inpatient or hospitilization.  Maybe since you have been in all the levels of care, your doctor is being extra strict. I guess the good thing is, your doctor believes in you! He/she has set you some big tasks but like, they wouldn't have done that if they thought you would fail.   At first I was like ""hmm this sounds suspect"" but I think it's actually a good thing because patients with EDs need structure and very strict guidelines. Maybe signing a contract is a lil weird, but it's a good way for the doctor to say, ""this is what we agreed to, you have/havent followed it""  Anyways, good luck! Recovery is hard but it sounds like you're getting through it, that's awesome! I dont know you but I'm proud!",False,False
