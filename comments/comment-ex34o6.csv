One day of (relatively) ""normal"" eating definitely won't make you gain, especially when you eat So Much less than your BMR normally and considering that it takes more than 3500 calories even above your TDEE to gain a pound! If you see any change on the scale tomorrow, it's waste and water weight that'll pass away naturally. Your body needs energy to literally just keep surviving - fearing that you've gained because of it is your ED making you think irrationally. You're stronger than that voice, I believe in you and I hope you feel better soon ðŸ’–",False,False
