They are not chemically different from ""naturally-occurring sugars."" Sugar has significant metabolic functions in the body. Glucose is the primary source of fuel for our brain, and the nervous system only provided 60% of metabolic needs from ketone bodies. Any macronutrient in excess whether that's carbohydrates (which break down into sugar), protein, or fat can be problematic.
