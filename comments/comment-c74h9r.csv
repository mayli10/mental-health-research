Itâ€™s nice, but I enjoy following peoplesâ€™ stories more.   I got tumblr and meh... and Instagram is generally okay, like it has its toxicity, but it also has some uplifting aspects to it as well. Itâ€™s isolating when people you have grown close to gets removed, even if it isnâ€™t a very triggering account. Reddit was definitely the most supportive though, IMHO.",False,True

Iâ€™m so happy there are other subreddits out there. The community I felt was so positive and supportive, not excluding people because they didnâ€™t fit their definition of a disorder, etc.   I follow the 1200isplenty, but itâ€™s sort of meh.   Again, I thank you so much for your reply! When I found this subreddit, I signed up for peach and Iâ€™m hoping itâ€™s a good platform.",False,True

MPA ofc, pretty much anything goes on there so i kinda like it. the only rule that i know of that goes beyond common sense is no reverse thinspo.   my pancake addiction, which idk anything about lol.    subreddits: r/EdAnonymousAdults, r/Edanonymemes, r/fuckeatingdisorders, r/EatingDisorders, r/bingeeating, r/overcomebingeeating, r/BingeEatingDisorder, and r/bulimia.    if you just want subs that are sorta ED related: r/safe_food, r/thinspo *(quarantined &amp; inactive)*, and r/EDFood *(quarantined)* are the only ones i know of.    i wonâ€™t link these, but fasting, 1200isplenty, fatlogic are sort of EDish too.",False,False
