Restrict Mon-Fri, eat whatever on Sunday, Saturday is a flex day based on my plans. The weight loss wasn't super fast, because the weekly average was higher than straight restricting, but it was consistent. None of that ""lose 5, gain 3"" bullshit.  As long as I didn't weigh myself on Monday. ",False,False

Itâ€™s works perfectly for me, I either lose or maintain based on my goals and I never lose control and binge. ",False,False
