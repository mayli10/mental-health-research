I differentiate between my own thoughts and Ed’s but I hate that hearing terrible things. Thank you. Only the first session is covered so I’m not sure what I’ll do. I’ve been in recovery for a year and it’s been full of ups and downs, I know this down is temporary but it doesn’t make it suck any less. Thanks for your response ❤️ I’ve been feeling too alone lately",False,True

EDs also speak to us. Like how you have self-awareness yet your ED is whispering all these messed up lies to you. I feel the same way and it makes me feel actually crazy.  &amp;#x200B;  It's awful, I'm sorry. :( Good luck with your new dietitian, I hope things work out well for you and I hope you can enjoy food some day soon, like really enjoy it without the ED standing over your shoulder.",False,False
