I've asked similar kinds of simple questions like this in other subs before, and all I've got was a handful of downvotes, along with a comment that gets upvoted for calling me stupid.  Another reason why I like this community.  People here are a lot nicer, downvotes are used more sparingly for its intended purpose, and everyone here is on the same level, with nobody being condescending and assuming that they're smarter than everyone else.  I'm glad I found this community filled with people who are civil, and not toxic or vicious.",False,False

Just wondering, how do you put post-its in your shower?  Wouldn't it get wet?  I'm sorry for sounding stupid, perhaps you put it in a sheet protector?",False,False

There is not one moment that goes by where I'm not worried about my appearance. It doesn't help that I'm a 25 year old woman who's never had a boyfriend. I'm quite sure it's because I'm an insecure fuck. But I cant help it. Insecurity is engraved on my DNA. ,False,False

I don’t want to sound too preachy but I think maybe you could think about why you think you’ll never be good-looking. I honestly believe that the vast majority of humans *do* have the possibility to become attractive. You look better than you think! &lt;3 and you deserve to feel better about your future/hopes/etc. There *is* a point in life and you don’t need to make yourself starve to death!,False,False

One of the things driving my ED is also a deep feeling of ugliness and a perceived incapacity to be beautiful.   But in my case it's not that I'd rather be ugly and skinny than ugly and fat (or average), or that I'd rather be a little less ugly by being skinny. Instead I look at the grotesquely emaciated body as being beyond beauty and ugliness. I deeply hate being ugly, and since I can't be pretty, I want to look so unnaturally ugly that I'd no longer be ugly but grotesque. To me that would be like going beyond beauty. It'd make me feel like ugly or pretty would be categories that simply don't apply to me.   A few days ago my cousin told me she was worried about how bony my body felt when she hugged me. I had to hide how livid that made me feel.",False,False

Whether it's makeup or a nice beard or grooming/hairstyle. I keep post-notes and writing in a lot of problematic places (like mirrors and my shower) that tell me to forgive myself and point out my beauty, even if they feel like a lie most days it still feels like a compliment and serves as a reminder.   I still feel similarly every day but even just a hint of kindness to yourself helps &lt;3",False,False
