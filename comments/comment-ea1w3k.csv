You might think that the exponent should simply be 3, but that doesn't match the data at all. It has been known for a long time that people don't scale in a perfectly linear fashion as they grow. I propose that a better approximation to the actual sizes and shapes of healthy bodies might be given by an exponent of 2.5. So here is the formula I think is worth considering as an alternative to the standard BMI:  New formula: BMI = 1.3*weight(kg)/height(m)^2.5 = 5734*weight(lb)/height(in)^2.5  The numbers 1.3 and 5734 are designed make the BMI reading unchanged for an adult of average height, which I take to be about 66.5 inches, i.e., 1.69 meters. (The square root of 1.69 is 1.3.)”  Here’s the explanation of the formula. It’s just that, an adjustment.",False,False

It's not scientifically validated, and when it comes to evaluation, it's even worse than traditional BMI. I think people use it to either convince themselves that they're thinner than they are, or that they're heavier than they are (depending on what they want BMI to say about themselves).",False,False

Since pretty much all practitioners and apps use the old formula, I stick with that. And if it makes you feel better, I'd recommend sticking with the old one too.",False,False
