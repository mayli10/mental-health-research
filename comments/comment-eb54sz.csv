I instantly regretted sharing any info about me or my habits, I felt I had no privacy or control anymore. Every discussion I had was about food and why I didn't want it. It's only just started to get better for me and I'm still really struggling with the feelings that come after I end a fast. But I eat now. And I'm not happy per se but I'm happiER. It gets so much easier when everything doesn't have to be a shameful secret. Sending love ‚ù§",False,False
