I’m in a similar position - when my boyfriend and I started dating I was like 60 kg - maybe 130 lbs? - and now I’m 50 / 110 roughly. He knows I’m self conscious about my body. I don’t know if I have a bias or not but I feel like he’s more attracted to me during sex, by what he says and does. He goes on about how hot I am.   I’m getting the same concerned comments from others as well, and he knows I’m in a bad place and has acknowledged it saying I need to eat more - just the other evening we slept together and he was very positive about my body and gave me lots of positive comments - I often tend to keep my clothes on during sex but didn’t that time as I had been drinking. He definitely got a good look at my body (with the alcohol in me I “allowed” it more than I would have).   Then, afterward, we both got changed to go out and I wore a fitted dress (something I haven’t really worn before) and he genuinely seemed shocked and concerned, like he was realising it for the first time - the first thing he said was that I looked “really skinny” and “barely there”. It was so jarring, and such a contrast from the way he’d been treating me just moments earlier.   I’m so confused, and with the brunt of his comments about my body seeming positive, and the lack of acknowledgement regarding my weight being low, I’m finding it a motivator to continue with my behaviour. But it’s difficult. I’d say my relationship has been in a similar position to yours (regarding the lack of concern expressed on his part and the rather reaffirming comments) for a while now. It’s very, very weird.",False,False
