I've convinced myself that I am minorly (sometimes majorly) allergic to them, when in reality the only thing I can't really stomach is ice cream. Also most processed 'health' or 'protein' foods.

I used to use it as my 'finisher' of a binge because then it would coat my throat as I purged.   So now every time I eat ice cream I panic quite a bit because I just want to eat all of it and stuff my face and then throw up. So I've swapped it for mochi which comes in pre-determined little balls and that helps me treat myself with something similar to ice cream.   I have a similar to your pancake experience, but it was Ramen. I almost choked on a noodle as I purged. The only ramen I can't eat is specifically the ramen that comes in those little bags for like 50 cents, which was the kind I almost choked while purging. ",False,False
