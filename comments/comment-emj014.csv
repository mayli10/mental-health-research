My Fitbit broke last year and I never replaced it (the original one was a gift and I couldnâ€™t afford a new one) and eventually my obsession subsided.   I donâ€™t have OCD but I think I displayed some obsessive/compulsive tendencies regarding my step count... it wasnâ€™t even just getting a certain number of steps, it was also that I had to get EXACTLY 15,000 (or whatever) and when I hit that I would go to bed and not move for the rest of the day.",False,False

Like back when I first started my weightloss ""journey"" I didnt want to eat dangerously low but slowly everything got more harsh and I wanted to be lower.  Now I'm afraid my steps will get in the way of some things.  Yesterday i wouldnt stop until i hit 15000 (which i dont know if it's a lot or a little depending on the person) but I had to study for my test the next day but I didnt care, I just had to.  Eventually I stopped there, and didnt walk purposefully after that.  Right now I'm pacing since I just came back from school, will probably do this for 30 minutes before I settle down and plan the rest of my day.  Ever since hitting anything above 10000, 8000 itself seems too little for me.",False,True

My friend slept for most of the day yesterday (think 4 pm to 12) and spent the rest of the night studying for a test we had in a few hours but also had more than a cup of rice for dinner at 2 am.

My boyfriend has been dieting after New Years but yesterday he was hungry and felt crappy. It was a big day of important meetings at his job - so what did he do?
