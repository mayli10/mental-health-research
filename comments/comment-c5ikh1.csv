(Episode 54) that talks about losing your period and imo was very helpful in understanding some of what’s going on there.

I'm 5'5"" and my LW was right around 120 and while I never fully lost my period, it did get noticeably lighter at my LW. What you're going through is valid, and your weight is likely at the very least playing a big role in it (even if it's not the sole cause).",False,False
