Next year I'm going to have a bachelor's degree. Having to be an Actual Adult terrifies me. I have no idea what I'm going to do once I graduate. I don't really feel ready for a Real Job.

Kinda a big issue, since if I'm not getting financial aid from school or living with one of my parents, I have no idea how I'll be affording rent üôÉ I kinda want to go to grad school just to delay entering the real world for a couple more years, but I doubt my grades will be good enough to get in. I'm emotionally unstable, bulimic, depressed, irresponsible with money because I just blow it all on food and alcohol, etc etc. I can't even manage absolute basic life functions like sleep or eating.
