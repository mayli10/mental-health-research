You can order a chridashi (sp?) which is normally assorted sashimi on top of sushi rice and have as much rice as you feel like eating without it being portioned out like in rolls.   If you feel like rolls there are tons of options, just stay away from deep fried options or anything with sauce. Everywhere will have avocado, cucumber and crab stick options as well as all sorts of fish. Negi toro is my favourite which is green onion and tuna belly.   Most Japanese restaurants will have edamame which is just steamed soy beans. Low calorie and high protein. Miso soups, spinach salads (usually in a sweet soy dressing but almost always very small portions).",False,False
