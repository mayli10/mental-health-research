And my version of a binge is loosing control and eating in general... In the last year I‚Äôve gotten more of a handle on my all day over eating and only truly binged to the point of extreme excess and pain bout three times... so today was more on the ‚Äúnormal‚Äù side of things but it was completely unplanned and my stomach is hating me for it now cause it happened right in the middle of a long fast...   I do think things will slowly get better. I might have swung to the opposite end of the spectrum this time around with fasting and restricting, but i feel more in control and have relaxed a few times on just intuitively knowing i was eating within a normal range... shrug",False,True

Fasted 4 days this past week, shoved absurd amounts of food down my throat, fasted 2 days, too much food again. I feel funky calling it a binge bc I am in control. I guess it's more reactive eating than anything??? Body is just Angery‚Ñ¢ at my not giving it things.   Restrict/binge cycles are a fuck. I hope things improve soon, at least in that regard ://",False,False

Gotta hide that shit. E s p e c i a l l y  when I buy binge food (or just ""unhealthy"" stuff in general). That goes in my desk and gets hidden til I shove it all in my face at once.
