I was alone for a good year before I found people who I really cherish now and who’ve made me feel like I belong. It’s one of the hardest things to go through mentally, but it was so rewarding.  I hope that whatever you do you find peace.",False,False

It’s a scary and difficult thing to do, but in time you’ll have been without those people long enough for the conflicted emotions to dissipate. That’s when you’ll understand how you really want to be treated by others and learn to not let those who want to disrespect you into your life.  Sometimes we are so desperate to feel loved and so afraid to be lonely that we let other use us as doormats. Ironically, we end up feeling even more unloved and isolated.",False,False
