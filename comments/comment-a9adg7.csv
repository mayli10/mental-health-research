Perhaps to them itâ€™s normal small talk, but I donâ€™t see why they feel itâ€™s an appropriate topic or what they feel it accomplishes. Next time I might set a boundary and ask them not to mention my weight again and to refrain from weight discussions around me if possible.   Hope your family quits that BS with you too and gives you some peace and respect.",False,False

I am not sure what she meant. But I know she has body visualization problems. She dealt with anorexia nervosa in the past. She almost died because of it...   She judges everyone on the body, rarely on any other attributes. Somehow, it hurts so bad because she is one of my favorite people in the world, I estimate her almost like a second mother.

I'm sorry they said that but they're so wrong. Even 54kg at that height isn't vaguely near chubby!!?  Maybe she meant like having a baby face in middle school? I'm almost same height as you and at school I definitely just had a chubby baby face which just slimmed out when I left school. It's nothing to do with actual body weight, just growing up!
