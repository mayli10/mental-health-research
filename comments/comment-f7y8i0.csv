Iâ€™d rather risk being murdered at 4am than interacting with  someone at 4pm!   OMG same. I HATE going to any grocery store during the day. Gotta be a MINIMUM of 1am before I will go to a grocery store. If my parents are needing something from the store during the day they gotta make it worth my time cause they know I hate it. Which they normally do by filling up my car with gas which is nice of them.,False,False

If you want to call them neighbors anyways cause they live about a mile from me. Gun sounds are not really terrifying as I know they are just shooting at practice targets but when it's dead silent at night and your walking around and all of a sudden you hear coyotes and gun sounds it gets a little scary lol.,False,False
