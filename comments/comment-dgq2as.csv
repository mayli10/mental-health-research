Something that helped me to resist was remembering that purging is probably the most dangerous Ed behavior-in the sense that you can end up in serious trouble a lot sooner than with other ED stuff  In addition to your teeth, throat stomach purging screws up your electrolytes like nothing else. This can cause really serious permanent damage even stuff like heart attacks (not trying to scare you or say this is going to happen the chance is really low -just for me reminding myself this fact is helpful in scaring me off it)   Its also the things that cause doctors/other people to be the most concerned so if you purge you are more likely to come back with a bad blood test, ecg blood pressure or display more noticeable symptoms which will cause more people to be more worried about you are try to get you into treatment (or higher levels of treatment), where as just restricting you can get away with it for so much longer/ doctors don’t really care.    Hope this doesn’t sound preachy-I’m just saying what I tell myself in order to resist that urge and hope that you could find a way as well",False,False
