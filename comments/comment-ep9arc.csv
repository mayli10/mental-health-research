Anything  flavoured or salty  I’ll suck on before I actually eat it.  When I eat veggie burgers I cut the edges off one side at a time so that what’s left is a square (and each edge piece is cut into 3-4 pieces). Then I cut the square in half diagonally to make two triangles, then cut each of those in half, and on and on until it’s not feasible to cut the pieces any smaller.  Certain foods I’ll only eat in certain numbers/groupings. Too complicated to explain that though.",False,False
