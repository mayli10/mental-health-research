What you dont need at this time is people pushing regimented eating plans on you, no matter how well intentioned.  Could you point your mum in the direction of info about eating disorder recovery online? I'm also in recovery and have found that a lot of people don't understand how harmful diet talk is to us. To them it's just a part of their life.  I've also put on a bit of weight and like you, I'm not delighted about it, but I know it's part of the process. Stay strong x",False,False

Like thanks mom, clearly my obsession with weightloss has benefited my health so much that I've agreed to voluntary institutionalization. I'm so glad you get it and really care about my recovery.  Last week, I was talking about insurance options with her and she said I should stick to my basic dental plan because there was no reason I should have any cavities or dental problems. I'm fucking bulimic of course I'm going to have dental problems ffs. She also said I can always just turn on the shower to drown out the noise if I'm self-conscious about throwing up when other people are at home. I honestly don't think she believes me about having any kind of disorder at all, despite the fact that she also sought ED treatment as a teenager. I love her but she is so effortlessly triggering every time we talk.",False,False

Show her how much you're rocking your awesome body and that you're able to eat whatever you want and be healthy and happy while her mind is too occupied with diets and weight to truly live her life.",False,False
