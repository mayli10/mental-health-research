For sure you can get there, if you can recover from an ED for 15 years you can do anything :). And you are already on your way there. Making changes is always hardest in the beginning and feels artificial but it becomes easier with time. Good luck!",False,False

I only go to therapy once a month (now more in relapse prevention mode). I think the hobby thing is a good idea... I've been trying to learn German as a hobby :0. I think I can get there, posting this I think was helpful and I really appreciate your reply.",False,True

Congrats on recovery! Do you go to therapy? Maybe it could help if you had one place where you could let it all abt your recovery so that you wouldn't need to do it all the time? Or if not therapy, maybe you could journal about it as much as you want and talk less? Otherwise I guess replacing the ED/recovery talk with other ""life things"". Do you have any hobbies? Do you have any new ones you would like to try? Read fiction books, listen to podcasts, try out new ways of exercise, volunteer, do art, start a blog, take some online classes on a subject your interested in, start knitting, do sudokus, whatever you fancy I guess :).",False,False

Your other friends might be tired of your talking about recovery too, and might very much appreciate ""hey, if I start to talk about recovery, please stop me and lets change the topic"". If your friends are like mine and my family, my ED was horrible for them too... I think what I'm gently suggesting here is they probably know how awful it was. And they also probably get it, because recovery has been a huge part of your life. But I think they'd support you in talking about it less if you asked. good luck!",False,False

Yeah I should do what you are suggesting... I partly posted this as a way for me to try to get my shit together on this a bit more.   I feel like I just want to make people understand how horrible it was before and how much better my life is. But maybe I need to just actually live and enjoy that life rather than dwelling on the past.,False,True

Aside from that it seems like it might work to tell friends ahead of time ""I'd like to spend our time together today talking about other stuff"" and if you find yourself shifting to recovery stuff, pause and change the topic. Will probably take practice!",False,False
