I do know that she had a very noticeable weight loss and has recently regained some weight but I wasn't aware that she had commented on it. I don't think she's made any comments about health issues though? (sorry just trying to make sure she matches all the statemenfs OP provided. Although she did mention in the interview that ""taking dieting too far can be dangerous"" and some stuff about healthier hair and such, so maybe that's what OP meant?)",False,False

She did mention calories once in a Vogue video but that's about it. So... probably not her,False,False
