And the amount of hate she gets is enourmous. But truly, you can't expect people to not be dissapointed, when she gives up on a diet instructed by a WEIGHT LOSS DOCTOR, just two weeks afterwards, because it ""doesn't have enough vegetables"" in it, and then a day after she shows she ate... nothing with vegetables in it. I think people are mainly frustrated because of her attitude and the lies she likes to spew, rather than her weight, but hey, assholes are everywhere so I'm sure there's quite some people who do hate her because of her weight.",False,False

You're not better than her because you dont weigh as much! The response to her crimes dont help anything and are inappropriate. Yeah shes done shitty things.  tbh I  think it still feeds her she probably feels like the hatred is all the attention she gets and that's better than none.

I‚Äôve posted about it before, it goes:  - Commitment to weight loss, usually a video of her having a meltdown, followed by an intense diet plan (sometimes involving Weight Watchers or Optavia, usually just calorie counting)  - Lots of cooking videos, videos with Becky, working out videos, bragging about weight loss  - A mukbang video, Amberlynn trying to defend her upping her calories/giving up on a specific diet, lots of excuses  - A torrid haul, completely avoids talking about dieting, no mention of weight loss  - Cue the weigh in video where she reveals she gave up on the diet and gained back more weight than she lost  aaaand repeat. Her videos are so predictable now, she uses the cycle and extremely clickbait-y titles to get views and she doesn‚Äôt actually seem to really care about her health at all.

It's the ""omg my thyroid"" and ""my meds"" and the insistence that she's getting professional help when it turns out she's just getting a random consultation from a diet food marketer or some shit.   Basically the issue is she has a wealth of support options and instead blames all her issues on happenstance and haters. And she's clearly aware that her following is fueled by haters so she leans into being defensive and cherry picking random positive notes.   Her attitude is vile and self righteous, and she's always the victim",False,False

Extremely rude and uncaring towards her partners, dismissive of everyone except for people who praise her, doesn‚Äôt put any effort into YouTube (which is her only job) and doesn‚Äôt care about her fans. She really is a train wreck.    There‚Äôs a story that always sticks with me about her: when she was dating destiny (one of her exes) destiny had a cat that was pretty old. She loved this cat. Amber wanted a new kitten but destiny told her they couldn‚Äôt take care of another cat. Mysteriously right after that amber let out the cat on purpose and basically let her disappear.

I‚Äôve watched people rip into her many times. I‚Äôve heard people say that just because she‚Äôs making money off YouTube she should be fine with harsh criticism?
