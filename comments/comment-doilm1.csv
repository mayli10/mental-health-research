I haven't fasted for longer than a day in a year or so so I can't quite remember) but I'd always gain it back fairly quickly, even if I was heavily restricting my caloric intake. Idk if anyone else is/was like that, I may have gained it all back so quickly and not really lost much because my chronic pain left me unable to do much exercise at the time",False,False
