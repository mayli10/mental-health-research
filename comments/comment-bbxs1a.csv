Maybe you can even make a deal with them, like if you reach x point in recovery then you can go back to your old unit, and you have to maintain a certain level of progress to stay there?   I’m seriously so sorry though. Recovery is so so difficult, even in the best of circumstances, and it’s awful that you were put into a worse situation.  I really wish you the best.",False,False
