People's perceptions of you aren't always right, even if they are medical professionals. The dangers posed by ED behaviors are still extremely dangerous even if you're not underweight. I didn't actually hit an underweight BMI until I was already in 24/7 care, so before that time people would be like ""Well you're a normal weight right?"" and it's so shitty, like, yea, I'm a normal weight, and I eat 25 calories a day, have lost 80 pounds in the last five months, and abuse laxatives, what do you WANT from me.",False,False
