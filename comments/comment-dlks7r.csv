However I don’t think that most of the people that criticize her do it out of malice. It’s more of a superiority thing. Like hey I’m a diet but I’m not fucking it up that bad- look at her. There is this whole community of like YouTube drama style reaction videos and commentary, it’s a whole thing. Pretty much it’s a YouTube reality show, people get invested in the characters, their little dramas, theories.   Like I said my partner is real into it.",False,False

I can see where the hate comes from though. She can come across as a bad person.  Bad people aren't immune to mental illness, so totally possible that she's shitty and she's sick.",False,False

You can't look away. Her mukbangs are good for killing my appetite during my fasts. She's repulsive inside and out. She's just a shitty human who is eating herself into an early grave and blames everyone, but herself for everything wrong in her life. Ignores every single piece of advice any doctor gives her to lose weight because she doesn't actually want to change. Then makes bullshit excuses as to why her latest diet failed. Claiming they wanted her to eat a bunch of sodium filled shit when SHE is the one choosing to buy frozen and processed garbage rather than real food. Let's be real, she has no problem eating a bunch of sodium packed bullshit. She does it all the time. It's only an ""issue"" when she's lying about what a doctor told her to do. She thinks eating a normal ass 1500-2000 calories is starving herself. Bitch acts like she only has a few lbs to lose. Making tiny ass ""goals"" for herself. 10lbs a month or whatever her ridiculous plan was. When she could lose that in literally a few days at her weight if she'd follow her damn doctor's advice. She is pushing 600 fucking lbs if she hasn't already passed that. She's clearly given up. She doesn't want to lose weight. Being morbidly obese and close to immobile brings in the views. God she just irritates the living shit out of me. I don't watch any of her videos through her channel. I refuse to give her the views. I watch through react channels and whatnot.",False,False
