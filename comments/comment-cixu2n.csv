Most of the reason was because the kitchen was constantly a mess. Quite a few times I cleaned every dish in the house and just two days later the sink would be full wish dishes stacked on the counters. I literally had to eat junk food constantly because I couldn't keep the kitchen in a usable state.,False,False

Not even to make it easier to restrict (although thatâ€™s always a bonus) but because itâ€™s embarrassing to me to have junk food in the house. I know I shouldnâ€™t judge for what other people eat when I literally have an eating disorder, but deep down I do. I even get embarrassed when I am the store and whoever Iâ€™m with asks me to hold their soda or something for them cause I donâ€™t want people to think Iâ€™m the one drinking it ðŸ™ƒ",False,False
