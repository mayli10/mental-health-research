So I experienced being a being without a body. And later without an ego. Later living outside the realms of time and space.   Without a body was very nice, totally would recommend it... But coming back to the body and being able to move it was the BOMB as well, loved it, really fun.  Without an ego? Well. It was at the same time comforting and desperation.  Without time? It was complete despair. Our consciousness are not build up for this kind of thing.",False,False
