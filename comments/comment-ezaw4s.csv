Bill W is not my pal but I've been to plenty of meetings. I work in addiction/recovery and dislike pushing any type of ""one size fits all"" approach to recovery, because that doesn't exist. An important component, no matter what, is making human connections and not isolating. Same with ED recovery",False,False

I tried AA for a while and the facility I was at was very AA heavy. Not my cup of tea. I'm really into Recovery Dharma though. For some reason AA always made me want to drink more. Seemed like way more sharing of old drinking stories than there needed to be.,False,True

If AA/NA meetings are at all helpful to you I'd recommend going. Eating disorders and alcoholism are both very isolating, so the social connections and accountability could be really helpful",False,False
