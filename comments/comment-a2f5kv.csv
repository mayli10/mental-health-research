At the club just being the skinniest girl in the room automatically gets me customers sometimes. And they tell me how they like my body and not big girls. It's like, guess I can't gain weight???

They are mental illnesses that can have physical consequences. I'm saying this because regardless of your physical health, your mental health is not doing well.   I also had a similar experience as a stripper. I had to take time off to get my mental health together. I waited too long so my physical health was also bad. It wasn't worth it.   If you take time to work on your health now before it gets worse, it'll probably take less time to get to a point where you could return to this line of work. I quit stripping about 3 years ago and I'm almost to the point where I don't think it would be detrimental to my health to return. ",False,False

I read on loseit the other day about someone in your situation reversed; she was a supereater on cam, and thought that she couldn't afford to put her health first because of the amount of money she was making. Fast forward a few months and she was having serious health consequences; diabetes, high blood pressure and facing an early death. She's in serious trouble and unable to do the cam work anymore because of it.   I know your situation is different, but if you destroy yourself there's going to be no one paying money to watch you do that. If you break an arm because you zone out and get knocked over are your followers going to care? Or watch another cam girl without a broken arm? Cam girl work is fickle, and no matter how thin you are it's not a business that's sustainable until retirement.   My advice to you is you have the ability now to make the money and use it to change your life. Find something your passionate about and make a career out of it. Having an ED is hard, but it sounds like you're being pressured into it, and I think having to watch your weight so carefully. Good luck to you! I hope you figure out something that works for you!",False,False
