You might want to strongly consider telling her, though. It would probably help her be more conscious around you in a good way and if you guys have a good relationship she’d be a great support! If not, maybe just try to redirect the conversation when she talks about those things, ie say you’re bored of diet talk and would rather talk about something more interesting or just change the subject. And comparison-wise, remember that people without eds can do things—like forgot to eat for the day—that we can’t without getting obsessive. Try not to compare so much though I know it’s hard xx",False,False

Does that make sense?",False,True
