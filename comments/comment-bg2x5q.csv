I havent even been on this sub in a minute but I got re-triggered today when I went to get my drivers license renewed and I saw the photo they took. I looked like fucking Shrek! Literally I do not understand. Because most of the time when I look in the mirror I don't look *spectacular* but it's nowhere near that bad. And then I see a pic like that -- really, almost any picture of myself -- and I get paranoid that that's what I ACTUALLY look like to other people and that my brain has trained my eyes over time to hone in on the 'good features' whenever I look in the mirror, or to unconsciously position my body in the best possible pose. I hate this shit!!!! I hate being back in this place of debating whether or not I should start restricting again. I'm not going to for real because I know it's not sustainable, but something's gotta change because I still feel and look like a blob to myself even though I work out every day and eat a healthy vegan diet.

[This](https://blog.photofeeler.com/why-do-i-look-different-in-pictures-what-do-i-look-like-to-others/) is a good factual article I like about it (although I do NOT promote whatever it is they're selling at the end). What you look like in the mirror is much closer to real life!!,False,False
