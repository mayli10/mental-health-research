I was gaming, and about to head to bed, and got massive cravings for Ben and Jerry's my wife has in the back freezer. I went in, but for some reason i started looking at the food labels, and noticed that the PB-cup was ONE THOUSAND FOUR FUCKING HUNDRED KILOCALORIES for a pint. I looked at the Caramel Sutra or w/e and it was less at about 1080. I was gonna still go for it, because, binging, but then I started this argument in my  head about ""well if you're gonna binge, go for the fucking PBCup. No no no i should have a mindful binge with 400 kcal less"" suddenly i was like what the fuck and just walked off with no binge.  i need more head arguments.",False,False
