I was a glutton as a child and usually ate to match my 6’2 father because he was the main caretaker back then while my mother worked. I was bullied for my weight in elementary/primary school and began to binge eat in my early teens, and was severely overweight. I’m just uw now but I feel like growing up hating my body was probably a big contributor to all of this. Now I’ve fallen headfirst in another restriction phase and can’t stop. I can’t get back there again. I can’t.",False,False

I was overweight, technically obese but was in denial. I remember seeing myself in a full body candid picture for the first time and I started sobbing.  That was in high school.

I always thought I was fat my whole life, my sister always called me fat and gross when we were younger. Looking back at pictures of myself from that time, I was only a little chubby. I wasn't anywhere close to being fat, maybe if I gained 10 or 20 pounds that would be a different story, but comfort eating is different than binge eating, and I've always been a comfort eater. I lost a whole bunch of weight after I tried to buy some new jeans. I kept having to ask my mom to get a larger pant size, it was so embarrassing to finally realize how chubby I had gotten.
