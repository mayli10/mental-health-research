I had a huge meltdown in front of my SO yesterday because I couldn‚Äôt purge after I went over my calories because I was at his family‚Äôs house. I felt so anxious and I started crying and hitting myself and he had to restrain me. We had a conversation about it today and I said ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know if anyone else with an ED has panic attacks like that I feel like I‚Äôm the only one.‚Äù Reading this made me feel a lot better, so know that both of you guys aren‚Äôt alone. I hope everything gets better for you soon. If it gives you any peace of mind you‚Äôre not alone in this. ‚ù§Ô∏è",False,False

I've only really had anorexic problems once, but it was because I was *so afraid* of throwing up again. (As in, purging.)   Those first two times I purged were so traumatic, I still get upset if I think about them too much. It was after that that being around food at all gave me so much anxiety that I stopped eating except enough to avoid notice (eventually I *was* noticed, and my friends got me back on track.)",False,False

At this point, I feel like I know I have to binge because I've gotten so used to it so now everytime I see food it pretty much reminds me that the next time I eat it's going to make me feel horrible about myself. I been c/sing for the last year and a half so the idea of actually swallowing food terrifies me, even if it's healthy. But when I do C/S its always thousands of calories worth of junk and I do end up feeling bloated despite not swallowing.

I was kind of living on cereal at that point, so this is slightly less weird than it sounds lol) were all ways my brain spelled out things and ways that I could eat WITHOUT being so anxious.

I don‚Äôt think anyone else really gets it, but my mom is probably the second closest to understanding.
