There were some periods in these two decades I was ""low on purge"" or even purge free for some time, and I'll outline what helped me below, but please keep in mind that I am not recovered nor attempting recovery.   u/legalshroomz already mentioned the similarity to cutting, and I think that's really a clever approach. Using ""skills"" for stopping an approaching binge in its tracks is definitely a feasible way.   Nutrition can't be left out of the picture, of course. Eating enough, including frequently enough, and getting adequate amounts of micro and macro nutrients will help to prevent binges, because once this feeling of being goddamn hungry has taken over, few bulimics will be able to stop at a normal meal.   Another important part of the puzzle, imho, is figuring out trigger situations and trigger feelings and find an alternative way of dealing with them. Keeping a diary is very helpful for that.  On a general note, I feel purging is stigmatized even in ED circles, and the picture of the ED-sufferer as underweight that the media have pushed since the 80s is so prevalent in everybody's heads (even in those of treatment providers - look what programs are offered, all focusing on eating enough and weight restoration... dude, not my problem!) we can't act on the knowledge the majority of people with EDs are NOT underweight and NOT anorexic.

I hope I can get to that at some point sooner than later. Also I hope things get less stressful for you, that all sounds rough. Thanks for all the advice. I've read brain over binge but will def check out the other two as well.  My therapist suggested it might be good for me to get on medication so I'm likely going to try that. I get purging urges often and they can last for hours so its really hard to sit through that all the time. I keep few and a low variety of food at my place which helps. I'm working on both figuring out what triggers me and how to work through that. I know it'll take time but I gotta keep working on everything and stay committed.",False,True

I had significant issues with purging, but was never underweight. I really didn‚Äôt find any podcasts or interviews that were at all helpful, because like you say, they were always dealing with women who needed to be refed.   I know it‚Äôs not much, but some things I found helpful were books like ‚ÄúBrain over Binge‚Äù by Kathryn Hansen, ‚ÄúLIfe Inside The Thin Cage‚Äù by Constance Rhoades, and ‚ÄúLying in Weight: The Hidden Epidemic of Eating Disorders in Adult Women‚Äù by Trisha Gura.   I was diagnosed with EDNOS in 2010, and I never felt like my ED was ‚Äúsevere‚Äù enough. I‚Äôm 3 years purge free now. Though I‚Äôve been bingeing a lot lately and I‚Äôm more overweight than I‚Äôve ever been, in my defence I‚Äôve been extremely stressed due to being stabbed in March last year and I only just moved into a new place before Christmas and now I have to move out in the short term so they can fumigate all of the cockroaches, repair the walls and paint them.   Honestly, if it wasn‚Äôt for my cats, I‚Äôd probably be dead. Initially, I actually found that a high dose of seroquel helped me eat but not care about purging, but now that the behaviour is in place, I do get urges to purge, but they go as quickly as they come. I‚Äôm working on taking better care of myself, and losing weight in a healthy way and getting back down to a normal weight. But I‚Äôm not super distressed about my weight. It will normalise in time.  You can stop purging, and keep your weight stable. Expect a little fluctuation, that‚Äôs to be expected. The best advice I can give you is avoid trigger foods short term, and I assume you‚Äôve got a counsellor of some sort - if so, working through the things that trigger you will really help.",False,False
