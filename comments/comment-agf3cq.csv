Normally i never show concern about food or weight or anything and i never make comments alluding to concern. But it's been really tearing me apart to see a number on the scale that doesn't match what i see in the mirror. I was kind of hoping he'd confirm and say yes, the scale is off by 10 lbs. But instead he said, no, i think you've lost weight. He said i ""barely ate over winter break"". Arguable, i did have a horrible cancre sore that made it hurt to eat, but i still ate enough, and by enough i mean typical enough. After the cancre sore got better i ate a bunch of christmas junk food, but that was pretty much it to be fair, by the time dinner came around i would feel too shitty to eat much, but i assume the junk food/chocolate/etc would've compensated in high calories, so i never saw christmas break as a net loss. But it's also true that i slept during the day most of christmas break, and it's been that way until a couple days ago. I never eat breakfast or lunch because i dont want to pay for it at school, and im too lazy to make it in the morning to bring. And my dad pointed out that i haven't been eating dinner/eating very much of it but i argued that i do eat before he gets home from work. Normally i just snack a bunch when i get home and then have a little dinner because by the time dinner is ready I've ruined my appetite. But he's still right. It's just, none of this has been on purpose. He also dropped me off at a friend's a couple days ago, and that when he was watching me walk to her door, he noticed my jeans were saggier in the butt and thought ""gosh, she's lost weight"". And he didn't mean that in a good way, he's always been disapproving whenever he's noticed any weight loss I've had, or when he's noticed i haven't been eating. The good thing is i know he only has my best interest. About half a year ago, i found out from my oldest sister that my mother used to have an eating disorder(my sisters struggle with emotional eating on the other hand). My mother died when i was 4, so it's not like my mother ever had an influence on me though. But according to my sister, he doted on her a lot.  Again, if it's true I've lost 10 lbs, it hasn't been on purpose, and that kind of bugs me that it was so effortless. But if i have lost 10 lbs, i guess im happy, but it's not lining up with what i see. 110 has always been the magical, sacred number for me, and right now it's like ""wtf?"". Nothing's changed. I thought my life would be better and i would be happier if only those 10 lbs didn't exist because i thought 110 would encompass so many things. But instead things are the way they are.  It's funny, i hadn't weighed myself for 2 months, and i remember before stepping on the scale trying to think logically, it's 99% ive maintained like i always have, 120 is where i naturally fall. I just had a fear supposing i'd gained so i had to think logically. I calmed myself down but right as i stepped i had the intrusive thought ""you've probably gained weight"" and it's like, wtf, I'm a logical person, why would i have such an intrusive and involuntary thought like this. And then i saw the number on the scale and i almost felt hurt and betrayed by it and i just turned around and started my shower. But it was the same after the shower so it wasnt a mistake. And this has been messing with my head more than anything. And i really hate. I can't believe it, and there's all these implications.  I always noticed my weight in my thighs, when i lose or gain a couple pounds. Im just in that sweet spot where i can tell based on how my thighs touch. Now, they barely touch at the top when i stand straight in the shower, but i guess i just told myself believing that was just a desperate attempt to make it feel as if i hadn't gained weight, since i was scared i did. Same thing when i thought my ribs had become more prominent in the mirror as well.  I've had some issues as well but i can always point to other reasons as well. But mostly i feel im reading too much into it because im not even underweight, so i shouldn't be suffering any negative effects  Idk, i guess that's it. For now i still doubt I'm 111 lbs. But the idea that i am has stirred a lot of feelings and thoughts i need to get out there.",False,False
