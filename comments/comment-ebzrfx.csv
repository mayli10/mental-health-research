I'd expect the school nurse to ask you what's going on. If you say ""nothing"" you'll get ""well your friend and teacher said ..."" and you should think about how you want to respond to that. I would also expect the nurse to ask if your parents know.",False,False

I'm still really doubting why I even asked for help and keep feeling like I need to justify asking for help ahhhhHHH",False,True

That might help us tell you what you can reasonably expect. You might think about what you want to say - since you tagged this as recovery support it sounds like you want some help?,False,False

I'll try :)",False,True

You don't have to share but its a lot easier to think about and process things on your own than when you're on the spot. I hope things go well and you get the support and any help you need!,False,False
