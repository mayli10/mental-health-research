I am not a doctor but at your height, 104 lb isnt going to threaten your life- you dont need ED behaviours to lose the weight. I suggest you look to normie weight loss subs and plant based diet subs. Personally, i prefer 1500ip to 1200 ip and just scale the meals. Dont recommend fasting bc youre almost at your goal.",False,False
