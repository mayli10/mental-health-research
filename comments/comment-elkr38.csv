So I've stopped seeing her in person. I avoid it. One of the last times I've seen her, she said 'how's your weight loss going'. Like bitch, WHAT?!? I'm overweight but she's very obese but she acts like we have the same issue. And she'll say 'fat people like us' wtffff?!?   Wow this has turned into me venting. Not really responding to your post.   Talking to her is obviously the best decision. Saying something like it's great that she's making healthy decisions but if she could please not talk about it much with you, that would be appreciated.   Or just avoid/change the subject each time. Sometimes I just won't say anything in response to my friend. That doesn't help a lot though, but might get you by for a bit? Idk :s",False,False

Not an easy conversation to have but since she's affecting your mental health that way I would still do it because having an ED is hard enough without the people around you acting shitty (as we all know).,False,False
