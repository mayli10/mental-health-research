So that puts me down.  I would buy a piano, but my house is too small to fit one in.  I just really want a job to meet new people and gain experience. I have applied for voluntary work.",False,True

I also feel so upset when I say I'm going to diet and restrict my food intake, it's like my coping mechanism of food has gone and it makes me cry because I don't know how else I'll cope. All these overwhelming feelings make me want to binge so badly, but I know it will make me feel bad after, but at that current moment, I really don't care!  I cry a lot because of my weight and eating patterns. I really want to stop but just can't.",False,True

What you're describing here definitely sounds like an eating disorder and I see myself in all of if actually.  I think it's great you're gonna get help, I think you could benefit from trying to be kinder to yourself, though I know it's easily said. You sound like you're dealing with a lot of anxious thoughts in conjunction with this eating disorder. Is there anything you could do that could calm you down? Like a peaceful hobby of some sorts ?",False,False

I also have a lot of issues with restricting. You're not alone, your struggles are real and valid. I know how awful it feels to be obsessed and addicted with food like that. Spending all your time, energy, and money looking for the next meal; crying because you can't stop eating, finding it hard to find comfort in something besides eating. You're so strong for fighting through your mental health problems every day. I'm proud of you, and hope your future will be brighter â™¡",False,False
