I believe sexy is how you dress/act rather than how you look and I've never cared to dress sexy. Beautiful? Absofuckinlutely. Sporty/athletic? Yep. Just never sexy.,False,False

I guess. It was awful. I felt like a thing to be ogled at, an object. So I tried to cover up and hide as much as I could. I still feel this way a bit at a normal weight but not nearly as much. I don't feel vulgar anymore... I also don't feel sexy, but I'm happy about that.",False,False

I struggled with realizing that I never once had a sexual attraction to anyone. I'm twenty-five now, and it becomes a deal breaker in every relationship. I have to take it one day at a time and not consider that this may be a sentence to be alone throughout my life.  So I realize your sentiment, I hope you find that feeling. I don't really know what it is.",False,False
