If so, the volume might be too loud. But whether you listen to music or not this is likely just a form of tinnitus (ringing in the ears). You’re probably getting it because of the increased blood flow in your body due to exercising. Ultimately it’s the increase of blood pressure (in your ears specifically) causing the sound. Nothing to worry about :) but if you’re wearing earbuds make sure they aren’t too loud.",False,False
