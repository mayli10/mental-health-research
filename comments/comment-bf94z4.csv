I think that, in turn, leads to the excessive spending and self-obsessive behavior. When I'm drunk I don't think about consequences, hence me spending excessive money I don't have on stupid shit. And the alcohol drowns out my ED voices so I become very self-obsessive and able to believe I'm hot shit when usually my ED just tells me I'm shit lol. I'm generally a narcissistic person, which sounds awful, but I'm self-aware enough to admit I'm selfish as fuck. No excuses for it, it's something I have to work on. So that's not really a restriction related-symptom for me.  I've never been diagnosed with Bipolar Disorder either and therefore, I don't want to presume to know what those who have it go through or self-diagnose myself. But, I've experienced a lot of manic-like symptoms. Like staying up all night and not sleeping, jumping headfirst into ideas and plans and spending a bunch of money only to abandon the idea a few days later, episodes of hypersexuality....stuff like that. So idk really.",False,False

And how I'll probably never get married, etc. I went to a friend's welcome home party. She has a longterm boyfriend who she moved continents to live with. And her sister is married and expecting her first baby. And another girl there my age is engaged. So they were talking about weddings and babies and domestic bliss. I kept thinking about how exciting that all seems. I want to find love and have kids, but I probably never will...lol so melodramatic, I know. But having an ED &amp; depression and then just being generally unlovable, ugly and moderately antisocial makes me feel like I'll never find someone. My ED, weight loss and bingeing are all that makes me happy. My life revolves around food. It's all I have to be proud of (the weight loss, not the binges. even tho I love bingeing rip). It's so pathetic, I'm so pathetic.   SO those thoughts teamed up with my already bad body image AND the fact that I forgot to take my antidepressant today. They all jumped me and kicked my ass. And then add a bit too much wine at the party. It led to me going to the liquor store and deciding to drink/eat my feelings tonight.   Then when I got home, my dad jokingly said that we need to get me a steak to ""get some meat back on my bones"". Just as I was walking back in the house with a bunch of beer and ready to order a pizza lmfao. I love self-sabotage. Whenever I actually start to look small (allegedly, since I still don't see it), I fuck it all up by bingeing. But I can't imagine not bingeing. Like, how do people deal with negative thoughts if they don't use alcohol and food for comfort and to drown them out?? Cuz a bitch would like to know!! Healthy coping mechanisms?  Don't know her.",False,False

I fucking hate that I'm in my 30s and this shit is still messing with my life. I know logically that I look fine to others, they don't see the rolls and lumps the same way I do, but I know they're there. The worst part is that so much of my body issues have been triggered by beating cancer. The meds I am on still have messed completely with how my body stores fat and just feels. And there's all the 'damage' the steroids and chemo did too. I've been exercising more and restricting to my safe limit (which is higher than I'd like but Drs are watching me) but nothing is changing. At all. It almost seems like each day I'm more bloated or just fatter. I need to feed myself to continue to heal and have my hair grow back so I don't just look like a fat middle aged man.
