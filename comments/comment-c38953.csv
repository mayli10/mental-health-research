I’m relapsing after some health issues but I was in recovery for years, so long that I didn’t think of myself as in recovery.   Life was life with all its ups and downs and even still it was pretty great. I had the time and energy to invest in fulfilling relationships, in school and work and building a career, in discovering new things about myself and about the world. I got more meaning and purpose out of life while I was in active recovery. It took some time, yeah, but it was so worth it and that’s motivating me to try and get help for this relapse rn because I KNOW it’s so much, much better on the recovery side.",False,False

I’m not judging anybody who’s using their instas for support and motivation to recover but... c’mon. Let’s just call it what it is. You’re still ruled by food, exercise and body image - just in a different direction. Don’t be coy.  At this point it seems like you only have two choices of recovery communities online - orthorexia lite, and fat positivity (not that that second one is a bad thing! I love it! But there are definitely accounts that use it to mask their transition from anorexia to BED). I don’t want to see your green detox smoothies with 45 supplements blended in. I don’t want to read your sappy poetry to your thicc thighs and soft belly. I just want one real, normal person who tells it straight and has an actual normal relationship with food and body image.  Sorry for the rant, I’m a hangry bitch",False,False

Using 'recovery' is often used as an excuse to eat banned foods. But if banned food consumption leads to rapid weight gain, it's going to backfire.   &amp;#x200B;  When I was at my lowest weight and had to gain weight to avoid being hospitalised, I turned into a health nut. I remember thinking, if I have to eat - I want to get as much out of this food as possible. Nutrition became so important to me. I'd read about vitamins, minerals and everything I needed for menstruation, hair re-growth, brain function (so I could study harder at college). I also thought to myself, I might get the benefits of eating FASTER if I'm eating nourishing things that my body really needs. Proper nourishment  just seems missing in all those people. It's possible for obese people to be malnourished because they live on junk.. there is so much more to eating than calories.   &amp;#x200B;   I felt more sure I was on the right track because I was eating for health, rather than this weird unhealthy junk food obsession those you tubers have. And to dedicate an Instagram account to it is just too fanatical imo.",False,False
