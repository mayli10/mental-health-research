Eating disorders are mental illnesses with a range of physical and psychological effects.  Those friends are toxic and ignorant.  Don’t let their comments invalidate your suffering.,False,False

You'll feel so fuckin bad you didn't care when I metioned. Gonna fuckin die from starvation.""- not so much of a fuck them attitude.  Trying to get rid of that kind of mentality but it's here. I'm sorry you feel that way and that they're that way about it.",False,False

I don't use word anorexia cause I'm not anorexic in terms of weight(yet). If you want some help and understanding from them then use words like ED and fucked up relationship with food, even better try to explain the thoughts and emotions that run through you cause that actually is your problem and it's easier for them to understand. My best friend would always answer to my problems with exercise and eating healthy untill I came to peace that its not that I want to be skinny, i actually deeply desire to be obviously sick-doesnt'matter it  it's the weight, drugs, alcohol and yet  I cant fight the urges to eat excessivly when I'm down. It all comes down to talking authentically how you feel with someone who wants to understand. When you wish to get skinnier so it's noticable to other people how bad you are inside it's dangerous if none of them acknowledge your issues without the weight loss. Are these your friends, close people that are with you, or just some old friends you don't see often?",False,False
