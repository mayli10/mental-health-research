I made homemade applesauce and compared the cals per serving to Mott's. Theirs: 113g, 100 cal. Mine: I ended up with 2 155g servings 98 cal. 42g more for less calories. Fuck yeah!   327g granny smith apples, 1/3c water, 1/2tsp lemon juice - bring to a boil then cook on medium for 15 minutes. Remove from heat and mash to desired consistency. Add 1/4tsp cinnamon (or apple pie spice, I didn't have any) and 2tsp swerve or sweetener of choice. (add more or less to your taste)   I weighed it when it was done (ended up with 310g) divided it up evenly into mason jars. This was an experiment so I only did a small batch. Can definitely scale up the recipe so you have it on hand whenever you want it.",False,False

It'd be really good on yogurt with some toasted oats and almonds too. I would keep my applesauce on the chunkier side. Just my personal preference.,False,False

Could make your own with granny smith apples, maybe swerve or what ever sweetener you prefer, some cinnamon or apple pie spice. Idk how many grams of apple is in a single cup of applesauce. But per 100g of granny smith is 52 cal.",False,False
