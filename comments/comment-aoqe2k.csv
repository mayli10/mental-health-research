And it's not like they can judge, right?   Given your age I bet most people would probably think you're a starving, busy student who hasn't had time to eat and is just really hungry! As long as you pay for it I doubt there's any negative judgement. ",False,False

They probably really did think you were just suuuper hungry. And it makes for a ""oh haha I saw someone eating in the supermarket right out of their cart today"" story.  And if I saw anyone doing that I'd just wish for the self-confidence to eat in public like that or at all (especially alone) ðŸ˜‚ ",False,False

They probably just think that you must be hungry?? Idk ,False,False
