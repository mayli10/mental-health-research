I just want to pop in and say hi. Your parents arenâ€™t meaning to interrogate you by asking you about your eating even if it feels that way. They love you and are expressing that love by noticing that something is up with you. Youâ€™re posting here and talking about fasting so they arenâ€™t exactly wrong to be worried even if they donâ€™t know exactly what theyâ€™re worried about.   I just had a baby girl in January and I would do ANYTHING for her. The idea that someday she will reach a point where she doesnâ€™t want my help to solve her problems is terrifying. I guarantee you that is what is motivating your parents to press this issue. Issues with food can feel very private so I totally understand why you felt interrogated. But fasting for 24 hours as a growing teen is objectively unhealthy, so you have to realize that your desire to conceal it is part of the problem.   Give your parents the chance to support you. Donâ€™t write them off without ever having asked for their help.   Best wishes!",False,False

I understand not being able to open up to your parents (mine are shitty as hell so I never tell them about anything) but if yours are more understanding I donâ€™t think it would hurt to maybe bring it up to them. And if you ever need anyone to vent to feel free to pm me ðŸ’™,False,False
