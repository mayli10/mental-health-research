I think it's easy to get stuck on cico, particularly with an ED because it makes everything so easy. A new pov changes the narrative, helps understand what's going on",False,True

Weight management obviously comes down to the balance of intake vs. expenditure (and CICO is always going to be something of a broad estimate, although it does work well enough for all intents and purposes), but sometimes I think we forget to give proper due to the forces that drive metabolism at a higher level... blood sugar and hormones (ghrelin, leptin, cortisol), glycemic *load* (not just glycemic index), all the variables that affect how well you digest food, your unique microbiome (which science has barely even started to touch), etc.   I can speak to the fact that absorption does have something to do with it. I have a GI disorder which is known for a couple of things, one of them being markedly different gut flora (as compared to healthy subjects in the research), and a tendency to become deficient in certain nutrients specifically because of where in the GI tract they are absorbed. Fat isn't well absorbed, either, and food moves through the system insanely fast. When I was really sick, I lost a shitload of weight and developed micronutrient deficiencies despite eating a more-than-adequate diet. I ""shouldn't"" have been losing weight, mathematically speaking, with the sheer amount of calories going in my mouth ‚Äî and I was essentially bedridden ‚Äî but my body literally could not absorb any nutrition.  So no, it's not complete bullshit. You can't reduce a human body to a set of equations.",False,False

If your body isn't healthy it won't be able to process foods properly. Your body is a complex system of chemical reactions, so malnutrition can throw off your body's proper functions and cause weird things to happen.",False,False

That‚Äôll happen if you‚Äôre eating virtually no protein or fat and living on sugar instead.  It doesn‚Äôt actually say anything about CICO, just satiety.",False,False

I find all the new science around nutrition really interesting and I believe it probably is a lot more complex than CICO. But also my basic understanding of physics is hard to dispute too, it must ultimately boil down to energy intake vs energy output? Perhaps it would be more accurate to say EIEO instead of cico üòè",False,False
