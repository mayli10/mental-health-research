I've isolated myself from literally everyone at this point, which, shockingly, is very lonely and horrible!  I have fun and feel great when hanging out with people, but then I just... never respond to texts or calls? Even from people I really like! I used to be so baffled as to why I did this, but now I think I do it as a kind of self punishment. I can have fun with others, but once i'm alone afterward its gamer time: gotta obsess about how ugly and fat I looked, everything I did or said wrong, etc etc until I reach the conclusion that i'm a total piece of shit that everyone hates, definitely don't deserve friends. So I stop responding. Then I feel even worse for ghosting everyone, repeat for the rest of my fucking life.   Also, my fave social activity was trying new restaurants, so, lol.",False,False

If i do go out i need like a few days notice to prep like making sure I can account for drinks or dinner and eating clean before so i dont look bloated. Its not a very good cycle because I get sad without social interaction which makes me dive into restricting worse,False,False
