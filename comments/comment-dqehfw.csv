Oftentimes people suspect but don't know how to approach it. Do you think they will be able to understand/support you or will it just be weird? For me, I got anorexia at 14, then ""recovered"" and I was always trying to hide my behaviours from my parents. After I relapsed at 22 I first tried to hide it from my parents but now I'm just totally honest abt it and it's just so much more chill not having to hide anything. Do what you think will make your overall stress load smaller :). Good luck!",False,False

I sent them an email. If I could do it again, I would have not told them...or else yah, sent an email. It gives them more chance to think and takes some of the emotional reaction out of it ...and protects you from their initial emotional reaction.   But I'd consider how you think they are likely to respond.   They um...responded oddly. Like ""we always knew you had a problem with food but"" and ""well now you see it's a problem, you can stop"". I'd asked them to help me find help. But it was like ""nope, just stop then?""   I'm bulimic though, and while I had lost a lot of weight too quickly a few times by then, I was never underweight.",False,False

When I told my dad I just mentioned it in passing not realizing I hadn't told him before that. I was in a good place then, so it wasn't a big deal.",False,False

If you think they'll be a positive support, it can't hurt anything. However whatever you decide has nothing to do with being a good or bad person. Don't place a judgement on yourself just cuz you're not comfortable openly talking about something like that.",False,False

I feel like I’m old enough that they don’t need to know but we’re still “friends” so it also feels shitty to hide it? Not sure how to be a good person in this situation  If I was a mother, I would want to know. But as a daughter it’s hard to tell.",False,True

I come from a pretty toxic family.. they knew I had issues when I lived at home and they didnt care, now that I'm on my own I don't involve them with my problems. If they're part of your support system then tell them but if you're asking on here, that kind of gives me an idea and personally I'd just keep it to myself.",False,False
