But since it isn’t...that’s why we have this. &amp; granted we don’t really know each other, it’s easy to connect on this deep of a level. I have 1 friend that I can openly talk to about this bc she deals with it too...but it doesn’t compare to this community at all.",False,True

I think it’s hard for them to understand since they haven’t experienced ED behaviors, but all of us know what a relief it is to come here after something makes you feel like shit and you need to feel like you’re not alone.
