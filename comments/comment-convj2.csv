Morning (8am) 3 eggs + butter (250 cal) Evening (8 pm) 1 avocado, 1/2 cup chicken curry, 1 cup broccoli (500 cal) I drink coffee with 1% milk through out the day, so add 100 to be safe   For the first time in a year I feel like I have some control and do not feel like binging at all. After my meals, I never feel moreish and no need for dessert.    I gave myself one cheat day and as soon as I had a brownie, my mind felt colourful like I was high or something idk it's hard to explain. At this point, I'm sure carbs and especially sugar triggers my binges.    The next day I easily slipped back into my routine no problems.  I'm glad I caught myself!",False,False

I think it's easier to count calories when you just regular restrict. (I high restrict.) but yeah, no real advice.. This stuff is difficult and I struggle with it too.",False,False

I don't fast, that is a major binge trigger for me. Nothing is more certain to cause a binge for me than a day of fasting. I still want to do it, but I can't let myself. Peanut butter triggers a binge too, and normal chocolate (not sugar free stuff) also fries.     My daily meal plan at the moment is just doing one meal a day, between 6-8pm. During the morning I forget about food, or ignore it. I'll have coffee or tea or an energy drink. I just keep busy. Then at night  I eat 500 calories which fills me up a lot and it satisfies my need to stuff myself to maximum. Mostly it's vegetables and some sort of vegan meat/tofu/tempeh/soup. I take about 13 different vitamins with my food. Then I get sleepy, and sleep.      If my routine changes, and I can't do any of this, it will trigger a binge. Like today, my internet wasn't working and I couldn't upload my pictures of my meals to the usual private imgur album I have (I always take photos of my one meal a day and upload them with the date). And that kinda upset the routine and I had a small binge. Not above TDEE, but still.      I'm not sure if this is the kinda stuff you meant in your question.",False,False
