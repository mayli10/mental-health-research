I was in my 80’s when they noticed. I don’t know whether they prefer my thinner body or not.,False,False

Sometimes partners are totally blind to it. But I can tell he’s much more attracted to me now because he can’t keep his hands off me. I’m on the low end of a healthy BMI so he isn’t concerned for now ,False,False
