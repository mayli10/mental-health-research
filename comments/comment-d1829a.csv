You actually look pretty skinny. I can promise you with 100% certainty that your weight isn't what caused the hammock to break, it was probably just a really shitty hammock that hadn't been secured properly.",False,False

Super skinny girl breaks a hammock, what are the chances.  I have seen some posts of yours where you show your body. You are not even remotely fat, you are actually too skinny. You just chose a shitty hammock to sit on. Not everything is a direct result of your body    Do this right now - Sit down, close your eyes, take a slow deep breath, hold it in for 5 seconds and then slowly exhale. Repeat this process five times.",False,False
