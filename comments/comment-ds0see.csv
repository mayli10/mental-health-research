I’m 5’8”- My BMI at the time was 16.5 and I looked sick as shit. He said to a co-worker “she felt awfully small when she hugged me”. Men are CLUELESS AF.,False,False

It’s like their clothes just morph to fit their body so they just assume if you’re not a child or on my 500lb life then you’re one standard size. It’s a mystery any of them have well fitting clothes",False,False

When I worked at a lingerie store and men would come in, I would constantly ask what size their partners were and would hear ""oh about the same as you"" even though I was a 25 BMI and plenty of these girls with thin or bigger than I am. It's just an ""oh all women who aren't morbidly obese or extremely underweight are the same.""",False,False
