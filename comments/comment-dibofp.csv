Have been accused of being a fake and an intruder on this sub for voicing to clearly when I thought unhealthy behaviors where to much applauded here.. Maybe I am a fake in the sense that after 20 years of ed I'm not that needy for outside motivation or needy to push anyone in to that hell.

This isn‚Äôt a recovery sub. I don‚Äôt see people saying they are proud to not be in recovery? Ed‚Äôs aren‚Äôt fun? Eating disorders are one of the hardest disorders to recover from especially if you don‚Äôt have access to proper help which a lot of the people on this sub don‚Äôt, hence why this is a good/safe place for them to come and vent. Many of us aren‚Äôt ready to recover. Which is why we don‚Äôt post in a recovery sub. Eating disorders usually cause people to isolate themselves from their friends and family. I find it comforting to have an anonymous group of people going through a similar situation who can talk about this stuff with no judgment.   Look I‚Äôm sorry it‚Äôs upsetting to see such a large group of people openly talk about something so serious in a very relaxed manner. It is weird. But everyone subscribed here is at a different stage in their ED.    (There is literally a sub for memes about eating disorders...)

Someone posted about their SO making a safe food meal for them, and you felt the need to inform them that they may have a codependent relationship and their attitude towards food isn't healthy.   We don't need that and we don't want it. We are all here, on eating disorder anonymous, because we understand that we have disordered behaviors. We know these behaviors are unhealthy and we're just looking for a neutral, judgement-free zone to talk about our day to day reality.   I cannot get over this post.

I think many people believe that because they are open in saying they have an ED, that they are immune from response.   And it floors me how many people here are proud to not be in recovery, and think it is the worst thing to even contemplate.

Ia m not being a dick.   2) Lets look at the post, shall we?  &gt;Anyone else noticing an uptick in non-disordered people commenting on our posts?  alright, so right there... there are assumptions being made. How do we know non-disordered people post? Are they saying they are non-disordered? Can we assume they are not because they don't think exactly like us? There is a lot of vague-ness in even the title. OP is not clairvoyant.   Moving on  &gt;I feel like I've been seeing more and more random people here and there coming in and lecturing us, or making assumptions, or just generally acting strange.  ""Random people"" how do we know they are random? are they lurkers? maybe they don't post too often? Again, lots of assumption there.   &gt; ""coming in and lecturing us""   another red flag. What does that mean? Show me examples? Who is lecturing who? Is someone speaking out about enabling behavior? is that lecturing? The term lecturing is loaded term and very subjective. But again, OP is defining it for us with no examples.   &gt; making assumptions, or just generally acting strange.  The OP makes several assumptions in their posts. So, what assumptions is the OP making, and ""acting strange?"" We are in a disorder subreddit. Everything is strange here. Why is OP getting to define something while staying so extremely vague that it fits anyone's internal idea of what ""acting strange"" looks like. Just because someone pushes back on something shouldn't be seen as ""strange."" Define strange.   There is absolutely NO clarification in their original post. all there is is assumption.   Now, lets go through the comments. The Second top comment was from someone who frets that while they don't have a disorder that they are not welcomed here. THEN THE OP states in their own words:   &gt;Oh no, I'm sorry if I sounded like I was gatekeeping.   And the point is... YES, they are gate keeping. OP is trying to determine who is allowed to post here. OP goes on.   &gt;  We've had some people commenting and lecturing and trolling and all that kind of stuff. Anyone is welcome, but the judgments and negativity from people like that is not good and taints our safe space. You're fine :) ‚ù§  Again, the nebulous ""Lecturing and trolling"" is used. and then ""Judgements and negativity"" is used without any frame of reference of what those mean.   To someone who is here and is starving and killing themselves, saying ""Please eat something."" can come across as judgmental and trolling *to that person*. For someone who is in such a head space that eating nothing for 5 days is seen as a positive, and if *anyone* says different is attacked.  ""anyone is welcome"" unless we challenge the Eating Disorder thoughts of the people who want their Eating disorder validated.   and yes, many people come here to validate their ED. To deny it is being part of the problem.   This cannot be a safe space if people were are enabling ED behavior, trading tactics to lose weight  or trying to find ways to keep their ED quiet to their loved ones. People who do not want recovery push others to validate their decision, and that is done here. All. the. time.   The OP referred to the Subreddit in one comment as ""Poking their head into a therapy session.""   THIS IS NOT A THERAPY SUB. Lets not even think of saying this is a therapy sub. it is not Therapy in any shape or form. Unless peopel who are doing the helping are qualified, then this is not therapy. And frankly when you talk to therapist about places like this, the first thing they do is say run away.   It is because this place is toxic, and pointing that out is not being judgmental or trolling, it is being direct. And warning people that many people here do NOT have their best interest, their health, or their lives in mind is absolutely necessary. Many posters here use this subreddit to condone their own ED.   And from what I can tell, OP doesn't want to hear it.",False,False

It was a long post but basically it was essentially that I get where you're coming from, and I know this sub isn't by any means private. And that's fair. My therapy analogy wasn't the best, it was just kind of the first thing I thought of to explain the intrusion some of us feel.   If people don't suffer from an ED but are curious or want to show support or figure out how better to help a loved one, that is wonderful. There was actually a parent on my post the other day who commented. That didn't make me feel exposed, it made me feel warm that a loved one would make that effort to understand the feelings of someone they love suffering an ED.  But when people come in and essentially troll us and try to diagnose us with other shit and tell us ""just eat normally"" or shit on our victories when we are trying to get better, it's just not a good deal. And some people are good at rolling their eyes and shrugging it off. But others do also struggle with more anxiety, even on the internet. So being in a supposed safe space, it isn't expected when we are judged and told off, and it can cause unease, you know? I know anyone can look in here. I don't care. But we have enough shit to deal with. We don't need the negatives from other people, in the one spot we can be brutally honest. You know?   (And I'm not talking negatives like, someone saying ""please be careful purging that often, I did it twice a day for two years and have a heart condition"" and shit like that. That's us looking out for each other. But many of the negative ones are straight up rude and judgmental and contain a lot of assumptions.)   So okay this one turned out long too, I'm sorry.

You are basically saying that people who do not agree with everything posted here are not welcomed here.   there are times when we have posts here that are dangerous, enabling, and glorifying EDs. We have posts where people talk about losing the will to eat and live and seeking validation for it. We have posts where people ask how to lose weight, and people tell them how.   We have posts were people hide behind humor in order to indulge ED behaviors. We have posts attacking men and putting the blame on EDS on them (or parents, or anyone else) and people dogpile on them, and yell at anyone who pushes back.   This should be a safe space to work through issues with ED, not a safe place to indulge in your ED. There is a massive difference, and I feel that this community is way too lax in allowing people to enable their EDs rather than trying to prevent very dangerous behavior.   And if I get attacked for trying to stop people hurting themselves, then that is not on me, but on the people who enable destructive behavior. This sub is full of them.   And yes, I am diagnoses Anorexia, so I am disordered and still saying all of this.   So, in short, don't silence me If am trying to stop people from real harm. It is not weird or strange, but vital if you want this sub to stay on reddit.",False,False

Your post definitely reminded me of times when I vascillated between restricting and binging (oh wait that's my whole life) and that book has helped me stop the binging periods.   A lot of people think it's about eating whatever you want, but it truly is about trying to eliminate all shame, guilt and feelings of ineptitude in order to eat nutritiously and just enough. It's all about try to get to that natural state of mind around eating, like the one most of us are born with but we lose along the way.
