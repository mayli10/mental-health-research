I would not break off the friendship, but try to recover. I'm in a similar situation because I'm on the board for an eating disorder awareness club at my school and if I lost a bunch of weight I'd feel like a hypocrite, plus there are recovered people in the group and I don't want to trigger them.",False,False

There’s never going to be a “perfect” time to recover, and this seems like a great situation to take advantage of—better to recover with the support of your best friend while you still can instead of letting your eating disorder ruin not only this friendship but ultimately every other relationship as well, leaving you to recover only after reaching rock bottom. It seems like you really care about him and you should care about yourself in the same way!!",False,False
