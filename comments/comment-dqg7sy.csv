I bet if that actress would have him eating out of the palm of her hand if he ever saw her in real life.   Please for the love of God, get rid of him and find someone in your area. Internet relationships aren’t healthy. You get way too emotionally intimate too fast because not having to look someone in the eye makes it so much easier to spill your guts to someone. So you end up forming very strong attachments before you even know the person. You don’t really know them, even if you think they’ve told you their life story. Now that he’s showing his colors, it’s so much harder to leave because you’ve invested so much emotionally. I’ve had internet friendships and relationships since I first got on the internet. I’ve made great connections with the friendships, but the relationship aspect was always always way messier than it needed to be and I never made good choices in that department.   I know it’s a lot easier to be in an internet relationship, the distance makes you both pine and there’s no worries of making them sick of you, they don’t have to look at the body that you hate, if you’re ever overwhelmed, you can just ignore texts and messages for a while, if something upsets you, you never have to mention it. But being in a relationship means being seen, in every sense of the world. If you two have been together in real life when he made that comment, you wouldn’t have been able to hide your discomfort, he would have had to confront the effect of his words and you both would have had to talk about it. How terrifying, right? Unfortunately that’s how relationships work, you upset each other and figure out how to make it right, or learn that you can’t and you’re actually not right for each other. “To be loved, you must endure the mortifying ordeal of being known.” You deserve to be seen and known. I promise there’s nothing about you that’s too ugly to share with someone else. We are all just social animals trying our best to find connection and meaning in this existence.",False,False

I get what it’s like to be in that situation, and I get it not being as easy as just being able to leave someone like that. Obviously I hope someday you realize you deserve better, and that the awful things he says are not a reflection on you or your self-worth, but on him. No one truly believes someone who weighs more or isn’t a solid 10 is less deserving of love than someone who is without holding themselves up to the same standards (whether or not he realizes it). You deserve the world, whether or not you see it now, and you are worthy, whether or not he can see it",False,False

Aside from hurting your body image, wouldn't want to date a guy who talks that negatively about other women's bodies... especially ostensibly thin ones.

My sister and I have the same BMI but she's skinny fat and I'm toned cuz I work out and eat a ton of protein whereas she just starves herself. I have a much smaller waist but she has thinner arms and legs. My fat is all on my ass and hips, hers on her stomach. We have completely different dress sizes and body shapes. She has the body of a 12 year old and I have the body of someone in her late 20s.",False,False
