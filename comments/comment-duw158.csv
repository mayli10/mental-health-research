I felt like everyone was staring at me judging me for breaking the bus. My face was flamin hot the entire ride. I was dying on the inside trying to convince everyone around me that it wasn’t me. It didn’t help that this guy standing right next to me was continuously glancing at me. I was half expecting him to snap and yell at me to get off the bus lol.  I’m sorry you felt that way. It really sucks. Our minds can be so irrational at times.,False,False
