I was talking to a girl at my school and she casually brought up wanting to try the IU diet (1 apple, 1 sweet potato, 1 protein shake per day) and I was really surprised, after a bit more conversation it seemed like already she kind of understood her mindset wasn't great though.  Idk if this is against the subreddit rules but I'm always curious to find super specific diets/detoxes/cleanse etc that require you to eat a very specific plan like the IU diet or master cleanse. I think it would be easier for me to stick to and wouldn't freak people out lol.",False,False

I go on juice cleanse a lot. But it's just the same idea too. Like if someone with an ED is using these type of things as an excuse how can it be healthy for real,False,True

I can accept a fun, sarcastic satire piece, but [people constantly and consistently demonstrate that if the option is given, they'll take it, even when it has health risks, whether out of ignorance or disbelief.](https://youtu.be/QiBpKuTrFrw) I'm aware that context is important when determining the significance of a decision, but it's frustrating that something can be accepted and promoted because normal people do it *even though* it's just as unhealthy as when eating disordered do it. It also reeks of science and medical denialism, where the answers offered through rigorous testing aren't good enough or don't act quickly enough, so some quack gets a taste of fame or success (notoriety?) they don't deserve. *Man I hate Dr. Oz.*",False,False

Uses blond coffee because it has more "" phenols "" but i think that's just something the doctor threw in because saying it has more caffeine and caffeine is a proven appetite suppressant in large doses doesn't sound as good.  &amp;#x200B;  God this sounds like a kidney train wreck.  holleee fukkk the chia part, that'll expand and sit in one's stomach and keep em feeling full.  yeah this aint a cleanse its a thinly masked Stimulant stack.",False,False

I've had friends who do a detox thing but can't wait to get back to normal eating.  &amp;#x200B;  It pisses me off because when you go through therapy for an ED every aspect of HOW you eat, WHEN you eat, WHAT you eat is scrutinised yet if some random does a coffee cleanse thing like this it's okay because there's always some BS health claims and a disclaimer about not doing it for longer than X days.  &amp;#x200B;  Yeah, it sounds disordered.  I mean, loads of us pretty much live on coffee for disordered reasons.  I haven't looked at any info on it but I'll check it out.  If I was a ""normal"" person I'd be all sensible and ask my GP about diets and stuff.  &amp;#x200B;  Good luck to them with the coffee belly cramps though.
