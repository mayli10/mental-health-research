I literally have this one tiny friend, never in my life have I seen her eat a vegetable that wasn‚Äôt iceberg lettuce d r e n c h e d in ranch. The rest of her diet consists of chicken nuggets, fries, burgers etc. so frustrating. Here I am trying to lose drinking shakes and eating Brussel sprouts and cucumbers ü•¥",False,False

Well, physically if not mentally for some people. As someone who's ""naturally"" underweight, I'm sure I piss off dieting people when I eat 1500 cals of junk per day and stay a size whatever. What they don't see is the malnourished childhood that got me here, and my habit of ruthless restriction whenever I got even a little bit close to healthy. It's wayyy easier to not-gain now than it is to lose later, so your tiny friends are probably just cashing in on that fact of life",False,False

As soon as Mum was out, I was in charge of everyone even if dad was home. Now I don‚Äôt mean in charge like I had real power lol but I would have to cook and sort my brothers out etc. My dad and older brother even scoff at basic things like a movie with a female lead? Anything to do with women is laughed at. I don‚Äôt get how they‚Äôre so toxic and anti woman. I don‚Äôt get how even a movie with a woman in it is annoying to them? I feel like I can‚Äôt enjoy anything around them or enjoy anything female related. It‚Äôs weird.   Yeah my brother calls people ‚Äúman woman‚Äù all the time. Man I hate it. And my dads attitude has rubbed off on my older brother and partly to my younger brother. My youngest brother is still cool though and even enjoys female led books and shows. I really hope he stays that way.   Sorry your dad is that way too! It sucks!",False,False

I had to clean up while my younger brother and him would watch tv. He would put down women's bodies on tv all the time especially smaller chested and I would be right next to him, small chested and offended. Like thanks for putting down my body type and alao singing the praises of blue eyes and blond Caucasian women while you chose to breed with an Asian woman. Dumbass.",False,False

They‚Äôve literally been skinny their whole lives while I‚Äôve literally been overweight and obese my entire life - like since I was a toddler. It‚Äôs messed up lmao.
