If so, I assume you have insurance that will cover IP. Insurance doesn’t fuck around. If they think you need IP then you really need IP.   Even if you’re not in the US, if you didn’t need inpatient, if you weren’t sick enough, the hospital would not have admitted you. You are sick enough.   It sucks. I know. I understand.  Using behaviors is part of this whole thing. They will not judge you or harm you or distrust you if you tell them. It doesn’t mean your stay will be extended. The length of your stay is not that easily determined.   You can do this. ",False,False
