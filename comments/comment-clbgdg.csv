Like, on one level I knew I was dysphoric, but when you can tell yourself you're freaking out about your hips existing because you think they make you look fat, you're gonna tell yourself that. Because no one WANTS to deal with gender dysphoria, especially not back when I was starting puberty and ""trans"" meant people laughing at Chaz Bono, not anything remotely positive or normal.   But of course, I also really did/do think my hips made me look fat. (They aren't even that big, just...dysmorphia.) So, where does ""feeling fat"" end and ""gender problems"" begin? I don't even know. I just know that to this day I want to take a sander to my hips and get them the fuck off me.   Ultimately, though, my clearest sign of dysphoria was/is having my heart sink whenever I'm referred to with female pronouns or sorted into the ""girl"" group or otherwise being blatantly treated as a woman. That, and my persistent wish for a dick, etc. I'm not saying you have to have those things to have gender dysphoria, but with stuff like feeling fat/having secondary sex characteristics, the body dysmorphia was always so in the way it was hard to say for sure what was going on.",False,False

Gender dysphoria is compounded by the expectations and criteria we feel we have to fit into, and body dysmorphia is compounded by the pressure society puts on us to look a certain way or be a certain size. That's not to say that dyphoria and dysmorphia are completely sociological and would disappear entirely in a vacuum, but they would be different, and for many people, easier to manage.  That said - I think the issue is that it *is* a very murky line between the two. I realise that part of the reason I never registered feeling dysphoria is because I was already so deeply unhappy with my body for what I considered to be ungendered reasons. It's hard to feel dysphoric about your body when you've hardly allowed yourself to even feel like you inhabit a body to begin with. It's funny actually because losing weight has basically revealed the underlying body shape I never knew I had, and so I'm getting more dysphoric as my body becomes more shaped. \[sad trombone\]   I think you will see lots of people who thought they hated their body for one reason, e.g. high weight, low muscle, ""bad"" structure, etc. and tried to ""fix"" it with an ED, who then eventually realise they're trans, and THAT'S why they felt like they hated their body. I remember reading a story in /progresspics from a very happy trans woman who talked about why she looked like such an ""alpha jock"" in her before photo - that she hated her body, and she thought the reason she hated it was because she wasn't living up to the male ideal, so she tried to reach it, only to find it didn't make her happy, either. Realising she was a woman, and transitioning, is what actually made her happy.  In answer to your question, I think the only way you can tell is by triggering gender *euphoria*. Try experimenting with your gender presentation or the way you speak/address/think about yourself, even if it's privately to yourself, or anonymously online, and see if it makes you happy. Play a video game where you can play as a different gender, etc. These little ""egg breakers"" might help you realise how you can be so, so much happier. Of course, it's still difficult to tell where the dysphoria stops and the dysmorphia begins, because we aren't always sure of the reasons why we feel negatively about our bodies - but the whole process is a series of self-discovery anwyay. All you can really do is trial and error.",False,False

Just wanted to share my take too.   My gender dysphoria and my ed dysphoria are sort of similar so my ed covered up my gender issues for a while. Like ""oh I hate my hips they're so big"" ""oh my boobs shrink when I dont eat neato"" shit like that, and my gender dysphoria revealed itself separately. It was a shock when, several years later, I realized that I hated my hourglass figure because I was a guy, and not eating was how i was trying to look more like a guy.   When I went to go start hormones, the hospital gave me a questionnaire. They were conducting a survey of trans people about eating disorders/disordered behaviors. Apparently many trans people use eating a lot or not eating at all to deal with their gender dysphoria and it just snowballs, or it may be situational and get better once they are able to transition.   Personally, my ed has not lessened at all with my transition, but it's definitely changing the more I pass as Male. I used to fall more under b/p behaviors and now I would say I've abandoned the binging altogether and slipped into more anorexic/orthorexic behaviors, although I don't think my ed has ever been able to be pinned down to one name.    **tl;dr**  This got really long, but they basically felt the same to me until I had the self awareness to know why I was feeling that way about parts of myself. And they were kinda the same. Just the gender dysphoria part goes away with medical transition. The ed part doesn't.",False,False
