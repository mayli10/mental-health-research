I'm so sorry you are dealing with this type of behavior from your partner. I hope you find a way to communicate that is positive for both of you and that brings you closer, if possible. I don't know the exact details, but even if someone said that as a joke to me, I would still spiral for a good week or more. Love to you.",False,False

I can‚Äôt imagine how you‚Äôre feeling, I‚Äôm so sorry that he did this to you. It‚Äôs just not okay. Commenting on someone‚Äôs appearance like that is never okay. And right before sex, too! That‚Äôs just disgusting. You‚Äôre in such a vulnerable position, being naked in front of him, about to give yourself to him, and he fucking insults you?!

I get where you're coming from, I believe you should take the time to process it by yourself first and then have a calm talk with your husband and explain why it made you upset and ask for him to refrain from such jokes, as it triggers a negative feeling on you. when someone loves and cares for your well being they will understand and apologize, and I'm positive it's just a matter of letting him know and remember your true feelings about it. hope it goes well.",False,False
