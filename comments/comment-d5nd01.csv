About 2 months ago I had a burger and fries delivered and the fries were mediocre. To prevent binging I poured dishwashing liquid on the fries and threw them out (I ended up binging anyway). So itâ€™s been at least two months and I still regret throwing out those fries because itâ€™s not like it made any difference since I binged anyway it may as well have been on fries a paid the $5 delivery fee for.,False,False

There are few things in life more melancholic and disappointing than fasting all day, avoiding all the good food you could have had only to binge on an entire box of granola bars at the end of the night or cereal that's *technically* good but not as good as the sandwich you could've had that would've been the same amount of calories and actually made the binge at least semi worth it.",False,False
