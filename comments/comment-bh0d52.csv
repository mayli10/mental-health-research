It mentions something ED-related in the first line, but that's it unfortunately, but it's still a good song in general for lots of people suffering   My fave ""omg pro-ana xD""/ED songs though would have to be: Skeleton Song, Deadly Beauty, Eyesore, Me and Mia, Cause and Effect, Lucy at the Gym, Waiting to be Weightless, and lolll Paper Bag (just like everyone else, but it's like the one ED song that really captures it all)  Couple other good mentions are: Antidote by Faith Marie, Decadence and Disorder, Invisible, The Doctor Said, Oh Ana, Emotional Anorexic, 90210, Please Eat and Ugly (both by Nicole something), and Self-Fulfilling Prophecy   Some others too, but I'm basically starting to type out everything from my Spotify playlist lol",False,False
