It's always overwhelming (in a good way) to be told I'm not going to just swell up and hate myself more.  I just have to fight the urge to eat junk!

It knows which foods trigger dopamine responses, which usually are junk foods and it knows which foods are connected to good memories. It’ll also just crave what you usually feed it out of habit. If your body craves chocolate, it doesn’t mean you have to give it chocolate, it just means it needs food and would like it with a side of dopamine. You can definitely eat something healthy and nutritious, and if you still want chocolate afterwards you can have a piece ! It’s about balance between treating and treatment lmao.    Don’t worry, I get it completely. Whenever eat more than an amount that will cause drastic unhealthy weight loss I feel like I’m gonna become morbidly obese by the time I hit the scale tomorrow. Eds are a hell of a drug lol",False,False

It craves junk.  Especially chocolate.  Like please body, can't you crave peanut butter or peanuts? Why dairy milk or pizza?

Except rn I’ve been weight restored (but relapsing hard). The feeling like “why are you so greedy body?” Is all too familiar lmao   I think your body is obviously hungry because it’s not getting enough food. I mean you obviously know this, seeing that you live in it and feel it 24/7, but sometimes it’s nice to have someone else tell you. Your body is hungry because it’s been starving for a long time and it needs to actively overeat for a long time to not be in a nutritional deficit. Hunger is many things and it doesn’t begin or end in your stomach:)",False,False

But one hour doing cardio at the gym - and I mean cardio, like sweating and gasping and trembling - still only takes my tiny 1142 up to about 1500.  Super depressing.  The only days I seem to burn are work days.  But they're 9 hours of stocking shelves and pulling cages.  I like those days - having 2500+ of calories to play with is so much more relieving.  You can actually eat a bit!  Whereas 1200?  Nothing.  That's not even two meals depending on where you're going out for dinner.",False,True

BMR is the energy required to maintain your weight if you were literally in a coma with no movement. TDEE assumes you are sitting upright with your eyes open and your brain functions intact for 16 hours out of 24.  Also - although TDEE algorithms can include your average activity level, they don’t always. So yes, 1200 is very very difficult for someone who is conscious and occasionally in motion and really needs more like 1700-1800 to maintain.",False,False

It’s what 45 grams of fat? (1.5 ounces if you’re American) that’s nada, it’ll even itself all out !  Calories really aren’t an accurate science anyway. It’s just whatever energy it takes to burn something, and our bodies don’t actually burn food. It’s just mean to give you a rough idea of how much food you need and how different foods have different nutrientional values. It’s not just simple “thermodynamics” as some people like to say, so don’t worry too much about going over such a tiny bit:)",False,False
