I'm sure you're not faking to be unhappy. This train of thought is what I, and many other ED sufferers have, it's ED logic :/. I think with recovery it should be possible to have a normal, happy life, I'm not there yet but that's what I've heard :D. It's your life and your life choises of course, but you're so young and it's much easier to turn around the train than try doing it 10 or 20 years down the line...

And for periods I feel like it‚Äôs always been weird so i can‚Äôt really tell I think it was missing for 40 days then it came back normally and then the most recent one it was super light but I don‚Äôt rlly like my period anyways so its not rlly a problem.

Firstly, are you already at a normal weight or not ? Also a diet tends to mean that you are getting enough calories but disordered eating usually involves going lower and lower, or just not eating enough. I also think it's to the extent it consumes you .  Like a diet is normal and people are not obsessed by it, they like to digress from it, they like to have a dessert and look forward to going on vacation so they can treat themselves. An ed fully consumes you, you are obsessed by it, you do not like to treat yourself, having a dessert would cause a panic and a vacation would stress you out. Also a diet does not put your life or health at risk, but an ed does. I don't know if you have an ed, obviously, but what I'm saying is that I'm not sure you want one because this shit lasts for years and fucks you up.",False,False
