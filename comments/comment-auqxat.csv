Raise the front of the shirt. Compare my stomach at different angle from both sucking in and normal.  Raise the entire shirt and turn around. Look at how flat my butt is. Look at my muffin top. Look at my waist. Look at the back of my thighs.  Drop the shirt and face the front again. Check out my legs at different angles. Hate that they're the best-looking part about me.  Squish my boobs down. Look at my chest and neck.  Move to the arms. Pinch the fat and look at from different angles.  Look at my upper back.  Look at everything overall.  Hate myself.
