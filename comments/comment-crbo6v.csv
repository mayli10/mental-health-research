On most mammals, the rib cage should be at least slightly visable. They're also bent over all day every day of their lives which make their spine and ribs much more prominent.    Crawl on all fours and youd look similar, minus the stomach and legs, but that's only because you havent been specifically bread to be aerodynamic, athletic, and therefore as thin as possible while still being healthy. It's the same reason birds have hollow bones and planes dont carry unnecessary items- the less weight and counter thrust the faster they can go while using less energy. Athletes are thin for the same reason, it jsnt starving its achieving peak physical performance.",False,False
