I find a lot of pleasure in going to the grocery store. It feels like I'm healthy and back on track. I buy for 30$ of veggies and maybe meat sometimes. but my meat mostly spoils and I only eat 1/4 of the veggies before I make a soup which also spoils lol..   I hate it because I grew up pretty poor and remember my fat ass always making sure the shit we bought was eaten. Now that I live alone.... yikes",False,False
