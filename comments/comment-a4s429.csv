Thanks for your kind words!",False,True

Running increases my appetite horribly which causes me so much unneeded stress. I hope you are able to navigate through this!! ,False,False

Yeah I figured as much with the calories, tbh as I get more into running I think I'll just have to see if I really want to prioritise bring able to run compared to losing weight faster.",False,True

Not to discourage you, but you 100% will not be able to do it if you aren’t eating enough (or at least increasing your calorie intake some). I thought I could in the beginning, but around week 4/5 the runs got really hard if you’re eating &lt;1000. It’s difficult to make fitness progress when restricting because your body really does need the fuel. Try to eat a little more than you usually would on days you run and stay safe!!! ",False,False
