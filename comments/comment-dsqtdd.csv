More science knowledge is a good thing!   That's not really true about the 3000 cals thing. A 6 foot man at 170 lbs or so who is *exactly* as active as I currently am would have a 3000+ cal TDEE while I only have a 1700 cal TDEE with that level of activity, due to our difference in mass. I wouldn't call myself ""constantly active"". It's actually very easy for a tall man to reach that TDEE, imo, as I have zero trouble managing my current level of activity even while going to school and working. So a 3000 cal TDEE is not ""very hypothetically speaking"" at all.   Your last question is interesting. I'm not actually sure what the answer is to that as I haven't done the research on average BMIs for tall vs short people.   My original point still stands. Ghrelin (hunger hormone) is regulated by food intake. An anorexic with a very low TDEE who is underweight will have much more ghrelin hormone than a person of the same height with a normal weight. Ghrelin is, of course, only half the equation. Leptin is the other half, and there is research that shows obese people have lower rates of leptin (satiety hormone) than people of normal weight. So the problem appears not to be that bigger people are hungrier, but that they are less capable of being satisfied. Small distinction, but I think it's important. The fact remains that a person of low body weight could in fact be producing way more ghrelin and therefore have a huge appetite in proportion to their small size, which is why I said that appetite doesn't scale linearly based on height/mass.",False,False

I used to trust calculators and when things like MFP told me I had to eat 1500 or under to even just maintain, I’d believe that. I’m only now figuring that you have to trust your body and sort of test our your own TDEE. Also, from a calorie intake perspective, now that I don’t binge after getting use to intuitive eating I think that helps too.

Path I took: started premed at a private 4 year. Realized I didnt want to be a doctor mid sophomore year. Couldnt apply for the 2 year of 4 year program at my university (still not 100% sure why but my guess is they were hoping I wouldn't transfer bc premed program makes school more money). Found out I COULD apply for the ABSN program (accelerated bachelors- 12 month rigorous program that destroys you as a person- DO NOT RECCOMEND), did my prerecs to get in, which I mostly had from premed, got in, 12 months of hell, graduated, NClEX, you know rest.
