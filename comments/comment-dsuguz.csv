Yeah online therapy also seems like a shitty thing. I was reading on the NHS website and it seems you can refer yourself to a therapist it may take a couple of weeks but once you're in you're in (here's the link https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/stress-anxiety-depression/free-therapy-or-counselling/ )    I hope things work out for you guys anyway and everything settles with your gf living situation,False,False

So, she saw her GP and mentioned her ED. He kind of brushed it off and recommended a free ED clinic type thing. She's had experience there before and they did not help. Also the reviews and other testimonials were pretty poor.  We're looking to pay for a therapist, but her living situation is going to be all over the place coming up, and it's not looking like we can really commit to a talk therapist. We're also very weary of online therapy.  I'll give a look through other posts on here though!",False,True

Sorry to hear you guys are going through this but you're girlfriend is amazing for looking for help and you are amazing for helping!!   Firstly she should see a gp, she can either talk about her ed or just go for a referral to a therapist. It's much easier to get a therapist once you've been referred  you're kind of in.  As for things you can do, just be there for her. Talk to her. Eating disorders are really difficult and I know you must be feeling helpless but once she gets into therapy theyll give her exercises and it will really help. You can look through here or there are tons of online resources for you just so you can understand the kind of things shes going through.   I hope your gf finds a good therapist, she will dont worry and I really hope you guys get through it",False,False

She also has a site with online resources) 2) overeaters anon (12 steps based group, helped me dramatically in times of desperation)",False,False
