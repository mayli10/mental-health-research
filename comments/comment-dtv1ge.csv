No one will rifle through a bathroom trash bag. You open one bag, dump the food in there, dump a full bathroom trash into the bag with food to bury it, then just tie it off take it to your trash can. That’s what I used to do.",False,False

Also people in my neighbourhood don’t leave their bins somewhere where I can throw away my food. The woods have the closest bins.,False,True
