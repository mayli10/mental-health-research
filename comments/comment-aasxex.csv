Almost as if it exists for reasons, lol.   By the time I'm wanting to lose again (assuming I don't relapse and I'm doing it when it's actually appropriate), I'll be at a higher weight and have been gaining for a while, so hopefully my body doesn't flip its shit. Hopefully.   ",False,True

I felt fine at 18 for so long, and then I had to go do this to myself... I felt so sick below it, too, and went back to 18 faster than planned :p   I think last time, after losing weight for a year, it took me about two months to feel ok again? It's only been one, I shouldn't despair.    Around 20 is where I think I'll probably want to stop bulk/cut cycles... maybe higher, depends on how my strength/mass ratio feels. ",False,True

Except I buy a bag and only eat the skins and throw the rest.   My head theory is that Chew/Spit misaligns your bodies measurement of the value of food for a while - after a few days of C/S I will be hungry no matter what I eat - so perhaps that is relevant for you.   In a way extreme hunger makes restricting easier because you know that food cant fix it.   ,False,False
