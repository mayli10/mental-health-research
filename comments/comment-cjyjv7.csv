It sounds like you're in a really unhappy headspace right now and I'm sorry for that.  EDs do just take and take, long after you think you have nothing left to give.  I don't think you're wrong to feel the way you feel.    You wanting to feel better tells me that you still have hope that you *can* feel better.  Don't let your ED take that, guard it with everything you have.  That feeling is something you can draw strength from when you can't draw it from anywhere else.  The way you feel today is not the way you will feel forever.  If you need to go through the motions of living to get through today, then go through the motions.  You've got to be here, existing, in order to feel better.",False,False
