Trouble is I am plagued by comments every day at work asking me how I did it or invasive questions about what I'm eating today etc and joke comments about not eating or being careful about Christmas ,False,True

But, either way, if I believed in a God, I'd be praying for you to get better",False,False

I think it may help you to just put blind faith in the people around you who you trust. You trust your gf and you know she wants you to be healthy, so listen to what she's saying. Even if your ED tells you she's lying, remember that her motivation in what she's saying is your health and happiness.",False,False

I don't know how I can't take it serious I just don't. It feels like they only care cause they know I'm not eating rather than being at risk? I haven't fainted or anything. ,False,True

Because I love seeing wlw represented here.  Anyways, it sounds like you are in denial, and you can tell. Everyone in your life is concerned about you. The hardest thing is to just accept that what they are saying is the truth even if you can't see it. If you are at the point where hospitilization is imminent, you are definitely sick. I think the most important thing to remember is that there is NO LOW WEIGHT required to recover. I think you should just vent to your gf. If she calls to see if you ate and you did but you feel guilty, tell her that. Hearing reassurance might help. My brain is kinda all over the place rn but I am trying here.   Even if it scares you, accept your friend's offer of training. Gaining muscle weight can help a body look skinny while still being Healthy.   I hope that you can come to the realization that your struggles are valid and that you do need to get help and recover. When things get hard, remember what your eating disorder is causing you to jeopardize. Remind yourself, ""if I lose weight, I could threaten my career. Do I want to stunt my career growth just to lose a couple pounds?"" Remeber that your eating disorder will LIE. It will tell you that your worth in society is based on your weight. It is NOT. Your worth is based on how you treat other people (imo). If you struggle with feeling as if you are not a ""good enough"" person, focus on being as kind as possible, or as loving as possible with your gf.  I hope you can find peace and get the help you need.",False,False
