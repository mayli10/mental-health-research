Split the eggs, dip in cold water again and you should be able to more easily remove the yolk. If there’s still some bits wipes with a napkin or just add a few cals to your count!  I eat just hard boiled egg whites, this is what I do.",False,False

You can bake them (i use cupcake liners to avoid oil) or boil them in heat resistant cling film.   Tbh to boil whole eggs so that the yolk just pops out you gotta overcook them a little. when I was eating boiled eggs in resi i also tended to wipe it out with a napkin.",False,False
