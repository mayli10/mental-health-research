It’s totally misused, and the intent behind it is exactly as you have said. However, anorexia is in fact a word for lost appetite, it can be a symptom, it can look like weight loss. Anorexia nervosa is the mental illness.  Still wrong though, please don’t get me wrong haha.",False,False

On Monday I was face timing with my best friend. She is being under a lot is stress and bad moments and has loss a lot of weight, and she was always thin to begin with. She said that, that she is so thin she looks anorexic. And it hit me. I am comfortable being brutally honest with her,so I decided to tell her not to say that, of course I explained being very nice.  I explained that anorexia is a mental illness and has nothing to do with weight, that people can be overweight and have anorexia, and because of this concept of thin anorexic they are not taken seriously and don't receive help. She apologized and told me that she would choose other words from now on.   Idk how open are each person, I have been trying for years to educate my surroundings to make people stop using mental illnesses as adjectives or insults, not everyone understands.",False,False
