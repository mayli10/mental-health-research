I've never been in such a situation. I just want you to know that we are here to support you and you are a strong person. You've successfully overcome a very powerful illness; eating disorders kill many people every year!  I am not a very subtle person when it comes to things triggering me, so I wouldn't know how to approach this issue, but I would definitely confront the person. Say that you feel hurt by her words, and see her reaction.   If you really feel like you can't handle the situation, there is no shame in mentioning that you want to move out. Living on your own might be a good solution, as you would have your own safe area. Moving in with people with actual healthy habits would be even better, especially if they have been through recovery themselves.   Good luck! ðŸ’•",False,False

The smallest youâ€™ll find in a standard store is XXS which is a size 6.  Both myself and my housemate are the same size in clothes so it caught me off guard and I felt it was a bit of a weird thing for her to say. Iâ€™m aware that my reaction to her comment is extreme, but thatâ€™s the nature of this stuff. Battling an eating disorder my entire adult life, any seemingly negative comment regarding size/weight/eating is always going to be really hard for me to rationalise and process objectively. I wish it were as easy as just not worrying about it, I really do.  I have thought about gently bringing her eating habits up but itâ€™s such a sensitive topic and I donâ€™t know whether it really is whatâ€™s best for her at the moment. Sheâ€™s still at a healthy weight, but if it gets any worse, I know Iâ€™ll have to talk to her. She tends to hide her habits behind the guise of just being a health nut (something I also used to do) but sheâ€™s recently offered me some insight into how she feels about her body and her relationship with food and itâ€™s nothing good.

Saying ""I used to be like you"" and simply asking her to be healthier won't make her change anything if she really does have a problem. At best, it's ignorant; at worst, it's insulting.

I would imagine that for any brand XS would be the smallest size available. ðŸ¤”   I wouldn't feel too bad about the thing with the shirt. It's not necessarily a bad thing if your roommate is smaller than you. But regarding her eating habits you could have a talk with her. Although if you're focused on anything besides her well-being it probably won't work. You could just say something like ""\*Hey, I've noticed that your eating habits are very unhealthy which I know because I also used to be like you! Please be healthier!\*""",False,False
