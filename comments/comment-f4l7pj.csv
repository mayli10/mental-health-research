But it does hurt. Like whenever I eat over my calorie limit I’ll take them. I know it’s really not smart and I should stop and I’ll try to but probably not completely at least if I do take less it’ll take longer to permanently harm me I hope.",False,True

That's the kind of thing that'll happen with stimulant laxatives like dulcolax and ex-lax, magnesium-based laxatives typically don't have that effect. Intestines coming out your asshole is caused by prolapsing, which is possible when you have constant severe diarrhea like when you have some intense laxative abuse. The only way to really fix that is surgery.  165 laxatives in two weeks isn't just considered a lot, it is a lot. Most people who abuse laxatives don't take that many laxatives.   I really want to recommend to you to stop using laxatives while you're ahead. It will hurt when you stop, and you can mitigate that pain and discomfort with a dose of miralax and a dose of colase per day. And, realistically, you're going to have to realize that your body will return to making bowel movements on its own, but you have to let that happen. I've been inpatient multiple times in the last year and both times were related to dehydration caused by laxative abuse. When you're abusing laxatives the way that I have and the way that you are, it's extremely difficult to replace those fluids and electrolytes, and being unable to replace those fluids and electrolytes can kill you. If you ever notice that your heart rate jumps up when you stand up, that you feel lightheaded, or you feel any degree of dry mouth/skin tightness or dryness, that's the dehydration and that's the sign of the damage that you're doing to your body.  Also, I know that personally the reason that I use laxatives is to help get rid of bloating, so I'm not sure if that's the reason that you're doing it or not, but if you're doing it to remove food from your body, remember that it's physically impossible for laxatives to block caloric absorption.   If you can't stop using laxatives in general, please just get off the stimulant laxatives. Those will cause serious damage to your body that, eventually, is totally irreversible and will require surgeries so that you can survive. Replacing them with Miralax would be ideal, but if it's not possible for you, magnesium based laxatives are a lot safer than stimulant laxatives.",False,False

And I saw the picture of it too. And another story someone on ed Instagram told me recently about someone that abused them for like 3 months and then their intestines literally would come out of their asshole when they would shit or even sneeze and like I don’t want that but idk. I was someone who literally a month ago I’d be like “I would never take lax why would I do that” and now I am and I’m not even buying it. I’ve been taking it like 15 days straight except last Wednesday the only day I didn’t take any(cause I was literally dying from taking 4 energy drinks but that’s a different story ig). I’m those days I’ve taken 165(if I counted right) so I guess that’s kinda a lot considering the recommended amount is max 2. When I take what is considered a lot it generally doesn’t feel horrible. Like it does but I feel like I’m forgetting how much it hurts every time it stops. So then I’m like ok it’s alright to take more next time cause it doesn’t seem to be killing me though logically I know some shit is gonna happen eventually. I feel like I’m almost getting addicted already but idk.,False,True

If you're like, lactose intolerant, you'll probably shit more than you'd normally shit with just Dulcolax, but it won't have any specific negative consequences.  Try taking a few days without laxatives. If you can't shit, that means that your body is becoming physically dependent on them. How long it takes people has a lot of range and can happen pretty quickly. As a risk reduction method, try to avoid stimulant laxatives, because stimulant laxatives will kill the nerves in your colon and eventually you'll have to have your colon removed, and your shit will go into a bag on the outside of your body.  A lot of people that I've been in the hospital with are prescribed Miralax and Colase, so that's a pretty safe combination that you could take daily if you do find that you can't shit without laxatives. Personally I was prescribed Miralax, Colase, and Senna, but senna is a little more dangerous than Miralax and Colase.",False,False
