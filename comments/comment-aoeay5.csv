But we dont talk about it. Honestly, anytime my bf offers advice I shut him down, its not his job to ""fix me"" its my job..and I tell him these things for support.. if he gives me advice I feel obligated to try and do what hes asking, which leads to guilt, which leads to feeling like more of a failure, which leads to it getting worse... so I just tell him that.   Its kinda hard but whatever you need is whats most important.. so if you need to bring it up more to a certain friend do it, if you dont wanna talk about it when your drunk tell them... tell people what you need to not get triggered..   but it also depends where you are with your disorder.. and this may be terrible advice for you and my post may make no sense ðŸ˜”",False,False
