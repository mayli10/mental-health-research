I don't want to get implants though because they would artificially increase my weight and I want to know that I'm at a healthy weight but like a minimum healthy weight.,False,False

Now that I’m obese I’m still an A cup but fill it out better. One of the main reasons I decided to “recover” was because my boobs had completely disappeared after restricting so much, and the guy I was hooking up with said I had “no boobs but a nice ass”. Now that I gained tons of weight I at least fill out an A cup but my bulging belly goes past my boobs so time to restrict and lose my boobs all over again!",False,False
