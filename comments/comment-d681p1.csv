To discuss the issues. In every post I have ever seen on here about not liking fat bodies, the op mentions how they know it's rude. But that's the point of the disorder...it's a disorder. They have a right to vent here just like you have a right to vent about their opinion.  But calling people out about this  is missing the point really. This place exists because we let each other talk about this shit. Just like this post.",False,False

I have an ED and am overweight. I'm sorry you're hurting. You are not disgusting. Please dont harm yourself!  I think in regard to people in the subreddit saying they are disgusted by fat people... I understand how an eating disorder can screw up your thinking, (or just being human, we all have judgmental thoughts at times) and being in a bad place mentally could lead to lashing out at others, or even just accidentally voicing a negative thought without thinking about how it might effect others around you.   I think we've all done that before, in some form or another. At least I have. It's not right, and I'm not trying to say it is. I'm just saying, it's not something to take personally. I know it's hard not to, because it seems like a personal judgement on your body type. But I think it comes from a place of hurt and a disordered mind, and maybe we can forgive them for messing up sometimes and saying something hurtful.",False,False

Please don't harm yourself over this; it's really not worth it.   But I mean...not everyone experiences EDs in the same way, and framing uglier symptoms (like people being repulsed by fatness, or using reverse thinspo) as sociopolitical expressions is unhelpful. I don't think people should be prevented from talking about the ugly side of their EDs (which they usually do with great shame, btw). And discussing the fact that their thoughts exist is not the same as them deliberately perpetuating fatphobia.   That said, it's true not everyone uses this sub appropriately; nor does everyone post about fatness with tact/self-awareness. If a post is seriously off the wall, you can report it for the mods to review. But in general, I'm not in favor of censorship. I AM in favor of people flairing posts with TWs if the content is sensitive.  I wish I could advise you on finding a safer space, but tbh, this is the best ED space I've personally encountered (other than recovery communities, which I have no use for), in terms of trying to welcome a diversity of body sizes. Most ED spaces can barely acknowledge the existence of BED and atypical anorexia and so on.   If you find the sub offensive or triggering, please don't harm yourself by participating here. I mean that 100% sincerely, not in a condescending way.",False,False

I see it too. I'm guilty of it in my own brain, I'm literally fatphobic, I am *scared of fat,* seeing that quality in others reminds me that I am dissatisfied with myself and there's a cognitive dissonance that I can't cope with, so I turn it into a weird prejudice. I'm just VERY careful to not voice it because it's totally irrational and it can hurt people the way I hurt myself with my thinking.  I think in general most of us wouldn't want someone else to hate themselves the way we do, but might fail to realize when projecting our own thoughts hurts other people.  I'm coming out of a pretty long recovery stint and I get uncomfortable with the way people talk sometimes. I can't see myself objectively, so I insert myself into everyone's negative talk, because it sounds like my own thoughts.
