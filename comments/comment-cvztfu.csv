Your baby will still be very dependent on the nutrients you consume while you breastfeed, and restricting while being a new mother will make it so much harder to function and take proper care of them (babies are a lot of work!) and you need to make sure you're not screwing over their immune system by providing nutrient-deficient milk.",False,False

As a new mom you will skip the wait list as it’s in the best interest of your baby that his mom has good mental health. I went through the exact same thing, I’d been in remission for a few years and hadn’t weighed. In retrospect I think I decided to restrict after the birth the moment I saw my weight at the booking in appointment at 12 weeks. I almost doubled my weight during pregnancy and that was very triggering. The rapid postpartum weight loss is also triggering as my ED saw that as a “kick start”. I relapsed pretty bad, I didn’t get help soon enough. I would urge you to ask for help now. Trust me ED becomes so much more of a problem once you’ve had kids. It doesn’t get easier, mine are teens now and at the age where I wish I were a better role model for them. I wish you the very best of luck 🙏🏽💚",False,False
