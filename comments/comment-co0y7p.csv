I didn't start cooking again until a few days ago, actually, so I was living off funeral food and takeout and veggie straws. I'd *finally* decide what I wanted to eat, take a bite and be immediately disappointed. It really sucks. I'm sorry for your loss, too &lt;3",False,False

Relapsed fucking *hard* after that. I didn't eat for like a week straight I think; I was way too fuckin sad. Even after I started eating again it wasn't much. Still struggling now and it's been months,False,False

Sounds like an emotion my brain doesn't have room for while my ED is in control.   My parents divorced and my thoughts the first evening were about how there would be less family meals to worm out of. Food obsessed robot here,False,False

My ED brain has basically just said “great, now you can restrict more without her noticing, and if you die, that’s one less person who will be affected!” I didn’t even realize how unperturbed I was by it until I went to my DBT group yesterday and talked about it...everyone was looking ready for me to cry and patting me on the back but it just felt so mater of fact to me",False,False
ewfap4u,t3_co0y7p,t3_co0y7p,annielovesbacon,1,2019-08-09 08:08:05,/r/EDAnonymous/comments/co0y7p/how_does_your_ed_interact_with_grief_or_vice_versa/ewfap4u/,I definitely use restriction as a coping mechanism in times like that. It makes me feel more in control and it gives me something to focus on aside from my feelings and what happened.,False,False

It's normal to feel disconnected and surreal, I think. Everyone handles grief differently. Stay close to the people who care about you unless you absolutely need personal space.  Things might hit you harder later. Felt like I was frozen in the dark up through January, up until a week or two ago. Everything's raw and real right now. Hurts a lot. But like thawing from frostbite. Hey, look, I can move my hands/emotions again. Neato burrito.  If you can cope in any other way whatsoever, it's worth doing. The more you cope with self-neglect or self-punishment, the colder and darker it gets.  Try to let people remind you that life doesn't have to be about the ending. And try to avoid mentally ruminating.",False,False

Honestly, i'm glad that my obsessive Ed behavior keeps me from crying all day. I used to have massive panic attacks but I find myself much more able to keep a hold of my emotions. People say that this behavior backfires very quickly because 'you were never able to process the emotions of that specific moment and you will regret that later' but I couldn't disagree more.  If a hunter-gatherer human would break immediately after seeing their family member get eaten by a bear, he wouldn't be able to get himself to safety. I deal with my extreme situations by acknowledgeing that breaking right now will not get me anywhere, whereas getting slowly accostumed to a new situation (someone's death, a breakup) by first making room for the facts and a later for the emotions , makes it a more consumable bite of sadness.   Give yourself time, this isn't exclusively weird for people with disorders. Young kids usually go through a grieving time likewise. Try to comfort people around you because you have that position right now (not being broken ) so you can avoid the feeling of being too passive during this event. It's okay not to feel sadness at the time of happening. You are protecting yourself",False,False
