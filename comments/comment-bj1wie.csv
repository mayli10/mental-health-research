Bad ITBS on my right knee took me out for months. I'm still kinda on the tail end of recovery but seem to have managed to keep fitness with the elliptical and cycling. Gets boring real quick though. Also picked up yoga and Pilates, which I can't recommend enough! And they're actually fun imo.",False,False
