And yes I was prolly hangry since I didn’t eat all day lol. When I’m alone I can focus on non food things so being around someone who is constantly talking about it was really setting me off!  And I totally relate on food being personal. I feel the most comfortable eating in my room alone as well. I’ll be hanging with my roommate watching a movie in my room then tell her okay well I’m gunna “go to bed” and she knows that means make food and watch parks and rec alone while eating lol.   I’m gunna really think about everything you said tonight now that everything has cooled off and I actually ate a decent meal with carbs!,False,True

It's really hard to talk about these anxieties with food because the less in control we feel, the worst the anxiety gets... Thus triggering, well, bad episodes. I think you just need to lay everything out in the open with her, tell her that you honestly do have issues with food and that hyper focusing on it gives you anxiety. I'd also tell her that you have it under control diet wise and that it'd just be a better time for you there if she didn't constantly talk about food. If that's what she's doing? Also, does it bother you that you feel like she is enabling being unhealthy or that she's talking about food period? You might be hangry and getting annoyed with the fact that she's focusing on food period. I hate being around people who eat normally because it makes me over think my own relationship with food and when/what I should eat? For me, food is a very personal thing that I like to indulge in privately in my room when no one's around- I noticed that everytime I'm around people and food is brought up, I pretty much get super annoyed. Even when I go to starbucks to get a coffee and I just see the fucking presentation of croissants and pastries looking all sexy and tempting. Than I realize, wow, this is messed up. Try and look at things rationally and maybe TRY confronting your mom from a non antagonizing place.",False,False

I totally feel you on constantly looking at people’s bodies...I’m just analyzing and comparing myself to them it’s maddening. And yes when I see skinny girls I’m always wondering if they have an ed or not and I never ever thought about that before!!! Or even people who have decent self control or eat a smaller than average meal and are skinny I’m weirdly thinking they might be struggling. It’s crazy how fucked up this shit is.   I’ll think about talking to her but I’m really bad about speaking up and confrontation.   But yes it’s like two people with food related issues in this tiny ass apartment constantly triggering each other lol. After dinner she asked if I wanted ice cream and I said no and she said “yeah I’m really full I don’t want any either”. It’s basically a battle rn. I think I’m gunna just suggest other non food related activities for the rest of the time I’m here. It’s weird to feel all this resentment but makes sense because normally when I visit it’s for less than a day so we’ll have a meal and that’s it. I think it’s getting more intense because it’s the first time in a while I’m staying for this long.    Fr thanks for responding I just really needed to vent because I felt like punching a wall or something.,False,True

She obviously contributed to your ED (probably unintentionally, she was just dealing with it herself) and is clearly still trying to be conscious- she's probably worried about you but also in admiration of your progress, maybe she wants to impress you?) I think you should tell her everything you feel, minus the fat shaming. Ever since I developed my mental ED, I can't stop looking at people's bodies. I don't even really compare it to my own, since I try really hard not to think about my body due to my BDD but I will notice that people I used to think were skinny will look... well, less skinny. Even if they themselves haven't changed, my brain has and my standard for what is ""admirably"" skinny has changed a lot too. I actually barely see girls in the real world who look ""skinny"" to me. Even thin ones look healthy and not ED'd out. I usually stare at girls who look legitimately skinny because a) I am admiring and envious and b) wondering if they are struggling mentally with food the way I am.   &amp;#x200B;  My point is that the way you are looking at your mom is probably less judgmental towards her than it is your ED brain being nitpicky and scared for yourself. You love your mom and vice versa but you're probably resentful of the fact that she instilled this mentality onto you and, on top of that, getting low key triggered by her way of dealing with her issues with fitness/food all while getting annoyed that she's like this and not skinny herself- thus making her seem like a hypocrite and messing with your mind in general.  &amp;#x200B;  Sorry for the long response, feel free to PM me about any of the psychological BS behind this.",False,False
