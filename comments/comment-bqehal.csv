I don‚Äôt have the emotional energy to post much anymore, but when I did, it was ALL a front. Things I did post: sexy lingerie photos, travel photos, pictures with hot coworkers (I have no actual friends).

My sad ass watches them on repeat. It‚Äôs kinda like a form of self harm I suppose. Also the videos with that guy Jay are a killer.

She said she hated working at her current job (one of those discount clothing stores like TJ maxx) and wanted to only work part time while she was in school.   Obviously I‚Äôve gotten to know her. She lived with her mom who supported her mostly. She had bad spending habits and had to borrow money from other employees a few times. She made THREE fake doctors notes to (one including major surgery) so that her teachers would give her wiggle room on her school assignments. While broke she took a vacation to FL, cheated on her boyfriend, and was almost stranded due to financial reasons. She got kicked out of her house a few weeks ago. It may sound like I don‚Äôt like her but she‚Äôs actually a very fun kind person for the most part, but she obviously has issues.   I‚Äôm not gonna go as far as dragging her with pictures from her Instagram on here but let me tell you...her Instagram paints such a fabulous lifestyle. Vacations to FL and CA. Skinny pics in front of white fur rugs. Her effortlessly looking gorgeous on a beach.   Social media tends to portray the (not always entirely true) highlights of peoples lives. YES, she did go those places but she had to borrow money to go. When she got back she couldn‚Äôt afford food. YES, she went to the beach...four months ago. That picture is fucking old. YES, she does own that cute top, but she bought it knowing she was going to return the next day because she actually can‚Äôt afford it. (Also apparently Rue 21 has almost no return policy lmaoooo).
