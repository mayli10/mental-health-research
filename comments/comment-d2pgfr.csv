I think that I must wear an average size and often end up with stuff way too big. And when I find a size that suits me, I feel that it's toi small anyway and won't buy it. As if I didn't ""deserve"" a smaller size tag ? Which is such bs, I should just grab what suits me but yeah.",False,False

I can’t believe anyone when they tell me I’m skinny or small or that they want to look like me. I had one of my beautiful friends with amazing curves (seriously, insta-model level curves. Flat stomach and ass and tits for days) tell me she wishes she was skinny like me and I’m like you are literally way hotter than I’ll ever be??? I’m not even skinny????",False,False
