(A close second would have to be drinking soy milk straight from the container and back-washing peanut butter and chocolate into it\[I have a retainer\], so i finished off the whole thing so my parents wouldn't know ahahhahah)",False,False

Sometimes going back the same night, sometimes the next morning. I often binge on a box of donuts, stop when I'm disgusted and couldn't eat anymore, then go back the next morning to dig out another one for breakfast. I try to layer the box under other trash to keep me from digging them out and to prevent my boyfriend from seeing them, but it never works.",False,False

If i take the bag out too often people would get suspicious and start questioning me so i have to wait at least a week to take it out. Sometimes i just straight up forget and one time it was sitting there for like 2-3 weeks because i kept forgetting.   Other gross things: Getting puke all over my hands from purging and eating food straight from the bin,False,False
