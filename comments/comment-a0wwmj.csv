Last night I made a veg stirfry with sausage for my OMAD. I‚Äôm a volume eater so it looked like a lot but it was less than 300 cals and my mum goes, ‚ÄúYou can finish all that?‚Äù üôÉüôÉ",False,False

Especially family. I had a family member who told me ‚Äúyou used to be so .. chunky when you were younger.‚Äù Like what the fuck? Why? Why would you make me constantly repeat that in my head? ,False,False

I was eating a single bowl of cereal (130 calories) with a half a cup of milk (40 calories) and my dad decided to pick up the cereal box and start listing out all the ingredients, commenting about how unhealthy it is.   I don't think he meant anything maliciously but I couldn't bear the though of finishing the bowl.   ",False,False

At one point last year, I hadn't eaten in 2 or 3 days and I had a big chemistry exam coming up, with a review session that night, and I knew I unfortunately needed some actual food. When my father picked me up from therapy and stopped somewhere on the way to school for coffee, he said he'd buy me food. The only thing that was immediately and noticablely vegetarian friendly (I suck at menus and it was one of those places with the menu on the wall, which I HATE) was the mac n cheese, so I begrudgingly ordered it. Of COURSE he had to comment like 3.2 seconds later that ""wow, that's a lot of carbs."" Like stfu greg I don't need your shit, I know what the fuck a carb is and I feel gross enough already for trying to eat this????",False,False

It‚Äôs extremely triggering and they have no idea that I DO know what I‚Äôm doing to my body when they on the other hand go WAY over their TDEE every single day ,False,False
