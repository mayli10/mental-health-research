I think even buying them individually at the grocery store would work out cheaper. Sometimes Amazon has a sale. (I got a 12 pack for $21) I’d suggest trying a bar before buying the pack though - I discovered I really don’t like ‘em.   I love protein bars (kinda live off them at times). There are more low-carb ones like Quest these days (often sweetened with sugar alcohols though). They run pricier than the types with more balanced macros. I like the ThinkThin, Balance, and Zone brands (partly cuz affordable) but there’s such a range these days. Vegan. Dairy free. Gluten free. It’s literally a whole aisle at my local grocery! So, peruse and pick out a few that match price/ingredients/macros you feel comfortable with, and see what you like :)",False,False

They're 200 cal. 20g protein. I got a value pack at Walmart and they were like $10 I believe? For 12 bars. They're really good too.,False,False
