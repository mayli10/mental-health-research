Take a small break. I literally couldn’t stop doing this cycle for 3 months and gained so much weight with so much fucking suffering because I kept binging at 10pm high af and not sleeping through the night. A 1200 1500 diet instead and I would be at gw rn. So. Doing 1200 for a week with nutritionally dense food, kind of omad helped me out of that cycle. When the urge to binge struck because I felt like I had fucked up my fasting diet I was able to forgive myself because I had internalised that 1200 is more acceptable than a full binge and I tried to relax self care whatever instead.

Stop being so crazy hard on yourself. That is what leads to being under/overweight. You're ready to fix this once and for all, I can feel the frustration through my monitor. The weight will sort itself out as a bi-product of focusing on health. A healthy mind, and a focus on nutrition will inevitably lead to you finding your natural set point. Every single serial restrictor goes through a binge phase in recovery. I think this is the biggest barrier to recovery; This feeling of a lack of control. Acknowledge these different dialogues in your brain - there's the actual real hunger voice talking to you, and there's this other voice that is the deprived, starved, fear of famine voice that screams at you, even when you've eaten and not physically hungry. In order to get this famine voice to STFU once and for all, you have to train it to know that you are OK, food is coming, and it doesn't need to be so scared and frightened. The worst thing you can do post-binge, is to restrict - because again, you're fuelling the famine voice. My assumption is that you're not spreading your meals out throughout the day (or have a routine in place of regular eating). If you're not eating enough at certain times (e.g. saving all your calories for the evening), then you are still fuelling the famine voice. This is why so many people reach a normal+ weight - because periods of deprivation still exist.  &amp;#x200B;  So my advice would be to do away with calories and diets for now, and focus your heart and soul into being that person you really want to be. Someone that eats normal meals, at normal times and regularly - not too indulgent and not too healthy. Give in a little too, don't go for 'safe' options all the time. Take your time doing all this. This non-dieting way will 100% lead to weight loss as a result of regular eating (body not making your mind rebel and binge, and absence of binge = absence of weight gain). Take this route, take this pace and eliminate this mental turmoil.  Don't do anything you've tried before (quick fixes lead to massive binges). What your poor soul and wellbeing needs right now is some kindness and some stability.",False,False

A big part of it for me is that drinking less water makes me feel more hungry and the less nutrient dense the food is, the less likely your body will be properly satiated, even if you've had more than enough calories.

I’ve gone through a similar experience myself. Though I was never underweight, about 8 years ago I got down to a BMI of about ~19 after heavily restricting. Fast forward to today, I weigh almost exactly twice of what I did then due to binge eating disorder. Actually, I just calculated my current BMI and get this.... it is exactly 38 too (guess I could’ve calculated 19x2 easily!)  As a couple other people brought up - I highly recommend Brain over Binge. I think I might have a different version than most - mine is titled “The Brain over Binge Recovery Guide” by Kathryn Hansen. Your comment  “My stupid head just told me to eat them and snap they’re gone” is exactly how I’d describe my binges. The book discusses the why of this, how urges to binge develop for 2 reasons - survival instincts (dieting) and habit (conditioning). It was obvious to me my binge eating developed after prolonged restriction, but once I began eating sufficient calories again, I couldn’t understand why I couldn’t stop binge eating every. single. day.   It’s easy to beat yourself up thinking it is a lack of willpower, but this book helped me look at my binge eating in a different light. It describes your binge urges as a function of a temporary brain-wiring problem/an expression of primal wanting which explains “why you have this inner dissonance” and discusses the “higher” and “lower” brain. It then goes on to discuss what is required for recovery, and one part was to stop dieting/restricting/fasting, which i know is really hard when all you want is desperately to lose weight, but you truly can’t overcome BED and diet in an attempt to lose weight at the same time.   Alrighty this comment is already way too long, but I definitely recommend giving the book a shot. BED is rough, and it took me maybe 7 years(?) to view it as an eating disorder and not me just being some wild pig with 0 self control. Hang in there &lt;3",False,False

Tumors (benign or malignant) on your pituitary gland, kidneys, liver, stomach etc can also cause an increase in appetite. *I don't want to alarm you!* it's probably nothing but you should get it looked at!  I also think that microbial imbalances in your gut can cause hunger, so you could think about probiotics and things like that, but that's like a super new area of research and there's SO MUCH nonsense and woo out there so be careful.   Another thing that caught my eye in your post is you don't know what your family might be saying about you. Have they really not said anything out loud? No one has approached you to talk about this drastic weight gain? You should talk to them, even if it's embarrassing, because you need support.

I cannot imagine the toil you've been through in the past 16 months. Don't let anyone (yourself included) tell you that your ED is no longer valid because you're not underweight/because you're obese.   Your emotional relationship with food is unhealthy and it needs help- that's what we are all dealing with here, it just manifests in different ways.   I truly hope you can get some help- what you have gone through in the past 16 months (plus before, I'm sure) has probably had a physical toll on your body. IDK where you live or what kind of healthcare system you have access to, but I really hope you can find a doctor, dietician, and/or a therapist to help.    Remember, EDs are complicated because they have both a mental and physical components. Your body has its hormones all out of whack- it's not just a mental game and this is NOT a reflection of your mental toughness and discipline.",False,False

I’ve seen quite a few males on here, along with BED sufferers. And, you don’t need to apologize for sharing your feelings; this is what this sub is for.  I feel for you strongly. I don’t have your exact eating disorder, but I have anorexia binge-purge subtype, so I know how awful it feels to binge and I know how awful having an eating disorder in general is. All I ever think of is food and suicide too. Saying this to tell you that you’re not alone in your feelings. Your feelings are valid and they’re not wrong. And, you deserve help for your problem.",False,False

You didn't ask for advice but I relate you as a recovered BED and I want to say a few things. I know that it sounds ridiculous to you now but fasting will only make you gain more weight. There is only one thing you need to focus now and this is your psychology. You need to find why you have an eating disorder, you need to see a therapist. If you don't get into the roots of the disorder it will be hard to recover. Please prioritize yourself. You are loved, no matter your weight.  As for eating, I recovered because I ditched all the diets. I ate whatever my body wanted, not my appetite. Sometimes your body wants to eat sugar, chocolate, french fries etc and its good. You need to learn how to eat intuitively. Because often our body wants to eat greens, fruits and healthy stuff. There is a TED Talk by a dietician called Eve Lahijani who teaches this, it helped me a lot.   Please take your time, please be kind to yourself.",False,False

I used to just live with the hunger and restrict hard but I've just lost the willpower to restrict. I have no idea how to eat anymore, and I have no idea how to lose all this weight, even with the fact ive already done it once (I went from average kid, to obese 15 year old, to skinny 18 year old and back up to obese 20 year old)",False,True
