I really really avoid confrontation but feel pretty strongly about this and am trying to level rationally with you here. I am friends with the girl whose post this is so I went to look.   I think you were combative in your responses. Your initial apology was a hostile non-apology. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry I misunderstood but...‚Äù [insert reasons why you shouldn‚Äôt be held accountable].  You went on to say it‚Äôs a support group, but you were not being supportive of this girl struggling with recovery and made it about yourself. These other people **were** being supportive of the OP. It‚Äôs her post. Did you see where she thanked the original girl because she was uncomfortable with your comment?   Something else - the fact that there are that many people trying to weigh in and support the OP and help you see where you‚Äôre not understanding is extremely telling. When so many people are voicing this, it might help to do a little introspection - maybe you are the problem in this specific conversation.   While I think others in the conversation were aggressive as well, you are not innocent here. The first girl was sympathetic to your ‚Äòapology‚Äô and made some great points. You were confrontational in your response and that is where others came in to further support. I respect your last comment, saying you misunderstood and are moving on. If that was your initial response, I think the whole exchange would have gone very differently.   I would be incredibly stressed and guilty if this was an exchange on my own post. Stop making it about you. Further, you are now posting OP‚Äôs info as well as many others‚Äô which just kinda feels uncool.",False,False

I was simply trying to be supportive and was doing the opposite and I‚Äôm not happy about that. I apologized. But why does my one mistake give everyone else  the right to say all these things to me? They‚Äôre not careful what they‚Äôre saying and it‚Äôs so hypocritical.,False,True
