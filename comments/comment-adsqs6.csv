She’s 3 years younger than me but about 5 inches taller and pretty thin, like maybe 110 pounds at most. She eats like shit and never exercises and never gains weight. Meanwhile, I probably haven’t eaten a “normal” amount of calories in years, I’m vegan and I exercise obsessively so I can stay barely underweight. She started talking about wanting to start exercising and I’m like nooooo because that’s like the one thing I have going for me that she doesn’t. ",False,False

It's almost never effortless. That illusion only works because you're not around the person all the time and only see a small insight to their lifestyle. Many nights I would exercise like crazy so no one would question it.  Or eat high volume, low calorie foods in front of people so they would assume I eat a lot. Let's be honest, unless it's something like a dry salad, people assume it's a normal meal. ",False,False

My cousin is the same height as me and has a natural tiny frame very much unlike my hulking shoulders and hips. We fast for religious reasons and this previous time, she mentioned that she was using protein powder and trying to up her calories for fear of losing weight. Meanwhile I'm desperately trying to lose weight but uncontrollably binge as soon as our fast ends for the day. Family members like to call us both skinny which is a laugh because she's clearly at least 20 lbs less than me, probably more. Just casually feel like a monster when I'm next to her. ",False,False

I mean that's probably not fair of me to assume, but I don't think I've ever run into a skinny person that didn't have some weird food thing going on. Whether they don't eat bread, or they're mysteriously full after clearing 1/4 of their plate.... Take your pick. But they're putting in some effort. ",False,False

My cousin for example is my height and a lot skinnier than me, recently she became a match as a bone marrow donor and had to gain so she would be allowed to. And she found it so difficult and kept losing again! During family meetings they’d always talk about it and her weight in numbers (trigger no 1 hello) and how she should eat another piece of cake and I just couldn’t take it and ran upstairs and fucking cried my eyes out.",False,False

I promise you the other 80 percent watch what they eat, might even be restricting, and probably have my fitness pal on their phone.

When I logged my cals I was heavily restricting and it was a high seeing your weight drop on the app.)",False,False
