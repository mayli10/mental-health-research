Then I could talk to her without feeling so angry. Well, that’s all undone in light of this medical issue.  I may want to schedule a follow up",False,True

I’m trying to frame it as taking care of myself, but it can be hard when my reaction is so visceral. I am so mad at her right now, but I want to see my nieces and nephew for thanksgiving.

You are not to blame for this at all. The fact that you’re still trying and aiming for recovery in light of what you survived as a child is extremely commendable and shows that you are strong as hell. I can’t imagine what that must have been like, and I can only guess what it feels like to have to consume the same kind of laxatives she would give you. But taking care of yourself by following the dr.’s instructions for the lax could be seen as you taking back your body!",False,False

I am trying to remind myself that this time around the medications are helping rather than punitive, and I’m choosing to do this to myself as a form of self care.
