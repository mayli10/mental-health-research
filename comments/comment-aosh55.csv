Ive switched to once a week now and it kinda helps? Enough to know im not full on binging but not enough to punish myself for every  food decision I make daily.,False,False

I’m on my period rn so I’m not losing much per day, like 0.4lbs a day,  it when I’m not bloated as hell I enjoy weighing every day because my downward trend rn is very steady and it’s just satisfying and motivating to wake up each morning and see where I am that day. I don’t have any problems with keeping my food routine in check, though, at least at the moment, so unfortunately I can’t speak on if weighing daily has helped with accountability.  When I first started restricting I weighed weekly, and I honestly think that’s better for mental health. I was happier doing that, whereas now I’m disappointed a lot, mainly when I’m on my period, if I don’t lose a big enough amount of weight day to day. There’s nothing I can do about my period, and I just have to remember that, but it’s still frustrating to see a number and be disappointed all day about it, you know? But I also like.. need instant gratification I guess, so I weigh daily anyway lol  For literally any reason, including accountability, I recommend weighing once a week. If you fluctuate during the week you won’t even know it or be disappointed, because by the end of the week you’ll still have lost weight. For my particular situation the disappointment comes because I only lose so little weight day to day. Week to week is decent, but day to day isn’t very satisfying. For you, if you stay on your routine, week to week should show you progress galore! I think it’s just better overall for you mentally to weigh weekly.",False,False
