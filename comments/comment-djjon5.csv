Being a mom to me is the thing I want the most in life and while I haven’t lost my period yet, they’ve become incredibly short and light and have all but disappeared. I’m scared too, and I’m sort of about to enter recovery and I’m terrified of the weight gain as well.  If it helps, I’m trying to think of it like this, and maybe you can too: At the end of t he day, which do you want more- to be skinny (I use that word liberally, since our idea of skinny is much more drastic than the average persons), or to one day hold your own child in your arms? For me wanting children of my own is the only thing I want more than to be skinny, and I’m dealing with the weight gain and recovery so that I may one day have that. I think about what my children will look like, what their names will be, etc, as a coping mechanism when it gets too hard.  Idk if it’s healthy or not to do this, but it’s comforting, and for me, effective. Hope this helps💗",False,False
