Although I've never had it in that particular spot. It didn't make me feel short of breath or anything and I definitely don't think it had anything to do with my heart.,False,True

I don't necessarily think it's something serious just more of an annoyance. It's right in my lower ribcage area and feels how I imagine a baby kicking would feel like. If I'd ever been Prego.,False,True

(like not enough potassium, sodium, calcium, or magnesium?) supplements might help if you're not taking them already dfgkljdfgh",False,False

It's been going on for years, it's sporadic, not necessarily triggered by anything and goes away after a minute or two. It's very surface level, not deep, so it doesn't worry me, except when it first happened, I thought i was actually about to die. If it is worrying you, I'd get it checked out. Actually, I'd get it checked anyway, just to be safe.",False,False
