Try a medium roast with cinnamon and turmeric, or go for a nice quality breakfast blend! Breakfast blends are light. My favorite light roast is Cafe du Monde.   If you live near a coffee shop, ask for a light roast to taste test and if you like it, buy a bag! Whole beans that you grind immediately before brewing are peak flavor, but nice quality grounds are OUT THERE",False,False

I usually have a cup in the morning and at lunch, but still can sleep around 10. Decaf might help you. Also, get brands you like. Good black coffee has some floral tastes.
