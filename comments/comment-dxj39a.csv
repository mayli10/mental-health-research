It’s unfair. I get that sometimes our disorder makes us make stupid decisions and not think things through, but this one is important for everyone.",False,False

What can help is having lollipops or other hard candies in your car and just have one if you feel sick. It’s not that many calories so the effect won’t last that long but it will help in the short term. You might need more than one, though.",False,False

Fortunately there’s a Walgreens next door so I can get a little something and chill a minute before driving home. I’m gonna start keeping a few snacks in the car just in case... (which I should really already do anyhow as part of my winter emergency kit),False,False

I had a 10 day fast and at the end I got very confused while I was driving and had to switch with someone. It was terrifying and the guilt of how my actions could have harmed someone else was overwhelming.",False,False

Electrolytes do often help me. But if I’m still feeling foggy and/or dizzy my personal call is either don’t drive or eat a small amount and reassess before driving. I’m fine with self-destruction till kingdom come, but the possibility of hurting someone else while driving in what is functionally an impaired state just isn’t a risk I’m ok with. (But my life circumstances rn also make it easier for me to avoid driving than the average person.)",False,False
