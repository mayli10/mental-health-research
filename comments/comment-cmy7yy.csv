Some people gain weight because their depression caused them to lose their appetite (without having an eating disorder). The medication starts working and can motivate someone to start eating again which is why they list weight gain as a slight possibility on SSRI's. I honestly recommend asking your doctor or pharmacist because they can try to find medications that are weight neutral and provide more details about listed side effects.,False,False
