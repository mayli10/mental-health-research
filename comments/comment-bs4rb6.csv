It's been 90F+/33Â°C+ weather where I live for over 3 months now and I could be restricting for days and sleep deprived af and I'm not even cold when the AC wind (60F/16Â°C) hits me constantly ðŸ˜­ ðŸ˜­ ðŸ˜­  Plus walking even a little (and I have to walk a lot) and being anxious make me hot af too.
