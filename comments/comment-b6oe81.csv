I put on weight and I hadn’t been doing my nails or getting my hair cut and colored. I was devastated and humiliated, but couldn’t get mad at my husband because I knew it wasn’t something he could control. I 100% thought my weight was the problem, but I colored my hair and hadn’t lost a single pound and he was ready to go again (and he’s much older than your boyfriend). Find something that makes you feel pretty. Get a cute new piece of lingerie or paint your toenails or something. Just take a minute in your crazy schedule to pamper yourself. It’s good for you and might help the situation.",False,False

This problem is not with you! Your BF might be going through something totally unrelated to you right now. Ive been a very similar situation and the issue was not with me but with him. ,False,False

As a dude, I have never failed to get it up because I suddenly found someone I was having sex with unattractive. This usually happens because of personal stress or fears about performance ironically enough. Don't let your ED tell you otherwise.   &amp;#x200B;",False,False

Sometimes they get rockhard in public for no reason, sometimes they won’t get hard because his mum mentioned Easter recently..   Something so random shouldn’t be determining your self worth. I know you’re brain is in complete crisis mode right now, and it’s not easy with the disorder, but try to breathe and apply your logic.   A man isn’t going to notice a weight flux like a woman, and a man definitely isn’t going to notice weight flux like an eating disordered woman. I would take him at his word.   You sound stressed, and maybe he is picking up on that. I’d personally find it harder to get aroused if I noticed my s/o was tense.   Try to focus on yourself and managing your disorder, don’t let your ED dictate your love life. I’m sure he’s with you because you have several endearing traits.. not because of 10 lbs.   This feeling will pass and it will be okay. ",False,False

Guys already have fucked hormones/sexual responses at that age, which often leads to situations like yours through nothing other than biology, and that combined with the insane pressure he’s under, both from wanting to please you and from wanting to live, makes it a perfect storm for this sort of thing.
