I've gotten it in zero waste stores before but (unsure of where you like) but the UK isn't amazing for bulk sections + my town's health food store wrapped everything but it's still where I buy it from   I can order online from a zero-waste store (as the one I usually go to is 3 hours away by train!) but I usually wait until I need lots of other things so it's worthwhile for the women who runs it to make the deliveries. It's kinda a small business atm   I'm moving at the end of a month so the nearest zero waste store will only be half an hour by train and significantly less experience which will be great!,False,True

I'm like 80% sure my tiny local health food store has bulk popping corn",False,False

Even at the farmers market they have plastic containers which I hate so much   I try to avoid all non-recyclable materials, which is definitely in part helped aid my ED (a lot of fruits and veg is great) but I also want to be able to eat cereal and rice cakes sometimes without having a panic attack over the plastic ugh. It can really suck a lot I'm glad I'm not the only one",False,True

My ED has kinda expanded to my obsession with being low-waste, like I can't allow myself foods that come in packaging. I guess it's good, bc it cuts me off from stuff like diet soda and stuff like that, but it also sometimes sucks not being able to eat the strawberries my mom buys just because they're in a plastic box.",False,False

I spend an hour in the shops &amp; just buy the foods I need without feeling judged or worried.   Today it just all got on top of me I think, I love being healthy and conscious about the products I get usually but when all I was is one specific food and nothing else, it just upset my I felt too guilty to buy it",False,True
