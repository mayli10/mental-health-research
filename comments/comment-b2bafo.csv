My anxiety has been through the roof lately so I'm really not handling it well. Anemia would make sense. Had bloodwork done about 6 months ago and all levels were normal, but my doctor did mention my b12 was on the lower side of normal. I've been supplimenting but I'm not very consistent with it.

Some kinds can cause itchy red spots and some can cause the spots without itchiness. And anemia isn’t uncommon if you’ve been restricting! Medical stuff is always scary but hopefully it’s something minor you can take care of easily. Good luck! I’ll be thinking of you ,False,False
