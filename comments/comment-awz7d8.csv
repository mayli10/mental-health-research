People don't get alarmed unless you look like Eugenia Cooney because being and trying to be thin is just normal for girls and simple restriction is so normal it's not even a diet.   I've seen many of my former classmates who were ""always dieting"" just lose interest after getting married and having babies and just accept being 50kg or heavier. And looking back, what they were doing wasn't just simple diet...   They don't even talk about it because it was normal though. And I feel that people who do are trying to be special.   &amp;#x200B;",False,False

As for my mom, she started having a lot of physical problems that motivated her to change habits. I would say she still has some disordered mentality. She didn't ""grow out of it"" as much as have her nutrition pointed out as a problem.   I think that most people will have another problem going on that they will address and will make the mental aspect of the eating disorder better- i.e., depression, anxiety- and then they will work on the eating as an eating aspect of that without really formally seeing it as an eating disorder.  In my case, I honestly think I was only disordered, and was not full-blown, but my mom is Very Anxious and Proactive and that resulted in diagnosis and a formal recovery, so yeah.",False,False

(Well, other than, ""don't talk to her she's crazy "" a la the lady down the street who may or may not have killed some people?)  She describes a lot of anxiety and restrictive eating and fits all the eating disorder boxes, but no one is getting her diagnosed. As far as her parents could tell, she was being just weird.  For me, diagnosis was a surprise pushed on me. I had fear foods, I restricted calories, I did lots of exercise, I planned meals and had a growing list of what wasn't allowed, but in my view it was all a very healthy 'lifestyle change'. It just didn't occur to me that flying into a panic because I ate pineapple, drinking half a gallon and going running in a frenzy was ""an eating disorder"" because eating disorders are girls who wants to be skinny and pretty, and I just wanted to do something right. Totally different. Now I look back and yeah, a lot of it was very disordered, I pushed away friends by getting overly focused on food, I lost sight of things, ect.   When you're in there, you often don't even realize that what you're going through is a real problem.  Yet another example- a swimmer I knew. Same thing- planned are her meals, portion control, skipping meals, vigorous daily exercise, total control of what she ate. Told me she didn't eat for two days, routinely ate low calorie foods, functioned normally in class. She lost ~20 lbs in a month or two then I think got help, but if you asked her I don't think she'd say ""I have an eating disorder,"" she would say ""I'm just stressed."" ",False,False

Like for YEARS I would fantasize about dying or killing myself on the daily and didn't even realize how fucked up that was. Denial and deflection of mental illnesses come in strong when you feel like you deserve your shitty thoughts, or when it becomes a natural part of your identity/ habits/ coping mechanisms. I also think the fact that for a long time, people close to me didn't see any problems kind of normalized it to an extent as well.   In that vein it just becomes so blatantly obvious in retrospect when your life changes for the better, its so much easier to see what a dark place the old normal used to be. ",False,False
