Is there any way you could be able to talk to her about how she triggers you? (You don't have to use that word) if not just try to remember that you know what you're putting into your body, and she doesn't have any right to tell you what you should and shouldn't be eating. Hope you feel better soon. Sending hugs.",False,False
