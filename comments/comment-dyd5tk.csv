I replaced anorexia with booze and will regret that until the day I die. I’ve gained an Unbearable amount of weight. I thought I wished that everyone would leave me alone, but in reality, I shut everyone out and now my only friends are my cats (not that there is anything wrong with having cats for friends). You’re still young. Realize that you may see yourself as too fat to be worthy, but the rest of the world does not see you like that. I don’t know where I’m going with this. I just wish I could go back in time and tell myself to stop. Don’t shut everyone out. You’re worthy, even if your ED brain is saying you aren’t.",False,False

I'm 27 and have basically put my life on hold since I was 22 (when I gained a bunch of weight out of college)... Been on an awful binging/restricting cycle for years... Also have socially isolated myself. If it weren't for my family I wouldn't talk to anyone but people at school now that I'm going back to change my career. I wish I could say something more helpful, because I'm trying to get out of it too. I'm here if you ever want to PM me &amp; chat.",False,False
