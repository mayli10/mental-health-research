As a result I buy a very small variety, usually 2\~3 kinds of vegetables and fruits each. It helps a lot if you can keep track of exactly what perishables you have, so that you don't forget about something you bought a long time ago. Maybe keep a list of expiration dates on the fridge? Then if you see that a date is coming up, you can factor that item into your plan for the next few days. You could also try preparing things like cabbage in advance (washing, cutting, etc.) and then freezing it in portions, thawing what you use a day before you need it.  If there's anywhere around you that has composting services, you could compost your extra food waste, depending on the guidelines (some don't accept meat/dairy/bioplastic but some accept everything compostable). Moldy produce can be composted too (but not diseased ones, e.g. if you have something that got recalled for e.coli then that has to go in the trash, otherwise it'll spread to the soil). It's good for the environment but it also takes a lot of psychological weight off me if I have to throw a large portion of food away.",False,False

Freeze it. If it's more tricky like yogurt or whatever, I incorporate it into a freezer-friendly meal prep or I use it in some recipe I can give away. Like if yogurt is the example, I could make a smoothie with it and then freeze it into lil smoothie cubes for later, or I might find a cupcake recipe that needs yogurt and use it up that way, and them give away all the cupcakes.",False,False
