I’m trying to keep my eating to very low calorie foods. Like chopped slaw, filling stuff like oatmeal, and coffee :)   I hate it though. I hate feeling insatiable. It usually happens to me after eating high carb or sugar foods the day before. This week was my birthday and it’s just been a couple days of nonstop food and i am DYING to get back to normal. But then i also want to run with it and just eat normal... but when will that end? What if i gain weight? Oh man the spiral is real",False,False
