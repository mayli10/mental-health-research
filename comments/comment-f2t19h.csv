I think all the Calorie deficit calculators online fuck with me. I want to lose 15 pounds to be at a lower bmi (still ""healthy""). they are all telling me to eat from 750 to 1100 and it seems low and confusing.",False,True

An average person needs around 1500-2000 a day, so unless your body is in a starvation state where it holds on to your fat (because you've been severely undereating) you should actually lose about a pound a week as long as you don't stay sedentary.",False,False
