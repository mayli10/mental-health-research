I used to have a recovery account... truth be told it was more of a ""recovery"" account. I would post my meals/etc and occasionally challenge myself but I actually was continuing to lose weight/spiral.  But someone commented on my post and said that I shouldn't be using recovery hashtags because I was abusing their safe space?? It made me feel really bad and upset. To be fair I was in denial about how bad I was getting and genuinely thought I was doing better but I don't understand why people gatekeep like that",False,False

If it happens again, I'd say you're completely within your rights to tactfully tell them that this was a challenge for you and to please respect the speed you're taking recovery. No one (aside from that person's treatment team) should EVER criticize someone else's recovery attempts. Even the treatment team needs to be thoughtful and understanding because recovery is HARD. You deserve all the love in the world for trying, and I for one am proud of you ❤️",False,False

They could’ve been nice like another commentator and said “hey I’m so proud of you! Next time add some chicken to challenge yourself more but such a big win!” But no they had to say I wasn’t really recovering.  This community and my friends are proud of me though so I’m happy :) thank you for the support I was worried I was being overly sensitive about it,False,True

You did something challenging for you and you should be proud of that! Dick move for them to invalidate it because it's not their idea of ""recovery"". Recovery is any step that gets you healthier. They shouldn't be saying that kind of shit unless they're your therapist or dietitian, and wording it like that was incredibly condescending and rude. I'm so sorry that happened to you.",False,False

And yea small steps are better than no steps and it literally almost made me cry when I read their comment cause they don’t know shit about my eating habits and life. This community always supporting me means the world and I’m glad you guys are here! Hugs and thank you once more &lt;3,False,True

That person minimized your accomplishment in the most condescending and uncaring way. As if to say that any step toward recovery isn’t something to be proud of. Sorry if I’m ranting but shit like this makes me so mad. It sounded like they were basically saying that you aren’t “recovered enough” and because of that, your step towards recovery isn’t worth anything. And you know what I think? I think that’s bullshit. Any step towards recovery, even if it’s a small step, is something to be proud of. Oil is a scary thing and you ate it, and if you ask me, that’s pretty badass. I am so proud of you. Keep on fighting ❤️",False,False
