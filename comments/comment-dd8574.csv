She's not ed-specialized and I can't get an ed-specialized dietician or therapist because the closest ones are several hours away from where I live. Plus my family really can't afford it, I'm going to have to stop going to therapy as a whole since I'm not getting anything out of it anymore anyways.  The thing is my weight gain was real weight and not just bloating, I'm not bloated at all anymore since I've relapsed and I'm at a healthy weight so idk. Sorry I appreciate the advice, it's just complicated",False,True
