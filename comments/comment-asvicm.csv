I read an analogy somewhere which explained why extreme hunger happens: imagine asking someone for a loan of $14,000, and you have a week to pay them back, but instead of paying them back the initial amount, you give them $700. Obviously that person will be upset, now just image this with your body; your body requires a certain amount of calories to get throughout the day. If the average person needs 2000cal (example) a day, that's 14,000cal a week, and you only giving your body a small amount (like 700cal a week) creates a major deficit. Your body is basically trying to make up all the nutrients that were originally deprived in the beginning. Purging and over-exercising lengthens the whole process, setting you back at square one. Although I had lost a lot of weight, I still wasn't considered ""medically underweight"" by BMI standards or a danger to myself, which still angers me, so you definitely don't need to be at a certain BMI or weight to experience extreme hunger.

I used to fast pretty frequently and stop feeling hungry after maybe 3 days, but I physically just can’t fast that long anymore. (Maybe five days if I’ve been binging a lot beforehand whereas I used to go maybe two weeks or so).  I’ve got a long while before I get to that low because I tend to lose a bunch then backtrack a bit and so on. Hoping I can lose quite a bit more before hitting my own threshold then.",False,False

BMI was around 16.3ish. Also possibly of note, I was anorexia binge, overexercise,  long restrict, then do the whole cycle again - so my body was not being TOTALLY deprived of anything for loooong periods of time.
