Every time I try to write ANYTHING about any of this, it turns into a giant novella. At this point, I'm just owning it and rolling with it.  Look at it this way! When you haven't vented about something for years and it's constantly weighing on you, how *could* you sum up your feelings about it in small, neat little soundbites? Gotta just get it out there sometimes.  Clothes shopping...is going to fuck with you so much. I'm sorry. If you're female, clothing sizes aimed at you are so fucking arbitrary. Stuff you try on will probably be too big, too small, or somehow both at the same time. It's stressful. I've cried lol.  BUT actually having clothes that fit is wonderful. I tend to hit up thrift shops. The jeans are already stretched out and soft, nobody hovers by the changing rooms, and it's so cheap that you can accumulate a range of sizes so you never have a morning panic.  Idk if that helps?! But love and strength right back atcha. ðŸ’™",False,False
