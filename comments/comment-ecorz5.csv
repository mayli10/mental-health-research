I seriously think i have 3 outfits I don‚Äôt mind. And then it‚Äôs just crap that is too baggy and Raggy clothes I can wear to work ( long hours in a kitchen ). Now my girlfriend has a fancy job and I have to wear dresses(?!?¬ø) or clothes that look like a functional adult would wear them.   It feels so narcissistic to care about but it really depresses me when I have to put anything on or chose an outfit for even going to a nicer store or a family thing. It‚Äôs not that I am obsessed with fashion or care if other people are wearing whatever they want, it‚Äôs just a reminder of how (insert horrid internal monologue of self hatred - y‚Äôall know the script). I wish I could just feel good in some clothes but I‚Äôm looking for a bandaid to fix broken ribs. I hate shopping too, I mostly thrift because I can afford to eat ice for dinner- and frankly they don‚Äôt have much in my size and it‚Äôs hard to find certain Types of things.",False,False

Baggy clothes take away the curvature of the body and tight fitting clothes emphasize the unwanted bodyfat.  Maybe you have bigger bust/ hips/ thighs? I realised that body shape matters alot.   It's actually a blessing in disguise. :),False,False

Like, 80% of my clothes are ""just in case"" clothes.
