I have a single picture I keep of myself looking like a corpse to help keep me in check. I never want to go there again (but strangely I don’t want to fully recover either).  But I really feel like wanting to go that far is a huge red flag that you need help now. I didn’t even want to go that far; it was always “just two more lbs.” I hope you’re able to get help.,False,False

I feel as though being “visibly” sick is the only thing that would fully validate how I feel mentally. I’m also still stuck in the mindset that nothing’s wrong with me unless I’m at death’s door. :(,False,False
