Youâ€™ll definitely need fluids and electrolytes, and when you can, try and have a little broth or soup, itâ€™ll help you feel less weak and tired and maybe even give you some energy. But take it easy for the day, you donâ€™t want it to get worse (Ketoacidosis). It sucks though, I feel for ya, but it just means your body is out of glucose burning mode and has switched to full fat burning mode. The transition period is rough but you should feel better soon(:",False,False

If you canâ€™t eat, get electrolytes in your system, itâ€™ll help you feel better, I promise. Do you feel weak and fatigued as well?",False,False

If you can, get something with electrolytes in your systemâ€” Gatorade zero or pedialyte works. Youâ€™re probably low in sodium and magnesium as well, so when you eat again, make sure whatever you eat has plenty of sodium. Protein is great too. Also lots of water",False,False
