I started morbidly obese and Iâ€™m still just in the obese category. I ate more than usual the last week, and my weight hasnâ€™t shifted at all in 2 weeks despite eating way under my BMR . I used laxatives and exercising to get rid of excess calories but I know laxatives arenâ€™t very effective. Iâ€™ve tried vomiting before and failed, but now I can do it I feel a bit addicted already.   But I know youâ€™re 100% right. I will tell my therapist I think. Just a part of me really wants to keep it a secret so I can keep doing it. But a part of me know I should tell them.  Thank-you for the comment.",False,True

Purging is a really horrible slippery slope. I know exactly what you mean, it feels amazing for a few minutes after you do it, but I found out that satisfaction is your brain releasing chemicals to make you feel better about the fact that vomiting ultimately means something is wrong. I hope you can get through this, and if you ever need to talk, Iâ€™m here! Stay strong.",False,False
