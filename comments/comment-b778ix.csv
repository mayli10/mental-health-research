Don’t do anything to impress them, it leads hating yourself.  I learned this as a child and I was still rejected by my dad. Losing weight just made it worse. ",False,False

I’m 5’5, and my ex liked ‘em skinny. All his exes had six packs, and they were tiny muscly women. I was paraded around like a trophy wife, when I weighed 108-112, which isn’t the smallest I’ve ever been, but it’s still little. He would get less attracted to me when I was 120-125. Now I’m 130, and sometimes 135. I’m seeing a guy now, and he saw me when I was tinier, and now that I’m thicker (healthy thick, not fat); he’s even more attracted to me. I’m exactly like you too. I’ll be whatever a guy wants me to be. I’m so grateful that the guy I’m seeing, likes me at a healthy weight. I’m sooo thankful. ",False,False
