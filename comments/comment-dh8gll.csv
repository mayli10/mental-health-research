There’s something about drinking it cold, maybe through a (reusable?) straw that makes it taste sweet and amazing. It’s way more palatable than hot black coffee, it really just doesn’t need anything added! If you can afford it/find it, nitro cold brew coffee is the bomb omg they add nitrogen to the coffee, and it tastes sweet and creamy and like a gd treat for no calories added! I can’t recommend it enough.",False,False

Just don't burn your grounds or it'll taste like ass for sure. Boiled water is too hot so I got a kettle with a coffee setting that stops at 95c.  Cold brewing is also an option. The end result is much less acidic than regular brewed and you can always heat it up if you don't want it cold.,False,False

You could even reduce the amount of sweetener periodically as you adjust to the taste.  You could also just jump right into it and keep drinking black coffee until you ~~get stockholm syndrome~~ start to enjoy it.  Cold brew is also a great place to start black because it is usually less bitter than a hot brewed coffee. There are also several brands of flavoured cans of cold brew at places like whole foods that don't have milk but ~40cal and are a good middle ground between bitter bean water and a dessert.   Finally, if you're not brewing it yourself, I would highly suggest smaller independent cafés over something like starbucks. A lot of them have properly roasted and prepared coffee that tastes way better black. (Sorry for the long coffee rant!!!!)",False,False

I make my coffee with a splash of almond milk and a few packets of stevia. Overall it’s probably ~30 calories total, probably even less. Drinking something that’s 30 cals and enjoying it is more worth it to me than drinking something that’s 0 cals that I find disgusting.  Other 0 cal drinks that I like (or drinks that are under 10 cals) are Cherry Coke Zero, ICE Sparkling Water, Crystal Light packets, Bai drinks, Fresca, and Arnold Palmer Half Lemonade/Half Iced Tea packets.",False,False

Water it down with water instead of milk bc zero calories. Add your desired amount of stevia (0cal), a dash of a sugar free syrup (which come in tons of flavors and are also 0 cal), mix it all together and then add ice. Its pretty good imo. You wanna use the stevia as your primary sweetener and then the syrup for just a lil flavor. And the water helps with the bitterness of the coffee (as well as the ice when it melts). I do like black coffee sometimes, but this is what i do when im feeling like a lil bitch and want something that tastes good",False,False
