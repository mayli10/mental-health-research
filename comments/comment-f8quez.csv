Yeah was never a problem last year, but for some reason I just cant smoke and restrict this year. I havent been this high a weight in years, and it's absolutely terrifying. Skipped classes cause I feel gross, just really struggling. But I will throw out 100 bucks worth of weed and start again, I finally got it through my thick brain that it just isnt gonna work, and I cant be allowed to have a couple hours of peace a night. Just 24/7 misery.  Fun fact though, the last time I had edibles I was starving (hah) and without thinking, I shoved 2 and a half homemade brownies down my throat before realizing, oh FUCK those have q lot of weed in them. Was high for 48 hours ( I dont mess around with edibles lol) and must have eaten 10-12,000 calories in that span. It was wake up, eat till I was sick, pass back out, wake up, eat more, etc. Fun times.",False,False

Not sure how tall you are or how much you weight but I gotta say that's a pretty normal, average amount! Even if it's above your TDEE I can't imagine it being *way* over. Ofc food and water weight r gonna artificially mess up your weight rn but in a week all that will be totally gone :)",False,False
