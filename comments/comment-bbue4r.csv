I was told by my doctor that this reaction is common as basically most people don't go from eating a normal amount to nothing overnight. Most people with EDs who restrict actually start with higher cal restrictions and work down. TW NUMBERS: I initially started at 1200, then went down to 1000, and so on) Therefore your body gradually gets used to working off of less and less over time. This is the true starvation mode where your body adapts to more easily breaking down fat stores and using the small amount of cals you put in and so you don't constantly suffer with hunger pains or starvation symptoms.   However most people who try and recover tend to jump up in calories instantly. Your body can go into a sort of shock and instantly drops out of this fat burning mode and goes back to normal. Therefore when you suddenly try and cut again your body isn't in the right mode and so you feel the hunger and symptoms more strongly. Think: spilling boiling water on your hand versus standing in a cool shower until the water gets hot.  You should always try and increase and decrease calories slowly if you can.",False,False

I was 100% unaware that I even had an ed for nearly 2 years. I lost my appetite after I broke up with my fiancé and dropped 30-40 pounds. Consistently kept it up until I got a real office job after graduating. Then I got fat and I can’t restrict for the LIFE of me.   I ate like garbage but I was skinny. I ate ramen, potato chips, pizza rolls, drank coffee each morning with HEAVY CREAM and SUGAR. I could only manage to eat 1 piece of pizza, maybe 2, I rarely had an appetite and when I did I couldn’t eat much.   It was effortless. It was perfect. I felt sooo good waking up on a cold winter morning, layering on tight leggings and big sweaters, feeling utterly empty and thin as I sipped a monster on my way to class. I didn’t even know I had an ED until I found the old sub... I’ve spiraled down the BED/BN hole and just want my old body and life back.",False,False

When I wanted to lost weight I wanted to restrict again, but because my body had become trained to eating like a normal human it was hungry regularly. I have recently been able to restrict again and am able to restrict more with less amount of time required when I started a few years ago.  But if your body is not willing to restrict again, I would encourage you listen to it. We know how all of our stories go and it can be frustrating to get back into our old habits. Be proud of your growth and do your best to maintain it.",False,False
