I have trouble eating my parents cooking when I’m home. But I have a suggestion if you do want to eat her food (which homemade traditional cooking is the bomb and everyone deserves to be able to eat that!)  Tell her you want to cook with her and learn the recipes. Work with her, and you can calculate the calories on your own once you know the ingredients. But you’ll also spend time with her, learn the recipes, and maybe it will help your uncertainty around those dishes. For me, baking/cooking is a bit therapeutic sometimes and I’m more comfortable when i eat stuff that I cook. But you deserve to eat and enjoy your mom’s cooking ❤️",False,False
