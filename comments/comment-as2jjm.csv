Some stores are fine for little bits and the occasional basic but tbh for like 100 bucks at VV boutique you can get like 3 new outfits vs like idk one pair of pants or like 1/3 of a pair of designer jeans smh. i wouldn’t care if i was a 00 and an international model or 300 pound queen, i’d most definitely still be thrifting.

Most skirts, even nice ones, have elastic waistbands. It'll give you a bit more leeway if your weight fluctuates a bit. There's also no shame in thrifting! ",False,False

Make thrift stores your new home for a few weeks and stalk all the aisles. I’m really happy for you and you have to keep in mind how incredibly strong you are. ,False,False
