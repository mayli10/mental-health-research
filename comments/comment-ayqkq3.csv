I can imagine how hard that must be. The expectations of both Mixed Fil and Chinese beauty must've been suffocating. I can imagine that you're very pretty though.   I'm a pure filipino and our family has fair/morena skin and chubbiness as the norm. (and the height &lt;\3). This lead to my mother getting those whitening shots and going to the gym (no ""bad eating"" habits thank god) . She complains about how she looks which resulting in me thinking that's okay. I already have a low self esteem in the first place but this made me look at each part more.

Eventually there are people who fall back on aged historical premises that the value of having fair skin is a result of aristocracy without actually thinking about how beauty standards always evolve over time no matter the culture. You can't convince me that the push for anglo-saxon features in the Philippines or any Asian country for that matter, was a result of staying indoors.   Being skinny comes easier to some, and while Asian cultures promote this on a really unhealthy level, the added ideal of having white features makes ED and body dysphoria so much worse. These unrealistic expectations of beauty are a hybrid of Asian perfectionism and Western influence and eventually, even if you try to fit in, when you think about it where does your identity really come from? Arbitrary standards of ""perfect"" from your ethnic background on top of being subjugtated by foreign (western) ideals that have seeped into your culture that now feel as if they instrinsically belong there. My point being that the social and mental intricacies of being Asian are so hybrid it's hard to even find a mental health professional that understands the cultural problems surrounding this and I live in America. I could tell you about the countless professionals I've seen and discussed the abuse I've faced with my parents along with my ED/dysphoria only to have them brush it off as ""Well it's normal in your culture so why is it a problem with you?"" Word for word what I've been told at mental hospitals. We seriously need more POC mental health professionals who understand problems that come with being POC. We need more recognition about how Asians relate to their own bodies across the world because there are so many socio-historical nuances to them that we tend to get lumped together and have our experiences brushed off.",False,False
