Have you been in treatment before? I'm not sure if  it will make you feel any better, but I've Seen Some Shit during treatment meals lol and being open about anxieties wouldn't be even in the vicinity of the list.

My GI symptoms (the biggest of which is nausea) are actually quite a bit better this summer--at least compared to how miserable I was during the school year--but I've had really bad health anxiety in general since this started, and I've had other health issues come up as well. So for me I think part of this recent struggle is a way to relieve that anxiety.",False,True

I’m in treatment again for a relapse and the fear of food as it relates to symptoms is paralyzing.
