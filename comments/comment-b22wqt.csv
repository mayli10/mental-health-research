And like another commenter said, this is not how you go with somebody to the gym!!! at all!!! EVER!!!! and if your friend has any sense of social cues, she should know that!   this is bitter, and rude. Itâ€™s ridiculous behaviour and itâ€™s not something anybody or you need to have around you, ESPECIALLY not somewhere and around something that is triggering for you.   whether sheâ€™s doing it to be malicious, or if sheâ€™s just immatureâ€”this isnâ€™t fair on you OP.  You deserve better.   Sending love âœ¨",False,False
