I go to school In NYC and I mobile order my coffee because I‚Äôm so afraid to talk to any barista. I try to place my order early so I have no problems.   If my order isn‚Äôt there I will literally eat the money and order it to the next Starbucks nearby. I‚Äôm so afraid that people will make fun of my venti iced coffee with sugar free vanilla order. (Which I know is a pretty generic order but anxiety lol) It‚Äôs completely psychotic but I don‚Äôt know any other way.   I hope you know you‚Äôre not alone. Ordering food is traumatizing to me. No one understands unless you‚Äôre in our position and I‚Äôm so proud of you for trying.,False,False

I‚Äôm not on the spectrum but I have anxiety and sometimes when it‚Äôs really bad I genuinely cry if something doesn‚Äôt work out with my food. Especially if someone gets my coffee order wrong! I can‚Äôt have dairy milk, only soy, and I get really upset if it‚Äôs wrong because it means I can‚Äôt drink it but I usually don‚Äôt realise until I‚Äôve left the store",False,False
