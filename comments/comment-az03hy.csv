Itâ€™s just as important as the weight restoration and the key to recovery. You sound like your heart is in it but you really need help resolving the internal conflict, the wanting to recover is a really good start it means there is hope. Be honest with your mum, explain to her that you want to do this but you are facing difficulties to implement it. Very best wishes ",False,False

It's hard because eating disorders are just as real an illness as any other illness. Recovering from pneumonia is hard. Recovering from a broken leg is hard. Recovering from depression is hard.
