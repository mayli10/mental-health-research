It made me realize how just five months ago this is probably something I would have wished to happen just so I dont get to eat, but in reality I was really hungry and I wasn't going to let my ed keep me from thinking that being sick was okay and no matter how loud my ed told me I can use it as an opportunity to continuously starve without anyone worrying. I wish u the best on ur recovery I know it's hard but it is achievable I'm proud of u with the baby steps u have taken (＾ｕ＾)",False,False
