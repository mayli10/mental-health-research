Hook ups are one thing, but a deep, fulfilling relationship requires a lot of intellectual attraction rather than physical--though that never hurts.    In my experience the moment I like someone mentally, they automatically go up about 2-3 points out of 10, and I'm just intoxicated by their brain. Even things that are conventionally unpalatable about people's appearances become things I'm obsessed with, because they mean that that person is unique, and that I have THEM, not just some cookie cutter barbie doll person.",False,True

It was a bit of a wake up call that it's not my job to fulfill other people's expectations of me or make them happy. For now at least I just need to make sure I'm doing what I have to do, because my will to live is delicate and precarious, and needs to be protected.",False,True

Sometimes I get clouded by wanting to be in a relationship, I never know if they truly are good for me.",False,False
