You are making progress though, and we're super proud of you for it. Don't get to down on yourself about a few mishaps, coping mechanisms are HARD to get rid of and the fact that you've even done it up to this point is amazing.  Stress is one of the worst things that can happen in recovery, but if you can handle it even marginally well now, imagine what you'll be like later on! And, even if you don't feel like you're handling it well now, you can try to take a few steps back and reassess your situation to decrease any of your stressors. Is it possible to drop one of your classes? I know that it might not be (financial reasons, under university policy, etc.) but look into it and see. If you don't want to/can't drop any of your classes, maybe you could take some time off of something else you're doing in your free time (clubs/work/etc.) (?) It's totally understandable if none of that is possible - either way we believe in you and this community is here for you!  It's tough right now and that sucks, but I believe in you and even if you slip up, know that recovery is not a smooth ride. Take it slow where you can.  Good luck :)",False,False
