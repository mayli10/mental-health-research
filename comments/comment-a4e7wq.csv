I was depressed and fired for going to the ER for suicidal thoughts. I was fired but through my own words/a very persuasive/threatening letter, I was reinstated to a fortune 500 company by showing what laws they violated (and I'm not a lawyer).  I don't know if you will appreciate how big a deal this was. I'm sure your school district has violated laws. Having an eating disorder is a disability so they are probably super screwed and owe you at least an apology.  &amp;#x200B;  \#DrunkGigiOut, sorry for the spam",False,False

(I went to private school so this is a bit out of my experience) DM me and I can help you tomorrow. Me/my dad's ""fuck you"" letter are legendary. Basically, I would recommend you to write a fact based letter along the lines of ""On such and such a date, I expressed XXX.  You said XXX. Your legal obligation as a public employee is XXXXX"". (Can be more or less direct about how much she fucked up).  The most important part is that you write a letter, copy the superiors, and make sure you have dates and facts. No one could come off looking okay if some poor young girl says she has an ED and the counselor ignored her. Would be best if you asked her how she thinks she can rectify this situation. It is subtle but it puts the onus on her because that wording completely assumes she is guilty.",False,False

Can you get your GP to refer you to see a psychiatrist?  I think that'd be your best bet for diagnosis.  I know the criteria for a diagnosis can be a bit off (like ticking boxes, the more ticks the more it ""proves"" you have an ED), but I think you should speak to someone other than a counsellor.  You could ask your GP to refer you to the ED services for an assessment if you want to skip the psychiatrist.  You should be getting the help you need.  People can be dicks, but don't let them put you off.  Good luck x",False,False

You’re experience is valid and don’t let someone tell you otherwise. Hopefully you can find another source of counselling from somewhere else. That person should not be in the role they are right now if they’re going to belittle you and your experiences with ED. Internet hugs. Wishing for the best. ,False,False
