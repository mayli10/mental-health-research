I think this is because I'm naked when I weigh myself at home, and I always weigh myself in the morning before drinking+eating, and after my morning BM. I don't want to sound like a discouraging cunt here, but for the sake of calm (since you sound a little worried about the weight loss), you probably didn't lose a crazy amount. Sounds like you weighed yourself the same way I do in the morning, so yeah, the scale is probably accurate. It was most likely the doctor's reading that was slightly inaccurate.",False,False
