This is just bone structure. So I came to realise that building muscle is a way to balance this to feel a bit better. So maybe this applies to you? Being thinner won't reduce the hipbones. But building your back and shoulders specially will balance the hip width. Also, doing exercises, specially lifting helps to loose fat, that females due to estrogen store in the hip and butt area.  Plus, exercise has helped me through recovery and keeps me fairly sane. I hope this can help you. We are build a certain way, but sure we can play a bit building muscle in some areas more than others. ",False,False

I feel like my hips are some ridiculous female-mammal-type addition to my body, and I try to have as little of that as possible.  I don't ever think negatively of other people with relatively prominent hips, but for myself I want to look/feel like a child in my body, in a way.  Please remove the sexual connotations of mere corporal existence kthx.",False,False
