At some point, I realized it had been well over a month since I'd had it... then two months, etc. I wasn't surprised, it was a few months into a relapse...I'd been consistently restricting and ramping up my running mileage for a while.  Didn't menstruate at all for almost a year. I told my gyno and GP at my annual exams around the 10-month mark, and neither of them really cared. (Though they did both take me at my word that it was probably just due to distance running.)",False,False

It came back when I started eating regularly,False,False

Eventually I came off the pill and just didn't have a period, probably for a solid three years? I've only just gotten mine back and it's exactly as you described, ten days after I finished the last one and super light. Defs worth checking with your doctor as eds can screw with your hormones.",False,False
