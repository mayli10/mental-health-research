I guess I could always consult with my doctor to try out different types if the side effects are too prominent, like another user mentioned. Who knows, it may even be worth the trade off like you said. It'd be nice to feel calm and more ""normal"" for a while.",False,True

I had very little drive. Sex could still be pleasurable, but I basically wouldn't be horny as often and sometimes couldn't orgasm at all. My partner new I was on the meds and I would just tell him occasionally ""it's not gonna happen this time."" I personally didn't mind though because my mood was so shit before I started them that it was worth the trade off.   SSRIs are notorious for this, but you don't always have that side effect, and if you do you can easily switch to another. Having side effects with one doesn't mean you will with others even though it's the same medication class.  Also keep in mind it takes a few weeks to see any effect from them at all.",False,False

My doctor thinks that I'm Bipolar and I'm sure I'll be diagnosed with it once I see a psychologist but he's my primary doctor so this was prescribed to me until I can get to a psychiatric appointment. If you don't mind my asking (since this is a rather personal question so feel free to ignore if it's too personal), was sex still enjoyable on the medication despite difficulty in reaching orgasm? I've always been afraid of medication affecting my sex drive.",False,True

A couple initially reduced my appetite and then it returned to normal after a few weeks.    Concerns about side-effects are also really good things to discuss with your provider at any point. In many cases a different med can be tried if side effects from one are bothersome. And itâ€™s so much better to talk to your doctor rather than unilaterally deciding to stop a med. I learned that one the hard way...a few times over.",False,False

I found it to be very mood stabilizing.,False,False
