I think I got this, but it did go away for me.   for some people, though not all, you can also experience some of the symptoms (including bloating) you'd generally have with your period when you'd normally be having it, except often with light or no spotting, for the first year.",False,False

Personally I think itâ€™s to do with hormones and blablabla, having heard from friends who have all different sorts of contraception as well. I wouldnâ€™t worry too much about it :)",False,False
