From the sounds of it, what has been happening with you the last month does grant concern. I urge you to seek immediate help for yourself because I don't want this to progress for you or have a place back in your life.

Therefore, I believe you could get through it again. Please try to take care of yourself and consider reaching out to someone for professional help",False,False
