I went through a point (over 10 years ago) where I was abusing my diabetes (T1 juvenile onset) for weight loss. You get yeast infections, your body cramps up at night and later on... you start losing your vision or you get neuropathy (numbness and shooting pains. I didn’t get neuropathy, thank god). Breathing becomes difficult and you essentially become a conscious unconscious person. You also get to (after your blood basically becomes acid) sit in the ICU for a spin with an insulin drip, as well as the all time favorite- potassium drip. I still get ghost pains in my hands from it. It is a cold hard pain. This is just the tip of the iceberg, mind you.@  I also wonder if it can impact joint health, as well. I can’t walk normally and have the beginnings of arthritis in my legs.   My little brother is still in that point (diabetic Keto acidosis) and he has developed neuropathy at the age of 24. He screams at night, pretty often and mostly when his blood sugar is waaaaay too high. I’m 90% under control and I’ve started losing my eyesight. Not worth it.   I don’t mean to lecture, especially because we’re all in a similar boat here, but it is a horrific way to go. It is also a little bit more permanent than a regular ED. You have a chance of recovering from an ED and diabetes ( type 1, for the most part) is essentially forever. I would give anything to make this go away and maybe live past 50.   With vision. Seeing is nice. I like seeing.",False,False
