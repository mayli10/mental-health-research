Long way to go.  I look at thinspo, but draw a line:     The ones with defined muscles, and visible but not protuding bones are hot.  (Male and female)  The ones that are curvy with no definition (more common on females) are not.  The ones that are walking skeletons with no muscle at all I feel sorry for.  &amp;#x200B;  But I also draw a line an how I feel.  Two days ago I was constantly hungry and tired.  So I ate about twice what I usually do.  That was enough.  Yesterday was back on the wagon.  Maybe I'll only get down to BMI 22.  &amp;#x200B;  I like fitspo too, but there isn't much of it.  Women's fitspo is more attractive.  Too much male fitspo is bulky body builders.  My archetype of beauty is the build of rock climbers and gymnasts.  Small, well defined tough muscles with bones showing.  ",False,False

Even people with underweight BMIs don't necessarily look skinny to me. Slim, but not always skinny.  I often wonder whether I actually have distorted body image when I look in the mirror or whether what I see is reflective of reality (no pun intended) and I just have a different idea of what thin would look like (realistically it's probably both, because I know I see myself as bigger than people who are the same size, but also I don't see people my actual size as being thin either)  Like how can I have a ""thigh gap"" and still think my thighs look huge? Granted, I have wide hips and get a thing gap at a BMI of like 20-21  Like even when I see pics of thin celebrities in form fitting outfits I can't help but notice if their stomach isn't completely flat (which is pretty much always, because a completely flat stomach is definitely not normal or healthy)",False,False
