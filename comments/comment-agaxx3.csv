Iâ€™m no doctor, but a lack of calcium causes weak bones.  That causes micro fractures in your bones that heal weird and cause permanent curved posture. ",False,False

Your bones are mature by age 17, so you are well past the window with the greatest risk.  I've had severe scoliosis (surgery candidate, it is very visible) since before I developed a restrictive eating disorder and IBD. I'm at the brink of osteopenia and yes, I worry a lot about what that means for my scoliosis, but my understanding is that it is a structural issue unrelated to bone density.",False,False

I don't think it has to do with ED. You should see a doctor and get an x-ray, it can be reversed with the right exercises and posture. If you let it go then you could face loads of back pain later on in life. ",False,False
