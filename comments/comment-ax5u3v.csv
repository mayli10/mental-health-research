I was in the middle of exam session and binging purging  every two days...it got to a point where i had to chose between my exams and the stupid voices. So i upped, some days 2000 some 1800 sometimes 3000( keep in mind that i study on my feet otherwise i don' t retain material...weird I know). I feel like a fatso but at least i did well at school.
