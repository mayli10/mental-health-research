Some people say I'm skinny some say I'm normal so idk but I don't think I'm skinny but my BMI says I'm normal. You can totally have an ED and realize that you are in fact skinny. Everyone with an ED is different. Just like you don't have to be skinny to have an ED, you don't have to feel fat all the time either.",False,False
