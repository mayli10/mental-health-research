I need that quasi lax effect because without it I don’t go to the bathroom and the idea of all that filling up in me freaks me out",False,True

It seems judgey when I reread it now.   It probably would be fine to take a dose like that; personally I think my bowels would evacuate in a terrifying manner at that dose but your mileage may vary. Magnesium is one of the water soluble supplements so extra should just get peed out.  *as long as kidney function is good. Most bottles of mag give a dosing guide and then say ""unless otherwise directed by a doctor"" Mine actually says only 200mg a day and I take twice that, but I take a magnesium glycinate because I **don't** want the lax effect mag chloride, mag citrate and mag oxide give me.",False,False

For example, as someone mentioned, there are several forms of magnesium. Again please don't take my word for it but magnesium citrate *for example* is usually used for this purpose, they make it in liquid form specifically as a laxative.   As for the dosage, 3400mg is wildly high (as someone also mentioned, 3x the daily dose). This would very likely cause a lot of diarrhea which is a side effect of taking more than the recommended dose of magnesium. Supplements aren't medication but can still potentially harm you if taken in excess, for example taking an excessive dose of potassium can seriously harm you. Hypermagnesia is risky and more likely for people with kidney, heart, and GI problems (some people with ED can have these!), and could have serious side effects (though rare).  tl;dr please be cautious with this sort of information and do thorough research",False,False

I have a terrible experience with mag oxide. Its supposed to be the best for laxative purposes but I remember I took it before bed 1 time and spent the night in agonising pain. My stomach was loud af and I didn't get any sleep. Terrible night. Would not recommend 1/10,False,False

I don't think anyone should be taking 3 400mg tabs of magnesium.
