I struggle with emotional regulation in general and I have a lot of anger toward myself. A lot of...judgments and shoulds/shouldn'ts and 'you're not enough' and 'do more better'. Which is all to say, that I find my disordered thoughts/behaviors often come out of that same place of anger toward myself. And maybe because in a way I'm fueling that anger, when I'm restricting I'll actually experience an increase in self-loathing and urges to punish/hurt myself. It's confusing. It wasn't always like this for me, but this is were it's ended up.  Whether or not you're explicitly diagnosed with an ED, it sounds like you're experiencing intense distress surrounding your body, and that's a significant experience. It is real. It is worthy of compassion and support. &lt;3",False,False
