I'm going skiing in a few weeks and our group always eats alot of greasy shit right after we get off the hill. What I usually do when we eat is take a sandwich with me that I made and a diet soda, if you are going somewhere that you can get some decent groceries (atleast bread and some lunch meat or cheese) it helps to be able to pack your own food when you go out.
