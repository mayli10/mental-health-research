But please, hang in there. Everything seems hopeless sometimes, and it’s hard to make it through all the pain and disappointment and fear we live with every single day. But your life is worth so much. It’s hard, but even writing about feeling this way takes so much courage. You are strong, and you are brave, and you are beautiful. And you deserve life",False,False

Which generally isn’t enough.  I don’t know your story, I can’t relate to the last part, but religion is a to each their own thing that I am nowhere near qualified to discuss. Anyway, if financial burdens are a problem I’d suggest looking into nonprofits or online resources, as I’m kinda in the same boat of trying to find a budget suicide prevention resource.   Wanting to die is it’s own thing that, again, I am not qualified to talk much about. I really, really implore you to call CRISIS, they’re good people who, in my experience with them, are pretty down to earth and helpful. It’s toll free, and costs like a half hour at most. Whether you know it or not there are people who care about you, heck, I care about you, and everyone who is reading your post cares about you enough to empathize with you and give guidance. I hope you get better, you deserve to.",False,False
