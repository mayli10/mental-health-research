I got diagnosed this week but I was part of Pro ED reddit, kik, twitter, tumblr, you name it for most of 2018.  I think that being alone with my thoughts with nobody to talk to has been really difficult and alienating and my mental health is in a MUCH worse spot than it was. I agree with you on the routine thing... once my routine fell apart, I started fasting more, cooking less, exercising less, and self harming more.   At the same time, losing all online ED communities made me stop comparing myself to others. I always felt I wasn't ""sick enough"" because compared to the girls I was chatting with, I was in decent health. That said, overall I'm desperate to reconnect... I get more out of chatting with other people struggling than I do at a psych appointment. It feels good to not be alone, and it feels good knowing that if / when I finally commit to recovery, there's a massive community here to provide support and good vibes. ",False,False

It ripped my support right out from under me. I felt so lost and untethered. Eating disorders are so misunderstood in the real world and reddit admins taking away our little loving enclave made me feel so alone. Sometimes I think about how this will end for me and I feel despair. How do I get better when I don’t want to change my behavior? How do I heal if nobody really knows how to heal me besides force-feeding me? Our old sub felt like a break from that despair and I don’t think we’ve fully calibrated since it was banned. ,False,False
