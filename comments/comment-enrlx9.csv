My high school sweetheart and I went on a road trip back to our hometown for New Year's to see old friends and family and the majority of our friends commented on how I just vanished, or how they thought I died or something. Some couldn't even remember my name, though they recognized my face.  It's not that bad in my mind though. Fewer people to fuss over me.",False,False

I don't have any close friends, and I'm a lousy friend to anyone I try to be friends with. I'm flakey and a homebody. I actually prefer being alone or just wait my SO. But lately, I'm even avoiding my SO so I can purge. Having an ED makes you miserable company.",False,False
