It's not social sport if they're gonna take it so seriously. Good on you for putting yourself out there and playing - it's hard if you haven't played for a while or not used to it! I definitely wish I could join a social netball team :( even if you had a bad experience with your coworkers, please don't let it put you off! I do a couple of social sports and we often have a range of people and abilities, everyone is super nice and it's just a bit of fun. Maybe there are some other teams you can join? Sending hugs - don't give up! ðŸ’•",False,False
