When I eat I get at least 93g of protein.  My ability to lift has gone to shit. It just causes me immense amounts of pain in my shoulder and spine. Idk if it's related to the fact that my spine seems to be gradually curving off to one side. For a while though, it worked nicely and I was able to tone up my arms and pecs.   I stopped jogging recently because I just don't have any energy at the moment and I feel sick all the time (combo of benzo withdrawal and my ED catching up with me).  I'm trying to supplement calcium and eat more regularly now but it isn't helping much. Yet anyway.",False,False

I tried to do what you're doing and it was either significantly lower my lifts because I couldnt lift them at all or eat more,False,False
