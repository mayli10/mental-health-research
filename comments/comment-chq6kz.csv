An acquaintance? A stranger? Almost never. Even if I would, it would come with caveats about paying attention to how your body feels, etc.   I did manage to do the 2 hour pre-set workout. Almost had a panic attack multiple times throughout, but I did it. I'm both proud and ashamed- it's weird",False,True

My desire is a workout every single day but sometimes I'm too busy for it and it hurts my soul when that happens,False,True

Especially if you've been overworking your body. Do you ever take rest days, like not going to the gym at all? I think it's a good idea to try a shorter workout. You are absolutely not a failure.
