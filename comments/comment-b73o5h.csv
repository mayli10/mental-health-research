Some discomfort is necessary, unfortunately. - Liquid calories! Smoothies, lattes and even coconut water helped push me through some days.  well done for choosing recovery and taking the first steps! i wish you all the best, you can do it!",False,False

You don't have to try and make up that 1000+ cal deficit right away, but rather work your way up to it. If you add a little bit to each meal, it'll add up.",False,False
