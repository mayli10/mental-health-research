This isn't the same thing, but they deleted my personal blog last year because I when the porn ban thing came through I didn't have time to try and purge my blog of """"""""inappropriate content."""""""" And oH My GoD there were pictures of humans in their natural nude state!!! And FEMALE-IDENTIFIED NIPPLES!!! (Literally none of it was even porn, although I was also pissed to lose all the porn blogs I followed.) So yeah I lost a huge chunk of my life, thanks to Verizon deciding that the way to make tumblr profitable was to remove all """"""adult content"""""" (such as the bare human body that we literally all possess?) to better appeal to advertisers. (And yeah, despite the fig leaf of tRYinG to pRoTeCT VuLNerABLe yOutHs, this is basically also why they banned ED/self-harm content.) Yep, great plan, purge tumblr of content that a huge number of people exclusively use the site for. I'm sure companies are champing at the bit to advertise on a site whose traffic has declined so significantly.   Anyway I literally hate that company now and I'm sorry you're going through a similar experience. It has certainly taught me a powerful lesson about never ever ever trusting any significant part of my life to a social media platform.",False,False

There are way worse things on the internet, but someone talking about how they have problems eating gets taken down instead. I think it’s very crucial to have ED blogs remain accessible to people who struggle with this so they have a support system and can talk about their problems. Most kids aren’t just going to develop an ED “just because.” Yeah there are naive kids who want an ED (ugh) but there are plenty of people who have one and need to talk out their problems and why they feel this way. If I didn’t have these platforms, I wouldn’t still be here today. I wish people/parents/companies understood that not every blog or forum about EDs is bad.",False,False
