If not please ignore.    If yes I was accepted to your newer @big_dumb_mess account (I'm @theblamename or blueloon)   And both accounts  being deleted following a slew of ""i'm very depressed and not hiding it at all"" tweets has me worried.     You okay?    If somethings going on what is it?   From my experience with depression it's more likely nothing is really happening now, except the shadow in your mind is a lot bigger than you feel it should be and you've no idea how to handle it or relate this to others.    Again, sorry if you're not who I think you are.    Barely even know the person in question so I feel silly, but feel too worried to not say something.",False,False

She is better than she was then (not totally, but better at least) and I think she said she's back up to a healthy weight, but now I'm doing really bad. It's really nice to have someone in your life to relate to, but it's not always easy. I took a while to open up to her about relapsing because I didn't want to trigger her. I only really did because she was so worried about doing the same thing. I guess she had noticed I lost weight and was worried that she somehow had something to do with it, but she didn't know how to bring it up without risking making things worse. It can be pretty tough.
