I was always told plasma is more of a drain on you then straight blood donation.   As a personal experience; I felt fine after giving blood and when I attempted to donate plasma I fainted halfway through, and the tube disconnected, and I bled all over myself. I have not donated since because I'm too afraid. I was slightly overweight at the time and I had eaten PLUNTY of food before donating. I'm more prone than most to fainting in general though which can be annoying.",False,False

But also they have a standard weight limit for donating blood and you HAVE to eat afterwards or you risk passing out. Donating blood is still a medical procedure where the nurses there are intent on protecting your health and EDs are not healthy.
