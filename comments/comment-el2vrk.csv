Living a normal life, walking and talking and stuff, burns more. Exercise etc burns more on top. Those numbers all add up to what is called your 'total daily energy expenditure' or TDEE.  If you eat that exact amount of calories in a day, you will stay the same weight. If you were to eat that amount + 3500, you'd gain 1lb. If you were to eat 3500 *less* than that number, you'd lose 1lb.  Obviously, nobody's TDEE is as much as 3500 unless they're a large person who also works out a lot. So it's more useful to add the numbers up and think of it in terms of the whole week, rather than individual days.",False,False
