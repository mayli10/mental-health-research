Now that I’m noticeably extremely underweight I generally try and act like I didn’t notice and then if they keep pressing me I say the running thing again. It’s weird cuz it’s so validating when people notice but at the same time it’s so uncomfortable and awkward dealing w people who are confronting you about your weight. If someone really won’t let it go I’ll straight up tell them that my body isn’t their concern. I’m not open about having an ED though so",False,False
