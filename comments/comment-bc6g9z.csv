I'm proud of your efforts to avoid low restricting though, so would suggest you maybe bring it up lightly with a GP (you don't even have to disclose your ED if you don't want to and you haven't told them yet) or familiarising yourself with TDEE calculators for your age, weight and height. Good luck!",False,False

Based on what you listed, you’re at 1,410kcal, and you need to be at least around 1,800kcal/day, if not more. You might either add another snack or something more substantial to one of your meals.",False,False
