I just mean that in the case of your post- you could have simply said   &gt;""This man on TV lost more weight than the weight I am currently..  like fuck yeah I'm just a small portion of what you are...""

Honestly I wasn't going to add them at first but I don't speak English very well and didn't know if what I was saying made sense so I had to rephrase.

I would've preferred if you hadn't included numbers because it's unnecessary.  I'm glad you can recognise that this mentality isn't good or healthy but try not to limit yourself by saying you can't change it. It takes mental retraining but you can challenge these kind of thoughts- that's what recovery is afterall.,True,False
