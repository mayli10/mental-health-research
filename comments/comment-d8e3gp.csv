Okay, second of all, I went through this awhile ago and I'm gonna be really honest, your hunger cues will not (and I'm dead serious about this) come back unless you have a schedule and planned meals (that you stick to!). The most important thing is that you stop skipping meals all together, and then obviously you need to be eating enough. To be honest, it's been about a year since I started and my hunger cues are still wonky, you get better at it though. Therapy is hard, and it'll only be effective if youre 100% honest (trust me, I wasted 3 years and thousands of dollars lying). Now, the good stuff, what keeps me motivated is knowing that by taking care of myself, I'll have more energy to take care of the people that I love. Also, when you start trying to free your mind from the fixation on food and your body, you kinda get to re-meet yourself. All of that time that was once spent calculating calories turns into calling your friends or watching that TV series that you've been dying to catch up on. I'm not saying that the ED thoughts ever really go away (I don't know yet) or that things get better (I really can't guarantee anything at this point), what I am saying is that things will, at the very least, get different. Your life will be different from how it is now and I truly believe that it'll be for the better, because you seem like you're really trying to fight for yourself.   I'm always here if you want to talk ❤️",False,False

I'm not dealing with wonky hunger cues or fogginess per se, but my digestive system is throwing an entire fit about the increased volume of food I've been eating. I know I have to sit through the physical discomfort but it's so difficult sometimes!!",False,False

Distractions during and after meals can be really helpful. Also, I was given digestive enzymes to help with the physical discomfort (they're otc. You can get them on amazon). Once I started eating 100% of my meal plan it took a couple of weeks for my body to stop feeling uncomfortable. I have a really hard time with motivation. I try to just take it one meal at a time.",False,False
