If in any way possible you could lay off of the scale for a few weeks while you’re starting maintenance calories, that would be awesome. You’re body might start holding onto more water and your bowel movements might be slow from restricting so it’ll seem like your gaining a ton of weight that isn’t fat. Give it time to work itself out. Let your body get the energy it needs... 1100 calories is amazing but eventually I hope you really do get up to 1800 to 2000. Just want to remind you that It’s also ok to ask for help or seek medical/physiological treatment. You can do this, there might be a few curveballs thrown your way when it comes to over or underrating. If you continue to have trouble sleeping, get some blood tests. You may be lacking something. You’ve got this. Be gentle with yourself.",False,False

Like ""this banana is no stomach cramps in the middle of the night"", ""this bowl of oatmeal is the strength to hit all 10 reps during my weight training"", ""this bowl of pasta is the endurance to not feel light-headed at work""",False,False
