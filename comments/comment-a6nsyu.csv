I’m on 2500 a day and it’s surprising how hard it is to gain weight.  I said on another thread recently, the decision to gain (or maintain, or lose I guess) isn’t just one decision we make and then we do it and it just happens. It’s a decision we have to keep making. I have to make the decision to recover six times a day. Every meal or snack time I have to remind myself that I want to do it. It can get really difficult at times, and some days I do better than others.   If you feel overwhelmed just take baby steps. Try to make today just one increment better than yesterday, and repeat ad infinitum. Focus on small goals.   I’ve realized that the exact same principles of the methods and mindset I used for ana can be applied to recovery. It’s all about the small steps, and lots of dedication. Good luck! X",False,False
