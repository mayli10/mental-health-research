I’m glad it’s working very well for you! I have developed lots of coping mechanisms to combat it that work enough for me. I have a cube that has a bunch of buttons and such that I play with all day, I have noise cancelling headphones, I chew gum all day, and I’m not in undergrad which helps. Undergrad was difficult. Grad school is very different— I don’t have to sit through lectures, I learn the material on my own time and it’s just a lot more flexible in terms of research and deliverables. Basically, I don’t need to memorize things and have answers anymore which helps. Idk, I’ve gotten used to it. My symptoms are definitely not as severe if there was such a big shift in your abilities after medication! Definitely good to keep taking it and do what works for you.",False,True

This is also 1 ½ years of monitoring my digestive issues... I am getting an allergy test this Monday and the elimination diet is to figure out what I’m intolerant to. There’s something wrong and I know I feel better sometimes and worse sometimes, so I just need to figure out what that is.",False,True

If you have food allergies, you can easily go for a test and your doctor should send you to that. I went to a naturopath and they talked all this bullshit to me that my family doctor and my doctor from the eating disorder clinic just told me was all wrong. That there’s no scientific evidence behind it.   Plus, you don’t want to add restrictions that could trigger you after all the hard work you’ve done in recovery.   If something seems to be bothering your stomach, try eating smaller amounts and maybe when you know you can be home just in case you get sick from it.   Reintroducing foods can be rough on your tummy. Be easy on yourself about it. I heard sometimes eating something nine times is supposed to help your body get used to it. But take it as it goes. If your stomach doesn’t like something, it’s ok to give it a break for a day or two.",False,False

I went from being stuck and being capable of so much as soon as I started. I used to struggle so much to focus I couldn't get any work done or participate in class (my ADHD got worse after trying an anti-depressant) to getting tons of work done and impressing my professors with my answers to any questions they asked. I was able to answer questions I didn't know I knew the answers to even. Plus, ADHD medications have been shown to stimulate brain growth in youths which means if you're young enough you can end up on par with others after a few years of treatment. It might not even be necessary to be medicated as you get older. Perhaps that is why there is a believe that kids ""outgrow"" ADHD?",False,False

It really made me realize that I'm not alone and that an elimination diet is not a good idea for me(though I did try some).   My digestive issues finally resolved for the most part by taking psyllium husk fiber capsules.  It's only soluble fiber, so it's very easy on the digestive tract and can help with both diarrhea and constipation. I can't handle insoluable fiber very much.    Don't risk relapse, whatever it takes, relapse will 100% worsen your digestive symptoms and mental health.",False,False

It's funny because I also have ADHD but cannot take medication for it because of AN. And honestly kinda thankful. I'm weirdly phobic of taking medications and fixing/changing parts of myself, I feel like it'll make me act different or change my appearance. It's just another need for control tbh, just like anorexia.",False,True

It's self-defeating in my case though because of how sick I get. It kind of sounds like it might be the same you. Maybe I'm wrong though. Since I started getting treated for my ADHD my doctor has kind of been treating my medication like a hostage which has only made me more scared to lose weight. I had been sick (constipated) and wearing heavy clothes the 2nd last time I saw my doctor so when she weighed me I was up to like 110lbs and then the last time I saw her after trying laxatives and wearing lighter clothes I weighed less which makes sense, but she lowered my dosage for the medication because of it. I was already worried about losing weight because I genuinely felt like I looked better and felt better at a healthier weight and then adding this on was just a lot of extra stress. I wonder if the stress might even cause more weight loss 😪 My anorexia tells me it would be nice to be like 90lbs, but my fear of losing weight is stronger. It really does feel like some cosmic joke that trying to recover from an eating disorder could make people so sick. Like, I finally got to a place where I felt like I could be a normal healthy person and then the universe cruelly decided that I haven't suffered enough.",False,False

I do try a bit but honestly, I'm terrified of eating less, because I lose weight really quickly, I'm a BMI of &gt;!\~19!&lt; and I eat about &gt;!2,000-2,300!&lt; calories a day. I think maybe because I live in a big city, where I walk a lot and everyone is Health Conscious™, therefore recovering *physically* was already really difficult. I feel like my hard work will be wasted. But because I'm in constant pain, I end up eating less and then ""making up for it"" by eating like 10 squares of Ghirardelli chocolate at night before bed. It's like reverse ED at this point, I'm scared to lose weight so I force feed myself. Sorry if that sounds weird, I know everyone has different problems that are up, down, left, and right from each other.   I don't know about the laxative thing. When I take 1 serving of Miralax, I don't poop, but when I take 2, I poop a little, but feel nauseous all day or throw up. It's honestly a sick joke lol.",False,True

It sounds awful to say on an ED sub, but I genuinely could not manage to get through the day when I was eating more than 1500. I took me a whole year of that to finally gain just 15 lbs, but then I got sick and lost most of it again because it was unsustainable. I eat as much as I can without getting sick to avoid losing more weight as much as possible, but it really is the only thing I have found to make day-to-day life manageable. Sometimes I fall into an anorexia mindset from eating so little, but I have been working on telling myself that I need to come close to 1500 whenever I can. I even go over sometimes when I feel well enough.  When I talked to my doctor about how I felt when I tried laxatives she suggested that I may be overdosing on them, but I was only taking a single pill a night and I only took 6 doses over 8 days which is less than the recommended period of time to take the one I was one. Maybe whatever eating disorders do to our bodies makes us sensitive to them? So then maybe even smaller doses would be necessary if they were to be used at all. I think there are actually prescription medicines that aren't laxatives or stool softeners that help with bowel movements. I know that my gastroenterologist recommended one for me, but my insurance wanted me to try laxatives and anti-spasmodics before they would cover it. I guess they're good for when you're not totally constipated but still have problems with digestion. So good for treating chronic GI issues. It could be worth looking into so you don't throw up all the time.",False,False

I eat a lot more than 1500 a day but every time I eat whatever I want, I’m in pain. I take laxatives and they make me puke instead of poop.

I'm not vegetarian, but I have horrible GI health after years of restricting. I have tried everything and all I find that helps is eating less. I can't handle laxatives either, so I can't even eat more and just rely on a mild laxative to keep my body from handling what I eat too slowly. Turns out that's probably why coffee hurts me. I did learn that eating smaller amounts throughout the day instead of doing OMAD to try to avoid overeating does help me eat a little more, but 1500 calories worth of food is still pushing it. That's even with eating fatty foods. There's no way I could eat that much with a normal proportion of fat in my diet. All I know is that eating hurts my stomach, getting too much fiber causes abdominal pain, not getting enough fiber causes constipation which causes abdominal pain, laxatives cause scary amounts of abdominal pain, and that if I eat too much my body just stops absorbing whatever I put in it. I lose weight if I eat too much. 😞 My body is sensitive to everything, I'm always tired, and I'm always in pain. This is just how life is for me after anorexia.",False,False
