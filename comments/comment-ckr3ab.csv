I completely understand. My knee jerk reaction is to be overly sensitive. I'm dealing with this ED AND working on long term sobriety and holy shit I've never felt so many feelings so raw and intense in all my life. I overreacted and I'm sorry if I was bitchy towards you. I do appreciate your words.   And that sucks about your family dinner. I'm sorry it wasnt a better experience. I hope you're doing okay after it ðŸ’œ,False,True

I know the want to listen in and the emotions and thoughts that come into it.  I compare myself to others *all the time* and I am trying hard to fix that. And I am trying to help you in reminding you to stay strong.   My intention isnâ€™t to make you more isolated. Iâ€™m sorry if I made accidentally did that. I apologise completely.   I appreciate and understand your experience, I am just trying to help in the next time you are in that situation so that you donâ€™t feel so alone.   Last night, I was at a family dinner and my sister in law was talking about going on Keto and all the weight she is losing and everyone talking about how *easy* it is.... and I had to manage through all those emotions without breaking down or causing a scene. I absolutely understand that isolation.   And Iâ€™m not perfect.   So donâ€™t feel alone. Take this as a learning experience, and think of ways to counter your thoughts the next time it happens.",False,False

I compare myself to everyone all the time and I know it's not good but sometimes I can't help it. I didn't assume anything about what they were saying. More just trying to convey that people talking about their weight makes me more self conscious about mine. I was coming here for support and to try not to feel alone in an already alienating disorder. Don't worry, won't happen again.",False,True

Wanted to say thank you for where you were coming from + for explaining it more. It'd be pretty unhealthy to always try to figure out who's lying in general, but especially re:weight when one's a rainbow scarf of volatility about the topic.  It's not a bad reminder to be careful. I'll edit something into the top comment about that.  I hope none of this affected you negatively in any way. You seem like a pretty awesome person yourself.",False,False

""Don't let healthy skepticism lead to being more comfortable about fixating on other peoples' weight""? Yeah, absolutely.  If OP had sought out the conversation, I'd just stick with ""nooo stay away from that"" too.  I took some of this too personally for a few minutes, so if you saw that ramble before it was deleted, sorry for dropping a deuce in your inbox. I don't like feeling like I'm being reduced to my disorder, but it's not like it can't factor into what I say + it's reasonable to make stabs at whether it is.  I have to go host people for dinner tonight, so I'm just...in a weird spot and probably should go walk my dog instead of trying to comment on sensitive stuff. I think we're both right, just talking about different risks at this point.  You have a good day too. Take care.",False,False

I dind;t think you went too far or anything.   here is my answer:   You may not be a fan of ""this is disordered thinking"" but, we have to be aware of it. As you said, we need to be skeptical, and that means being skeptical of our disorder and what we believe and see. When you jump instantly to ""they are likely lying"" it throws warning signs to me. It may not be healthy to assume everyone is lying or posturing or exaggerating in conversations. Yes, be aware, but don't assume. That is all.   &amp;#x200B;  I know that for me (anecdotal here I know) I tend to be hyper-aware of things that no one cares about, or even thinks consciously about. And I have to remind myself that most people don't think like I do.  And as I am going through recovery with my therapist, I am reminded that many ED people do the same thoughts, patterns, and actions that I do, and not believing people of what they say is one of them.   &amp;#x200B;  I know you are not defined by your ED.   &amp;#x200B;  I push back not because you are being terse or blunt (that is good actually, I want you to do that!) but because I think we are really close in alignment, and we are just reminding each other of our blind spots.   &amp;#x200B;  I hope you have a good day.",False,False

Nobody is an omniscient reliable narrator, me included, but that doesn't mean I can't recognize a phenomenon that's cropped up repeatedly in the world I share with everyone else. And just because the phenomenon's relevant to my mental illness doesn't mean my mental illness must be the only reason I've recognized it.

It won't be convincing, but it'll be impressive.  It'd be a really dangerous mentality to assume everyone's lying and try to obsessively find out their real weight, or something like that, absolutely, no question about it.

Most people do not do that. people who are obsessed with weight do, but most people are not obsessed with weight like we are.   And your anedoctal experience doesn't mean it is right, and our experiences are colored by our ED, in other words, we are unreliable when it comes to gauging discussions around weight.    Yes, it would be worse for your ED if you compared yourself to everyone, you shouldn't do that, you are different than they are. That is the point, not that they are being truthful. You shouldn't compare your weight to anyone. You assuming they are lying is part of the ED isolating you and making you not listen to anyone on the outside.   ""i know I am right, I have my evidence. you are wrong because you don't know what I know and see.""

Fuck no.  I'm going by people I've known irl who I used to compare myself to. It's not my ED talking; it's reality and experience talking.  If anything, it was worse for my disorder when I took everything at face value and compared my truth to people who were often fudging their truth, intentionally or otherwise.  &gt; some of them  This explicitly didn't apply to ""everyone"".

We should not assume that people are always lying about their weight, that is an ED talking.   Also, we should not assume that they don't weigh themselves regularly, or that they are using their weight from high school. remember, they are not obsessive about their weight like we are.
