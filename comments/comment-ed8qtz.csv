I don’t mean to scare you or anything, but please don’t wait to address health issues until you reach a certain size.  And if you do end up fasting, maybe time your fasts so you only have to drive on the first day or two. Be careful &lt;3",False,False

But I’ll be drinking veggie broth, liquid soups, maybe electrolyte powder mix, and water. I am scared for my heart but people can do this for 30 days. I’m also taking a multivitamin.",False,False

Dehydration is from electrolyte deficiency. You need *a lot* of electrolytes to retain water to the same degree as you would when ingesting food. 5000 mg sodium (salt is less than half sodium), 3500 mg potassium and 300 mg magnesium is the usual recommendation from what I've seen.   You can't really buy any sports/hydration drinks with those amounts, but you can buy specialised supplements and mix your own. Drinking a bouillon cube works great for a quick relief because salt is the worst offender and depletes the fastest. It has a bit of calories tho. Drinking a lot of plain water without electrolytes will make dehydration worse btw.  I'm sure you already know why fasting might not be a good idea in itself, and how it can trigger binges and make everything worse, but I understand wanting to do it anyway. Hope it helps and you can at least stay hydrated and feel a bit better.",False,False
