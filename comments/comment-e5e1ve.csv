I want to get to a place that's fairly sustainable and relatively healthy, but I have no plans to weight restore in the foreseeable future. My illness is a big part of my identity, and I don't want to get rid of it. Plus, I'm pretty resentful of recovery in general due to a bad inpatient experience, so it makes me feel better about that to not recover. I know I'm only hurting myself, but I don't really care. Hurting myself is my way of expressing all the anger and resentment I feel and I don't know any other way, nor am I sure that I want to try anything else.",False,False

You cant actually wait until you'll be okay with gaining weight to gain weight. Gaining weight will making you more okay with gaining weight. Sth sth starving brains arent as flexible when trying to change thought patterns.  I hate it honestly. I don't fully trust Tabitha Farrar but I think she writes/podcasts/records videos about it if you're interested in falling down a rabbit hole.,False,False
