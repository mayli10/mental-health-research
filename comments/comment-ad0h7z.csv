You deserve to never have to go through recovery again. Early prevention is always the best way to go.  Stay safe ðŸ’›",False,False

And 1200isplenty is just... stupid. Like they really do glorify disordered eating over there. But remember how far you've come!! My thoughts probably make no sense, but it may be helpful to just ""talk"" to the people there and wish them the best. Like look at an ""amazing transformation"" nd acknowledge that they are unhealthy and say ""I hope you find peace one day.""   Just remember that your mind's health and your body's health should be your focus. How you look in comparison to others is tbh, not important.   I hope you feel better soon. Also consider finding a therapist if you dont have one, or just tell a trusted friend or family member the thoughts you've been struggling with. Finding someone to hold you accountable may help.  Best of luck!!! We're all here for you!!!",False,False
