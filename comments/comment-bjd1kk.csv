And they‚Äôre the first person in line at the table at the office potluck after they‚Äôve elbowed everyone else out of the way to get there. They‚Äôll eat your safe food you‚Äôve been looking forward to all day and claim they know nothing about it. Water is cool. Carbonated drinks are way better (for ME.)

Like, it never leaves my hand. I‚Äôll add lemonade Mio drops to make it like ‚Äòwater with lemon‚Äô because I can‚Äôt carry around that many lemons. Now doing that, my first ‚Äúhunger‚Äù isn‚Äôt til like 6pm. Granted, that‚Äôs with green tea, coffee, and diet soda padded in between lolol üòÇ",False,False
