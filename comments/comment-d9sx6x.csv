First relapse a couple years ago I stayed around 1000-1200. Never really binged but definitely couldnt keep it up.   Most recent relapse (starting about a month ago) and my new average is about 1200-1500.  I feel so much better in this new relapse. Its still disordered but my relationship with food is much better and I havent binged once, or even really wanted to. High restriction is the way to go 100%.",False,False

I have a job/I’m in grad school/I walk about 13km a day, so I really wouldn’t be able to do anything else either way lol. I DO find it more sustainable + I don’t binge at all, I’ve just felt like shit this past week and it’s making my cranky rip",False,True

When I low-restricted for too long -- and by ""low"" I mean 700-800 -- I lost all energy, had a huge spike in anxiety and stress, couldn't focus, couldn't do my job anymore, looked pale and sickly, had a panic attack, lost the little confidence I had, etc. I started high-restricting again, also motivated by reaching my UGW and wanting to give maintenance a try, and I feel sooo much better. Physically, emotionally, as well as overall control over my eating and cravings. Yesterday I was aiming for 1500 but could only make it to 1300.   I'm 100% a high restriction type. Progress was slow, yes, but I've lost around 10 kilos, I now fluctuate around my UGW and I haven't lost my hair or even passed out throughout this entire relapse.",False,False
