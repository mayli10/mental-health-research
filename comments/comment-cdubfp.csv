So naturally I’m going to say it to you.   Never rely on another man to make you feel beautiful. You don’t need it. I know it’s hard and damn near impossible to ever feel beautiful but if you are constantly looking for someone else to bring you up you are going to get into the worst relationships/situations. This is where the work comes in. And fuck your family for making comments about your weight. It’s a long road, damn near almost 30 and I’m still learning. We are all here for you ❤️",False,False
