There are simply other ways of communicating or asking. I feel like, “Are you bulking?” is similar to “Are you pregnant?” If the answer is “No” then it is a pretty hurtful experience no matter what. It’s assuming/guessing instead of asking.",False,False

Clearly the trainer didn’t know the circumstance, and “bulking” in the fitness world isn’t a bad thing - it’s a method of maximizing muscle growth! Given the context, they couldn’t have known.   That being said, it hurt to hear and I would have melted down too! The coach wasn’t a shit person, it was just a shitty scenario. And that fuckin sucks ♥️",False,False

It sounds like you already know, but a lot of that would be water. I always get incredibly puffy after bingeing, and it makes a significant difference to how I look. Most of it filters out eventually though.   I’m not sure if you’ll find this helpful, but your muscles won’t differentiate between wanted and unwanted food, and they’ll have been able to use the extra to get stronger. The weight and bloat won’t last forever, but you’ve gotten literally stronger from it. ",False,False

I’m so sorry that your trainer said that to you. You’d think someone who’s job it is to coach and motivate people would have better social graces. It’s okay to cry. I hope that your day goes by quickly and that you can treat yourself with a whole bunch of self-compassion. Sending you an internet hug! &lt;3,False,False
