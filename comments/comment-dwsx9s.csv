I’ve been told I was pretty in a way that catches your attention until you do a double take and realize that I’m not.   BUT I have also been complimented on being incredibly “put together” all the time. So that’s what I focus on now- I do simple makeup, dye and style my hair, get fake eyelashes, have a tan in the summer, and wear nice clothes and jewelry. I can see and appreciate those things in the mirror, which is usually enough to ignore the troll beneath. Maybe next Fancy Friday try looking at only your accoutrements instead of at yourself?",False,False

But then I watch an episode of botched and realize surgery would make everything so much worse and I'm not really that hideous compared to some of the travesties out there. I know it seems impossible sometimes, but try to pick out a few things about yourself that you DO like and focus on that. This will pass.",False,False

I can assure you we don't see ourselves how others do. It's body dismorphia. I know you can't be that ugly. I'm not gonna say you're beautiful because I simply don't know what you look like but you're NOT ugly,False,False
