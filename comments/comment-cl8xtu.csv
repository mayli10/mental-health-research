It has really helped me after a crap therapist and no one else is listening so the self help is a life saver:  ""So my therapist isn't accepting that I have an ED and is working with me on my PTSD and OCD instead but they have given me a really useful resource.   https://www.cci.health.wa.gov.au/Resources/For-Clinicians/Eating-Disorders  I'm almost done with the ""Workbook: overcoming disordered eating: Part 1"" and even though it's like reading a school textbook it is actually helpful. My aim is to complete it, along with the suggested food diary and charts then take it to a therapist that specialises in ED's. I'll have actual evidence in diary form that way and my own thoughts on each aspect of my ED.   Take a look. I answer the questions in a notebook instead of on the sheets because then I can read them on my phone or computer and answer on paper. I have them all printed out too but I find the sheets too big and awkward to write on and not enough space.   I hope this helps at least one of you.""",False,False
