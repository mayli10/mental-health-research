Itâ€™s not so bad if you think about the benefits, but itâ€™s definitely a punch in the stomach when you buy it. ",False,True

Can also carry me to my next meal on OMAD. But you don't realize the importance of electrolytes when you don't eat until you try this stuff. It can help with lightheadedness, shakes, even total body weakness or numbing.  Personally I only really enjoy the lemonade or cherry pomegranate flavors. I feel like those are the sweeter ones.  Another note this stuff is expensive. I think twice a year it goes buy one get one free at the store I shop at, but when that happens the store doesn't stock the 50 that I need for the year.",False,False
