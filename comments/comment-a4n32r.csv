I went from 108 to 115 and then just kept binging because I opened the floodgates to 123 to 128 in a month and a half. Now I’m back to 124 but binging each night is a habit and I’m fat,False,False

I have a goal weight of 88lbs, coming up from 76lbs, and I know every binge gets me closer to it but I still feel like utter shit after.

It helps me deal with the immediate discomfort and bad feelings because they're just the price to pay for hitting a more socially and medically acceptable weight. ",False,False
