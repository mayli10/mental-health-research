The constant thoughts of food, living your life for the soul purpose of food, yet fearing to eat. You are really hungry, and you have all the right to eat. Your body is desperately screaming and begging you for food. And for you to keep it (down). All you can think about is food, but you are unable to give yourself permission to eat. It is the ultimate torture, always being tormented by thoughts of food, but yet you cannot let yourself eat. These thoughts will not go away with those 2lbs. If anything they will be even stronger. Your body will be screaming at you even louder, in one way or another. Whether it be the gnawing physical hunger, or constant thoughts and fantasies about food, or both. Atfer -2lbs, you will just have even more of an energy defecit to make up for. More repair to be done. More food left uneaten. Your bodily functions will just be even more compromised. Maintaining that weight will be even more difficult because your body desperately clings to whatever it can get.  It doesn't matter if you are at a 'healthy BMI' or not, or what your therapist or your family or anyone else says, or even what you think looks nice, really. You stand in your own body, your own reality, and your own life. And it seems to me, that the situation you are finding yourself in right now, restricting and purging, is pretty unbearable, and you are bloody hungry. Your body/brain likely thinks there is a famine going on and that you are not doing a well enough job of looking for food and feeding yourself. And your body will therefore keep nagging you with ravenous hunger and thoughts of food. And the only way to fix that is to eat lots and lots of food, and let your body know that food is abundant, and that there is no need for you to be hyper fixated on food any more. This will take a while of unrestricted eating. But you will get there if you continue to honour your hunger and what your body asks for without judgement or attempting to negate it afterwards.  Restricting and purging food demands willpower. You could make use of that willpower to run into the fear of eating, and the fear of gaining weight. In order to fully recover, you have to convince yourself it is okay to eat even if you are going to gain weight. Your body has all the right to be hungry, ravenous even, screaming and begging you for food, and you have all the right to eat. You don't need any more permission than that. It is your body's orders, it is higher than your doctor's orders. Being hungry is all the permission you need in order to eat.   I really hope you will be ready to recover and be able to (re-)establish a relationship of trust with your body one day. The longer you wait, the more power you let food have over you, the scarier food gets. To me, resources provided by Tabitha Farrar and Kayla Rose have been immensely helpful in my recovery, maybe it could be worth checking out for you. Hope you will figure things out one day, all the best. &lt;3",False,False

Honestly they didn't take me seriously because I was at a healthy weight and admitted myself, they just kind of told me to eat more and let me talk about whatever I wanted for an hour. I mostly recovered singlehandedly and completely fractured any trust with relatives and my boyfriend in the process, who either didn't understand or thought it was a form of attention seeking. Therapy again would just be too costly and I have so much going on in my life right now that I can't afford to miss out on. It's just so much worse this relapse.",False,True
