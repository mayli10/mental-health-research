It has helped me a lot with binge eating/purging. Using the technique of recognizing and not acting on the animal brain instinct to purge helped me stop purging after eating/binging, and once i stopped that I was able to stop binging.  &amp;#x200B;  However, it has not helped me with restriction, which was my main symptom that eventually led to b/ping.",False,False

I’ve only binged maybe 2-3 times in the last 6 months, and I’m at this point coming up on 2 months binge free. It also helped me in that I don’t restrict so low anymore either, as part of my attempt to get away from that feeling of the “need” to binge.",False,False

I really like the ideas presented in the book, but I’m just not willing to let go of the dieting mindset. In her book, Kathryn Hansen argues that you must stop dieting in order to truly recover from BED. Although I’m not sold on this argument, I still believe you can reduce the frequency of your binges by following the exercises in the book.",False,False
