It's like most of the writers have a baseline of where they want to take the story in their head, start typing and then just get flustered or heated to the point of ending the story in a very anticlimatic way. Most of the stories have no climax (okay, *that* pun was intended that time. Ba-dam tss!) I feel like a lot of stories in the porn genre are like that.   OP, maybe you could try watching strictly POV shots? That may help lessen the feeling of insecurity within yourself. It's a valid feeling either way, though. I'm a heterosexual female but this is honestly the main reason why I usually watch gay, male on male porn because I know for a fact that it isn't going to make me feel bad about myself.
