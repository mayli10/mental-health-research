Nothing of substance, vacuous shit with no nuance. I canâ€™t believe he still has a viewership with the stuff he says sometimes, particularly about eating disorders and chronic illness. He would tell somebody with any ED other than anorexia that they have mÃ¼nchausen syndrome probably lmao. Or that theyâ€™re attention seeking. tbh his negative energy made him bald",False,False

There's no way to receive adequate therapy with an audience watching. He took his certifications and decided to use them for entertainment. He makes money off of his guests' suffering. The number of clips out there where he's insulting people or making them out to be incompetent or diminishing their problems is outrageous. He should have his licence revoked. It's not right for him to call himself a doctor when he hits so many people for profit.,False,False

(Not that heâ€™s the first or only person to do this.) Itâ€™s Jerry Springer meets WebMD. I donâ€™t think heâ€™s actually an MD either...,False,False

That one pissed me off too, he always seems to focus more on appearances rather than the medical/mental health aspects. I remember an episode with a homeless girl where he literally refused to talk about anything other than her bad hygiene and essentially publically humiliated her when she needed help, she walked off the stage",False,True
