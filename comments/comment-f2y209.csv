After talking to him about it (because what the hell kind of weirdo, out of character comment was that???) And after also going shopping for new bras bc I‚Äôm continually just losing the little that is left of my ibtc tatas and *still* having a higher band size, I‚Äôve come to the conclusion that I have a bad case of the BIG OL RIBS with a side of the BIG OL SAGGY BOOTY/LEGS bluez.   Why can‚Äôt I just redistribute some of this? I always thought I would lose weight evenly but apparently not?????? EXPLAIN!",False,False

I feel like a bedraggled wizard warning you away from the darkness that comes with an ED, but I know a post from some random online wont make you suddenly change your ways. All I will say is - no I am not reallllly skinny, in fact my bmi is in the healthy range. And, try to talk to a therapist about these desires cause there is nothing beautiful of the feeling that you've abstained for so long, hurt your body for so long, that it looks unhealthy.

I swear it freaks me out more than anything. It is not delicate, dainty, princess who just forgets to eat and wanders castle like (as I thought previous to having them show!).

I'm not fat. My thighs look fat, but thats because I'm a squashed little person with inverted hips, so my thighs dont have nowhere to go but next to eachother.
