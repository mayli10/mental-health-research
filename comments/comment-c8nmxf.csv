I have been restricting pretty intensely for a bit and I couldnâ€™t sleep at all last night. Got up and slept on the couch under a towel because I was moving too much and didnâ€™t want to bother my partner. :/   Sucks because sleep is a great escape from hunger and ana thoughts otherwise.,False,False

Either I was too nauseous to sleep or too hungry. I think it also just throws off your bodyâ€™s general functioning which certainly includes sleep.  Right now Iâ€™m going to bed around 5am ðŸ™„,False,False
