Hell don't weigh until you have a bowel movement. That food is being processed and still in your body right now, so of course more weight is gonna be there, but the body cannot just make fat in that short of time, so the extra weight in the scale is food weight. And it shall pass.",False,False

Wine always makes me have insane sweet cravings and well, there was pumpkin pie.   I'm trying not to be too hard on myself - I don't go to parties much and we shouldn't have to feel terrible for doing something everyone else our age does for fun. Halloween is only once a year and we have all week to restrict haha",False,False
