I'm not a fan of the vaguely worded ones...like, ""Suffering is a part of life,"" sounds to me like my bitchy great aunt, not anything comforting. But I really like thoughts and phrases that speak to shared pain, to the truth that you aren't the only person who's felt this way, and you aren't the only person who's feeling this way at this very moment. Somewhere, someone in the world is even curled up on their couch (or wherever) like you are right now, feeling this same type of grief or fear or sorrow.   In accordance, I also like to modify the exercise by saying things like, ""May *we* be kind to ourselves,"" for step 5. I find that decentering the self really helps when I'm dealing with a vortex of pain/depression/fear.",False,False

Incense (or a scented candle) and a warm relaxing bath before bed can help soothe anxiety. I know you said your budget is tight but they often have candles on sale for a couple of bucks at walmart.,False,False

There are some great videos on youtube. A blanket is great for cushioning from the floor. Other options might include spending some time doing an activity that you enjoy, like taking a mindful walk on a nature path, reading a book, watching an episode of a funny show (I just started Schitt's Creek--I think everyone in my treatment program is watching it), taking a cool or warm shower, journaling, doing your hair, coloring mandalas, or progressive muscle relaxation.
