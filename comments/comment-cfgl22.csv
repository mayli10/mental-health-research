I think at this point my doctors are considering it chronic.  I wish I wasnt so strongly pulled into the idea of ""being skinny""  Theres so many reasons I want to eat more without having a panic attack. And I suppose improved digestion would be one",False,False

Regular doctors don't tend to know much about it.   Gastroparesis is often treated with drugs such as Reglan. Personally, I do think docs are quick to prescribe before trying other solutions. Obviously, listen to your doctor, but in particular, it's not a drug to take lightly if you have depression or a similar mood disorder (since it's a dopamine antagonist).",False,False

To be actually sure it is gastroparesis you usually need imaging studies done so they can actually time how long it takes food to move through your GI tract. However, for people with EDs and no other GI issues, the way to treat gastroparesis seems to be just by increasing intake. [Here's](https://www.cedars-sinai.org/health-library/diseases-and-conditions/g/gastroparesis.html) some more info. Definitely bring it up with your doctor if you are concerned, but absent other symptoms it might just resolve on its own, assuming that's what this actually is.",False,False

Freaked me out so much I didn't purge again for like 4 months.  Also, restriction can lead to delayed gastric emptying AKA gastroparesis (which is separate from metabolism, which is the process by which your body turns food into fuel). It can often resolve on its own if you increase your intake though.",False,False
