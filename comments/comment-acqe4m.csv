Obviously this shit is super scary and he is probably super scared. People like us are constantantly submerged in this shit and it loses its power, but it's shocking to the un initiated or lightly aware. The anger (or fear really) is a deep seated reaction, but if he cares about you (and he is dating and fucking loves you so he does), he both needs time and he needs to know you are having a hard time and sharing with him because you need support. If he is out of his depth with supporting you, you can always send him links to ED sites, the usually have pages for friends and family for exactly that reason! ",False,False
