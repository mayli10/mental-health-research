Learn what that looks like, and then you can gradually stop using the app as you get used to how much you should be eating. Weigh yourself maybe once a month, and if you see more than a 5 pound difference from your target, adjust accordingly.   I say more than 5 pounds because between hormones and water retention, your body weight can change by a big margin without actually putting on any fat.   Also, try to be kind to yourself and not so militant.",False,False

Plus, it'll help you ascertain what your new maintenance calories are since they go down by weight. If you go up by 100 calories or so every few days or every week it should prevent too much bloating also. Basically, once you get to an amount of calories where you see a slight gain on the scale every day no matter if you're not bloated or have food weight, that's slightly above maintenance. Subtract 100 cals from that and you should stay at that weight!!!  Good luck! Remember that if you exercise some days and not others, your caloric needs will be a lot higher on the days you exercise and still slightly higher on days you dont due to your body repairing its muscles and using extra calories to do so  I hope it goes well for you!!",False,False

It wasn’t the 1400 that made me gain around 5 pounds back; I started binging because I wasn’t used to letting myself actually eat or enjoy food, so I think I was scared I’d starve myself again, which caused my to binge horribly for a while. Now I’m stuck restricting again. Then binging. Then restricting. My point is, maybe an incremental increase in calories up to the amount you need daily is better than a massive increase like I did.",False,False
