I would really try to stay off them, they’re not worth it. Especially the monster drinks etc, they’ve got such high levels of caffeine that they can easily make you anxious and nauseous. Even just from an ED point of view you really want to avoid anxiety as it can raise levels of cortisol which can lead to weight gain in some people.  Try to get some rest, if you can’t give up diet sodas completely why not try some without caffeine, you’ll feel healthier and sleep better (good sleep hygiene is also a precursor for healthy weight and healthy appetite control)",False,False
