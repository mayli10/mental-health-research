Might make you feel better a bit.  I got trampled insanely hard, taken for about 4 grand, then watched her fuck my best friend in a parking lot. And the entire night I had to sit there with a smile on my face.  Backstory: met this girl when I was a groomsmen at a friend's wedding a few months ago. Started hooking up and dating. She was going through a divorce, just moved back home, etc. So her ex was an abusive asshole, controlled her through money. I gave her my credit card to try and regain control. She'd hit him up for back to school stuff for their daughter and he'd give her hell for 3 days. So my card was a way to break that and get back on her feet.  The usual happened. Bang, I love you, omg your amazing. Generic crap to make you feel wanted and loved. But she always used to tell me she couldn't spend the night or really go out on dates without her daughter around. Since they were going through tough times, I adapted. Our dates turned into shopping sprees and shit.  Well, her brother is my best friend. Amazing guy. He just got married this past weekend. She decided it would be a great idea to end things with me out of the blue at the rehearsal dinner because she wanted my other friend more. Makes up some lame ""oh I don't want to date right now I'm not ready"" excuse, I buy it.  Yep. Lied about it all. Found out everything the other night. She's been getting money the entire time from the ex, she's been seeing and sleeping over this other guy's house the entire relationship, constantly leaving her daughter at home. She's been taking money from several guys. It was just one giant shit show of a mess on my buddies wedding night. It was disgusting, fucked me up pretty good that night. Spent maybe 5 days straight in (several) bottles of whiskey.   So hey! If I can escape that hell on Earth and pop out the other side saying to myself ""holy fuck I dodged a bullet"" then so can you. Fuck shitty people who don't care about you despite all you do for them. Be happy with yourself. Love yourself. Because you're so much better then that dick.",False,False
