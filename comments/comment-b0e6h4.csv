When I lost weight previously I just cut calories and kept eating whatever. And then in time I self-selected my ""safe foods"" and ""fear foods"" ...you know the drill.  &amp;#x200B;  I train hard and have pretty high calorie output and this allows me to get away with eating a little more veggies and protein than would typically be permitted on this diet while staying in nutritional ketosis (which is measured with a ketone blood meter). I eat at least one salad every day (using keto friendly veggies) and in general try to get almost all of my calories from whole foods like fatty meats, avocados, nuts, olives, whole eggs (these are a staple) some dairy such as cheese. Then I fill in the rest of my calories with ""fat bombs"" which are basically mixtures of coconut oil and other oils with flavorings, and I also add seeds and psyllium husks to try to get more fiber in. I can eat out, just have to limit myself to a small portion of fatty protein and a few veggies. The most creative thing I've done so far is making a sort of ""keto ramen"" with zero noodles, sausage, bouillon, garlic, soy sauce, eggs, a bunch of oil (oil goes on/in everything on this diet) and some other spices and vegetables.  &amp;#x200B;  It is very difficult to hit your micronutrient targets on this diet unless you are extremely meticulous, and supplementing with a multivitamin, especially if you're traditional ketogenic (90/7/3 fat/protein/carb) is practically a requirement. Lately I have gotten better but it is hard. On a standard high protein moderate carb mixed diet I can hit every micronutrient target in a single 1000 calorie meal with the right foods.  &amp;#x200B;  The other thing nobody on this diet talks about is the fact that you require a constant inflow of electrolytes just to stay conscious and functioning normally, because your body loses the ability to retain them properly on this diet... sodium, potassium, magnesium, and calcium. Just like how a carb-adapted person operates best with eating small frequent meals, a keto'er relies on sipping ""ketorade"" all day long, lest you get cramps, headaches, etc. Food is salted liberally and I have had salt cravings on this diet I've never felt before in my life. In fact I've basically abandoned all sweet foods just because I feel like my ""sweet tooth"" on my mixed diet has basically been replaced by a ""salt tooth"" if there is such a thing.",False,False

I think it's largely down to how broken their leptin signaling system is and whether they are able to repair it and get in tune with it. For some people when they lose weight, if they set up their diet intelligently and find something pretty sustainable right off the bat, maybe tossing in a little exercise, their leptin sensitivity (which is disrupted by being in an excessive calorie surplus/being obese, look up hyperleptinemia) is restored to a sufficient degree for one reason or another and their hunger isn't as bad as you'd expect OR they were keeping themselves in a state of obesity from emotional eating to begin with (not because of physical hunger) and they were never really that hungry to begin with because their leptin sensitivity was still decent. Side note - one of the things that's mysterious to me about the keto diet is how it seems to have a very profound effect on obese people - they report hardly having any hunger at all and I wonder whether something about that diet promotes increased leptin sensitivity in obese persons or other hormonal changes that cause people to be less hungry.  &amp;#x200B;  Speaking for myself, I went from 350 all the way to 174 at my lowest (which was way too low) and I distinctly remember not really being all that hungry and having normal, even great energy levels between 350 and 230 but as soon as I hit 230, my body started getting pissed off, reluctant to lose weight, increased hunger, lower energy, etc. And then my response to this unfortunately was to **push through** and force myself to keep losing really fast to get to my magical goal weight I had in my head. This ultimately was the beginning of participating in disordered behaviors for me. I started denying myself food when I was physically hungry.
