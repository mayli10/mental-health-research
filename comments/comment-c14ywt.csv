Once you start, you never come back. I started one month ago. I thought it'd make me feel better, empty, I thought I found the solution to all my problems. Eat and vomit, amazing. First of all, it hurts. It's disgusting. It's not worth it. Now it's always in the back of my mind after eating. I'm a little over 1 week purge free and I want to keep it that way. I already have a ton on shitty disordered behaviours, I don't want to add purging to the list and so do you. You'll be fine, it's just water weight. Drink water, eat normally, don't fast (it'll trigger another binge). Don't panic, forgive yourself and move on. ‚ù§Ô∏è",False,False

Purging is NOT worth it and it just starts an endless cycle of bingeing and purging that causes SO many health problems. Anything you ~might~ have gained is probably just water weight, and it will even itself out within a few days of regular eating and drinking lots of water. stay strong and stay safe üíïüòä",False,False
