And yeah losing that much weight in such a short amount of time is...not very believable, even accounting for loss of water weight in the beginning. Although I do remember she talked about having an addiction to exercise so that might've helped.   I once saw an MPA post about a girl who lost 100 lbs in 7mo by eating 1000 a day, so Jordan may have done something similar and just 'omitted' it from her video.",False,False

I cut it all out and lost over 30lbs in a short amount of time. My own experiment has said numbers to me that no one else can disprove because they said so.

The super fast weight loss from morbidly obese people tends to be   1. Their initial weightloss is fast because they have reversed their near constant gaining.  2. It's often done in a scary way.  I watched a youtuber who lost 130 in a year and she still had/has lots of loose skin.  And I'm in the same boat. Even just going to 1200 it would take me 6-7 months.

Maintenance is probably one of the harder things to do, which is why is calls for a lifestyle overhaul rather than a diet. It starts with just replacing things for better options. Like, I threw out anything soy, like margarine, because it makes people flabby and it maintains that flab by giving people too many hormones (estrogens mainly). Real butter has slightly more calories, but I've lost bloat and a lot of fat just from cutting out soy. Now I'm replacing sugar with stevia. There's not a big difference in taste. In fact, it actually tastes better in my teas. I did honey for a while but honey is so expensive. (T o T)  In short, it's a long process but it's a necessary one. This gives time for the mind to catch up with the body since it's a lot slower to change than our physical selves. I see that all the time with people who dropped a bunch of weight in a short amount of tims. They have a hard time recognizing themselves and their mind still thinks they're overweight.   I just hope this info helps because it's helped me.",False,False

And she‚Äôs even mentioned stuff like ‚Äúyeah I got way too obsessive over calories and restricted too heavily‚Äù bitch then WHY do you act like that‚Äôs a reasonable amount to lose in six months in your videos and make it seem like it‚Äôs possible for other people.
