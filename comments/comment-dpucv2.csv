Wellbutrin lowers your seizure threshold.   For people with binge urges or binge/purge urges: Topamax is another non-stimulant option. It is also a seizure medication/mood stabilizer and preventative migraine medication. Sometimes it can help people lose weight because it helps with urges and cravings.   As others have mentioned, there's also Prozac, or Vyvanse. I'm not sure if Adderall or Ritalin is prescribed for BED.   I have had success with a combination of Prozac and Topamax for BN.",False,False
