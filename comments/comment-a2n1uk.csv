One bad day doesn't mean you're not on an upward trajectory. I don't believe in only counting streaks, personally. Maybe it works with addictions to substances that it's possible to just avoid- but food isn't one of those substances, lol. It has to be approached differently.   Also, just putting it out there... maybe your view of recovery is a bit narrow and/or ambitious? I mean in terms of expecting yourself to be able to ""eat like a normal person"". You may find it helps to stick with your safe foods or ""weird habits"" for the time being, especially on rougher days. That way, at least you won't b/p. Just a thought, though. I ain't a doctor.

A week is great and you can put more and more of those together on your road to recovery. It's not a straight line and as long as the trend is in the right direction you are good! ,False,False

You are thinking about one week, 7 days. What you are not considering is the number of times throughout EACH day where you made positive decisions that contribute to your recovery. Please celebrate this!! ",False,False

There are ups and downs and circles and sometimes you fall down a hill and whatever the hell else. So even one day, even one hour is fantastic. And a whole week? Holy shit! You kicked ass FOR AN ENTIRE WEEK! Part of you may feel like that's really small, but it's not. A week is long, and things add up over time, even if sometimes there are bumps and some hills that you fall down. You can do this. Give yourself some love and try to be kind to yourself, okay? We're rooting for you.",False,False

I don't believe that recovery ever truly ends; it is a constant struggle, and an ongoing process despite how much time has passed. You managed a week this time. That's okay. That's good. You know you can do it now because you've done it before. You know how you feel when you are doing better, and you know that you can feel better again.

You fell off the wagon, it happens, you can get back on it and maybe not tomorrow but you can and you will! Don’t underestimate your big achievement, a week is something and one day you’ll do longer. Don’t beat yourself up about it, focus on the fact that you know you can do it now and look forward to getting back to it. Good luck x",False,False
