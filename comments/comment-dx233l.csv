My heart rate was mostly in the high 80s when it was pounding. But it was pounding in the high 70s, as well. I can't tell if it is/was regular or irregular, but I am peeing clear and have been drinking lots of water mixed with salt. My skin has been super dry since this started, though. And I am retaining fluid again :(( I did end up going to urgent care and my EKG turned out to be normal. I still called my cardiologist yesterday and she scheduled for me to take a blood test tomorrow to check for electrolytes.",False,True

But I’m still not sure what that means for my potassium levels. I woke up an hour ago and felt no heart palpitations, but they came back after I ate a meal with a lot of potassium and now I’m fucked again. Do you also happen to know how to quickly lower my heart rate?",False,True
