I thought it's boring and I don't really trust it, idk. I like to calculate the calories of my food on my own. I'm obsessed with it. But it's probably as damaging as mfp. Your day is ruined if you don't count the calories because hey, maybe this carrot was actually 10 000 calories and not 30. Haha. Now that I already consumed so many calories I might as well binge.   Mfp is just faster in figuring out the calories.",False,False

I always overestimate how much I’ve eaten, so it’s helpful to see that. Like, “oh, I actually CAN eat a sandwich, cookie, fruit, vegetables, etc. etc.” without going over my calorie limit.  But it leads to obsessions and I continually lower my cal limit which is an issue. I also have a hard time creating habits so I log religiously for like a week before forgetting about it.",False,False
