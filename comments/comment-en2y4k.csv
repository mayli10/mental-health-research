When you're low ok b12 it can act like youre having a focal seizure (aka half your body tingling or just certain parts tingling for no reasoning or all) . Drink a 0 calorie vitamin water if you're from the the USA.   I have epilepsy and thought I was experiencing seizures every day but it was just low in b12 when my body was tingling every day. If it persists often with dizziness and concentration issues go to the emergency room/set up an appointment with a doctor.,False,False
