I have felt hopless 100% of the time before I found this sub. I have had more good days and stopped dumb behaviors so much more often now that I have this place.  It's only done me good.,False,True

Not only have I read echoes of my own thoughts and been able to say things I never could anywhere else, but this sub is where I learned most harm reduction tips and inspiring recovery posts that don't seem like total bs.  It seems like no one shares the actually helpful things because they think it'll promote behaviors, but im still gonna purge and restrict so thank you for telling me to rinse with baking soda or what is the least scary thing off the menu so that I don't just not go. much much love",False,False

Like holy shit there are other people doing and thinking the crazy shit I do! I'm not alone! It was a weight (heh) lifted.  I would never wish an ED on anybody but I am so grateful not to be completely isolated with my thoughts anymore.  Also we tend to share a fucked up sense of humour which helps a lot as well. Like ya'll should be comedians.,False,False

Came back to several messages of folks who have similar experiences and feelings just like me! I'm so grateful this community exists and is incredibly supportive of everyone wherever they are in their ED.,False,False

EDs are so misunderstood by those who don’t have them and having a place like this is truly helpful. I spiralled badly after proED was banned and once I found this sub, I felt like a dark cloud that had been hanging over me left.   This sub has provided me with so much empathy, love and new perspectives I would’ve never even thought of before. I’m so thankful for this place.",False,False

A hallmark of eating disorders is the unwillingness to seek treatment and recovery. I know I'm terrified of talking to a professional about any of this. This really is a place where we can try to take care of each other in a meaningful, helpful, somewhat anonymous way.",False,False

I was not aware of the old sub before I found this one...but I cannot imagine losing it now and going back to doing this shit alone.   But that being said, you're hella tough in my book to do so. Anyone who had to deal with losing a piece of their support system (or only system) gains a kind of strength. And every little bit of strength helps.",False,True

I don't have anywhere or anyone in my life who I can turn to, and after proed was banned, it had an immediate and harsh affect on me, my ED, and my life as a whole. On a lark, I looked on Google for any other community that might offer that support again. I found this one this morning, and it was like I could finally breathe again. I'm sharing in that feeling of gratefulness with you today, and I'm happy there is an outlet for us all to be open and transparent with our struggles without fear of judgement, and I'm so happy to know that there are so many people who will jump up and tell us that we're doing the best we can, and that it's going to be okay.",False,False

Literally came to terms with my ED a couple months ago and this sub has slowly been helping me work through it. I haven’t binged in a long while and I’m so grateful.

I was in denial for so long that I had an ED bc of my family and friends around me who would gaslight me &amp; everything (just a complete lack of support from them bc they don’t believe in any mental health issues actually exist, like they think it’s a made up concept type of conspiracy). It convinced me for *years* that I didn’t “really have a problem,” or that it was my fault, and as a result I continued to suffer because my ED was becoming more destructive to me as time went on. Luckily, when I started lurking on this sub a while back, as cliche as it sounds, I started to feel less alone with these issues. While this is a part of my life and I hate dealing with it, I do feel really appreciative for the existence of this sub &amp; the people on here.",False,False
