Things aren’t that simple and that’s valid for all our emotions including yours. Sometimes I get bitter but it’s often fleeting. Do I GENUINELY get angry? Nah, it is pointless to judge and serves no purpose but affecting my own mental state negatively. There is no value in that. I try not to dwell on negative emotions by empathizing in the manner that I posted.",False,False

Imagine humans from the plague eras judging us today for feeling hardships compared to what they had to endure. It is human nature to adapt and complain and feel hardship; if there was some sudden magic point of universal ‘contentness’, we would not continue to evolve as a species.    Everyone’s experiences can be valid. You can not control how your brain and hormones make you experience things.  I’ve been in two very distinct phases in my life. I was a child of poor immigrants and had an abusive father who later became a deadbeat. I was raised by a single mom with minimal education and broken English, my family was all women. We were never food poor but poor enough that we didn’t have healthcare for years and we could not deal with any sort of mild emergency. I am now a fairly well off engineer after much fear I might not be able to graduate because of my material conditions. I don’t have to worry about medical expenses and can buy things I WANT, not just need, and I can take vacations and travel now. And my job is now fairly relaxed. And I can tell you, I can still feel depressed. Sometimes it’s politics and the state of the world and existential shit. I also have permanent mild anxiety due to my early childhood experiences. I feel it randomly on my commutes or when I have a lot of chores or when I haven’t been working out enough to maintain high levels of endorphins. Basically, depression and anxiety and other valid human emotions are not limited to material suffering. The brain is complex and the human condition is complex, and we will always struggle against it no matter what.",False,False

You don't have to have a diagnosis to suffer. And they don't have to explain themselves to anyone, inlcuding you (especially because it just sounds like you are judging them anyways - I wouldn't feel comfortable opening up to someone who was judging me either). No offense, but you really don't have the insight to determine if someone needs support or not.   I am white and grew up in a stable home with food on the table and a safe home environment. But things still weren't always easy for me and I don't open up about that to people, even close friends. Being raped in high school really affected me. I grew up with a loving mom who we now know suffers from bipolar disorder, growing up with a parent with drastic mood swings was challenging. People still probably thought of me the same way you are thinking of other people, but they didn't know my struggles or life experiences (and it wasn't their business to know).   I may have ""privilege,"" but I still struggle. And here I am newly diagnosed with an eating disorder, so the struggle continues.",False,False
