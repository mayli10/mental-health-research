Or rather keep feeling like I don’t actually have a life. That my existence thus far (have been overweight/obese/morbidly obese my entire life) doesn’t count for anything until I’m sub-200 at LEAST. So much of what I see online, when people have the security of anonymity, is that obese people are not even seen as human. And no amount of “you can’t listen to that shit” or “that’s just trolls and idiots most people don’t think that way” is going to convince me that I’m not SURROUNDED by those people every time I leave my house.   So yeah.... I’m not human until I weight half of what I do now, and therefore my life doesn’t count until then. That’s essentially the mode I operate in.",False,False

I haven’t told anyone I felt that way. I have no aspirations, I feel like that lowest weight is the end of my journey. That once I’m there, that’s it. The world and me will just fade into some blank oblivion. I absolutely feel like I’m only living to lose weight.",False,False

To be without the fear that someone will trap me with food, destroy me with a look of disapproval at my weight or I will be overwhelmed at the thoughts of trying to explain “I am happy and healthy just exercising a lot”.    Week to week it’s just the same routines. Seldom broken by the chance encounter with an old school or college friend. They will remind me of my old life. The things I loved and the things I lost in the fire. I will respond with how happy I am with my Job and where I am in my life.   If I do spend a lot of time with someone or I have to explain what happened. I will say it was “the life trap that left me burned me out. I pushed too hard in work and though I didn’t settle down, marry or buy that house in the suburbs. I am happy.” I have a crippling happiness.    I remind myself I am doing better than other people. I have a house. I have good job.   Then I am reminded, my ED is like paying a mortgage. You work hard to maintain it and stay up to date with it. In the long term you think it will pay off. Providing comfort and security for years to come. Miss a payment and I am filled with fear for the future. My Future.",False,False

I mean I won’t go out or do things with friends I only do things that will help me lose weight and I’m just dreading each day cuz restricting so low physically hurts but I’m just wanting time to go by so I don’t have to feel the pain and so I can finally be thin it’s fucking rediculous,False,False
