If you are purging it's really important to replenish because a lack can really mess you up. Another thing i like to drink after purging is coconut water for the same reason.",False,False

I see nuun has been mentioned- personally I prefer the regular tablets you swallow with water (try Medi-Lyte electrolyte replacement tablets on Amazon).

It essentially turns normal water into sugar-free Powerade so they're good to just have in my backpack or at the office where clean water is just a drinking fountain away.

And our good friend magnesium citrate, taken as just a spoonful a day, makes an excellent magnesium supplement.

I never fasted.   That is when I found out low potassium can also cause temporary or permanent nerve damage.
