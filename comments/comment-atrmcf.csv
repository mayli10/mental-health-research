Sometimes we’d go out to dinner and he’d freak out about how full he was when we’d get home and make himself throw up right in the kitchen sink. Always dragging me to his weight watchers meetings and offering to pay me for every pound I lost,False,False

He's almost 52 and running marathons and shit. He eats not a lot but what he does is always pretty healthy. He complains somewhat that'll he gain weight from eating after a big meal. His girlfriend has mentioned to me that he's half seriously wanted to get lipo despite the athletic low body fat. Idk man but this probably shielded him from my habits back in high school,False,False

When she was a young adult she developed it and it didn't stop when she had me. My whole life has been a cycle of her criticising me when she thinks I eat too much or am too big, or doing the total opposite and trying to get me to eat more when I lose weight or she thinks I eat too little.",False,False

He’s a good addict who goes through months long stints of binging and then months of restriction, he’s been losing and gaining the same 20-50lbs through swinging between starvation and gluttony for years. He has no idea what a healthy relationship with food looks like, so he doesn’t recognize that I’m massively under eating for the amount of cardio I do, and he doesn’t know that losing weight as fast as I’ve been losing it isn’t normal.   He says things ALL THE TIME that fuel my ED, and I know it’s because he’s got EDbrain too. ",False,False
