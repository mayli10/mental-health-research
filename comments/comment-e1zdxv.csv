I know the feeling.  Sad thing is, if people knew the weeks of agonizing ahead of time, the fact we'd rather isolate or seriously endanger ourselves they would maybe undestand if we can't sit at the table or be cool around the buffet.   I miss the way no one expected me to eat when I was obviously underweight. For some reason I was just the 'designated anorexic' and people stopped trying to make me recover and accepted me that way after a few years. Not healthy or sustainable but at least I got to be social with minimal stress.",False,False

Does any one have a friend with the common cold that hot box me with germs in a car for a half hour! Lol I‚Äôll pay!
