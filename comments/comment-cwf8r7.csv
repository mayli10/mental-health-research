They're a great source of vitamin A, B vitamins, vitamin C, and various minerals including potassium. Part of the meal plan I made recently involves making sweet potato home fries for lunch ðŸ˜‹ I'm not a fan of cooking with oil ^(because calories are scary and oil has very little nutrients) so I kind of want to get one of those machine that fry foods with just hot air. I guess oil can be good for helping seasonings stick to the potato bits though.",False,False
