Also the 2000 kcals are mostly wrong if you don't really work out other than the steps. Fitbit seems to count a bit much there (it's all over google), so don't trust that too much. I mostly never burn that much on 20000 steps, while I take like at least 10000 of these on an elliptical on high intensity",False,False
