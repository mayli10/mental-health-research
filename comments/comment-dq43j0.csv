It's dumb because you need food to fuel your brain to remember things and think properly! When things get really bad I let myself have something dense but low cal like an omelette. When I intern over the summers, things don't change.",False,False

I enjoy throwing myself into long projects. Distracting myself from eating. It was great at the start and I worked on some big projects, here in Dublin. Now the volume I must work through is too much. Emails, updated drawings and meetingâ€™s I am starting to burn out like you. I am guessing my restricting isnâ€™t helping either.  I donâ€™t think there is a balance I think for me I need to move onto another position heading up a team or reduce my workload.       Client dinners have become a problem. As people have started to notice and mention I donâ€™t finish my dinner and I donâ€™t have desert.    I understand you work in social care and from what a friend has told me the nature of the profession is a massive commitment with very little return in the way of payment or job life balance. In Ireland anyway.        I am actually dyslexic and only got into engineering by accident. I had originally wanted to work as a social worker here in Ireland.",False,False
