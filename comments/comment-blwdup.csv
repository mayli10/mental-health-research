I know some people are scared of liquid calories, but to me it feels safer because it doesn’t feel like I’m really eating.",False,False

I made sure to keep them on hand and even carried one around with me even if I didn't drink it. I just felt more... safe that way? Was kind of scared for my life at the time as well (mainly due to substance abuse but also severe AN). Even if it's not a meal replacement, maybe think of something that has a lot of nutrients and keep that on hand?   I know ensure isn't the tastiest/healthiest but it at least can help keep your blood sugar/electrolytes/vitamins in check. I'm also struggling with restriction rn (it hasn't been this bad in years) so I'm having similar anxiety and I'm not sure how to abate the anxiety itself but I would say to at least do your body a favour and give it some nutrition until you can get home. I didn't think I would make it home alive either (and tbh I'm lucky I did) so please take the steps to take care of yourself until you can be back to your support system!!",False,False

Or even if you don’t want to disclose it to anyone, are there people you can grab a bite to eat with so you’ll be “forced” to finish at least most of whatever you get, even if it’s just a side salad?  Even a slight caloric increase can help you until May, whatever you can handle. Actually, a large increase would probably be dangerous anyway, I don’t know much about refeeding syndrome but it scares me. Be careful until you can get under a doctors care.   And what everyone else said - electrolytes and calorie dense foods if you can manage that. Maybe vitamins? I don’t know much about vitamins but I’m sure if you just search the word on this sub you’ll find some good resources.   Keep yourself warm, take care of yourself the best you can manage, and use May as your motivation to keep yourself at least minimally healthy for now. You got this! I’m rooting for you, even if I’m just a stranger on the internet",False,False

Maybe go to a fast food place or buy huge bags of chips. That would make sure you’re not extremely deficient.      Maybe get vitamins if you’re not taking them already, keep your electrolytes in check, a Gatorade once a day will help (there’s zero cal versions around if you need to.     You could also try to drink your calories, smoothies, Starbucks drinks, anything goes.     Good luck, I really am rooting for you!",False,False
