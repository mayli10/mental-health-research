Developed anorexia when I was 16, dropped over half my body weight, ‚Äúrecovered‚Äù and ballooned up again, lost it again in college, and now I‚Äôm somewhere in the middle at a pretty healthy BMI. And my body is horrible. I am covered in stretch marks, my skin sags, I have joint pain and arthritis in places, irregular periods, bad teeth, you name it. It sucks seeing other 20 somethings because I will literally never be that. And honestly all this started because I was so terrified of binge eating that I swung the other way and now I can‚Äôt even eat a full meal without panicking. I‚Äôm really trying recovery now but damn, it‚Äôs hard.  ",False,False

Although my weight hasn‚Äôt fluctuated more than 5lbs, at one point I weighed 250lbs. Now that I‚Äôve dropped to 125 I still have a saggy gross big belly with stretch marks all over my stomach, arms and thighs. I maintain by binging thousands of calories and then fasting for days.

I got to the point where I could only diet and obsessively calorie count for so long. I have less and less control over my eating. I binged a few times this week and tonight I purged a little bit in a public restroom. After 2.5 months of no purging. I'm gonna have coffee for breakfast tomorrow and a salad for lunch and in gonna have a light snack for dinner. I'm recommitting myself to lose again right now. My psychiatrist basically told me I should be counting and losing weight today. Even after I told him how dieting takes over my life. But I guess that's what I deserve after letting myself get so fat. ,False,False

I developed BED spontaneously when I was a thin, 12 year-old kid. They say the answer to binge eating is to ""stop dieting"", but how could that be the answer when it was never triggered by a diet in the first place? Sure, I restrict now, but that's only because I was, at one point, on the verge of obesity due to BED.  Anecdotally, I've food almost no correlation with how much I restrict and how much I binge. Fasting? Yes. But restricting? As long as it's not under 500-600 Calories or so, no.  I restrict because I binge, not the other way around.",False,False

For some reason even though I have a pretty small chest, my tits get huge when I gain weight. But they don't look nice so it's not a positive thing at all.   I've recently lost about 50 pounds and am at a weight that I'm still not satisfied with but I can't seem to stop myself from shoving food in my mouth. I feel like it's only a matter of time before I give in to binging completely and just gain all of those 50 pounds back :))) I don't feel in control at all.    ",False,True

I'm 20 years old and looking at other people my age is down right painful, summer time is the worst because I see all of these girls with perfect, firm looking bodies , not even a stretch mark in sight, and instead I have the body of an out of shape 45 year old mom ):  I'm really not trying to make older women who have had kids feel negatively about their bodies but it just sucks because at my age there's this expectation of what my body is supposed to look like and I don't even come close to meeting it.   I hate that food is first thing I think about when I wake up is food. And I hate that it's the thing that is almost always on my mind, all hours of the day.

I've had problems with binge eating since I was a preteen because food is a dominant coping mechanism. However, this positivity is also accompanied by a polar opposite sense of humiliation and lack of control; I hate that something as trivial as food is any sort of star for me, and I hate that my all-consuming urge to eat feels more like a need than a desire, thereby making me feel possessed by some degrading taint rather than an autonomous human being.   This has all caused me to swing between extremes in weight a fucking plethora of times and my body is battered as a result. It demolishes my self-esteem to look at other 22 year olds because our bodies are not even remotely comparable. It's difficult for me to conceive anyone being physically attracted to me during sex, so I avoid it entirely. I also have this bizarre body dysmorphia where I never recognize myself in the mirror, like the rapid loss and gain doesn't give my brain time to adjust to my new self-image.

I love eating and nothing else fills the hole for me either. I haven't had huuuge weight fluctuations, but have gone up and down the same 5-20 lbs many many times.   I think my boobs were fucked after getting heavy the first time (that one time I was about 30 lbs over my low weight, and it lasted a while, and even a small weight gain for me means a huge boob gain)... they are definitely saggy and wrinkly and deflated. Only barely tolerable to look at if I am standing up straight. If I lean over/lie down, game over, they are disgusting. It seriously depresses me but being fat depresses me more. I would like to get to my thinner state again but I'm not even sure I'm capable of continuously restricting anymore. ",False,False
