I put on over half a stone in less than a month and I feel like an utter garbage person. It's so disheartening as I've spent literally a decade of my life struggling to lose even the tiniest amount of weight only to pile it back on in a few weeks. I'm so sick and tired of this shit I put myself through.   I'm so sorry you're struggling. You're not alone ‚ù§Ô∏è,False,False

Basically, I‚Äôve learned that trauma and neglect are why I ever got fat in the first place and that, if I want to maintain a consistent weight, I‚Äôll need to be on meds for at least 2 or 3 consecutive years. Currently, I‚Äôm fasting to get to an even lower LW so that I can submit myself to modeling agencies before I‚Äôm too old and get the hell out of this traumatic situation and never come back to this godforsaken city.",False,False

I definitly overate during the holidays, but I ate what I thought was a normal amount of food for a normal person who was eating a lot. (because everyone overeats during the holidays and gains max 3 pounds according to Google right?) I didn't even feel like i binged most of the time.  Now I'm starting from scratch to lose it all and it sucks.",False,True

I put on 13 lbs in like  a month or so. I feel uncomfortable. The thing to rember though is that your body needed that at the time. You were doing yourself right by allowing yourself to gain. Nutrition and health is important. Be kind to yourself &lt;3,False,False
