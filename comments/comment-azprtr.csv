It was supposed to be my only meal. I also heavily exercise and managed to hurt my hand. Everything in my life just went to shit over the course of several hours. I wish my life was different.

I've stopped myself from bingeing before, but I've never stopped myself from following through on a trigger (in this case, it was 3 sips of almond milk).  But yeah, besides the dizziness and my limbs going numb all the time, I'm doing the best ever. I'm pulling off pretty large deficits while still being like 90% functional, which is crazy to me.   Just gotta keep going. 13 more pounds to go before hitting my UGW? Idk, we'll see.  I'm actually seeing a semblance of progress though...or at least, a fleeting semblance. But hey, even believing for half a second that I lost 5 pounds is great given my BDD.  I'm still fat, but I'm gonna get better.",False,False
