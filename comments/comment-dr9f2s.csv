I was pretty goddamn unhappy the first bit of weight recovery. But if I can be honest; I’d be unhappy no matter what so I just sucked it up.   After a few months it’s like your body calms the hell down and starts distributing the fat more “normally”. And your stomach does weirdly go back to how it usually is. At least mine did. Then everything was a lot more even.   🤷🏻‍♀️ weight recovery is the most miserable part but I guess it’s necessary so it’s all about just getting over it.",False,False
