Being sober for 10 months is awe-inspiring. I'm currently at 80 days. It seems like you have a solid understanding of yourself, what makes you drink, etc. I have faith in you and it seems like you'll get through this. It does NOT erase the 10 months achievement. Just don't let it get too bad.",False,False

Ever since I'm dry, other than the daily, disgusting hangovers, this is the one thing I feel relieved about - - restriction is SO MUCH easier when dry (major depression helps too, but YMMV).  You don't need alcohol. Really. Give it a try.",False,False
