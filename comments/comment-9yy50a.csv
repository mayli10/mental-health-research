I visited back to Vietnam over the summer, and I had so many of my old friends and even my mother’s friends just call me fat to my face.

The older generation feels that to be ""skinny"" you need to be somewhat borderline underweight regardless of your height.  It doesn't help that most Asians are obsessed with kpop and kpop itself promotes unhealthy eating habits. Ffs the idols crash diet during promo time. They undereat and overexercise to the point that it's not uncommon for them to pass out will performing.   It's also sad how their fans want to look like their idols. I've heard so many of them say that they don't want to weigh more than their bias, which is usually 49+kg if it's a female and 55-60+kg if its a male AND THEY DON'T EVEN ACCOUNT FOR THEIR OWN HEIGHT !!!!!  It's seriously sad how these young teenagers are brainwashed into thinking that THAT is the ideal state of beauty and pick up their idols disordered eating habits. It's such a slippery slope from there into anorexia/orthorexia. Luckily, I know as many people who are born thin and despise being skinny and want to be thicc and are actually eating healthier and exercising for muscle gainz so I guess we could override this stigma in a few generation's time? Just maybe not in ours haha:(",False,False

I know the culture to be skinny is large especially in China, Korea and Japan. I think there's the stigma against women more than 55kg in Korea and they don't account if you are tall.
