I used to be like you, I could never make myself vomit- until one day I just could. Bulimia is the worst thing that has ever happened to me. It has ruined my hair, nails, teeth and skin. It bloats your face and stomach. The back of your throat can bleed. Most bulimics don't even lose weight by purging. I personally suffer from terrible 24/7 acid reflux because of my bulimia. Please hang in there and try to show yourself some love. Significantly increased eating after a period of physically restricting (or even just mentally restricting) is not only normal, but expected.  I know it is so so hard and I am sorry you are going through this! Sending you strength!! ",False,False
