It wasn't specifically ED related, but was mental illness related. It is bad enough when the SO's family isn't kind to you, but even worse when the things they pick at are your biggest struggles and insecurities.

But if you feel you want to work on recovery at least a little bit, and want to let someone in, it can be pretty great.   After fully explaining it to my boy, it sort of put a lot into light for him, I think. It gave him the chance to be able to see that I'm deeply struggling with this stuff, and that my heavy restriction and then binging isn't just because I'm trying some crash diet and then getting too hungry and overeating.   I explained the compulsions and the anxieties about all the aspects of my ED and how it was the same as depression and anxiety: you know what you need to do to be healthy, but you can't just make your brain see it that way and turn it all off.   I think driving home the idea that it isn't just some attempt at a crash diet or something really helped things click into place for him. I think before that, he thought I was just stuck in a ""try to diet hard, get too hungry, start binging"" loop, rather than the reality: ""eat less and less or you're a failure, have one inconvenience, eat everything in sight for days because you suck anyway so why not""   (Disclaimer: that's the internal ED gremlin voice, not me saying that.)",False,True
