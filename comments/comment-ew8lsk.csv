My last anorexia relapse was literally when I was still on those meds and I lost tons of weight.  But funny those don't seem to matter when someone says I'm genetically thin and clearly don't have to try because I'm young.... but their self-diagnosed ""thyroid issue"" is why they're 300 lbs. Like tell me your most recent TSH and T4 please, or shut up.   None of this directed at you btw, this just makes me irrationally angry. People dismissing my hard work in the gym/on my diet enrages me, and people self diagnosing thyroid problems is super frustrating. Like, girl, you don't have a thyroid issue just because you struggle to lose weight, there's a lot more to it than that. I lost almost all my hair, developed cystic acne, and was exhausted 24/7 before my hypo diagnosis, but they never wanna talk about the other side effects.",False,False

All of the older (50-60+) women I admire at my dance/fitness studio are tall and quite slender. If they dyed their long white/grey locks, you'd seriously think they were only in their mid/late 30s at most.   I feel like a lot of the tendency to accept weight gain, esp for women, is a lack of care. It's not necessary that they don't care in general, they just have babies and turn all their attention to their children rather than themselves. I'm in my late 20s but I see a lot of women my age doing this. They're unaware of their weight gain because they're too busy making/taking care of kiddos. For men, it seems like a lot of them settle down and start taking desk jobs. They stop playing sports and being as active and it's their inactivity and relationship complacency that leads to weight gain. I've noticed a lot of the hetero older gentlemen that are slim/fit/extra conscious of their appearance are usually ones that are out of their 1st/2nd marriages or the immature ones that can't be bothered to settle down and would rather focus on sleeping around with younger women and spending money on sports cars.",False,False
