I know that adding a tablespoon of oil to this giant pot of soup I'm making will only add like, what... 15 cal to each serve? And make it taste SO much better. But nah, I just end up with a giant pot of soup that's fine I guess but nothing exciting that I'm not enthused to eat so I leave it in the fridge until it goes bad. I hate me.",False,False

It’s kind of a big deal for me, I can’t describe the feeling I get but it’s almost euphoric.  To be honest, just imagining it can be enough sometimes.
