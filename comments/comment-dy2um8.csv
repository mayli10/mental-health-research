I did a crazy long fast about 2 months ago and wound up in the emergency room. My labs were basically normal except my potassium was slightly low.. I took that to mean that I could keep on fasting/restricting because nothing looked too alarming on paper. It kinda shook me to read your comment. I hope you're doing well today, OP and lightsflicker.",False,False

Labs will be normal even if you are starving yourself for a prolonged period of time.  Then they will become suddenly abnormal when organs start to fail.,False,False
