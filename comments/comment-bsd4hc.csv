He developed it when he was 17, in his last semester of high school. He lost 50 pounds in 4 months and no one suspecting a thing. He told no one. I was literally the first person he ever told, and I didn't meet him until right after he was already recovered at 20.  I'm really sorry. ED's in men are very real. The way my boyfriend's ED used to manifest in himself is basically the same way my current one manifests in me.  I urge you to tell someone, if you can. Just to get it off your chest. ED's thrive in secrecy, and you seem really lonely. Telling someone, then leaving it at that and not even anything more would probably be quite beneficial.   I'm sure you know, you're not the only male here who feels this way.",False,False
