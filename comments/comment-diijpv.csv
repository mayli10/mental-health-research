I’m very open about my depression and anxiety, and I am slowly becoming more willing to share about my bipolar disorder, but my ED? No way. I know I couldn’t handle the way people would look at the food I do/don’t eat with silent judgments in their head, thinking I’m making this all up because I have a normal BMI... I feel like if people knew, I’d be on edge all the time (even more so than usual lol) and I’d feel like every single thing I say and do goes into the judgment of if I have a “real” eating disorder or not.   It’s fucked, man",False,False
