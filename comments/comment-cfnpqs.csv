But personally I find that pdocs downplay side effects that are known to be real risks with most antipsychotics other than Lamictal (such as weight gain, metabolic issues, tardive dyskinesia).",False,False

It killed my appetite because I felt a lump in my stomach after taking it, but it could have been the fact that my (now ex) boyfriend broke up with me last night too lmao. I just took my second dose 50 minutes ago, so we’ll see, but I am tapering off of Vyvanse now as well so idk if that affects it. I am pretty scared for weight gain..but I do tend to have BED more than all the other ED’s, so I’m hoping it might have the opposite effect, but I may be asking for too much lol",False,False

It's honestly shocking to me how common this has become - it seems like every other psydoc is riding Seroquel's dick right now - given the array of common side effects. Including weight gain. Like major weight gain.   Remeron is also a prime offender for weight gain (similar to anti-psychotics, I'd be shocked if they suggested a tetracyclic to you as a first-line treatment, but just in case).",False,False

I could barely force myself to eat on wellbutrin and I lost 40lbs on abilify. Prozac and zoloft had no effect on my weight at all. I gained 35 on cymbalta but I was also a student at the time and I'd faint if there wasnt something always in my stomach.",False,False

I was on paroxetine (paxil) for years and the weight gain was insane. I got put on vyvanse to combat some of the weight gain and it made my ED sooo much worse.   About 6 months later I got referred to an ED clinic and they took me off everything, and put me in fluoxetine (prozac) it’s also specifically used to treat bulimia so win win. Haven’t had any weight gain with it, I don’t think it’s as effective for the anxiety, I still have panic attacks, but overall i’m in a better state mentally.  Best advice, talk to your doctor about the side effects of what they want to prescribe and ask about alternatives",False,False

Sometimes antidepressants suppress appetite, but the same ones can stimulate appetite for certain people. Lexapro made me extremely hungry, Wellbutrin made me crazy but didn’t affect appetite much.   If you’re monitoring calorie intake to make sure you’re eating healthy, but still feel hungry, my recommendation is always taking an insoluble fiber (psyllium) supplement with at least 16 ounces of water. It expands in your stomach and makes you feel full so you won’t be as tempted to overeat. You can do this whenever you typically feel hungry (me it’s at night, but some people plan to take it an hour before a meal, etc.) and it might make things more bearable!",False,False
