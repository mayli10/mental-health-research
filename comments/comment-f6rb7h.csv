And tbh? Becoming overweight or especially fat (which is usually closer to obese?) probably isn‚Äôt the goal of recovery anyway. Becoming a healthy stable weight (someday) is a much better goal for either end of the spectrum.",False,False

I believe in worth at all weights/physiques, bc obviously on both sides of the spectrum there are unhealthy bodies but honestly whatever makes them happy. So anyone can do whatever tbh, my clown brain just has a thing with food and control and The Skinni for me.  So you're not fat phobic! Most people with eds aren't tbh, and if anyone says you are bc you have an ed they are severely uneducated/close minded oops",False,False
