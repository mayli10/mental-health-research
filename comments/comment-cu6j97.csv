I think I like my new therapist so far but I haven't mentioned my ED, and during the screening I mentioned I often get stuck in habits, like if I have something to eat I might eat only that for the next week.   She said ""oh, good, that answers my next question about if your appetite is normal! Well it's good that that is unaffected! :) ""   I didn't correct her, but it was like... I never said anything about how much of the food I eat. Sometimes I will find one low cal food and only eat that for a week and drop weight because it is barely anything. Sometimes I find a food that is way too indulgent to eat more than every so often but I do anyway, because I have started to stress eat/emotional eat and I decide it tastes good.    It just annoyed me that I mentioned getting stuck on eating the same food for a week and her takeaway was that I eat a normal amount of it.",False,False
