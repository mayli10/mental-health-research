Include your flight details and maybe a brief description of the attendant if you can't remember his name. He didn't give you a choice in whether you got breakfast or not, probably because you already paid for it with the ticket so he just handed it to you regardless, so he doesn't get a say in whether you're being wasteful or not.  There are SO many reasons why someone wouldn't want to or even be able to eat a meal on a plane, one of them being... um... flight sickness, anyone...? It's not appropriate to scold people for being ""wasteful"" when he has no idea why they aren't or can't eat it. I'm not normally the ""let me see your manager"" type of person but I think this is something you should escalate.",False,False

That food was included in your plane ticket so whether you ate it or not makes no difference and it's certainly none of this flight attendant:s business (plus they don't even know if you had some kind of allergy or something?? Like??). Don't allow a judgemental asshole (who was probably just tired after a long day of work and wanted to take it out on someone) to ruin your day,False,False
