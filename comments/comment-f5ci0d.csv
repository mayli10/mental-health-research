I recently bought one of those Systema bento box style containers for when I'm away from home and I have no idea what to fill the smaller non-sandwich compartments with.

Goes well with fruits, nut butter, cocoa, dairy, etc  Lunch:  - sandwiches are great haha! Tuna, cheese, tomatoes, cucumbers, chicken, avocado, loads of possibilities. You could also switch the bread for things like pita pockets. - personally love fried rice because it’s pretty simple to make. You can pre-cook and freeze batches of rice, then cook it with eggs/carrots/peas/chicken/anchovies/anything goes, really  - pasta! I make “bolognese” by mashing up loads of tomatoes and adding beef/onions/etc. You can make a big batch of that when you have time, then save it for later. So all you’ll need to do boil the pasta and just pour some of the sauce/meat over and add cheese if you want.",False,False
