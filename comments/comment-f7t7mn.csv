He'll say that he is doing something, then just not. Like, he didn't shampoo his hair for months before.   I honestly don't know where my health is at, I've only recently been angry enough at myself and my weight to start dieting/developing an ED maybe, I just can't stand to see any more weight on myself. I might take you up on that offer though, I appreciate it.",False,False

My brother is autistic and on ant psychosis pills, and he eats insanely. He's obese, and works at a dining hall at my university. He eats a ton at home, and lies about what he eats when he's at work. It's impossible to get through to him about his lifestyle.  Very strong TW, I didn't know I'd get like this until I wrote it.  &gt;!Talking to his boss (reasons unrelated to him, but he came up in convo since we're brothers), he apparently has a milkshake every day. A healthy lunch for him is a chicken Cesar salad. He's always eating, like the first thing he asks in the morning and the first thing he asks when he's home from work is ""What are we eating?"" .  I grew up with a beer bellied overeating dad who laughed about how much he ate because my mom was such a good cook, got mocked when I ate too much, and learned a ton of bad habits w/food because of it. It just makes me mad that I never learned about eating properly, since now everyone in my direct family is fat. I'm realizing this and trying to drop, I look the healthiest atm which I think matters more than weight, I just hate fat. I don't necessarily dream about being skinny, I just wanna have no fat, regardless of how much muscle I have.  But it's extra annoying because my bro made a sort of sinkage in the couch, where you feel the sofa sink. If he wants to get in the kitchen and I'm leaving, I feel his nipples/belly brush up against me because he's so huge, and it's gross. It makes me want to not eat even more rn. It's annoying because he'll claim he's trying to drop but I'll know he keeps having milkshakes at work and whatnot. And he'll just scream at you if you bring it up.!&lt;",False,False

In high school, a new girl joined a group of ... acquaintances I had? I dunno, friends but not close friends. And we had the same first name. I was v smol in HS, but she was shorter. So they called her ""Little Mary"" and me ""Big Mary"". (*Not actual name.)
