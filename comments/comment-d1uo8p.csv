Do you think chewing a lot of sugar-free gum could have this effect? Or is it only relevant for actual sugar substitutes?,False,False

At the time my prof had cited a paper about aspartame, but currently I can‚Äôt find it. I[ did find this other review suggesting aspartame doesn‚Äôt significantly change microbiome composition though](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6363527/) . Science is ideally a dialectical process, we have theories and test them and sometimes our experiment validates our theory and someone else‚Äôs refutes the theory and you‚Äôre sort of back to ground zero",False,False

Which sucks but apparently in some studies they see this change in like, three weeks of consistently eating the same sugar substitute (but that may be an effect of the substitute being used, like aspartame vs steviol vs erythritol). The natural flora is a highly transient thing and changes due to many factors (stress, diet, illness etc) so it‚Äôs not like you gotta cut out all sugar substitutes forever, but it‚Äôs best to not rely too much on them   (that and you can do a cleanse of sorts with heavily fermented foods, but I don‚Äôt even know if that will work. Just, like, in theory.?)",False,False

My body is definitely using up non-essential proteins ‚Äòcause my hair has been falling out in huge amounts lately, my nails are extremely brittle, and my skin has started breaking out when it never used to.
