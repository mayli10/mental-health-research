Eating 5 200 cal ""meals"" feels a lot more filling than 2 500 cal or 3 350 cal.  I hope you can start to feel more in control soon, I know nothing hurts more than that panic of thinking you've messed everything up.",False,False

At least you stick to your limit twice, that is already so much better than not at all! Also, January is still 21 days long, enough time to get back on track and feel better. I know it feels terrible to not be able to stop binging and it feels like you'll never be able to eat nirmally/diet again but it will get better, I promise ❤ Maybe your cal limit is a bit too low or your diet too restrictive? Try to give  yourself a break for a while and I usually find when I try to stop worrying as much ,I diet so much better and can stop binging. Stay safe, love ❤",False,False
