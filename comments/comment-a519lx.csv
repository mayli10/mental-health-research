I will admit that I've been trying to open up more about my issues so that's probably helped. Are your friends more talkative when you hang out? My best friend never talks to me by text but she's the opposite in person.,False,False

I feel like every friendship I have is so one sided, I’m always the one making plans and talking to them first. ",False,True

Even my doctor takes me more seriously.   My grandparents are so more interested in me, if I ever see them at an event, my grandmother makes someone make space for me and asks me to sit down- this never happened before.  Also, personal shoppers are much nicer than before.",False,False

People are a lot more aggressive about trying to persuade you to eat. No one thinks your jokes about losing weight are funny anymore. People feel like they're entitled to talk about how you look and your food choices.,False,False

And I still have this disconnect where I feel like I don't deserve to have friends and stuff when I'm not skinny like I used to be. But I think it's mostly paranoia, at least in my case. I mean, when I see a friend /relative for the first time in awhile and they've gained weight I don't think of them any differently.  ",False,False
