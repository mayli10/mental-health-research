I don't know why you are being downvoted. Disordered eating behavior logic isn't normal logic and it's important that people understand that, especially here where most subscribers have eating disorders.  If you absolutely want a way to rationalise eating enough, there's many decades after the surgery to make yourself unhealthily small and now's not the time for that.",False,False

Hold you for observation till medically cleared( you might be on the hook money wise for that. Could get very expensive depending on insurance and reason) I thought that was started in the original question-Fear of it being cancelled or postponed in relation to bmi or any complicating factor whether it be bmi, rhr, low o2, blood pressure, glucose levels or failure to follow to prescribed to presurgery directions (fasting and time length) Anesthesia is risky on a healthy individual it's just a law suit waiting to happen for hospital if they don't think you're good to go.",False,False
