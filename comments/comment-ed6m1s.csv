I altered a cardigan I really like to be bigger because I already feel like I can burst out of it like the Hulk. I removed the buttons and added corset-like lacing which lets me wear it without completely closing it. I used the button holes as holes for the lace on one side. On the other side, I simply cut new holes, and it didn't look weird, because the cardigan has a distressed/frayed style. I think it actually looks cooler than originally.   A dress I thought would get too small for me quickly didn't. The problem was the awful zipper, not the size of the dress. It was hard to zip up even at my lowest weight. I replaced the zipper and now it zips up like a dream.",False,False

I haven't. I don't want to go.  The games they play are too fast paced and loud and send me into panic mode. It's hard to participate and I stand out too much if I don't.  But it will make my boyfriend happy if I go... And his mom got me the gift I wanted (donation to Lil Bub's Big Fund) instead of just asking and ignoring it like last year... I would be an asshole if I don't go.,False,False
