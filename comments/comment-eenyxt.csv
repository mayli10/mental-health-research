I get that and definitely can relate. I used to only have one time things with women because that wasn’t as bad as them seeing me more often and me having to face the reality of them knowing what I look like. But it turns out, the more someone likes you, the more they’ll think you’re hot. Of course, with that a lot of other fears and issues come up but eh, that’s another topic lol.   I’m sorry you’ve had a partner who encouraged your ED! That’s awful and you don’t deserve that.  You’re worthy of love and obviously I’m not the best person to give advice but I’m rooting for you ❤️",False,True

She’s uhhh not happy. But tbf we’ve been together nearly 3 years, living together for 18 months so she’s seen me drop nearly 60lbs.

Also the not in recovery but not not in it- part...relatable.   I‘m still struggling with eating regularly so I can’t let myself slip up and not eat at scheduled times, but when we first started dating we both forgot (genuinely forgot) to eat a lot and sometimes spent the entire weekend together and had like one meal that consisted of a slice of bread and some vegetables at the end of the day. She cooked for me a lot when she got home earlier than me but she only ate such small servings that I often ate before I got there, because I didn’t want to feel bad. Which lead to feeling guilty because I ate more than 3 times per day etc.    Does your girlfriend know you’ve had/have an ED? I never told any woman because I‘m afraid they’ll start controlling me and I’m not ~that~ committed to recovery yet :/",False,True

Every girlfriend I’ve ever had I’ve compared myself too and I’m a lesbian who’s only ever dated women (seriously. I had one boyfriend for 6 days when I was 15 lol) so it’s hard.   My current girlfriend weighs more than me, not much but a few lbs, and is shorter so tbh it makes it easier. I have trouble dating girls thinner than me.   I still compare our eating habits though, she’s very much the same in that she just....forgets to eat sometimes. Like, genuinely forgets and isn’t thinking if food 24/7. She eats relatively healthily and just eat what she wants when she wants without overthinking it. So she maintains a healthy weight. It’s wild to me. I’ve tried to model my eating around here but I find it hard bc I’m food obsessed, even in recovery.",False,False
