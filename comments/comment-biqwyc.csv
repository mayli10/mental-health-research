The lower standards comment refers to men flocking to women with big tits/ass who appear to have had sex before in their lives. Playboy model types. The easiest thing to jerk off to. Fodder for 12-year-olds. I don’t get the thick comment? I’ve always thought thick meant the higher half of healthy BMI.  The lying refers to his experience with men saying to women’s faces they like thicker girls but only talk about thin girls in the locker room.  He doesn’t tell me this to motivate me to stay underweight (and frankly it actually alienates me); he tells me it to keep me safe. The context of these convos is usually him being paranoid about a guy leering over me, me denying it has anything to do with me due to my body type (small tit pear), and him explaining “the way the world works” based on his experience working in a primarily testosterone-charged field.  I disagree with him but my disagreement is built on ideas and his is built on direct experience.  I know there are men in this sub who probably hate the men are trash talk that happens a lot here. I honestly thought it went without saying that “men are trash” doesn’t actually mean every man on the planet is trash, but that the way men are taught to interact with society is trash.",False,False
