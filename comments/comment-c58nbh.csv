When I went into ED treatment, everyone was smaller than me and it triggered me beyond belief. I vowed that after treatment, I would relapse in order to look like them, and that the clinicians' jaws would drop after seeing how much lighter I was if I were to be forced back into treatment. I talk to a girl from treatment, and I tell her about how I feel like a ""failed anorexic"". I don't think I am physically or mentally ill, and she agrees with the physically part and even admits that I wasn't nearly as thin as the other girls. (goes to show how a girl with a BMI of 19 was fatter than everyone else). I haven't told her, but I see her as an inspo in order to get worse. All I want is to be sick again, I miss it. It bothers me when someone tells me I ""don't look like [ I ] have an eating disorder"" since I don't sick and skinny like she does. I really want to lose a shit ton of weight and for her to see me... so I completely understand where you are coming from. I just don't wish ED's or worsening ED's onto other people. I'm sorry you feel this way though, and I would suggest you see another therapist who you can trust in order to recover. &lt;3 xx",False,False
