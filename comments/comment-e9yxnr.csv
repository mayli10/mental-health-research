I wish I could give you a hug and tell you it’ll be ok. I am on the same boat, I’ve been with my fiancée for almost 5 years and when we met I was 160 and I’m almost 100lbs heavier. I’m 5’10” so I don’t look HUGE but as a person who’s struggled with weight and managing my PCOS all of their adolescent/adult life, I’m 30, I still struggle with wanting to starve myself or occasional slip and binge and purge. I’m also a nanny which makes it super hard to keep myself in check because I take to food when I’m stressed or emotional.   I’ve started doing IF (eating btwn 12pm and 8pm) a month ago on a journey to truly lose and keep the maintain weight loss. We plan on getting married next fall (10 months away) and I want to look my best but also feel healthy and strong. I’ve started east, eating no more than 1200 cals a day, doing mostly brisk walking and just portioning out my meals. I started at 266 11/9 and weighed in at 257 on 12/7. Both times right before my period, so I tell myself I’m probably retaining a little more water than usual.   It’s fucking hard to not just quit and give in. My PCOS is out of control, I think it’s causing my hair to thin soo fucking bad which causes stress on top of stress of caring for a 6 month old 50 hours a week while living in NYC. The weight loss is so fucking slow but it’s worth it, I’m trying to commit to losing it the right way. For me what scared me is that my OBGYN told me if I done get this under control (best way to manage PCOS is via weight loss) I could end up struggling to conceive, inherit diabetes (which my mom has and a lot of extended family), it could lead to other issues like ovarian cancer etc. That shocked me real good.   Anyway, sorry this turned into a rant. Please msg if you need a person to chat with, I know it’s hard but you are strong, don’t let ED dictate YOUR life. Take a breath, change some habits and start slow. You’ll see some progress!",False,False
