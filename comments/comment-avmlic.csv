Just let him know that you don't feel comfortable, you're not a doctor or dietitian. Tell him you'll support him or help him eat healthy foods but you don't feel comfortable giving actual advice!",False,False

But tbh, this might sound dumb, I don’t wanna introduce him to reddit cuz he already has a bunch of harmful, messed up ideas... and reddit is unfortunately a breeding ground for weirdos it seems... plus I don’t think he’d get it. Thank you for the advice though!",False,True

And once they have made that healthy change try another like instead of having two pieces of toast, have one. Stick to things that are well known for health such as increasing protein for fullness and vegetables for fibre. And emphasise making the new habits sustainable. Best of luck!",False,False

Say you've been counting, don't say how much (to cover yourself, just lie and say 1200 or 1400 or something) If he's an overweight man somewhere around 1800(? not sure i'm not an expert even 2000 might be fine) is probably good for him. Tell him oils/dressings/sauce is usually high in calories and would be good/easiest to cut out.   You don't have to fess your struggles to give him advice, if he needs to lose weight to live a healthier life it's good that he's asking.  Hope it all works out !",False,False
