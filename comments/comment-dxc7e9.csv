This is the sort of thing I try to explain to my doctor or whoever and they don't understand how I can be absolutely totally aware of the reality of things but still make skewed choices.   Yes, I know that if I only eat yoghurt then I won't get all the nutrition I need. Yes, I know that drinking caffeine without food will heighten my anxiety. No, actually I need to correct you there, it is possible for humans to survive for more than 5 days without food.  Is any of this knowledge going to make me rational? Sure ain't missy.   It ain't what you know, it's who... the actual fuck is in control of my choices because it sure as hell isn't me, you know!",False,False

Much like regular vaping, it probably isn’t safe. Also you probably won’t absorb the vitamins through this method.   Isn’t it amazing how I’ll put anything into my body BUT food?",False,True
