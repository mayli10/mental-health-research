You do not want to spend your college years subsumed in an eating disorder. It’s really important that you are noticing the red flags now. I get that the college environment is super conducive to disordered eating but if you can get help please please try. There’s so much to learn, so many people to meet, so many ways for you to grow in a really meaningful way and succeed. Please give yourself a shot to make the most of these years. My biggest regret is not reaching out for help my freshman year and now I feel like I essentially lost so many opportunities. Also wishing you the best XX",False,False

If you're worried about not having lunch, it might help to stock up on snacks or food you can just take to grab and go, no refrigeration required. Granola bars, fruit, etc to just snack on while walking between classes. Try to keep the snacks on you all day, if you have them you'll be more likely to eat. I wish I had better suggestions but you should look up other options. I also have had semesters where I didn't leave time to eat during the day, and people would make comments about me looking unwell. It sucked. I hope you're able to figure something out so you're able to have energy to have fun in your college years. Also, I'd recommend checking to see if your college offers counseling or disordered eating specialists. Often, colleges/universities recognize that students suffer from mental health issues and try to help. I wish you the best",False,False
