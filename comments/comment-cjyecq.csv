I did this with my mom to make her stop talking to me about Donald Trump.  Tell her explicitly that you don't want to hear her opinions anymore about anyone's food  or body, including yours or her own, and that you will need to end the conversation if she can't respect that.  Then, when she inevitably starts doing it, tell her (very politely and respectfully), ""I'm sorry grandma, but I need to end the conversation if you're going to talk about food and bodies,"" and if she doesn't immediately change the topic, you do have to follow through and say, ""Okay grandma, I'm going to hang up now.  I love you and we'll talk another time.""  And then hang up (or walk out of the room).  It *will* be uncomfortable the first couple of times you do it, but she's an old lady and there's probably not any way to get her to change that won't involve some mild discomfort and strong boundary-setting on your part.  Once you've conditioned her to realize that you *will* end a conversation if she brings up those topics, she won't bring them up anymore, or at least she'll probably bring them up less, and change the topic when reminded of the consequence.  Everyone understands consequences, even if they don't understand mental illness.",False,False
