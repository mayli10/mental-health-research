I definitely struggle with the 'never learned how to love how something looks on me' but on others; beautiful. I don't think I have them?? Or if I do I still have a lot of chub on me to hide them pretty well. (I think I just have a wide pelvis),False,False

It used to bother me espexia when I would try to draw (my whole family draws/does art so we are all very visually concerned) because I realized I'd never seen a subject depicted with hip dips. Then it occurred to me that I just don't have the kind of body that people usually draw--probably because it's just harder to draw! So I started giving all of my characters hip dips and now I feel a little better about it. Also, I noticed a lot of men have hip dips and idk...something about being slightly more boyish kinda makes me happy. A lot of my ED is focused on gender conformity but when I started to embrace my queerness and tomboyishness it started to like them more and more. Idk, basically what I'm saying is anything that you can't change can turn into something you kinda like.",False,False

My hip dips are exactly where my jeans or pants usually end so I have this bulge above it that looks like such a bad muffin top I hate it but the only way I mostly got rid of it was to go down to a low bmi which I haven‚Äôt been that weight for a very long time due to struggling with binge eating :/,False,False
