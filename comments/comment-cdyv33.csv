Try not to think about it in terms of net TDEE. Try to think of it in terms of deficits. If I fast all day my deficit is 3000 kcal. That's not good considering you would hate to look the way i do to ""earn' that TDEE.",False,False

Because eating that much feels Like nothing and I could easily eat like 4-6 thousand a day if I ate just based on hunger,False,False
