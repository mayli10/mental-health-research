Even though I'm still mostly eating at maintenance/a little over most days (2k and up) I'm actually still losing ever so slightly, I guess my TDEE is going up? I've probably just jinxed it by writing it lol",False,False

I eat 1700 a day and I'm trying for 2000 on the weekends so I can try to maintain because I'm scared to lose much more weight.

It all depends on perspective and BMR what you'd consider low/high. My BMR is like 1600 and I work a sedentary job, so 1,200 feels like a lot to me.

I rarely go under this. My goal is to have at least 800 calories of a deficit a day. I also try not to fast because it messes things up.   I count my weight lifting into my daily caloric needs but not my running so I probably really eat a deficit of 1,000-1,200 2 days a week.",False,False
