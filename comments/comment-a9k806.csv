I dated a guy who followed a really strict diet because of his autoimmune disorder. He strongly related to my eating disorder tendencies.   From dating him, I realized that a lot of his tendencies were fear based rather than illness based. It makes me wonder whether he should have been challenging himself more? And the problem with autoimmune and digestive disorders are that there aren’t a lot of doctors that specialize in them. I’d find a really great doctor and trust them.",False,False
