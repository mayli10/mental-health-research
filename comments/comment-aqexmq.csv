I used to drink something with Lactulose in it before this and that worked just as well. So I'd recommend going to a pharmacy and getting something over the counter?  Make sure you stay suuuuuper hydrated though, the Paraffin helps so you don't have to be all ""RIP anus"".  Do you have any intestinal triggers you can think of? For me, it's my second cup of coffee (black obviously, with the tiniest bit of honey) or looking at stationery or pictures of people being productive/study desks/coffee+computers üòÇ  ",False,False

I used to work for a doctor and that was always the first line of defense against stubborn constipation.   Miralax isn't a laxative and isn't habit-forming. It draws water in to your colon to keep stool soft so it can move freely through your system. You can buy it at any drug store and start with one cap full once a day dissolved in any liquid. Be sure to drink lots of water throughout the day. You should have a bowel movement within 3 days. If you don't have a bowel movement by the 4th day of using Miralax, you should be seen by a Dr to rule out an obstruction or fecal compaction.",False,False

You can go for that. Coffee *might* work but only if your body hasn't already grown accustomed to it.   But really, I recommend buying a bottle of prune juice, eating something with substance and waiting it out. It may work. Not right away, perhaps, but possibly overnight.",False,False

The summary is: psyllium husk adds ‚Äúbulk‚Äù which helps keep you regular, but what you need in this case is added water in the digestive tract. When stuff sits in there too long, it dries out, gets stuck, and won‚Äôt move easily. Calcium magnesium supplements pull water into the digestive tract. So do stool softeners. I usually do 2 calcium magnesium at night when I‚Äôm having ‚Äútrouble‚Äù and when I wake up my problems are over. I add 1 stool softener if it‚Äôs a desperate situation. Make sure to drink lots of water so they have water to pull in. Stay hydrated throughout the day to help resolve and prevent.   The thing I wanted to add is that adding essential fatty acids to your diet can also help keep things gliding along‚Äîbut I know that‚Äôs easier said than done with an ED. I just recently worked up the courage to start putting a tablespoon of coconut oil on a piece of toast in the morning. I think my skin is more hydrated, too, since starting that ritual.

You can get them at any health food store near you or many grocery stores. When I need them, I take two before bed and they work by the morning. If I‚Äôm desperate, I add a stool softener capsule too.   The psyllium husk will be a good ‚Äúmaintenance‚Äù item but it likely won‚Äôt get things moving on its own.
