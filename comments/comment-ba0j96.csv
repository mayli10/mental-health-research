Don’t be too hard on yourself you are young. Your body is growing and changing. It’s gonna be a little awkward as it does but you are definitely not fat. And H&amp;M’s size is really weird. I’m a us sz 2 and any size from 2-8 is my H&amp;M size. They’re notorious for bad sizing. Go with a friend and have them help review dresses with you. Before your special events if you want to temporarily slim down you can cut out processed food, carbs, sodium, and dark leafy greens. Drink plenty of water. Then make your own body wrap to lose a couple inches. They have tutorials online of the popular spa treatment. It’s very temporary but the 1-4 inches lost throughout your body can help a lot with confidence:) ",False,False

You do what you can, but remember you're still young. Your body is still growing and NEEDS nutrients to grow. Take care of yourself, yes you can restrict to try and lose weight, but make sure you're still eating healthy foods. Being a low weight by your birthday may sound ideal, but you want to make sure you can have more birthdays in the future!   I can go on about how you really should eat, but I know that isn't incredibly helpful. Just know you're probably your own worst critic for your body and try to be gentle with yourself. If you don't lose the all weight that doesn't make you less of a person or a failure. 15 lbs is a lot to lose in 3 weeks. ",False,False

I’ve seen you post before and you’re still so young - please just try to enjoy your special day &lt;333 ",False,False
