Honestly, ya I had to eat a ton of meals at the hospital when I did day hospital, and the food was gross.   I definitely know that IP is not a goal or something I really want to do logically, but for some reason it's like I'm not sick enough if I don't. So confusing! Even 2 months in day hospital and I was so done",False,True

You're also not a failure for only being there a short time, and trust me, with the food at some places it's tastier to weight restore in the community. Not everyone with an eating disorder goes IP or has a long stay and that's okay. Trust me, a short stay is preferable.",False,False
