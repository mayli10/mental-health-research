Low sodium (still get your electrolytes though because I had problems with that for about a year a few months ago). Light workouts will make you FEEL better about yourself (in my experience). Take your vitamins; it’ll make you look and this is probably the placebo effect but also will probably help you feel better. Just enjoy yourself and my therapist said an easy way to not think about food so much is to plan ahead so on the day you’ll know to just stick to the plan and you’ll be alright. Hope you have lots of fun!",False,False
