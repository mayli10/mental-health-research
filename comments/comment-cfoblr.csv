It’s so important to remember that this period won’t define you! It’s incredibly hard to experience a backwards slide, especially after feeling secure in recovery for so long. Life happens and we cope as best we can - and sometimes our “best” isn’t all that great. But one relapsey day in a sea of great days doesn’t cancel out the amazing work you’ve put in!   Be kind to yourself - this is a terribly difficult moment in your life. Keep doing your very best, we’re cheering for you ♥️",False,False
