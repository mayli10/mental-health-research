Not only was it dangerous for my body and brain, but it was ultimately totally ineffective at controlling my pain. Some things did work a little for awhile. But all of it failed in the end ‚Äî After losing my freedom to hospital stays and group homes. After losing the career I worked so so hard to prepare for. After years of desperate pain and hopelessness. In the end, my ways of dealing all failed. I‚Äôm so lucky that in the 11th hour I found the willingness to reach out for help and to keep asking until I found help that worked for me.   I‚Äôd urge you to reach out for help in whatever way you feel able. A parent, a teacher, a mental health professional, a crisis line or text. Life doesn‚Äôt have to be this hard. I know it can be scary to open up about stuff, but in my experience it‚Äôs very worth it. I truly hope you don‚Äôt live my 2 decades of hell &lt;3 There is help and hope out there right now. Wishing you peace.",False,False

We need a certain amount of calories just to EXIST. like in a coma. If you‚Äôre operating on a 1500 calorie deficit, shits gonna get real bad real quick.

Unlike a lot of the other forms, this shit *sticks* and is *long-term*. This is not ‚Äúrelief from life‚Äù pain. This is not ‚ÄúI hate myself so I must punish myself‚Äù pain. This is permanent and unhealthy beyond what someone needs to put themselves through.   I‚Äôm not going to get into some lengthy thing because you‚Äôve gotten more advice and help than I honestly can give on top of it all. I‚Äôd just be parroting what you already know.
