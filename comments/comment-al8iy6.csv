Unhealthy food and diet food are rampant and heavily advertised. It's pretty normal to overeat on a daily basis and then go on a diet. It's normal to want to lose weight all the time and not have a healthy relationship with food. It's normal for actresses to be slightly underweight, so that's obviously a desirable body type. All this frustrates me to no end, because I can't see myself being recovered while living in a world like this. [inb4](https://i.imgflip.com/2b7c8v.jpg)",False,False

So I stood up for myself and said that my ED has more symptoms than starving myself. Even the thinnest AN in the room agreed that the hyper focus on restriction makes it feel dirty to talk about binging, purging, lax use and anything else that isn‚Äôt the delicate waif narrative. The next class we had on nutrition, the RD brought handouts of how purging affects the body. Small win but I‚Äôll take it considering that was the billionth month I‚Äôd spent in resi over 6 years and basically the first time any of the trained professionals acknowledged anything other than restriction as a symptom in group therapy.   Treatment always made me feel jealous and competitive but this couple of weeks I spent with these women who actually all admitted to other symptoms beside restriction was wholesome af and made us closer and able to support each other. It made me feel 76% less disgusted with myself too considering I‚Äôd been weight restored for a few years and constantly thought that there was something *wrong* with how I did my ED that it involved anything other than super low restriction.   I think on reddit since we have anonymity it‚Äôs more common to see people sharing their other symptoms. But like wtf is it with treatment centers only giving focus to restrictive behaviors????
