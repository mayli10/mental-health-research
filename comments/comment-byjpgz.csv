I’ve noticed that my Fitbit over-counts my steps for the day, could it have something to do with that? I’ve heard of people lowering their height by 2 inches to get a more accurate calorie estimate too",False,False

I lifted weights strenuously , and cycled to the gym and back strenuously. I was also heavily stimulated so perhaps that was it, since my HR seems high at rest.",False,True
eqk32nh,t3_byjpgz,t3_byjpgz,usernameblahhhhh,1,2019-06-09 16:22:47,/r/EDAnonymous/comments/byjpgz/finally_bought_a_fitbit_how_accurate_is_the/eqk32nh/,Mine is so inaccurate I don’t even bother to look at it. It tells me I burn 25-2700 calories a day but years of tracking my daily calories and weight loss tell me my TDEE is actually 1725-1775. If Fitbit were accurate I would have died a long time ago lol,False,False

It also calculates calorie burn using your heartrate, so if your heartrate was higher than usual from caffeine and anxiety, then it might measure your calorie burn a bit higher than usual. But it's probably pretty accurate if you were doing heavy exercise for all of those 2 hours.",False,False

Keep in mind that it adds your TDEE into your calorie burn, so you probably didn’t burn 1000 calories just from running.",False,False
