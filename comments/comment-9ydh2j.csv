This is beautiful.  &amp;#x200B;  I've been a b/p-er for almost a year now, and I am  finally climbing out of the darkness (I went from doing it up to 5 times per DAY to having maybe one lapse per week now). What worked for me was aspiring to be one of the girls who were doing more healthy ""high restriction"" on proED, which leads to less binges and is more sustainable overall.   &amp;#x200B;  My therapist also told me that in studies, only 50% of calories at most are actually purged, which shocked me because i would eat thousands of calories in a sitting. It's wayyyy too easy to go from having one purge, and getting the satisfaction of seeing the food come up, to doing it on a consistent basis, to purposely buying big quantities of food to binge on and getting trapped in the cycle. &lt;3 stay strong everyone!!",False,False

Sometimes I binge until I'm painfully full and think about how easy it would be to lean over a toilet and get rid of it all. At the very least my stomach wouldn't hurt anymore.   But b/ping is one of the few things people ALWAYS say they wish they hadn't started. ,False,False

Mostly because i would restrict as much as i could during the day but i lived with my dad and brother so id come home to a homecooked dinner (i am always grateful that my parents cooked for me and taught me to cook) that was usually delicious so if i couldnt avoid dinner altogether id just eat until i was full then go purge it in the shower.    I was still able to enjoy my dads cooking but without facing the consequences of weight gain when i lost control. Unfortunately after purging id get hungry again later because it leaves you with that empty feeling so id eat cereal or dessert or something and maybe even purge that too. So that was the first issue.    It also resulted in our pipes getting blocked up with chunks of food and my parents had to spend thousands getting it dealt with. The plumber and my dad thought it was from food going down the sink (garbage disposals arent really a thing where i live) but Im convinced it was from my purging.     I also pretty much permanently had cracks on either side of my mouth like the joker that hurt when they came into contact with anything citric, and marks on my fore and middle knuckles from coming into contact with my teeth.     Speaking of teeth, i was always lucky growing up, never needed braces, and only ever getting like one cavity when i was older. Stupid me obviously ruined that by fucking up my enamel with stomach acid and i didnt know about aftercare, so i needed a bunch of fillings and a root canal which was another big chunk of money for my poor parents, and myself later on down the track. Tbh my teeth actually held up okay considering the abuse, ive heard much worse stories.     Oh my disordered ways also resulted in me losing a friendship because i triggered one of my friends into feeling insecure about her weight because i was so small and still throwing up all my meals so she started doing it too and hated that, making it hard for her to be friends with me. I had no idea of this and wondered why she was being so cold to me until she cracked and pulled my closest friend at the time away privately and told her, making it strained between her and I. She also told the school counsellor so i had to go through that old song and dance too.  I was angry at the time but what I considered ""bad habits"" was like this elephant in the room for my friends group.     I became really good at strategic spews when drinking or doing drugs so i would frequently drink until my body was like nah, have a super clean and efficent tac-vom and keep going (because god forbid i take the nausea as a sign that i should maybe stop lol) and was able to vomit hands free. I recovered and stopped purging for many years and although it would make the occasional reappearance it would be like a once off if i accidentally over ate.     Lately ive purged a few times, and although i try to be cautious with aftercare -not making it a habit, not fully emptying my stomach, -even after relapsing once, i can feel the acid reflux happening, the food kind of sitting there if i eat a big meal, like its in my throat, waiting to come out if i just tilt over. Almost a decade later, same bullshit. Then the next day i wake up and my throats sore, my stomach aches and i cant tell if its my actual stomach or my abs aching from contracting and one of those bloody cracks has appeared in the corner of my mouth. I think to myself, did it always feel like this after and i just forgot or does it just feel a bit worse cause im older?     Anyway OP, if you ever need more reason not to B/p, feel free to refer to my mini essay here. Nothin glamourous about it    ",False,False

I had never been a purger and never been that tempted... but in recovery I suddenly was hit REALLY strongly by a desire to purge becuase I was just so fucking full. i did not allow myself to do it because of Pro-ED friends who convinced me it's something you cannot really go back on. ,False,False

A month ago I got sick after a party and threw up 11 times over two days, and barely ate anything for 3... all I could think about was how satisfying it was to see the party food being thrown up and how big the deficit must be.. the next few days I was extremely tempted to try to purge my food deliberately but the stories of the b/p side effects stopped me in the end.

EDs are very stigmatized and isolating illnesses, so having a space where people can relate to you and make you feel less alone is an amazing thing to have (and likewise, a devastating thing to lose).

For me, proEDmemes used to help immensely.  When I was stressed out, in pain, feeling worthless and isolated and alone, feeling like a failure, unworthy of love, unlovable and so on... I would just go there and let myself get lost in the memes for some time. I laughed and I cried and I felt better. I can't take my mind off of my eating disorder completely, distractions won't help. But that place offered me a way to take my mind off the pain at least. When browsing it, I didn't get the anxiety of using a distraction (will it help? Will it fail and then I'll feel like even more of a failure?).   I stopped purging for a long time after finding proEDmemes and relapsed the day it was banned. I've been purging since.

Yes, you will get to eat vast quantities of ""tasty"" food, but it will stop tasting good and you will keep eating it and it will hurt.

But then you forget how bad the purge hurts and you can only think about the food and then next time you'll have the chance to B/P. It's honestly so addictive.
