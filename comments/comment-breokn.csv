Tumblr was a real safe space for so many of us but they just donâ€™t want the responsibility of having a platform that could influence people unhealthfully. Like I get it but they should have prided themselves on being essentially boundary free  while continuing to provide resources (which they definitely did) if their algorithm found someone who may need help.   RIP tumblr :(,False,False
