I would have interpreted his comment similarly to you, but as an outsider, it's easier to reflect on what people probably mean when they try to compliment someone with an ED. I ended up bringing up my concerns to my boyfriend, and he really reassured me; I hope that your boyfriend can do the same for you.",False,True

It inspired me to talk with my boyfriend, and he really reassured me. I ended up searching up some TED talks and sent them to him. He told me that he struggles with what to say, so you were right on with that",False,True

He said that his biggest priority is my health, but he knows I'm struggling and just wants me to know that he'll never find my body disgusting.   Thanks for your comment! It helped me see things more from his perspective",False,True

Your partner likely wants to help you love your body the way he does, and this is what he's come up with as a way to ""help."" He doesn't know any better, and that's pretty standard, but you probably have to take him by the hand here and give him some alternatives that will help you. A lot of my body positivity comes from noticing how I feel about my partner's body (very very good) and *why* I like it: there's the specific physicality of it (I like some masculine markers like hair and strength), but over time that morphs into mostly loving his body because it's *his.* This is pretty common in longer term relationships, based on what I've heard from other friends/lovers; when bodies change (+/- like 10% min for a partner to actually notice in my experience), a good relationship will usually absorb the change without much complaint. If my partner notices a change in my body he asks me how I feel about it first ❤️",False,False

In reality, if he sees you very often (like 2 times a week or more) he probably cant see the difference because realistically another person cant see a 1 pound difference on another's body. I really hope this is the case, and that he can't tell that you have lost weight, and is trying to encourage you to stay at the weight you are.  Either way, you should tell him that you appreciate him trying to help, but those types of comments actually make it worse because even tho logically you know he's trying to encourage you to stay helpful, the disordered side of your brain tries to convince you that he is complimenting your weight loss and makes you want to continue.  I hope he is a supportive boyfriend who is simply misunderstanding what to say. Perhaps send him some TED talks about eating disorders. They usually focus on AN, but can still help a non-disordered person understand the mindset a little bit more.   I hope that helps you a bit. Good luck",False,False
