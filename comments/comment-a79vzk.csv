Cut the tag out of the pants if the number bothers you..and try to focus on what you are going to do so that this problem doesn’t get worse and gets better instead. Try to be logical instead of emotional about it. You did X that resulted in Y  Y makes you upset That’s alright , so let’s work on resolving Y in a controlled steady healthy manner.   Beating yourself up over it is totally understandable but it’s not going to help you at all dear  Channel that same frustrated energy into making a healthy / safe eating plan for the next week and maybe some excercises goals (realistic-achievable)   I know..I know we have all been there and it sucks so badly just remember everyday is a new day and you can turn this around...I promise  Just use that frustration in a positive way to guide you to healthier choices so that you don’t have to feel like this in the future xx   Might be worthwhile if you don’t have one to start a journal just tracking how you feel..I know I’d binge when stuff was turbulent emotionally plus journal can be a neat distraction (omg stickers!)   Wish you all the best ",False,False
