I whole heatedly agree that the steps and the approach suggested and encouraged by them are not something that is going to fundamentally help someone dealing with a single or several EDs.   For me, what has helped me in the past and is helping me now in my current recovery, is the fact that I, myself am solely responsible, powerful and accountable for my actions. For me, accepting that I am not fully responsible and in control of my decisions and actions, and I should rely on a higher power to take the wheel, is very unsettling, takes away any sense of personal responsibility and achievement I may experience.  As someone who is in recovery, and has stumbled along the way, praying to God did not work for (please, note that I am roman catholic) me. Fundamentally, what helped me in my recovery is the fact that I realized that I am in control of my actions and if I fail it is going to be because of something I did or didn't do. I am responsible for my health and my life and the decisions I make which is why it burns me up inside when people say that it's not your fault, you need to give yourself to a higher power and etc. because fundamentally, when you stumble it's not going to be you that failed, it's going to be you who is going to be accountable and etc.   No, damn it all to the deepest pits of Hades. I am responsible for my own actions, I am accountable for them. Yes, I will stumble and fall from time to time, but that doesn't mean I am going to continue lying to myself and saying that ""oh, no it's not my fault, there wasn't anything I could have done differently for the future and that some higher power will make it better"". I refuse to believe this, it's not going to get better until I get better, until I am accountable, until I take the rains.   Yes, I will have bad days where I will fall, but guess what I am going to learn from them and get right back up. I will not, state that I had no option or choice in the matter, no I will take accountability and personal responsibility without berating myself, shake the dust of my knees and continue my journey to where ever the set the destination. Because fundamentally, I don't need to make excuses, or lie to myself about how this isn't my fault. It's my life, my battles with E and D, and I will come out on top, because it will be something I accomplished myself.  Apologies if this came off as a mean rant or an attack to some people, it wasn't my intention, and in no way am I discounting that a closer relationship with God may help some people or the program can set some good fundamentals for people. It's just that from my own personal experience, until I got mad at myself and decided to take the rains of my life into my own hands, making myself accountable for my own actions I lost battle, over battle over battle.",False,False
