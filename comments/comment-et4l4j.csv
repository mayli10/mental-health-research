Pretty much everybody in the group looked completely normal and you wouldn‚Äôt have known any of them had an ed if you saw them walking down the street. Honestly the group feels like an in person version of this sub, it‚Äôs just a lot of talking shit out and supporting each other, it‚Äôs not as competitive as you‚Äôd think. Like I said this is just from my experience, but I think that if you‚Äôre in the right headspace and you find the right group it can be beneficial",False,False

It's a huge competition to be the smallest, the best, and it validates the disordered thinking. Especially when you see someone smaller, even if they're smaller than your goal weight.",False,False

If theyre bigger then I‚Äôd feel bad if they‚Äôre smaller then i feel I need to be better. When I started college and I went to the mental health center they asked me if I wanted to do the eating disorder group ‚Äúbecause its filled with girls just like you going thru the same things‚Äù and i was like um no thanks I cant see how that would end good, since I  would just compare myself to them.",False,False
