Worth googling, but I think it's ~30 minutes.   Taking your meds earlier the next day, and then working back to your normal time schedule over the next couple days works pretty well.   Every anti-depressant and mood stabilizer I have tried have affected me a little differently.  If appetite increase is something you are experiencing, just be honest with your doctor about how frustrating that symptom is for you to see what other options you can explore.  They might make different choices based on what side effects they have seen more often.  Being open and honest with your prescribing doctor is always a good idea!",False,False

I don't have experience with Wellbutrin personally, but I'm on Topamax for bipolar and that impacts my appetite (When I started receiving ED treatment they actually started to limit my dose on Topamax lmfao).",False,False
