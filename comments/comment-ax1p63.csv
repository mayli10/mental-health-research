It's a good thing, it makes us more resilient in terms of survival than if we had the latticework-type cell structures that males have.   In some women, it's very noticeable or in a typically visible spot. In others, it's less noticeable, or not noticeable at all, (or they airbrush it out).   I know how you feel, though. I've also noticed on some days I feel like my skin is more firm and tight, and some days I feel all jiggly and gross. No idea what causes that, but our bodies just change a lot on a day to day basis and it freaks me our, but it's normal.   A mix of weights and cardio is the best for toning up your skin (or, well, the muscle underneath it, making it appear more shapely).  But you're definitely not alone. Most women have cellulite, whether it's visible or not. It's just how our cells visually take the shape of how they're arranged. ",False,False

During my first recovery I went from 90 to 130 in like 4.5 months and my legs were huge and ripply gross gross gross . After I lost about 15 pounds it was gone. I wasn’t even doing much exercise just hiking, walking, and running a bit.  I’ve lost more since then and my legs are pretty free of cellulite.",False,False
