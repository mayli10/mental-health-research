For all we know he could be otherwise supportive but is exhausted of dealing with it or had a rough day and wasn‚Äôt in the mood to hear about it  My fianc√© is generally supportive but sometimes he‚Äôs had enough of my bs and doesn‚Äôt want to hear me complain that I ate more than I‚Äôm comfortable with or that I feel fat or not want to go out to eat bc I‚Äôm scared of food I don‚Äôt know the calories of.   Obviously what this guy said was super insensitive &amp; if it‚Äôs an on going thing then she should consider ending the relationship.

First let me just say this is NOT an okay thing that happened to you. Yes, other people have other problems, but that doesn‚Äôt mean yours don‚Äôt exist. It‚Äôs not a competition of who in the world has the worse problems.  Just because he thinks his problems aren‚Äôt ‚Äúbad enough‚Äù doesn‚Äôt mean he gets to project that onto you, especially when you need support. (Saw your other comment about him potentially having depression.)  I had a similar experience with my boyfriend, but it wasn‚Äôt over my eating disorder, it was over something else that I was really upset about and sobbing over. I broke up with him and only got back together with him after he made it clear to me that he had changed and would never do it again.  I‚Äôm not saying break up with him, or don‚Äôt break up with him. But please please realize you deserve someone who has empathy and sympathy for you. Crying over something like toast may seem trivial to him, but tbh crying over something like toast should be seen as more of a cry for help imo, so honestly no offense but your bf really made a huge mistake, and you deserve so much better than to have your problems trivialized and rug swept. Here in the real world, adults are supposed to have empathy for each other. A lesson this guy obviously hasn‚Äôt learned yet.",False,False

It does seem like he is going through some sort of depression lately, I keep trying to talk to him about it &amp; provide resources/support (offering to listen, help him find a doctor/therapist, etc.) He refuses because he thinks his problems aren't ""bad enough"" :( i guess that's just a battle he will have to work through, until he is ready to reach out. But I'll keep supporting him. You're right, knowing he was once more compassionate than currently is a good sign, I don't think he's a bad person at all.",False,True

However, I wasn't trying to talk to him about it. I try not to bring anything up because it just upsets him. So his comment came out of the blue (other than me crying, but I wasn't talking to him, I wasn't crying TO him. I was just in the kitchen alone becoming very frustrated in scared, attempting to make the stupid toast) He definitely has a right to not want to talk about it, but in that moment I wasnt trying to talk to him at all.

""They act like this is the center of the universe"".  She shot back, ""well, it's the center of MY universe"".  And my dad finally understood.   In your case, that piece of toast was going to have an effect that was more critical to anything you care about than the fact that someone stole a car from someone else.   The fact was, that piece of toast was the center of YOUR universe.  On the other hand, it wasn't the center of his universe, so there's nothing wrong with him wanting you to limit the discussion over it, any more than you wanting to talk about it.",False,False

It was incredibly insensitive of him to say that to you. It shows that he‚Äôs looking at your life from his perspective instead of trying to see it from yours. It‚Äôs hard enough as it is bc EDs isolate people, there‚Äôs no need to say something that makes one feel more part from others. What he‚Äôs also failing to understand is that while the ‚Äúreal world‚Äù may be buzzing with ‚Äúnormal‚Äù issues, everybody has private issues at home. I think you should talk to him, try to get him to understand it from your perspective.   People sometimes say insensitive things when they‚Äôre going through something stressful, so while I‚Äôm not trying to justify his words, knowing that he‚Äôs been kind and understanding to you before, you can ask if everything is okay with him. If anything it‚Äôll give him an example of what compassion looks like.   Sorry if this response is a little charged. It frustrates me when people don‚Äôt think of EDs as real problems- because although they seem behavioral, there is a mountain of emotions beneath. It‚Äôs not just toast, it never is and never will be just about toast.",False,False
