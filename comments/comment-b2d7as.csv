I've been trying to gain weight, but I just get sick and end up worse off than I started :( And I do eat plenty of carbs :) I need them to help with my migraines.

Muscle burns more calories existing than fat does. And yes, to maintain your weight you must eat back exercise calories. And you must not skimp on carbs; those muscles need the glycogen replenishment.   If you're sub 15% already, you're probably not going to be able to change much without weight gain, though. Your body REALLY doesn't want to give up fat after that point. Pro bodybuilders (female ones, that is) have a rough time getting below there, and they have several things going for them that make it easier (higher BMI, lots of existing muscle, often on drugs)",False,False

Also I think my BF% is mid teens, but idk. I would mostly just want a stronger core and maybe some butt/hip gains.

Doctors never found anything wrong with him or with me, so the only reasonable answer is that there are completely ordinary reasons that a person might be thinner or heavier which are out of our control.

If you can't accept that you'll just end up kicking yourself when you find that it's harder for you than it is for others.

As a baby I had to have my tonsils and adenoids removed because they were before inflamed and I would always choke on my food when eating. I was really thin as a kid and kind of stayed that way as a teen even though I ate garbage food almost constantly. I did finally put a bit of weight on in my first couple years of college (high weight was around 130-135lbs) because I was living in student residence (with a mandatory meal plan card) and the only decently filling and affordable option was to basically eat fast food constantly. I could easily be eating anywhere between 2500 - 3500 calories a day and that was the only time I was ever able to put on weight. Some people can be generally healthy and eat a lot of garbage food and still be thin.  I feel like when people say that nobody is naturally thin it just makes things harder for people who aren't like that. If they meet somebody who is like that and is effortlessly thin it can be discouraging because that person seems to not try at all while they have to try really hard just to be at a higher weight. I think what's important is to listen to your body and focus on your needs more than figure. I know this isn't the right subreddit for that kind of advice, but if you feel like absolute garbage trying to get to a lower weight it's just not worth it. As long as you aren't overweight there's no reason to lose. Some people are just naturally lighter or heavier than others and it's important to accept that. Everybody has a different ideal weight which they can maintain and feel healthy and have the energy to be active. If you need to undereat or overeat to reach a weight goal you're going to feel sick constantly and you're not going to enjoy your life. ",False,False
