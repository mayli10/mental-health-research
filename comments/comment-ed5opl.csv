I‚Äôm sorry you‚Äôre having a rough time :(   If by ‚Äòget sick later‚Äô you‚Äôre referring to purging, then I think you should take them at a time of day when you typically don‚Äôt do that sort of thing. For me that used to be first thing in the morning. Good luck ‚ù§Ô∏è",False,False

Do you think there‚Äôs a point in taking supplements if you‚Äôre going to possibly get sick later? Ugh I‚Äôm going through it right now. Relapsing around the holidays is the norm for me.üò£,False,True

Honestly I think mine only started to thicken up when I stopped eating a huge calorie deficit. Your body is only going to use the calories you consume to stay alive, and things like hair, pretty skin, etc will start deteriorating due to a lack of intake. You could try changing what you‚Äôre eating instead of how many calories, and that may have some level of success. High fat and high protein are good for growing hair, and you should maybe consider that you could be losing it from an iron, or b12 deficiency as well",False,False
