I don’t like leaving the house because I feel fat (ed) and worried everyone’s looking at me and judging me (ed and anxiety). My anxiety is fueled by my ed— I don’t like public speaking, being in large groups, going to parties, all because I feel fat and ugly.   On the other hand though, losing weight is when I feel best about myself. When I lose weight, suddenly everything’s rose-tinted and everyone’s admiring my progress, my smaller arms and legs and stomach. I don’t hide myself anymore, I feel more comfortable.   But then I gain weight and I’m back at square 1– an anxious, self conscious mess.",False,False

I’m pretty convinced my ED directly caused a lot of my anxiety problems. To add to this, restriction in a sense “mediates” the very problems it caused... horribly ironic.   I used to be a very confident, well-spoken person with pretty decent self-esteem, but now I have really, really bad anxiety. I’m terrified of people (even eye contact is hard to sustain in any public setting) and feel like throwing up whenever I leave the house... convinced myself I’m stupid and can’t do anything right and sometimes just have a feeling of anxious despair in the pit of my stomach when I have nothing to do and should be relaxed.   Apparently this might have a lot to do with the direct influence of being underweight on neurotransmitters, particularly serotonin. My weight and food issues have screwed with my serotonin so much that I’m constantly crippled with depressive and anxious thoughts (interestingly I still perform just as well in public speaking roles as I always did, but am convinced I fail at absolutely everything and have a lot of social anxiety issues in interpersonal settings). It’s really annoying because restriction helps to regulate the neurotransmitters that my ED itself has screwed up, cue the vicious circle... ugh.",False,False
