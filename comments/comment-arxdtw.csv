I am kind of weird about physical contact most of the time, and I am uncomfortable with several parts of my body being touched at all. I am not a cuddly hand-holding type. I have gotten better at it over the years because of my fianc√©, but it is something that I still struggle with.   I would say my main one would be words of affirmation.
