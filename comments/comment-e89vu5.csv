I’ve found that only certain foods will set off a binge for me, like if I eat junk food then I will tend to binge where as if I eat fruit and veg and a nice healthy meal then I find it easier to control the urge to binge? I know this sounds like health freak advice but I’ve found it generally works for me so :) x",False,False

Idk how much you consider a binge but you could try eating at least one meal today but eat it somewhere else so more food isn't right there for you to binge. You could even leave the house and go to a park or somewhere to eat it. If you're worried about people seeing you you could sit in your car if you have one. Also you could try watching a show while you eat so you're not thinking about food as much.,False,False
