I dont relate to 99% of these posts and im so lucky. Yes im purposely underweight and have a good dislike of my body, but it doesnt control me. I'm not too far gone.. its honestly fitting because i never go 100% into anything ahaha",False,False

I'm not close with my family and honestly prefer my own company. I'm sorry you're feeling down. It helps me to focus on little things I appreciate, like Christmas lights or a nice cup of my favorite tea. I will also be spending New Years alone - feel free to message me if you'd ever like to chat.",False,False

I'm not close with my family, nor does my family even celebrate Christmas. i'm also not particularly close with anyone else. not in the drop-in-on-Christmas kind of way, at least.   I think one can be envious *and* empathetic, however.  We're all having a rough go of it.   The holidays aren't always happy.  A great many of us are not having a merry Christmas and it just makes me feel closer to each and every one of you beautiful people. ",False,False
