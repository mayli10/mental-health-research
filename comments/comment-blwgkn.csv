I also cried but ultimately we have to tell ourselves that we are literally doing our very best. We do what we can to reduce the amount of animal products consumed but no one is perfect and in this case, the eating disorder literally takes over.   I also thought I would never be undignified enough to vomit in the bushes at a funeral after eating pasta, but guess what, the ED beat me out on that one too.  Don’t beat yourself up, you’re doing your best, stay safe",False,False

I was vegetarian for a while and then went full vegan in the span of a year. I completely relapsed in March and started B/P on animal products. I am no longer vegan. I'm hoping once I get better I can go back to at least vegetarian.,False,False

You're trying and that's important, sometimes we fuck up. I got wasted and ate calamari on NYE because I had been restricting heavily and it was in front of me and smelled delicious.   Would you be comfortable grabbing some beyond meat, or Gardein meat replacements to keep around when you're really craving meat? I really love the ""chicken"" strips and I find they kick my craving in the ass.   Have a cup of tea or whatever your favorite thing is and relax :)",False,False
