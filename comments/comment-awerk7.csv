I don't have that one but have had other oral works so here's some fyis regarding the philtrum (Marilyn, Medusa, whatever you wanna call it)   - With all oral piercings, they are either cleaned with an alcohol free mouth wash or a saline solution (if you can stomach it) and this is done ideally after every time you eat (or just twice daily I suppose if nothing's on the menu haha)  - Your upper lip does swell quite a bit which will make it somewhat painful to eat. However, it's not an oral piercing that requires straight up only eat soft food. Your tongue does requires only liquids and soft foods for the first few days to a week.  - the best thing that can done for all piercings is to not move it (as much as you can) and to keep it clean (especially in the first two weeks-month)  A piercing is a wound and should be treated much like a graze or cut. Plus, your body is healing around a foreign object which it's not a fan of.   - Considering this, kissing is not recommended because a) it's going to be a bit painful for you b) everyone has their own microorganisms and salvia near the wound just means your body has to work to heal c) movement, bumping, see above etc - if you go in on an empty stomach, because this is honestly one of the more painful piercings (ngl), you may feel a bit faint afterwards, so maybe try to have a bite before hand.  - speaking of pain, it is  super subjective dependent on your anatomy and threshold. I would get my nipples done again &amp; again over any cartilage but some say nipples is one of the worst. The fact is, it's gonna hurt but it's over in a matter of seconds if done right.  - from personal experience, yeah don't purge ðŸ˜‚   In saying all that, kissing someone won't kill you (most of the time haha) The worst that will probably happen is that it will extend the healing time. Put ice on your piercing for 10mins a day and clean it as directed and you'll be okay! Plus, I can say with certainty that most people loveeeee their piercing once it's done, I don't see many disappointed faces coming out of our rooms. Make sure you source a reputable piercer near by because most will help with follow ups if you're worried and take the time to make you feel comfortable.   So I know you didn't need/want all this info but lol, it's there.  If you've been considering it for ages, just do it, you'll love it and the worst case scenario is you take it out and your have a tiny scar in a spot that is naturally shadowed. Feel free to send me a msg if you have any other random questions tho. Soz for the long response ðŸ˜‚ ",False,False
