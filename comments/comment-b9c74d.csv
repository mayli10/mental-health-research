We ate healthy meals and we would have some unhealthy snacks on the weekends. But my mother was always obsessed with how much she weighed and would actively eat less if she weighed above 65kg (144 lbs?), and she is about 6' tall. She would comment if I took more potatoes or something, saying that I didn't ""need that"". When I went to high school I had some days where I was home a lot earlier than the rest of the family, and I would buy chips and chocolate on the way home and quickly eat them while I was alone. I would hide the wrappers in the trash. I don't really know why I did it, except that I was never allowed a snack when I got home so I'd just be very hungry and dinner was always late. I was often nauseated because of the hunger.  When I moved out at 18, I quickly learned that I didn't have to be hungry anymore, ever! No one could comment on how much I ate, and I could finally eat until I was satisfied. I loved food but I also definitely used it to regulate my emotions. Needless to say, I gained about 60 lbs in 2 or 3 years. Last year I finally was able to lose it all, but now that I couldn't binge eat anymore, I've just started restricting and purging to cope with the stress and emotions.   Definitely not all my mom's fault but I really don't think it helped, either.",False,False

My dad values staying slim, but he eats really unhealthy foods and compensates with IF instead of using portion control. He makes fun of my mother (who had an ED as a teenager) for her middle-aged weight gain, probably to feel better about his own body insecurities. She has never been happy with her body that I know of, is always trying to lose weight, and when my ED started around 12, I got passive-aggressive comments all throughout adolescence over being too thin in her view (but my BMI was normal!). Both my parents are image obsessed and have problems with respecting boundaries, and my mom’s recently started talking about my little brother being too heavy in her view.

My mom started a ""healthy"" diet, and now has orthorexia. I was chubby as a kid and was constantly told I needed to lose weight and put on diets. I used to have to go do jogs with my dad in the evenings when I was 8 or 9. I stayed chubby, I grew taller and was 115 lbs at 165 cms. I had a BMI of 19.1. I had big thighs and a bit of a stomach because of how I carry my weight. I developed binge eating disorder and graduated high school at I'm assuming 175 lbs. I purged a few times throughout high school, but wasn't very good at it so I gave up (lol). I gained 20 more lbs over the course of a few years and stayed at 195 for a while.   I tried keto end of 2016. I lost 20 lbs really fast. I'm vegan so it was extremely difficult, there's not much variety in food. Then all of a sudden one day I was binging and without thinking about it, I purged. And now I've been doing it ever since. I gained some weight back, lost 15 really fast before vacation (in about 2 weeks). I put that 15 back on quick. I still binge and purge a lot but I'm trying to be healthy. It's so hard.",False,False

We ate basically the same thing everyday and if I didn’t feel like eating that particular meal, I wouldn’t be allowed to eat anything. Food at our house was so scarce that by the time I was 7 I was already underweight. It also stunted my growth and I didn’t go through puberty until I got to high school.

My mom was basically always on a diet or at least kind of. She was weighing herself often, and when she gained a few pounds she ate less and lost them relatively quickly.

I think this kind of affected me, but she actually did nothing wrong, at least she didn't know better.      Then there's my dad who often said: ""Don't eat sweets, in a few years you'll be trying really hard to lose those extra pounds and you'll regret eating this."", which made me feel horrible... Sometimes he squished the fat on my hipbones (while I was at a normal weight) and said: ""You have to be more active, go running, then you'll get rid of this.""
