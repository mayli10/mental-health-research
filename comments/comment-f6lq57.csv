All her coworkers knew why she was off work for so long and that it was because of daily radiation that had her having to take oral morphine that still didn't take the edge off her radiation poisoning symptoms.  She lost a lot of weight because the radiation made her lose appetite and it was concentrated on her neck meaning eating was painful due to bleeding sores all over her mouth and throat. She gets back to work and everyone congratulated her on her weight loss and how good she looked. All she could hear in their ""compliments"" was ""Hey girl! Long time no see! Cancer really suits you! Well done on not eating for weeks!"" People are fucking monsters.",False,False

I was gonna mention how in sooo many comedy shows growing up, like Jimmy Neutron, the fat kid (Carl) is the nerd or idiot with undesirable and unattractive traits. I'm watching Parks and Rec lately and the only person who is heavy is the brunt of being picked on/bullied because he'll bend over and his pants will rip, or he always fumbles around. Really makes you think, would the character be as funny if he were a skinny guy who ripped his jeans or farted?   The fat person is ALWAYS the oaf in comedy, because apparently with weight you become less intelligent and accident prone.",False,False
