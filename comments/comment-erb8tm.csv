I developed a major panic disorder in my last two years of school: we're talking minimum 5 panic attacks a day. My appetite was next to nothing, although I did eat at regular meal times, and I didn't exercise (I gave up dancing for those years because of exams) and just slept all the time. I went from a low-end healthy weight to underweight in a matter of months. I wasn't trying to lose weight, but my body was a wreck from anxiety and couldn't function.  I'm doing better now. My anxiety is still hell, but it's rarer that it manifests in full-on panic attacks. They still happen, but it's more like a few every month instead of every day. I should be happy about that, but I find myself almost wishing to go back to it because I was skinny. It's fucked up, but the thought is always there.  That ED voice will try and convince you that it was worth it, but those times in my life were literal hell. Panic attacks are the worst and it's so good that you've managed to beat them, you should be proud of that. Enjoy the things you can do now that you couldn't before, and take care of yourself.",False,False
