Although logically I know others are going through similar trials, it’s relieving to know I’m not the only one navigating the tumultuous path between autonomous care and financial dependency... Wishing you the best of luck and great success in your efforts with care and recovery! You deserve it too!",False,True

It’s weird to be categorized into a program, especially when we have like zero money and only our parents’ insurance. Something that’s kind of helping me is to view this as an opportunity to get our money’s worth and to really get the most out of the care I’m receiving. It’s difficult, because it really does take actively choosing to recover and retrain at all times, which is quite the exhausting process, but that’s what these services are for! School will wait, you don’t have to fit yourself into any timeline. Please know that you’re worth every cent, and the loss of you to this disorder would be way worse than spending money to recover. I know this is an isolating process but you have a community here giving you full support!! &lt;3",False,False
