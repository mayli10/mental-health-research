If he's worth keeping, I think telling him that it actually does hurt you might make him realize why you have such a low sex drive and self esteem.

I'm usually just too tired for the full deal, or I'm doing it to help me sleep, get rid of a headache, release stress etc. Or maybe he wasn't feeling it so I took care of it myself.   I'm a woman, so I probably don't understand male psychology that fully, but I'd bet it's just habit and not anything to do with you. And like I said, maybe sometimes he doesn't feel up to the full act. If you're comfortable, maybe have a conversation about what he likes in porn and if it's feasible to you, maybe try some of it?
