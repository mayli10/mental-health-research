It gets easier when you recover only for yourself and put everyone’s crap behind you.  I was only able to eat normally once I learned a lot about proper nutrition and started eating to live. You won’t gain any excess weight if you eat right.  When I was AN, I was hospitalized for 10 days and tried eating normal junk like everyone else and I had lots of problems and it all was worse than when I was UW. I just recently started eating foods that make me feel truly better (similar to paleo style of eating) and I feel amazing and my weight is Normal and since I feel good/satisfied, I never over eat.  Just try to recover for yourself. Do it for your own health. Find what foods make you feel the best. Ignore all the lies and antidiet culture because there’s nothing good from eating the standard American Diet/processed junk.   I would learn about some human physiology and about nutrition, it really helped me get my head straight about food and my weight.",False,False
