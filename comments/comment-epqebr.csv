And i am very proud of that. I used to p*rge in the shower, so, i started taking baths after i ate instead. This also helped me pass the time, because we have all heard that there is no point in doing it after one hour. So, i was less tempted, and it helped pass the time. I have recently started walking after i eat, which I’ve heard helps with digestion, and (i know that this could develop into ortho, but i feel its better than purging) i know that i am burning calories. No, not enough to cancel it out, but it’s peace of mind. I hope this can be helpful. Best wishes &lt;3 we can do this.",False,False
