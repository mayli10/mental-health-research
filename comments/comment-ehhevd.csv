Same with other things - it used to make me super uncomfortable every time anyone even mentioned the word ""depression"", and I still don't want to say I ever had ""depression"" (despite that massive nervous breakdown needing medical attention last year and all...), fucking hate it. I don't like being labelled I guess. I prefer to say ""I was feeling depressed"" or ""I have some problems with eating"" or ""I get panicky sometimes"" or whatever. It's so reductive to be labelled as ""having depression"" or ""having [x] eating disorder"". ""Eating disorder"" is still definitely better than the specific one (anorexia, bulimia, whatever) though.",False,False
