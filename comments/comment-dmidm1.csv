It's definitely good to have foods that you are really familiar with that you can turn to.   For me it's chicken breast, red pepper and a spoon of peanut butter all cooked like a stir-fry then on some salad. I know that it covers protein, a little fat and a little carbs and I also know the calories. It's safe because it's healthy, easy to make, warm and easy to prepare too.   At the moment I keep not having safe foods because I am back in a stupid binge/restrict cycle but just writing this out has made me remember how easy that dinner is. Maybe I will try eat it tomorrow.",False,False

For me, it’s been those pre packaged  fancy (but not overly expensive) cheese + meat roll ups. I think of them as fuel and I actually have been enjoying eating them. I think of it as a way to get my school work+exercise done and it makes it easier for me! 0 carb too so that helps me with guilt and fear. I’m proud that I’ve been eating them!   I know how hard it can be, and I’m so sorry you’re dealing with that :( I hope we can both feel better and get some good food in us soon!!! &lt;3",False,False
