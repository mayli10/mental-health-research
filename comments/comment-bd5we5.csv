I love fashion and dressing nicely and I've felt so sloppy the past few months because my clothes are either too big or too small. I've basically been living in ill-fitting jeans for the past few months because the thought of being in a fitting room with trousers I can only pull up halfway because of how fat I am makes me nauseous. But the lack of cute clothes is doing a number on my self esteem as well :(,False,False

But yeah, they're tooooo helpful... They're always chasing me and asking me if they could help me and that I should ring the bell if I need help in the fitting room. Like sure... I'll call you to come into the fitting room with me, you stranger... sure.",False,False

Just run to the fitting room directly and avoid eye contact lol. I also hate how the sales ladies at the lingerie stores try to be extra helpful, more so than at regular clothing stores.   Have you ever tried like ruelala or something? They usually have amazing sales on really nice bras and underwear. So much cheaper than in stores, like my favorite CK bras are like $20 there vs $50 or whatever.",False,False

Tomorrow I have to try them on in the store and decide if I want to keep them or not. It'll be horrible...,False,False

That’s why I usually only buy my bras at target now. Though I’d rather just hold onto my ratty old bras for 5 more years than have to buy new ones.",False,True

I really need new bras, but I feel so judged when I walk into the store. There are only super hot, super pretty women working there and I feel like shit while trying to choose some items to try them on...",False,False
