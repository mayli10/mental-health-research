Something one of my friends from NA always says (in regards to relapsing with drug use) is ""Not today, motherfucker. Maybe tomorrow. But not today.""  It's a little more fun than ""One day at a time.""  It really helps to just focus on this day - abstaining from behaviors today and being intentional about it. Knowing that in the future you always have the option to use/purge/whatever it is, but for right now, you're committing to NOT doing it. All you ever have control over is right now - if you've already made it this long without purging, what's another 5 minutes? Keep repeating those 5 minutes. I promise you can get through this!!  Not today, motherfucker. Not today.",False,False
