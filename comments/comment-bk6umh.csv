If I could give any advice it would be to try and treat yourself like you would treat a good friend or a child of yours (even if you don't have kids) that has been through the same thing. Be gentle and loving and give yourself time to get through this. Get your mind off things in a way that's calming and relaxing - adult coloring book, favorite show, pedicure, anything relaxing. I hope things get better for you soon ❤",False,False
