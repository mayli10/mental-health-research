I have other health issues that affect me as well that will probably get me first. the fact of the matter is, I simply cannot afford the treatment I have had in the past right now, and if my will to recover is not strong there is no use in trying to seek out treatment. I am however in outpatient care, and I follow my labwork almost religiously to ensure I am not harming myself as much as possible. Full recovery, however, is simply not in the cards for me right this second.",False,True

You just need to not let your brain get into that ""okay, it happened to them but it won't happen to me, I'm different because-""  It WILL happen to all of us who don't get well. Every single one of us is going to die from this unless we get better, no ""ifs"" or ""if nots"", only ""when"".",False,False
