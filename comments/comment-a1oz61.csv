Now a bit more time has passed from that convo, do you feel a lil bit more relief from the thoughts at all? ",False,False

Sounds like maybe she didn’t like you commenting on her weight so she spat out a zinger. That comment found it’s bullseye!! Ouch!  I wouldn’t bring up her weight again. If you feel like supporting her weight loss, you could compliment her style, clothing, attitude, “internal glow”, etc... instead!",False,False

She isn't trying to hurt you, she's trying to boost her own self esteem.  Try to remember she's probably very insecure about her weight and only now feeling like she has any control over it, so she's getting a bit of a big head about it. I would literally not bring it up, I'd just let it go. I'm sure you look exactly the same. ",False,False

I know it’s very much my own personal problem and I am working on it! Although I think the consequences of this conversation potentially not playing out the way I imagine it to would be sorta dire for my mental state. Idk I know it’d be worth a shot but eating disorder and alike included it becomes it a real touchy subject if u understand where I’m coming from ",False,True
