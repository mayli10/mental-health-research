I hit a physical breaking point/scare while purging today, and I had a giant ass dinner with some actual nutrition in it after therapy, so I pray I don't freak out on the scale tomorrow. I'm sure it's gonna be a lot. I think I'm usually dehydrated from the constant purging as well so",False,False

I am afraid to gain too much weight by allowing myself to eat... because after starving myself and starting eating even just a little bit, my body just starts gaining weight... It's basically impossible for me to maintain a weight.",False,False
