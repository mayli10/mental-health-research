Your body is going to want to redeposit fat where it’s most necessary (around vital organs) before it goes anywhere else. I read about this on some recovery website that noted the initial gain as a potential trigger for people trying to recover from eating disorders. They said that the tummy gains are temporary and fat will begin to deposit more evenly with continued weight gain. It could also be bloat. I ate like shit for 5 days while on vacation and got a noticeable pudge in just my stomach that subsided after I got back on my bullshit.,False,False
