I really get how you feel, I’m 6 inches taller than you and I went up to 200 pounds. I remember when I weighed myself for the first time and I straight up had a panic attack. Depression is a fucking bitch. My bipolar kicked my ass and I had like a 1 year depression spell that I barely even remember. Am back down to 148. Still don’t feel great, but I feel physically better.",False,False

I'm right about your same hight, started at 130 (after extremely careless eating my first year of college!), and am now 100. Weight gain is *always* reversible. Yes there is something called the ""anorexic high"" when you get into the unhealthy habit of eating very little, but I believe that there's also a healthy version of the feeling when you start a healthy loss routine and get into the flow of it. Give yourself a realistic timeframe (1200/day is like 5lbs/month I think for example) and a healthy plan and you can easily get to where you want to be before the year is up, be that 118 (which is a good goal, right in the middle of healthy weight) or back to your original weight. You can do it!",False,False

I am dealing with the same feelings right now, though I don't have any trauma that caused my weight gain.     What are your common binge foods? You could try keeping healthier alternatives in the house for when you have the urge. Homemade popcorn instead of chips, veggie sticks and fruit to constantly munch on etc.     I totally empathize with not wanting to be in public, and also with hating yourself and feeling panicky and stuck. Make a list of small things you can do each day that will help you reach your healthy goal, and make an effort to check them off each day. You are already in therapy, that's wonderful and a huge step! But how about smaller things that will also help you improve your health? You could add things to your list like ""Try to drink 8+ glasses of water"" or ""eat 2 servings of leafy green vegetables."" Small and attainable goals that lead you to healthier eating habits and a sense of accomplishment.     ",False,False
