He said my body is probably fighting to regain the fat it's lost because let me tell you it's fucking low as hell.  He said to eat it.  And not worry.  And if it did somehow spiral he's there to help but he doubts it.  Still so scary to live with an intense urge to never stop eating :(  Thank you so much though, this has been driving me insane. I've been sobbing my eyes out thinking my mind wants me to binge endlessly and get fat.  I might not entirely feel better  but it's super super comforting to have people tell me I'm not going crazy or being a glutton.  Thank you.",False,False

Listen, eat the chocolate. Don't fight cravings if you are trying to recover- you'll eventually lose and it's just the wrong mindset for it. Even if your not trying for recovery- eat it. Nothing bad will happen. Make yourself a little snack then have some chocolate after. It's a totally normal, healthy thing. Even the relentless hunger and cravings and constant eating is normal for people attempting recovery. I've read lots of studies. It's standard and how it should be. You're body is trying to repair itself and the brain from malnutrition and the best way to do that is rapidly and with a lot of nutrition (food) so that's why we just want all the food. Because we've had none (or we've had it and puked it up or whatever). Anyway life is too short not to have the chocolate.",False,False

I try to graze in-between meals. Grab a tablespoon of peanut butter, couple bites of cheese, a few slices of apples and slowly eat it in between my meals. It can be super alarming at just how hungry we can get once we allow our bodies to do what they need to do again. Be themselves as it were. They over compensate for the horrible shit we've done to them and try to get as much nutrients,fat ECT in case it happens again. but they won't forever. Just hang on over this hump. It got better for me the first time. I'm in the midst of this right now. It totally sucks- just keep telling yourself this won't last forever and you will have to be uncomfortable for a bit. Through recovery I've really tried just to lean into the uncomfortable thing lol",False,False
