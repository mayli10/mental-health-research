Your body likes to have an equilibrium between sodium and water in your blood, hence why too much sodium causes water retention. Too little sodium though can cause dehydration through expelling the excess water to get back into balance. It's swings and roundabouts.  Other factors can impact how much water your body holds onto. For every gram of glycogen, the body's primary energy source, you store 2-3 grams of water. When you exercise, your body stores more glycogen to fuel your muscles, which is why sometimes you gain weight after exercise (you can also gain weight through building muscle mass, but that's over a period of time, not like one session).  High corsitol levels can lead to retained water, I'm not entirely sure as to why though. Anything that causes a prolonged state of stress, such as sleep deprivation, anxiety, extreme dieting, can prohibit your corsitol levels from lowering.  To get rid of water weight, ironically, you need to take in more water. But we do need water to help us effectively store that glycogen for future use, so you won't ever be able to get rid of it all, we are 60% water after all. If you find yourself experiencing signs of hyponatremia (low sodium), try to get some salt into your body and cut back a bit on the water until your body is back in balance.",False,False
