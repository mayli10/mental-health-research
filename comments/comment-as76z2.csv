I think skin takes a while to bounce back and become tighter but being young puts you in a good position in terms of loose skin. it's obviously easier said than done but try not to let it discourage you and think of it more as a sign of how far you've come. also I don't mean this in a way to trigger you into restriction/fasting but I have read that fasting puts your body into autophagy and this process helps your body metabolize the loose skin and help reduce it. I'm not 100% on the science of it, but it may help you in some way.  your post is not narcissistic and you have every right to share your experience, I find posting here is so therapeutic that it actually calms my mind from my extreme thoughts and behaviours. much love ðŸ’• ",False,False
