There are obviously juicing people, like say in wrestling and bodybuilding. Then there is just using steroids to fast track to naturally achievable physiques while not being detected for steroid use because you aren't a freak.  THATS when I used to get pissed off. Yes, there are dedicated weightlifters who have been doing it religiously for many years and they look good. But any ""transformation"" you've seen where a very normal guy get shredded to model-level musculature in a matter of months, that's steroid use.   I guess it bugged me because I got all my body images from Hollywood. Then after getting into weightlifting I learned about the reality of steroid use in all sports and in Hollywood and my heart kind of sunk that the general population thinks that their beloved actors aren't using steroids. I kind of felt that don't hate, just join them attitude.   ""Luckily"" for me, I made a deal with myself to never touch steroids unless I'm under 10% body fat and my eating disorder never even let me get close..... I'm over 50% now... kmp",False,False

Say something along the lines of ""you? anorexic? But you don't look anorexic!"" and this is just wrong on so many levels.   And unfairness, false statements and stuff like that do bother me a lot.

I’d say the girl who goes to the gym to build muscle (squats) but also has a relatively lean midsection is the most popular. Lot more healthy too, but yea I agree on the idea that health means fuck all for attractiveness lol",False,False
