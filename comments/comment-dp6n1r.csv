Try to find out what triggers those binges - for me it's either certain foods, emotions I can't deal with, certain settings (as in being alone at home) or loneliness in general. It's great that you're in recovery! Slip ups are normal in the progress of getting healthy, even though it may upsetting to fall back into ED behaviours such as binging try not to be too harsh to yourself. Recovery is possible, even when you are still struggling! I believe in you xx",False,False
