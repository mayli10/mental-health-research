It just knows that you ate 4 hours ago, and you usually eat every four hours! And if you are recovering from restricting you will be more likely to get STARVING hungry that will wake you up. And if you purge, your body interprets a large amount of calories as a small amount, and the binging stretches out your stomach, making you inordanitely hungry.  Anyways, theres nothing wrong with waking up hungry but if it stresses you out then not eating for a while before bed, after a few days, will stop that",False,False

I think if you are eating every few hours (like 3 meals, 3 snacks type of thing) your body gets used to not going more than 3-4 hours without food and starts producing that ghrelin hormone (idk how to spell it) that makes you hungry. It's a sign that your body is working properly in that way! So hooray for us! (I am also trying to recovery although I relapsed real fuckin hard today)",False,False
