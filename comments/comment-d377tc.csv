I was overweight as a result of depression and whatnot but that same fall I met her (1st year of hs btw) I went full ed mode and lost 10kg in a month resulting in everyone being worried for me and since I totally was the annoying pos who called themselves fat all the time because that's how I felt, I probably triggered my friend real bad. She was still underage and in a recovery program at this point tho.  Let's cut to next summer, a lot of shit happened during winter and spring and I kept losing but was made to enter a recovery program in that July (2018). So I started gaining again and for like 3 months both of us were ""doing better"". Then she turned 18, quit recovery, moved on her own and lost a shit ton of weight, skin and bones pretty much. I was at my highest weight during the time she was at her lowest and that fucked with my mental health a lot... Anyways, I became a legal adult this year and a couple of months after I was able to quit the program and start losing weight again. A month or so after I ""started slipping"" again my friend had to see a doctor for heart palpitations and got tired of her own bullshit, entering recovery on her own free will. She is still very skinny though and most certainly not recovered weight-wise or mindset-wise but as long as she's getting better it doesn't matter how slow the progress is. However, she keeps triggering me like crazy and I can't even say anything about that, also I'm still one chubby mf (I've been struggling with binge-eating which slows my progress significantly) so no one's even concerned for me or anything... Doesn't really help either that all of my best friends are in general literal models unlike me, a 5'1 potato  So yeah it seems we can't be okay at the same time without one feeling shitty because of the other",False,False
