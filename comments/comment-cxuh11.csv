It's like they just don't give a flying fu\*k about us binge eaters. We really want to stop, but can't!  I was told by various doctors to go to weight management, so I went, but that didn't help me one bit. It didn't address the physiological side of things of binge eating.  Then I found one doctor at my local GP who's super nice and understanding, he tried a few years ago to refer me to the eating disorder clinic, but they didn't want to see me. Thankfully my mental health care coordinator got me in the clinic to be assessed - expect that went completely wrong. The woman who assessed me for an eating disorder said I needed to get motivated and go on a diet. I was like, ""bitch, I'm depressed and can't get motivated because I'm so depressed!"" So then I emailed the manager of the clinic and I told him I wasn't happy with the outcome; I know myself too well to know it's not my OCD causing me to binge. So then I met up with him and he said he's willing to help me.  I had to fight so hard for help. From my experience, see as many different doctors until you find the one who completely understands binge eating disorder.  One doctor I once saw said that there's only two eating disorders: anorexia and bulimia. I couldn't believe she had said that.  **FIGHT FOR YOUR HEALTH!**",False,False

It‚Äôs like when I used to go to doctors before they always would ask me if there was a reason I was underweight &amp; ask me stupid questions like my eating habits &amp; stuff &amp; like how fast I walked lmao.
