Around exam time a lot of people lose weight because they're too stressed to eat. I think it's only our community that strives to be underweight to the degree where it affects health. To 'normies' it isn't effortless simply because the end result isn't something they would even want to put effort in to achieve.,False,False

I know I will put every ounce of energy into losing weight and then when people ask about it I‚Äôll just be like ‚Äúeh I‚Äôm not usually hungry‚Äù or ‚Äúyeah I just walk a lot‚Äù lol,False,False
