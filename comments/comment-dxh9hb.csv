I worked in a supermarket before also and most of the people that worked there, if not all were not bored or brain dead tired. Also most grocery stores I go to people seem to talk to their co-workers etc.   People are rude no matter what job they have. It‚Äôs a nice idea to think the entire world is like your store, but it‚Äôs not. People have treated me like I was gross or really odd. More people know about ED‚Äôs now. They also know more about health. So either way lots of snacks are judged by many.",False,False

I'm aware that most people don't notice or care, but some people definitely do notice, and if you're someone whom strangers feel compelled to comment on, well....you quickly learn that shopping trips are just NOT a safe/fun experience.
