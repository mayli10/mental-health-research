For the past two weeks or so I've been weighing 139.something the morning after I've had a ""good"" day where I've kept to my restricted caloric goal, but obviously it'll hit low 140s later in the day with food and water and clothes. Plus if I have a bad day where I eat at maintenance or something, the next morning I'll be 140/141 and so it doesn't ever feel ""real"" that I'm in the 130s.   It's fucking with my head and actually has been causing me to have more bad days than usual, because I feel like it's not really progress when it's so easily messed up, because it's on the cusp of a weight ""decade"" like that (I love that term too lol bc that's also how I think of it).

I refuse to upvote if the number of upvotes ends in 8 because I hate it so much lol.   4-8 are safe numbers for me! 1-3 makes me frustrated I'm not less, and I feel like I can basically round the 9 up and it wouldn't make any difference.

My thing is like...I don't feel like i'm really in a weight ""decade"" unless i'm able to still be there at the end of the day after drinking/eating with all my clothes on.

A few years ago when I high restricted (1000cals) and weighed myself every day, I was obsessed with the numerology of my weight. My highest weight ever was 77.1kg, so 7 became the ""bad"" number. 6 on the other hand was the ""good"" number because I wanted to get out of the 70s and into the 60s. The best numbers by far were 5's and 2's for some reason. 5's obviously since I was elated when I got down to the 50s. 2's...I guess it was the lowest number except 1, which was bad since it was in 77.1, my SW. So 62.5kg was a much better weight than 61.7kg...those numbers made me more anxious. I was happier to see 58.6 than 56.1 (my LW), because it had a 1 in it. I had a lot more rules about numbers that I forgot. I was so obsessed back then...",False,False
