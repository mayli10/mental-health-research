You should listen to this podcast called The Read when you have a chance. It‚Äôs hosted by two LGBT people and there‚Äôs a lovely segment at the end where they read people, which feels cathartic to listen to when you feel pissed and/or sad.",False,False

Like to them it‚Äôs just lunch chat but to me it‚Äôs my human rights?  Unfortunately HR would not be helpful. I also work in manufacturing, and I‚Äôm the only woman engineer at our company and HR has straight up said ‚Äúmost women who report sexual harassment are lying about it‚Äù   I‚Äôm planning on getting TF out as soon as my lease is up in July.",False,True

It‚Äôs the casualness of it all that gets me.  It stuns me how people feel so comfortable spewing hate, with seemingly no self awareness or consideration of others around them.    Don‚Äôt feel afraid to report it to HR, you shouldn‚Äôt have to deal with this.   I work in a factory in a rural area, I kind of know what it‚Äôs like.  PM me if you ever wanna talk.",False,False

You don't need to be at work for that to be a violation if most workplace policies. That's some crap.  Sorry you had to listen to that. People are jerks,False,False
