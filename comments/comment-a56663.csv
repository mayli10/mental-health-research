So like: -sipsip, disgustingly loud swallow, gross vocalization noise as well-   I used to work for a guy that was severely obese and he used to make smacking noises while he ate. I could hear it from across a hallway in a different room. Used to drive me bonkers.   Also moving like a fat person is a big fear of mine. So I make sure I'm physically active. Like I said, my dad can barely get up stairs and I just don't want to have to be reliant on other people to get around. My weight has fluctuated a lot. At one point I got big enough that I was having trouble reaching my feet. I mean I could always do it, it just wasn't comfortable to have my feet up when I was clipping my toenails or whatever. That had to get fixed ASAP. Now I'm back down to comfortable toe-reaching weight lol. ",False,False
