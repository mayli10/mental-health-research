That's why I really want the galaxy watch instead of the active, the bezel seems so nice to have. But I'm not used to wearing anything on my wrist so I was wondering if the active would be more comfortable, plus they added a weight tracker to it which is great!  I think I'll have to go at the Samsung store myself and check it out. :) thanks for replying!  Also you should probably buy a new watch band, I heard the HR is more accurate with a different watch band!",False,True

I like the spinny front of it!  I feel like the calorie count is pretty good on it, I don't think it over estimates at all. The heart rate sensor is great, I only have issues because the band doesn't go small enough for me so it flops a bit when I run.  As for running with gps, it's also awesome at that. Battery life is okay, but I use a lot of features on it (constant HR, Bluetooth, bright screen, run a lot).  If you fidget, I recommend the normal watch. The spinny face is a nice fidget thing.",False,False
