I relate to this on physical, mental and spiritual levels tbh. Especially since all my friends are so skinny, I have to take ""proper care"" of myself and make sure I don't look or do anything that would make me be seen as ""disgusting"". If we go out they can wear whatever the hell they want and still look good, while I have to dress up nicely, do my hair and makeup so I can be up to pair. I am so tired of this.",False,False

When I went into the normal weight range suddenly I noticed people really DID have bias and felt guilty for benefitting. So the guilt turns to “now I have to compensate for the fact that people don’t just like me because of my looks” It’s the disorder always messing with things!  ,False,False

I live somewhere that has a high population of overweight people, and I don’t see them getting treated any different, because it’s so normal now. Personally my anxiety makes me feel how you’ve described and I’m underweight. I have to really really try to get people to treat me nicely, but I always feel like I’m a weirdo.",False,False

I haven't been the fat girl in a long time, but I will ALWAYS feel like the fat girl who needs to overcompensate and be extra nice just to be treated like a human being. :(",False,False
