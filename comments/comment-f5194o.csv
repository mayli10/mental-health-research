Idk about others but I think everyone is welcomed if they relate. If you find this sub helpful to visit/like it, then go ahead. Not like anyone can stop you anyhow.   There are many people who are in recovery who post here because in the end, EDs are ongoing struggles and it’s nice to have a community to get through them with. Everyone here, I’m sure, wants everyone else to recover.   However, this sub can also be very triggering and normalise many ED habits, or even inadvertently give tips, so I ask you to be careful. Your mental and physical health matters, and comes first.",False,False
