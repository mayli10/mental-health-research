I theorize that the sugars etc in cookies (or ice cream, cereal etc) get broken down really quickly, whereas fibrous foods (vegetables) and fats (dressing) take longer. Which is why I get visible veg chunks covered in sweetish liquid.   I hope you can safely hydrate and replenish your electrolytes, it's not fun to get salad up.",False,False
