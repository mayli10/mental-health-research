I want to reach through my phone and give you a hug and your safe food of choice.  I do have to agree with the other commenters that this relationship isnâ€™t healthy. Honestly, what you describe sounds like emotional abuse. Whether or not this is truly the end for you and this boy, you deserve better than a partner who treats you that way. You are worthy of someone who wouldnâ€™t dream of doing this to you.  Try to take care of yourself. I 1000% know how it is when your partner betrays you and it feels like youâ€™ve lost everything. But you can get through this, and things can get better. Be safe ðŸ’œ",False,False

I went thru that. being yelled at for having male friends but he was allowed to talk to exes and old flings. its going to be ugly and her obviously doesnâ€™t respect you. itâ€™s never worth the emotional turmoil, the insecurity that itâ€™ll create; so get out while you can please. this is the perfect opportunity.

But whenever he thinks Iâ€™m talking to or hooking up with other guys he loses it. Heâ€™s allowed to sleep with his ex but I canâ€™t do anything without him acting like this?  Ya boi is trash.  TRASH.  Walk away from this dumpster fire and never look back.  Anyone who holds higher standards for YOU than for HIMSELF is a garbage person.    Don't still be friends, he sounds like a fucking turd.",False,False
