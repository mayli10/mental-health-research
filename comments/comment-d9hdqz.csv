I find most days I don‚Äôt have the energy to work out at all and just spend it sitting around. I had a personal trainer session the other day (going through proper form on new strength training exercises) and I struggled through it. I feel awful going to these training sessions and then not eating enough to actually do the workouts in my own time.",False,False

I know I'm being dumb I just have no idea where to start to not be a useless lump and I find posts like yours really aspirational and they make me wanna jump the gun. I honestly just don't know what to do at this point eating doesn't make me any more able and it's really getting me down.   Sorry, didn't mean to unload on you. Thanks again for being a voice of reason. Seriously, thank you.",False,False

This is a good way to pass out in public (ask me how I know).   Now, I'm a dumbass who does weight work when I'm objectively not eating enough for it to be a good idea, and I do have successful workouts and have seen gains. But I don't work out when my body feels really sketchy, and I have to be self-aware and stop if I'm getting woozy. And again...if you're eating so little you can barely stand, you should simply not even attempt this kind of workout.",False,False

If you feel light-headed or shakey before you'll feel so sick after. If you can't afford/aren't comfortable getting a trainer start with very low weight. Even just the smallest dumbbells or the bar with no added weights until your farmilar with the way it makes your body feel and have a base understanding. Then you can start to actually push yourself and see results!! It's definitely a healthier obsession,False,False

I found that I actually love seeing the muscle mass from lifting?? I was never a thigh gap person but I never thought I would enjoy seeing my quads round out either?? But like my firmer lower body makes my upper body look soo so tiny. Lifting has made my waist look like it's shrinking even though its not.,False,False
