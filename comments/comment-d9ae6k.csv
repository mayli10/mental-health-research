I had to buy size 14 jeans the other day and I couldnt believe it. I have ZERO hips or butt . the 14 is literally just to fit my waist girth without pain.,False,True

I felt kind of like a 'fake' or like no one would take me seriously cause I've never been stupid skinny.  I'm sorry about your break up...its crazy how it can be gone for so long and then boom its reemerged. Like an old friend ..but one who has it out for you but smiles at your face...  All the best.,False,True

I never thought that I could fit into a size 5 before. Now I'm lucky if a 10 fits me. I've been trying to limit my intake to 1,115 but 9f course, I'm cycling between 165 to 175 for the last few years.",False,False

I was the chubby kid and decided to do something over the summer when I was 13 and dropped about 40lbs with my mothers support because she was also obsessed with being skinny. No one commented on my dramatic change, I just got more attention from boys. I never got asked questions in highschool about my habits because truth be told, I hid it well and stayed between a 10lb range. When I was 17 I entered a relationship that made me feel more comfortable about myself... which led to weight gain. I got to my heaviest weight Ive ever been with a bmi of 37. He started making comments and it hurt. Im 22 now and that relationship ended for other reasons at the beginning of the year but it hit me that I only have myself again and I had lost myself... so I decided to take control. I had forgotten how euphoric fasting feels, watching my weight change through out the day, the gratification from other people noticing and saying ""oh you look good"". Ive never felt more depressed in my life, everything is falling apart but... now Im back to restricting, I have comfort in something, something that makes me feel good in a shitstorm of chaos.  Im sorry for rambling there but, I related alot to your experience and it made me feel better to know Im not alone. I hope youre okay.",False,False
