This girl is golden and I am lucky to have her around me. It was a hard time for me because today we had a conversation through texts that lasted 3 hours and I was anxious through all of it. But in the end she means well and might have convinced me to end my fast a bit sooner.",False,True

I know she has ptsd, I understand it.   In the end we had a very long conversation around a cup of tea. She means well, she tried her best, I can see her point of view, but I explained her that I can't be changed easily in a single conversation.   THough in the end I told her I would only fast  weeks versus  originally, I think I am going to break my fast tonight... I can't stop thinking about some of the things she told me... But I also can't stop thinking about the weight I could be losing if I kept on, the efforts I did until now,the fear of binging again, and the weight I WILL gain after I start eating just a bit after fasting....  Thank you for your comment anyway &lt;3",False,True

Relentless, and doesnt stop telling me to eat.",False,False
