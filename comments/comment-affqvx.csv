An ""ok"" could be a positive sign. I know it hard because you were hoping of course for a bunch of loving support, and he didn't show you what you wanted. Do you usually feel an incongruence with the way that you each like to show/receive love? Are you familiar with the concept of love languages? It is going to be helpful if you keep telling him about your feelings. Tell him when you feel hurt and what actions seem to correlate... keep communicating and showing him how you want to be treated.  &amp;#x200B;  It's hard for me to suggest more ideas because I am not sure what type of relationship you guys have. But if you feel hurt and you feel like he isn't giving you what you want... please request different treatment and search for support for your ED elsewhere if he doesn't manage to show you love, understanding, and compassion about it.",False,False

And you're upset but maybe he is just worried about how to approach you or that you might get upset if he does.   I say this because I constantly worry about these things. I never say the right thing. If my husband says one thing I try to respect it. And if I think I need to go above because he walks away or seems to be avoiding me and I DO he often rejects me so I feel worse and then future times I avoid it. Once you calm down maybe try talking about it with a clearer head.,False,False

My last fling would just reply okay to things all the time. When I asked him why he did it, he said it was because he wanted me to know that he heard everything I had said and was either processing it or just really didn’t have an opinion on what I told him. :///   Either way it’s rough when someone you care about doesn’t know how to support you and invalidates you in the process. Just give him some time. I hope you feel better soon. ",False,False

A lot of boys and men unfortunately have been socialized to suppress their emotions and not talk about them with each other or anybody else.,False,False
