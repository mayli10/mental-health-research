The occasional 2-3000 cal buffet trips probably factored in, and I've never purged either. I also don't own a scale anymore so I never had any freakouts over inevitable plateaus.

Being sedentary isn't good for most people anyway, so exercise would be a healthier choice than restricting. If you're unable to exercise you still need to maintain your body through proper nutrition, so you might just have to accept that you'll have to lose weight slower. A 300 calorie deficit is still a deficit, it's just a smaller deficit than 500 calories would be. You could choose to restrict to an unhealthy amount and I won't try to stop you, but you can't deny that eating less than what your body needs to maintain itself is unhealthy. It would just be factually wrong. You can lose weight without getting sick, but eating significantly less than your BMR will lead to a minimum of headaches and lethargy. It's also nearly impossible to get all of your necessary nutrients at 1200 calories. You can take supplements, but unless you're being very careful to make sure all your needs are met for proper absorption a lot of supplements won't really be very useful. I know specifically that a lot of people who take potassium pills have trouble absorbing it properly because of other nutritional problems and even if they didn't a potassium pills is only 2% of your daily potassium needs. There's also potassium powder, but you can't get a prescription for that and it can also be hard to take because you need to mix it with food and it can be tough to cover the flavour of it since it's so strong. That's just one nutrient however. Chances are if you're eating just 1200 calories per day you're going to need to supplement a lot more than just potassium. I would guess at least iron, vitamin D, vitamin K, and magnesium. You could take a multivitamin, but I find that it's very hard to not get more than upper limit of vitamin B3 (niacin), folate and calcium when taking a multivitamin as these nutrients have very small ranges between what's recommended and what's considered too much and you don't need very much of either. What I'm saying is that it's extremely difficult (and expensive) to be healthy when eating such a small amount of food. It's better to burn excess calories instead of restricting to very low caloric intakes. For the average woman 1200 is not plenty. It's too low and it's risky to push the idea that it's fine. I get that subs don't always have names that really reflect what they are (like ProED used to), but they don't make an effort to help their posters understand that. There's just a link haphazardly thrown into the sidebar. Most people won't even see that link, but a lot of them will see the bold text at the top telling them that eating 1200 calories per day is the minimum for women and that will lead to plenty of people who don't know better thinking they should strive to eat around that much.",False,False
