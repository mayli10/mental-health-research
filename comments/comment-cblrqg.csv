I started out eating 1,200.. stopped losing weight as quickly so I made it 800... stopped losing weight as quickly and I was down to eating about 500 calories a day. I didn’t really consider myself to have an eating disorder but when I think back to it my eating patterns and the thought patterns tied to them were very very unhealthy. I hated everything about myself and as punishment I told myself I didn’t deserve to eat. I lost about 35 lbs doing this which I gained back unfortunately because I emotionally ate my way through grad school haha. I realized eating so little was just not sustainable and this time around to lose the weight I’m making it a point to truly make lifelong changes to my habits so that I can have sustainable results. This time, it’s my goal to fuel my body because I love it and it takes care of me. I wasn’t taking care of it when I ate 500 calories a day. Dont do your body a disservice! Honor it by maintaining a healthy calorie deficit and find an exercise you love and want to do all the time! For me it was CycleBar! Time will fly and you’ll be at your goal sooner than you think! Best of luck!",False,False

I'm very sorry to hear you've been struggling with food  500 calories a day is not enough, and the fact that you're making it like a competition against yourself is also not good and definitely disordered behavior  I'm not a health professional, but I am diagnosed with an eating disorder, so my advice to you would to seek a therapist or similar professional that knows how to help people with eating disorders or otherwise unhealthy relationships with food.  I hope you're able to sort this out, it's really no fun",False,False
