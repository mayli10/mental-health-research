Seriously, sometimes we should be given those options with family. Sweetie you're doing well, eating is important and necessary. You need to find another person to confide in and to help you. I would stop talking to her about food and your issues, she seems to make you worse.",False,False

It sounds like your mother is responding in very self-centered and passive aggressive ways - for some reason she’s making *your* struggle more about herself than about you, when supporting *you* should absolutely be her focus.   During my teenage struggle with AN, my parents sometimes responded with anger. I think because they were scared, they didn’t know how to help, and also some feelings of “Is this our fault? What did we do wrong?” Their response came out of love, but was very hurtful to me. No idea if any of those factors are in play for your mom, but the bottom line is you. deserve. help.  &lt;3 She should be helping you get it. There’s no excuse for behavior like what you describe, but sometimes understanding that my parents responses are about their own shit and not my fault or responsibility helps reduce my pain over it. I dearly hope you can find a trusted adult to help you. (Maybe a relative? A teacher? The parent of a friend?) I’m just an internet stranger, but I’m sending zen hugs.",False,False

I’m sorry that she is not helping you how she should. You need to find a better support system, and just keep making baby steps to recovery. I believe in you OP. You got this.",False,False
