The PMS, crying, moodiness, and depression, even cramps sometimes, still came during the couple years I didn’t get my period and were actually way worse. I really thought I was losing my mind until a friend mentioned that my breakdowns seemed to happen at the beginning of every month. At least since I got it back I know when and why it happens.",False,False

I’m at a healthy BMI (at the higher end too :() but when I was restricting pretty low my period was very light and PMS symptoms were super minimal, and I did miss my period entirely a couple times. It was nice. I’ve been in a binge cycle for too long and my period is worse with every cycle I don’t break out and this on was sooo fucking terrible. And like you, a large portion of my daily calories comes from alcohol. I know the alcohol isn’t helping things, but I just want to be able to restrict to not feel so shitty. I suspect I have endometriosis though. ",False,False

It’s been absolutely life changing. Everything you wrote was what I felt too, and now I feel much steadier. I didn’t expect it to work at all, so I was really shocked that it worked that well.

If you're consuming almost as much calories of alcohol as nutritional food, I'd bet on that being the emotional trigger issue. ",False,False

Sometimes higher, sometimes lower, but that’s the average. I’ve had 2 maintenance days in that time period.  I put high restriction in quotes because my food intake is around 500-800 calories, but I drink 300-400 calories of alcohol.  ",False,True
