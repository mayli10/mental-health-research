At least they can enjoy the food i am too scared to eat, i guess? Lol  Now i live a double life of being an chef with ana. When I told my doc about this, his only response was, ""wow. You must really hate yourself."" ðŸ˜‚",False,False

She'll even try to do it now when I visit her but I don't give in so she ends up getting upset. I guess she always prided herself on being thinner than me... but now she isn't and that's triggering I suppose.,False,False

Baking was one of the very few things that gave me genuine happiness and fulfilment, but I feel like my ED has stolen that from me. I'm at a point where I can sometimes have a little bit of what I make (or binge on it lol) but for the most part I just creepily stare at my family while they eat it. ",False,False

I donâ€™t really feel like itâ€™s me being pushy or trying to live through others though. Usually I donâ€™t really make treats that I personally crave, itâ€™s just that I enjoy the act of cooking/baking and when I know itâ€™s for others I donâ€™t have to worry about skimping on ingredients or portion size.  I love holiday cooking because I can be helpful and my way of showing love is just feeding everyone but myself lolol ",False,False

The other week I smoked with 2 friends and got the munchies. I am vegan and my friend had nothing in his house for me to eat so instead of breaking my fast, I made my 2 friends pancakes and watched them eat them high out of their minds. They savored the food more and it was just so pleasurable to watch even though I didn't have one bite! Its nothing sexual but more so fulfilling so I understand.",False,False
