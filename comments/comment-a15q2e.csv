I went home with a huge chunk of leftover stuffing, some pumpkin bread, mashed potatoes, ratatouille, and some french bread. Devoured the french bread on the drive home. Got home and inhaled the stuffing and half the pumpkin bread.  I did manage to throw away the potatoes before I could eat them. And I didn't eat the ratatouille and locked away half the pumpkin bread in my kitchen safe.  Still, spent the night farting and sweating in misery.  I'm a nut. ",False,False

It links in with not wanting to waste food / miss an opportunity if it's going to expire soon -_-   Like say I planned a binge (no longer doing that - calorie counted cheat days sure maybe, but never a binge plan)   I would try cram all this food into the one day,  actively bypassing my fullness due to the whole need to eat it all now so it's not around/ wasted.   I'm trying to learn how to be more intuitive and be able to not eat the whole plate just cause its served. Trying to accept it's okay if the food expire, I'll get the best out of it while its there and thats okay. It's better to be slightly finically wasteful if it means you're not harming your body / mental progress imo.   Stay safe lovelies and remember if you wear makeup (sorry men although could apply to some of you too)  its wasteful to cry off / ruin such a pretty face of products bc you messed up your eating. This is a better one,  but it's also wasteful to have to wash gym clothes too often if you work out to compromise this too. So maybe it's okay to be a little wasteful with food :) ",False,False
