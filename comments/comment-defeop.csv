Teeth are important and pretty.  It's hard to just up and quit purging forever and for good.  In the meantime, you can try to protect your teeth and throat as much as possible.  It's not just teeth that bear the damage of vomiting - your throat and mouth and salivary glands can get inflamed and damaged.  You might already know all of this but I'll just share some good tips anyways.  The Colgate website says the following about excessive vomiting:   \&gt;To minimise damage done by stomach acid during episodes of vomiting, rinse your mouth with baking soda mixed in water. You also should rinse with a mouthwash containing .05 percent fluoride, which your dentist can prescribe. Don’t brush your teeth immediately after vomiting because stomach acid weakens tooth enamel and brushing can cause erosion of the enamel. When you do brush, use a toothpaste that contains fluoride. Fluoride helps strengthen teeth.   So yeah, DON'T BRUSH AFTER even though it's really hard to not.  Chew a tums really slowly before and after and let it coat your teeth and throat, or do the baking soda rinse.  Use a mouthwash with fluoride.   Sorry, I know you didn't ask for advice and you might know/do all of this already, but there ya go.  I kind of feel like adapting some harm reduction into my life and taking fastidious care of the body parts I was about to damage by purging helped me out a lot, physically and mentally.",False,False

I chose soup that was in the 500s (#recovery?) and I knew one ice cream was under 200 but then that was sold out. I didn't order dessert, but my sister did, a coconut ice cream. She ate it, I stared at it for 20 minutes trying not to cry, and bc it was too big she shared it. In the end I decided to eat it and I wanted to die every single bite.

Im currently at an 8,000 cal surplus and I'm up 8 lbs (probably more earlier, but i didn't have the courage to weigh myself until now, now that i feel somewhat better physically)  As long as I've been underweight, my chest bones have been visible and I've had a dimple above my belly button. Now my chest bones are less prominent and there's no longer an indent above my belly button, but instead there seems to more padding and the skin around my belly button seems ""loose"". It reminds me of what i imagine pregnancy does to a woman's stomach (but way less extreme). It's not terrible or anything but it feels really devastating, especially with these two changes happening overnight. I know i can expect 2 or 3 lbs of weight gain after the water weight has settled, but until then, what's the deal with my stomach (and how long until the water weight goes away?) I've been reading a little bit and read about anorexia patients first gaining weight in their abdomen and how the weight will properly redistribute with time. But it's just really triggering. And will my belly button go back to normal? I read that i should continue eating maintenance, but i called in sick today because I'm really devastated and uncomfortable with these changes in my body and needed a mental health day to recover. My intention was to take the day to fast so i can feel as normal as possible to prepare for the next day, but will fasting just make the effect worse? Because i read that you should continue eating normally. Tomorrow i did/do plan on allowing myself to return to eating maintenance so that i can recapture some sense of structure and break this overeating cycle, though. But right now i have no appetite anyway and i feel gross.  When i was over eating, my stomach would get so distended, while my ribs were still visible, the indent above my belly button was more pronounced/""popped"" out from my side profile because my stomach just stuck out so much. I had to hunch over/couldn't keep a straight posture, making my spine more pronounced. It was kind of scary to see.  I've always had very weak stomach muscles, but now it feels especially so. I feel like i can feel my muscles. Did i stretch them? Will they return to normal? Did i cause permanent damage to myself?

I feel 50 times worse after I binge, and any restriction throughout the week is utterly pointless by just one binge. I had a really big and bad binge this past weekend, and I don't even know why. I leave for a beach vacation on Friday, so I was just telling myself ""it doesn't even matter anymore. i can't lose anything before friday anyway"" I had TEN (10) months to lose just 20 pounds. Even 10 pounds would have been satisfactory. But here I am, with a total loss of ZERO (0) NADA, NOTHING. I mean I definitely lost at least something--confidence, will to live, mental stability, you know--the norm. I mean, fuck, at least I didn't gain weight, but maintaining for 10 months when I wanted to lose sucks just as much too, especially when I WAS restricting. UGH.  So here I am. Back to restricting.   And now I have 51 days until I meet my bf's parents for the first time. So 51 days to lose whatever I can. Hopefully that means 10 pounds, but knowing my track record, probably not.

I can't remember what it's like to not feel awful.when I was genuinely peaking in June. I can't keep on like this. I'm really struggling.,False,False

She was literally early.  So now I feel like absolute shit, will never ask for a ride again, and don't wanna eat a goddamn thing today.   Seriously I would have preferred her being angry and just saying ""I can't handle you being late "" or something (this is the first time I've been late btw) but she just straight up ignored me and made one snide comment about how she prepares ""the night before"". As if she's never been late on her own.   So yeah I'm a massive piece of shit but hey at least I ate under 800 cals yesterday?? Whoch was probably why I was late??? Because Im numb to my responsibilities? Still feel like shit tho so I still have some feelings lol",False,False

My goal is 144 hours as I had a nasty binge on Thursday through Friday and consumed no lie...~10,000 calories in the span of about 30 hours.  Things are going well otherwise in my life even with the binge my bmi is still in the normal range.  My boyfriend was gone this weekend to help his ex and their kids move to a new house and it’s in another state...he wanted me to come with him to spend time with him but no thanks, I am not gonna just be casually hanging around his ex all weekend and moving her shit while she sits around doing nothing and playing on her phone.  So he went alone.  Fine, whatever.  That’s why I used this weekend for my binge anyway...was looking forward to it.  I went back to work tonight and he got home (we live together) after I left.  He’s been quiet and not saying much.  I know he is tired.  Says he’s gotta go back in a couple weeks to help them finish moving and guess what again, he wants me to come with him.  So I can spend my entire weekend moving this woman’s shit and being nothing more than a 3rd wheel.  He takes it personally I don’t want to come...gets pissed at me.  Like I should want to do this!  Again no fucking thanks I will stay home again.  He is so desperate to be around his kids he will kiss her ass forever and do whatever she asks to be allowed to come around.  In a way though I want to thank my boyfriend for upsetting me with this bullshit.  Now I am more determined to finish this fast than ever.  Shit I may never eat again.  When I fast it takes my mind off of him so much.  Gives me something else to focus on.  It’s the only thing in my life I have control over.  It keeps me zen.  Why am I always the one to come last?  Could he at least put my ass first for once?  I adore him and want to do everything to make him happy.  Make him relaxed.  Make him desire me.  And I fucking hate being obsessed with him.  I know I think 1000x more of him than he does of me.  He could take me or leave me despite what he says cuz actions DO speak louder than words.  At least now when I fast I can focus and obsess on something else.  When I fast I almost don’t even care if he is in my life or not.  I feel like I can be objective and see that he isn’t so perfect.    So, 48 hours down, *at least* 96 more to go.  Fml.",False,False
