I find myself doing best when I let go for a little bit, have some patience, let my brain be a bingy whore, and slowly transition back. yes, I do gain weight. but I put on fewer pounds than I used to when I had binge phases. I let it happen but I make sure it stays temporary. just remember: the first day breaking the cycle is always the hardest. there is no need to purge! that is a dark place to go back to. I promise you will be alright. aim for healthy/wholesome foods right now. let your brain focus on healing right now.",False,False

Iâ€™ve stopped purging a few years back but Iâ€™ve been there...  Iâ€™ve learned that whenever you have a bad day, no matter how bad it gets or how bad you get, you shouldnâ€™t punish yourself for it. Weâ€™re all allowed to have bad days.
