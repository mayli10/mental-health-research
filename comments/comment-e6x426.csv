Yeah it's finding that balance and being 'rational' (oh the irony) to realise you can eat that little bit more and still lose, but not as drastically",False,False

Try upping it (I know it's not ideal, but you will still lose anything under your maintenance intake) or upping your exercise for one day. I'm sure you've heard this but dropping your calories that low is potentially risking a binge which will have the opposite desired effect. If you're a girl it can also be down to water weight too from time of the month",False,False
