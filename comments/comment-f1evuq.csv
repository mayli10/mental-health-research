For example a few months back she went to see a dermatologist who recommended her a diet plan to help with her acne. We talked about her normal eating habits freely and she even asked me about ideas for cheap easy meals that fit within her diet plan then updated me daily about what she ate for a few weeks after. It didn't seem like she was trying to brag/use me to calorie count. I myself was trying to eat healthy at the time so we held each other accountable. Calories were never mentioned and she was always a little upset if she didn't eat properly some days/if I hadn't either. I obviously think she's unhealthy and has some sort of ED, just that the catalyst of her disordered eating isn't that she feels like she has to be a certain size (which is what my personal experience has been like). I guess I'm just trying to understand her mindset a bit better before I jump to help her.",False,True

Plenty of people with eating disorders love to tell people that they just don't think about it or don't know how they stay so thin.",False,False

It's so foreign to me...,False,False
