I'm sorry you're having to go through this. ""I can't make any promises regarding my behaviour because I'm only human and you can't expect me to be perfect"" is a generally shitty thing to say-- how does she compose herself in difficult social situations, if that's true? Does she just blow up at every little thing that rubs her the wrong way? Jeez.   As for advice... it sounds like a miserable time. If it were me I'd back out. But if you still want to go for your grandpa, then go, and try to remember that you can't control what other people say, only how you react to it. Consider a cover-up for swimming.   And if your mom or anyone else says something terrible, try telling them (as calmly as you can) that you're aware of your problems and you're waiting for a bed to open up in treatment and you know it's difficult for the family when one of you is clearly struggling but that things are very close to looking up. Telling them that you appreciate their concern (even if it comes out of their mouth in a shitty way) usually gets their attention, in my experience, and makes them listen to the rest of your speech.  \*hugs\* I hope things go okay.",False,False
