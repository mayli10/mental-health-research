You were concerned enough to ask in a forum of people that suffer from ED for their thoughts. And it looks like we've all said the same thing more or less. That there is a problem, and tbh, now is the time to get help. You're young and still have a long, healthy life ahead of you. This is something I'd absolutely advise trying to get ahead of, because before you know it, you're pushing 30 still panicking because you have to go to a restaurant that doesn't include cals on the menu. Or feeling like shit because you restricted too hard and don't have the energy to play with your kids.  Find someone you trust and talk to them.",False,False

Like I said, I typically snack instead of eating a full meal. I eat small meals. I also go in the occasional starve binge cycle.    2. Idk. I just want to be skinny lol.  3.

No. But it could be useful to at least try to understand your own behavior right?    I get your situation more than you know.    I was pretty much in your situation a few years ago (I'm an adult now) where I was underweight, had some questions about whether my habits were disordered or not, but never told anyone about it because I thought it would just be easier to slide under the radar and stay skinny, esp. since males are questioned a bit less.   I go through and periodically delete my post history so I can't find it, but I initially came here (or well, the old subreddit) years ago with similar questions got similar advice, and ignored it.   I guess I'm just trying to pass along advice that I wish I would have taken.",False,False
