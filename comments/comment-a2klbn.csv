I guess thats the affect leaving has had so when I come back for Christmas I’ll have my game plan. I was really worried my psych is on a totally different plane but your comment really helps me :)  I just want to be healthy and sane again",False,True

Maybe try spending more time away from your family? Go to a library or see friends or do some volunteering. The less time you spend with them, the less opportunity they will have to unload their shit onto you. Any issues that arise as a result are NOT. YOUR. FAULT. You cannot live your life as a punching bag existing to absorb others' issues, it's their responsibility to work on their own lives, and your responsibility to look after yourself FIRST. No one else will do that for you. Your psychologist sounds like they're on the right track though. Stay well ❤️",False,False
