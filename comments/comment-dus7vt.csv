Family and friends are terrible at judging sizes regardless. My nonna used to buy me XL and XXL everything, even though I've never been above a medium in any brand. Her response? ""What if you keep growing?!"" Fucking precious, she just thought I was her little baby even in my 20s.   On the other hand, my dad would always buy me small or XS, regardless of what it was because I'm *smaller than him*. Literally.   At the end of the day, they just wanted to give you a present and have no idea what size you normally wear. Or she texted your mom and asked, and if you normally wear smalls, it would make sense that that's what you'd end up with.",False,False
