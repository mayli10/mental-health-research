It scares me to know that this can kill me, and Iâ€™ll leave him alone. I wanna meet him (LDR) and have a baby and travel and grow old together.   Last night I watched this video of this girl who made a tribute clip for her deceased boyfriend and it really made me rethink everything. I have trouble with over-exercising but Iâ€™m working on that, as well as eating enough to actually sustain muscle, and one of my goals is to eat 1500 with no guilt and I will get there.  You will get there too, I believe in you. Best wishes ðŸ’•",False,False
