I was so happy that I was finally losing weight in a healthy way but my brain is like ""lmao u thot"" which kind of sucks.   I don't really have many people to talk to about this sort of thing but I'm going to try to at least find someone who may listen. I might get a bit more active on this sub since up until now ive been a lurker haha. thanks so much for your help, it means a lot to me &lt;3",False,True

For example : you can have obsessive compulsions. It's not a disorder until it starts to negatively impact aspects of your life.    That's the general clinical view of it. I'd say if you consider your eating to be disordered , you probably are being negatively impacted enough to qualify.",False,False
