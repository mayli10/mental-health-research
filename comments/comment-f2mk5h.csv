An entirely different wardrobe, routine, friends, energy level, food choices, drink choices, sleep routine, etc. I don’t even sleep in my bed next to my husband most nights after I binge. I lay on the couch all night watching Netflix and usually refuse to sleep. I literally am a completely different person when I binge and it’s fucking terrifying.",False,False

Also not allowing to drink tea out of a certain mug because that one is only for restriction/fasting days. Have a super pretty bottle I also am not allowed to drink water from when binging. Have a whole playlist on youtube of videos I safe up while in a binge phase because I feel I‘m only allowed to watch them while restricting. There are video games i‘m only allowed to play whilst hungry, can only interact with friends when restricting etc.   It‘s so messed up when looking at this behaviour from the outside but when in it, it just slowly creeps up and less and less is allowed until you realise depending on what phase you are in, you are living two completely different lifes. I‘m sorry you are going through this.",False,False
