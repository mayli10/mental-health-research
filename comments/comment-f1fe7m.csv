A couple of guys saying I would be really hot if I gained XXlbs. Wasn't sure how to feel about that as it was from a sexual-attraction point of view. Saying they, ""Like to have something to hold onto."" \*shivers\*  Maybe this guy was talking about other girls in his dating radar, trying to say that with less skinniness, there's less to hug and cuddle. I don't know, as I don't know the entirety of both of your dynamics.   :/ I hope some of your thoughts on this improve, for you. Dating whilst disordered can feel like running sprints.",False,False
