Don’t even fantasize that “motion of weight loss program“  its going to ruin your metabolism (yeah really ik it sounds illogical) and raise your “set point” It will make you so deprived that when you actually try recovery (eat like a village every day) you won’t be able to to stop no matter what.   So I STFG! Stop right now! I’ve wasted my entire Life with anorexia. And I’m a male, everything is so fcked and seriously, you HAVE TO EAT A FK LOAD OF FOOD! ASAP or you’ll never get to the point where you can have a good weight (I’m talking Fit and toned)  You must immediately take action and I eat. It’s horrible and it makes me disgusted, I literally want to k*ll myself after eating.   But your body thinks a famine is going on and won’t quit until it feels safe.  Ok now this is going to sound like TOTAL BS, but It’s true oh god its true :[  You have to eat like (literally) 4,000-6,000kcal per day. I’m so serious right now, I’ve been eating ~4,000kcal for the past 3 days =[  But it gets better, you’ll quit feeling insanely hungry in a month or so.  You’re body will gain but please please don’t think about it and pretend that everyone else is completely oblivious to it. You may want to steer clear from negative people*  Ok, eventually your body will quit telling you that you’re insatiably ravenous after eating like a elephant and you’ll eventually be able to eat all you want to and not gain weight unless you’re trying to OD. Lol You’ll then be able to exercise and be super fit and happy unless you start dieting again, then your metabolism will die again and weight control will ruin the restore your life:(  Please please don’t ruin your life with this, I’ve been in this too long and I’m trying as hard as I can to get free. I wish the best for you, it hurts me so bad to hear that Evil Ed telling everyone how to live. Tears are literally running down my face right now.  Please just let your mind go blank and make yourself do what’s right, it’s the only way out. Reward yourself you deserve it.  I hope the best for you and for everyone else going through this hellish battle with insanity.   🤗 hugs and more hugs! I believe in you, because I believe in myself🙌",False,False
