Prepopped popcorn, nuts along with your dried fruit, rice cakes, but butters, apple sauce packs, Jerkey if you eat meat, cereal, and might sound weird to some but... baby food.  I would like to suggest apples and bananas. I know they go bad quickly but at least they contain some healthy nutrients and fiber.   Try not to be super scared of the dining hall, many have salad bars but I totally understand where you are coming from.  I’m not sure if we can name actual people but there is a youtuber than was in the same predicament and ate fully raw her entire time in college, supposedly she even made friends from her “healthy” eating habits.   Condiments are another nice thing to have on hand.   Congratulations on getting into college.",False,False
