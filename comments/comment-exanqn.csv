Thatâ€™s my food 2. I can decide what I want to eat 3. Ordering is really simple, Iâ€™m not that dumb. Iâ€™m guessing it could be that sheâ€™s worried for you and she wants you to eat well. Itâ€™s really not the best way to show concern but bc itâ€™s coming from a place of concern I think if you told her about how uncomfortable it made you feel she would try to stop. But regardless I hope you day went well!",False,False
