I was on Seroquel which is notorious for making people gain 100+ lb due to extreme cravings, but I actually lost weight by just going to sleep before the hunger signals could get to me lol. Not that Iâ€™m recommending that strategy, I was living in the hospital so itâ€™s not like I had anything else to be doing.",False,False

I don't know if that's an option for you, but if you're comfortable with it, it's worth a shot.  You probably don't even have to say you have an ED.

I was told two days ago by my new NP that weight gain is extremely uncommon with anti-depressants like SSRI's and MAOI's, but its more common with anti-psychotic agents.

I never gained weight on any anti depressants and Iâ€™ve tried so many over 7 years now.

Iâ€™m up to almost 15 different meds tried, so I have a lot of experience with it, and the thing that remains consistant is that everyone responds differently to different meds. Luckily, remeron was a VERY immediate issue, so I stopped taking it as soon as we realized how it was fucking with me. That being said, I have talked to a lot of people that have had the same experience with remeron in particular. If you donâ€™t feel comfortable taking it, then donâ€™t and ask your doctor for another option.",False,False
