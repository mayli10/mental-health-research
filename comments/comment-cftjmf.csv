It’s super messed up and is making light of disordered behavior imho. You’re not wrong.  I mean...occasionally just *letting yourself* have a Questionable Treat *to a fathomable degree* is  totally healthy! (Must be nice...)   Purposely consuming *10,000 fucking calories* at once when you’re otherwise extremely careful about your intake is...uhhh, basically self-harm????!!...*and can literally kill you* even if you don’t puke afterwards. Like??!!   There are generally some VERY STRANGE aspects of Fitness Culture (or at least some pockets of it) that are FUCKED UP if you ask me... ............ I’ve literally told my therapist that a lot of the Gym Bros I’ve known irl have pretty much been exercise bulimics without knowing it, lol. :( Upon thoughtfully considering my explanation, she didn’t refute it at all.",False,False

Some foods are hard to fit in a diet plan and for some people that’s the only way they can stick to an otherwise healthy diet. It’s still moderation. However once people started recording it for $, fame, etc it’s gotten out of hand. 10000 is simply too much (usually really low quality foods) to consume regularly in a day. Seriously it’s 5 days of food for most people. I can’t imagine they feel physically or mentally ok after that.",False,False

First of all its not healthy and not eating normal at all, i really don't understand why people do it and i just think its for the views as a person that's recovery from an eating disorder if someone told me you can eat 10,00 cals and not gain weight from it i would decline because its just some much food and its not healthy for your body to have that much food and i would feel so uncomfortable like the bloating they have after the challenge is terrible",False,False
