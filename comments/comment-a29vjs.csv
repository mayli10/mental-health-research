A bowl of ice cream is NOT 3500 calories. You’ll be okay. Chill and try to enjoy the tasty treat. It’ll prevent actual binging in the future to enjoy treats in moderation. ,False,False

I drunkenly ate like 4 bowls of icecream, some chocolate &amp; mozzarella sticks last night and I’m really trying not to beat myself up over this morning. Deep down my brain knows I’m not just going to be fat all of a sudden even though I’m super bloated this morning, but it’s hard to let those thoughts overtake the irrational thoughts that I’m going to gain a ton of weight all of a sudden from it",False,False
