Iâ€™m also 5â€™7 and I carry all my weight in my thighs and hips.Not only that, I also have wide set hips. Even at my lowest (120) I was not a size zero I was a size 8 too. It would make me so upset and mad that I couldnâ€™t reach a size zero no matter how much weight I lost. When I was younger this hourglass figure was also considered unattractive, I remember being made fun of for having thunder thighs. Itâ€™s funny how this hourglass figure is what people see as attractive now, although I really do wish I could be a stick, I know itâ€™s impossible with my body type. We sound like body twins, if you ever need anyone to talk to I am here! ",False,False

Not from being fat; just puberty set in over night, I grew too fast, and it scarred me. I never had a chance. We never had a chance to be perfect and pretty. That's not the life we were given.  But who gives a fuck? Everyone is ugly in the end. We all get old, our bodies all get ugly and flabby and horrible, and then they die.  Much better to focus on things that have some staying power. Creative works, a successful professional life, kids, helping people, being a good person so we're remembered well.  Your body is on a fast track to becoming putrefying sludge. It feels silly to care so much about it. Like decorating the interior of a burning building.",False,False
