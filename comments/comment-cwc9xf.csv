It was a bit ago lol  Ahh that sucks. Family expectations can take such a toll. I am glad I am kind of removed from those situations because i am not great with pressure from family.,False,True

After every 'heavier' meal we took a walk to aid in digestion. Granted it's mosquito season here in the south so we walk the halls in the house, but hey, walking is walking lol.  Oof. I'd actually kill for a damn werthers right now. Love those damn things.  I guess I meant more like family expected less? When we lived in Cali they didn't expect constant visits (or any visits really!) from us. Now that we're only a state above family and inlaws they expect to see us frequently. Gods forbid the people that don't have to take 10 hr drives with super young kids (literally all of them!!) actually make a trip to see us. No, since we have kids it's apparently OUR job to go see them üôÑüôÑ. And the guilt trips are real if we don't.",False,False

Thankfully the only time my kids see it is after dinner. And I don't mind them walking with me then, or even making that a habit, because I read (somewhere, all the years ago) that a short walk after a meal can help digestion.  My natural bmi is the high end of uw/really low norm. Even so, after 8 years together and almost 8 years of marriage (eek, I'm almost 29üôà), he's definitely seen the ebb and flown of my ED behavior. Thankfully, as long as I can take care of the kids and the house like normal, he doesn't get involved.  And I absolutely feel that. I feel so dumb sometimes. Like pushing 30, 2 kids and I'm STILL obsessing over the number on the scale?? I guess I just always thought I'd be 'over it' by now. Obviously not the case.  We did a cross country move when husband was in the military before kids. Didn't think I'd be ok with it, but I kinda miss it now. People expected a whole hell of a lot less from me when I lived on the other side of the damn country.",False,False

That sounds great, I just hope I dont pass any orthorexic phases i have, either lol.  I went from underweight to low healthy bmi when i met my SO, and i feel like im a faker since he doesnt really see the ‚Äúdisorder‚Äù and im 26 so i cant be that shallow right to still be obsessing over my weight  I‚Äôm going to dm you~ I moved across the country a year ago so #relatable trifecta",False,True

Or when they asked for water instead of the juice the other adults were trying to give them üòç.  I get it. Most of my friends have kids at my age tbh. But one of them literally has 3 and is the same size and shape she was before (love her, but I could also strangle her for that!). Doesn't help that mine and her 2 oldest are the same age. We were pregnant at the same time and have birth within a month for the first and like a week for the second (we even had the same due date for our second!). Baby shower pictures from that time are ridiculously triggering. Plus, all my people (except my husband), think my ED was only something I dealt with from 11-17, not something that has made multiple resurgences in the last almost 12 years since my ""recovery"".  Trust me, I feel it. And everything you're feeling is valid. It sounds dumb, but do try to remember that even women without an Ed have body issues after pregnancy! Giving life to a little human causes major changes and absolutely takes a toll.  You got this mama üíú. It'll be rough, it'll fuck with your mind, and it'll hurt. But always keep that little one in the forefront of your mind as the reason you gotta keep keeping on. Not only did you give the gift of life, you're feeding it too!! That makes you a superhero! (my 1st I didn't want to bf, and my 2nd I didn't produce). That little babe is officially the center of your universe and you theirs (until they're a teen üôàüòÇ). Make the most of every moment, because it passes SO FAST! Which I'm sure you've heard before (I sure did), but with my oldest pushing 5 I'll be damned if it wasn't true.   Also sorry for the essays lol. I mention 'friends', but they've been dust in the wind since we moved states (almost 3 years ago!), and we're really talking about monthly check ins. Maybe. I don't get to have many conversations with adults lol.",False,False

I definitely want the same for my lil babe as well.  üòä  Its also great being able to relate with you, none of my friends have kids so its been a little isolating, especially when u throw in disordered thinking and i feel like i cant talk about it bc im not even thin enough to admit i have disordered thinking about food.",False,True

Idk, I think it makes pretty good sense. I always wanted kids. All I wanted to be was a mom. And as soon as I got those positives my ED brain kinda backed off.

I mean, I hate the bitch, but she did let me be while I was pregnant ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è.  Ugh, I totally get it. Honestly, the only upside to my crazy is that my kids are SUPER healthy. Perfect weight, great relationships with food, etc. They eat very healthy (can't have too much junk in the house!), and honestly eat a more healthy /varied diet than all my friends kids. Even to the point of turning down junk food in favor of an apple (3 year olds favorite).  --yes, that was a not so humble ""mom brag"" lol.

No more cute sweet babies üò≠.  Yes! After my first the nurse told me she'd never seen anyone shrink so fast at my 1 week check in.

We were going to put a bigger gap between them, but then tequila got involved and now we have a 3 and 4.5 year old lol!  Something I learned (and have had to defend to people that either aren't mothers, or don't have a crazy Ed brain) is that : We are allowed to hate what carrying children /giving birth did to our bodies. Doesn't mean we hate our kids, or wish we hadn't had them. My second gave me a horrible diastasis recti. It's not just cosmetic, it causes issues with my body and health. And I hate it!!
