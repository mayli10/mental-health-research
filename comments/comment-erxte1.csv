But I normally don't eat more than half a banana at a time. I'll slice and freeze the other half for smoothies. I love bananas but fuck them for being a higher calorie fruit. I did have a whole one today for the first time in idk how long though. But I ate a metric fuckton of fruit in general today. Like more than 3 times the recommended amount. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èüòÇ,False,False
