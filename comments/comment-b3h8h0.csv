I assumed it was a hormone thing and went to the ER (seemed super similar to a rare side effect that could cause death, walked there like a dumbass anyway) so it could actually be an ED thing.",False,False

Last week, my daily average was 1100 instead of my usual 1000. This week it’s been back to 1000. Do you think that slight increase last week would be enough to cause this? Would that be enough for my body to “refeed”?",False,True

The heart muscle gets weak from prolonged restriction, so it doesn't circulate blood as well. When the blood gets backed up in the legs and feet, fluid leaks from the blood vessels into the tissues, causing the swelling. You can try wearing compression socks during the day to help with circulation, and try to keep your feet elevated when able. ",False,False
