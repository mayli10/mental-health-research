C: if you ever have any questions you can always feel free to pm me! I can't give the same advice that a doctor can, but I've had a ton of experience with some really similar stuff since I had to learn a lot in order to treat my autoimmune diseases well ðŸ’–",False,False

I've had really bad arthritis related nerve compression (non ed related) my whole life, and sadly most doctors are super bad at identifying it and knowing how to treat it. I wasn't able to actually fix my problems until I went to a really good physical therapist. If you tell a general practitioner about it they can give you a referal for a physical therapist :)  Also a good protip, if it's not too harsh feeling on your stomach, taking some anti-inflammatories like aleeve can help! A lot of times the nerves become compressed because the surrounding muscle and tendon tissue around it gets inflamed and sort of chokes the nerves running through/beside them. Idk if this is just me since my body's weird from all of my autoimmune diseases, but i always get horrible connective tissue flaire ups when I fast for too long :/  Best of luck to you, I hope it gets better!!! ðŸ’–",False,False

I'm not a doctor tho, just a biology student with a tooon of connective tissue disorders",False,False

Iâ€™ve been trying to fast instead of purge because thereâ€™s this pain that starts deep in my palm and huuuurts. I also took a hiatus from purging and never had this happen before so maybe our hands are weak from not being used??,False,False
