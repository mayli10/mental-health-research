I had the help of my university counseling service before this actually, before being referred to the partial inpatient program - mixed experience for me because my dietitian was great but I wean through a couple therapists before I found someone I was comfortable with.  But if it hadn‚Äôt been for my UCS I never would‚Äôve made the move to recover.  Good luck with your process as well! I hope you‚Äôre able to find someone who can address all your needs and take strides towards a healthier happier you ‚ô•Ô∏è. You can do it!",False,False

I‚Äôm going through my University services for the time being, trying a different therapist from last time (since I can somehow open up to literally everyone in the system besides her smh).   I think you‚Äôre 100% right that I can focus on more than just my eating issues, but you‚Äôre also correct in that they cause me the most distress. I just feel like my GF thinks it‚Äôs one or the other when, in reality, I wouldn‚Äôt have been spurred to go in the first place if I wasn‚Äôt struggling so much with this particular aspect. The feedback loop is real and a lot of my sobbing self-hatred sessions are caused by binge eating... which then causes me to binge eat to comfort, attempt to get better, eventually fail (for seemingly no reason ugh), then it‚Äôs back to sad time.   Why she thinks this won‚Äôt benefit me I have no clue. Even if I‚Äôm not diagnosed or not diagnosed immediately I‚Äôm more concerned with being able to stop the behavior than being validated...    Once again, I wish you the best of luck. The process to get help can be really rough on multiple fronts, so I hope you are able to receive the help you‚Äôre looking for üíï",False,True

If your depression is manageable for now and your anxiety isn‚Äôt affecting your life nearly as much as your eating then I‚Äôd say you‚Äôre correct in focusing it in the meantime. Everything is connected, but sometimes you need to tackle what‚Äôs interfering in your life the most and causing you the most emotional distress before you can move on to the rest.",False,False

I feel this this 100% though and a good therapist/psychiatrist will take not only what you feel are the biggest issues you wanna resolve but also consider the other factors that are affecting it. Honestly... it was lind of ignorant of your girlfriend to say that because even if that‚Äôs what she perceives to be the ‚Äúmain‚Äù issue your eating issues are clearly affecting you emotionally and mentally more right now.  Wishing you luck with getting help and getting better! Even starting can be such an effort but getting better will be worth it. I‚Äôm starting a partial inpatient program in five days for my own ED and then continuing outpatient for the other issues so I can stop being sad and start being successful. I‚Äôve cried and screamed and done all sorts of stupid shit because the process has been grueling and it hasn‚Äôt even started yet, but here‚Äôs to both of us coming out better on the other end of the tunnel!",False,False

I can‚Äôt disconnect that from my depression because it‚Äôs at least 75% of what makes me feel more depressed.   I wish she connected them, but she‚Äôs upset that this is such a big focus of my treatment when I‚Äôm still depressed (but manage it) and still have anxiety (about only a few things). She feels like ‚Äúme wanting to be skinny like a KPOP Star‚Äù isn‚Äôt a problem and I shouldn‚Äôt focus on overeating when I have other issues too.",False,True

I‚Äôm hoping we can work through this and she can see my issues as valid. Even if I am not formally diagnosed with an eating disorder, my eating habits and the body that resulted have been making me incredibly depressed for... a while.   I know that to actually feel better, this is a glaring issue that needs to be addressed in some capacity.   I think some of why she‚Äôs upset is because she‚Äôs known a few people who fake mental illness or rehearse to be diagnosed with one. She thinks because I‚Äôm aware of the symptoms I‚Äôm gonna make them up or play them up... to prove a point? I guess that‚Äôs where I get lost though, because I wouldn‚Äôt benefit much at all from being  diagnosed. I guess she‚Äôs just tired of people self-diagnosing, but it makes me sad she can‚Äôt look at me more positively than that because I‚Äôm her girlfriend.  She also thinks I‚Äôm not very severe, since she saw a documentary once that showed extreme cases where they are 10-20K calories a day.",False,True

You deserve a lot more empathy and support, and I'm glad you posted here because we have plenty of that for you :)  What you're going through isn't in any way vain and you're absolutely not a ""monster"". This is a real problem and it's happening and it's painful whether you or she or anyone else thinks it's justified or not. Struggling with ""crash dieting"" would be a serious issue anyways, because habitually depriving yourself of food isn't something a person would do if they have a healthy relationship with themselves or their body. But it's clear this causes you a lot of turmoil and if it's impacting your life that negatively you deserve help for it. I think it's safe to say (and I of course don't mean to speak for you, it's just the case with most people) that your depression and anxiety play a major role in why your eating habits are like this. and on the flip side, eating disorders exacerbate depression and anxiety. It's a whole fucked up loop. So a lot of people need to manage the coping mechanisms they've developed to deal with their pain before they can even start to tackle the underlying causes. It's all part of the process and she needs to understand that.  it concerns me that she attacked you seeking help with such vitriol. i understand that a lot of people without eating disorders say really insensitive things sometimes because they don't understand us, so i never like jumping straight to the worst case. but what she said just seems more than that, really unnecessarily cruel and callous towards something that clearly is significant to you. your partner really should care about that, even if they don't get it.  i don't know what you said to her after this conversation, if anything, or how you've handled it with her since then. but imo it is REALLY important that you express how you feel about this, why it hurt, and why your eating disorder needs to be taken seriously. i truly wish you the best of luck with that and whatever happens or however you proceed from here, i just really hope you allow yourself to try healing in a supportive environment, because dynamics like these are only gonna set you back. if she can't change her attitude and be open to listening to and supporting you it is only gonna cause more problems both for the relationship and for your recovery.",False,False

Same with every other eating disorder. Still, you should go to a therapist to figure things out- why you eat the way you do. Going to therapy is NEVER wrong especially if you feel like you might need one. Your therapist will be able to tell you what your main problem is not your girlfriend. And if you feel like you have a bad relationship with food don't let anyone tell you otherwise your girlfriend isn't you, she can't tell you what your problems are and aren't.
