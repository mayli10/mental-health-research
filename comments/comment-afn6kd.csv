They KILL any craving for any food!   They make me think of food as disgusting because watching them eat is so gross.

Itâ€™s satisfying to me because I get to see food that I havenâ€™t seen before, and I get to watch people enjoy food that isnâ€™t just protein bars and Monster Ultra haha    ",False,False
