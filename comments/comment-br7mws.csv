They are properly balanced so it will help with the malnourishment and they are drinkable which is a lot easier on the stomach. You could take small sips throughout a couple hours instead of having to eat a meal. Please remember that hunger might kick in when you start upping your calories, don't be scared it's just hormones.",False,False

Maybe that will help your body get used to stuff like oatmeal and such. And from that point you can introduce small portions of other things until you feel comfortable eating them again :)   Good luck, you can do it! It will all be alright♡",False,False
