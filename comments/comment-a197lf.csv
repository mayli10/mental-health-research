Now it’s affecting how I interact with my family. They are all on my back about getting some form of help and it just makes me feel guilty. Like you said, just the understanding from people would be great",False,True

That was 4 years ago.   I restriction relapsed about six weeks ago. The first time I asked for help was three weeks into it. I had a panic attack and started bawling after I had gone to the store and hidden a scale at work. My partner convinced me to talk to my therapist, my therapist is setting me up with an ED therapy specialist, and I've set up an appointment with my doctor. I'm not dying I'm not underweight but I'm MISERABLE every waking minute of my life now is spent struggling with food. Struggling with this 15 year old demon inside me that woke up from a four year long sleep HUNGRY AGAIN TO CONSUME MY LIFE. Well it can frankly fuuuuuuuck off.   I'm getting help because I miss going out with friends, I miss being excited about my future, I miss thinking about sex with my boyfriend 5 days a week instead of CALoRiEs 5 days a week. I have shit to do and this thing needs to take a goddamn nap. But I had to first admit that I need MORE support than I have right now.   I guess that's okay. ",False,False
