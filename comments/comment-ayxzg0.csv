If this happens try to start again, as soon as you’re ready, without judging yourself for having slipped up. This bit is super hard to do, mindfulness techniques can help with this (I only discovered them after I’d already quit, but if I’d tried them back then maybe it would have been easier).  If mindfulness doesn’t gel with you, you could try the opposite technique; distraction. Every time you feel the urge, go for a walk instead, or pick a new skill or art to learn and practice that instead.
