Fair warning though, a friend of mine went there and came back an entirely different person, and not in a good way. I mean, she “recovered” from her ED but she seemed pretty much brainwashed. Like, it reminded me of when you see people who have joined a cult or something. Not sure how much of that was due to the treatment center vs how much of it was due to other mental health issues of hers, but the change in personality was quite disturbing.",False,False
