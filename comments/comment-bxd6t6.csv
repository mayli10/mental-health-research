I def play down how insecure I feel. People tell me my body is perfect and although I don’t feel that way, I still pretend so no one is the wiser. Regardless, it sounds shitty and toxic. I’ve recently gained a few pounds and I remember saying things like - I just want to lose 3 pounds - and truly meaning it and not knowing how obnoxious that sounds. The ED does make you compare yourself to everyone. So she might be a shitty person but she also just might be tone deaf.",False,False

But even if it was about something different, that’s a really poor quality for someone to have so I would avoid her.",False,False

If she's aware of your ed and continuously says things like that, I think she's being pretty insensitive. It's up to you if you want to unfriend her but I personally would not want to be around someone who makes me feel bad about myself.  &amp;#x200B;   Hope you're well and take care always. Hope you make the right choice!",False,False

She is using your vulnerability to make you feel bad in order to boost her ego. You deserve love &amp; people who are going to give you kindness &amp; be patient with the obstacles you have. You do not need someone who is going to exploit you— I feel like if you were to call her out on it then she would most likely gaslight you (since she’s clearly willing to make you feel inferior about something very sensitive to you.)  You can do what you want at the end of the day, since it is ultimately your decision.....but I really think what would be best for your headspace &amp; peace of mind is to spend time with other friends, family, just people who love you. I suggest you unfriend this person since it sounds somewhat toxic.....but again, if you don’t it’s your decision since the ball is in your court at the end of the day.   I really hope it gets better for you! You deserve good things",False,False

If she’s only friends with you because you’re “bigger” than her, it’s time you unfriend her. If she only keeps you around to satisfy her ego, she’s not a friend at all.
