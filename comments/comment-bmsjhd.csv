I didn't really see it much from her perspective either, but I think I understand a little now. And thank you for your empathy. This space has always been a safe space for me to read and vent.",False,True

Mostly because I'm bitter that I can't fucking eat. It doesn't make it right, but I see where she's coming from saying if you wanted to you would just do it. But I also see your perspective because I've suffered from BED too. Don't feel guilty, you can't change over a short period of time. It takes effort, time and slip ups here and there. **Progress is not linear!!!** It's just a shitty situation and I'm sorry that she doesn't understand you. At least you have us tho?",False,False

It might even be her AN that’s making her perceive your BED that way tbh.  Like I guess my AN has developed over the years into EDNOS because I go through really bad binge cycles and through restrict cycles. So I kind of understand both perspectives/thought processes. Kind of a BED-AN combo and I’ve got to say both of them are really difficult to control. When I’m in a binge phase it does feel like “ugh people who restrict should just EAT!” but when I’m restricting I do feel like “wow how can anyone eat that much, just don’t??”. Lol EDs are fucked no matter what one you have",False,False
