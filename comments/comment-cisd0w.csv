I have fairly wide hips in terms of skeletal structure, but now my shoulders are the widest part of me- and I don't even train for hypertrophy!   If I could do it over again, I would have stayed at a BMI of 19-20 to re comp. I feel better and train better at this weight. Going lower only hurt me. But my body image hadn't caught up with my weight loss, and I had nobody to tell me that.  I also just was going through a lot of things- at some point, ""I can make my curves go away"" became ""I can make my body go away"". And then things got really bad. XP",False,False
