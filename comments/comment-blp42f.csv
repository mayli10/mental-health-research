I‚Äôve spent fourteen months sticking INCREDIBLY strictly to a food schedule and I didn‚Äôt mess up even once until very recently. I was starting to get really down on myself for losing that steely self control but maybe I‚Äôm just going through one of those ‚Äúimpulsivity‚Äù phases.   It‚Äôs so weird though, you mention about impulse spending. For a while I was definitely using that to temper my obsessive urges around food - if I felt like I was gonna binge, or I couldn‚Äôt stop thought cycling about food, I would just go buy a bunch of shit online until I felt better. It was a really effective tool. I‚Äôve been much more controlled in that sense since the beginning of this year, and along with that I‚Äôve started having looser control around my food urges.

And she was like, yeah, that's how self control works- you can burn yourself out on denying impulses, especially if I'm naturally predisposed to being an impulsive person. It's literally changed my life and how I look at things, and helped me not feel so guilty when I feel like my life is falling apart when I've really just burned myself out. If I give myself a little less pressure I can keep my self-control phases for longer and my impulse phases shorter.   There's evidence that it's an actual physiological process that takes place when we deny ourselves an impulse, but there's a lot of debate whether that can be traced back from the denial of the impulse or rather just the stressors of the situation. This theory is called ""ego depletion"" if you're like me and find these things interesting enough to dive deeper into. Crazy stuff!",False,False

I know I‚Äôm gonna feel tired and dejected if I go hiking on an empty stomach, so on days when I‚Äôm going, I make myself eat a healthy, delicious bowl of oatmeal or yogurt with fruit and nuts, and even though it stresses me out initially, I always feel full of energy and motivation and just *life* once I get out on the trail.
