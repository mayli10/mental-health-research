I am not bipolar 1 at all, I do not need anything to address whatever those episodes are because I'm very self aware and have it under control. I need my depressive episodes and my PTSD under control. I don't really know if cymbalta is working for me anymore, I just like that it weakens my appetite. I have been worse this year emotionally, but I don't know if that is situational instead of my meds just not working anymore. as for vraylar... yeah, I read up on it, and uh... the side effects are concerning to say the least. her only reason for diagnosing me with ADHD is because I have trouble focusing, two common side effects of depression and PTSD ü•¥",False,True

So, you don't have to take meds you are not comfortable taking. I think you should get a second opinion... I know how hard it is to open up in the first place but maybe one way to reframe it is it can't be worse, right?",False,False

Like, some practitioners are open to the idea of a bipolar spectrum, and the idea that bipolar cycling can be present at the same time as persistent dysthymia. Explanation [here](https://psycheducation.org/diagnosis/bipolar-diagnosis-spectrum-or-yesno/). This is generally a good thing and means they are willing to think beyond the limits of the DSM. BUT. Your psychiatrist sounds problematic in other ways, which makes me worry that she's just incompetent. Because no, bipolar AND depression is not a typical dual diagnosis (unless, again, this person is educated about the bipolar spectrum idea). That's just odd.  I also find it concerning that she would diagnose you with six different things based on a single conversation.   Did she give you a reason for refusing the Lamictal and putting you on a much more side-effect prone antipsychotic?? If not, that's a big red flag for me. And no, Lamictal doesn't seem to be effective for mania, but if you're bipolar II, that inherently means you don't experience mania. (Instead you only experience hypomania - although even that can be suppressed if you have dysthymia on top of bipolar, making your cycles more like ""super depressed to basically normal to super depressed,"" instead of to ""depressed to hypomanic to depressed."") If she diagnosed you with bipolar ii, but also either said you're having manic episodes, or is using the word ""mania"" as a synonym for ""hypomania""....she's incompetent.   And why the hell did she switch you to Zoloft when you said you wanted to stay on Cymbalta? Also, if she's so concerned about mania, why would she keep you on an antidepressant at all? I agree with Dr. Phelps (the guy whose site I linked to) that bipolar people doing well on their antidepressant should consider staying on that medication, but that's a controversial move, and I'm skeptical this psychiatrist is on the vanguard of bipolar spectrum treatment.  I'm sorry you had this experience, and your instincts are right. Don't see a psychiatrist who doesn't listen. Which is most of them, it seems to me, so you may have to be persistent in your search.   Don't take Zoloft if you don't want to. Don't fill the Vraylar prescription, imo. Antipsychotics are less scary than the name suggests, but more heavy duty than many pdocs convey to patients, and I fear that if you experience side effects like weight gain, you'll relapse even harder. (Sidenote, if she thinks you have ADHD...why did she prescribe you a medication that has fidgeting as a common side effect? lmao)",False,False

It‚Äôs not ‚Äúreal‚Äù to a lot of people, professionals included. So a lot of what we end having to do is pushing and pushing until we get somewhere. Which is exhausting, but definitely worth it once you find someone who‚Äôs not a piece of shit. Like the psychiatrist I‚Äôve finally found has made up for all of the past bullshit I‚Äôve gone through. She listens, takes me seriously, and my insurance actually covers her. Lol.   So!

I've also been told it was odd for her to diagnose me with both bipolar and ADHD at the same time. ugh. I've just spent so long trying to get doctors to take my eating disorder seriously, it took 3 appointments for my previous doctor who gave me the anemia diagnosis to take in that I was saying I had an eating disorder, and I said it in very literal terms. then he told me ""don't eat so much and you won't feel the need to purge"" and I was so so angry because the problem is that I don't eat in the first place üòî",False,True

Personally, lamictal does cut my appetite a little bit; but not that much, really. Just kind of makes food taste a bit ‚Äúblah‚Äù. I don‚Äôt even think ‚Äúdecreased appetite‚Äù or ‚Äúweight loss‚Äù is a labeled side-effect? Otherwise, it does help a lot in balancing my moods without making me a zombie. So I don‚Äôt really see a reason to shut that down for you when it‚Äôs also the most gentle stabilizer on the market.   I‚Äôm a little surprised your psychiatrist would diagnose you with all of that and then blow you off- it also sounds like she didn‚Äôt adjust your meds at all? That‚Äôs a bit... odd. If you have the opportunity, I‚Äôd see about either fully switching or seeing a different psych for a second opinion. In my experience, I was always listened to when it comes to what I think would work best for me and my personal needs. Even if it ends up them suggesting something different. They would at least be like ‚Äúthat‚Äôs a good idea, but I think x might suit you better‚Äù and then tell me why.   So I‚Äôd maybe try to find someone who‚Äôs a bit more... receptive.",False,False
