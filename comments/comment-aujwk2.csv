Logically I know he'd be happy if I gained weight, but I think somehow I'm afraid of not being taken seriously if that happens?  I'm so sorry you're struggling. Just know you're not alone, I feel totally stuck as well. Could it be an option to talk to your doctor about how you find the weigh-ins triggering? ",False,False
