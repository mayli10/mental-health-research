That's why I never put out any particularly identifying information about myself on here. For instance, I used to be subbed to the food service worker's sub when I was waiting tables then I subbed to the retail one since I work retail now- but I use my alt account for those. And there's also the 50% chance that I could simply be making one, if not both, of those occupations up. There's no real way to tell.  Still, I get what you mean. I definitely drop subtle hints about my ED around certain irl people. It's a mix of a cry for help and that insatiable human curiosity of my wondering whether anyone would catch on either way. The latter being more tied to morbid curiosity.",False,False
