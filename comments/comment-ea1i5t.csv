I have really dry flaky skin on my top lip of all places and *really* repulsive looking eczema on my hands. I just can't seem to stay hydrated or get the eczema under control. It's so embarrassing and it really gets me down. No amount of drinking water or slapping on cream is enough.  However! I have found that hyaluronic acid tablets help quite a bit to make my skin retain more moisture. Not a miracle cure but I've noticed a definate improvement.",False,False

Retinol is great for treating fine lines.  Staying hydrated and moisturizing your face/ using a hydrating serum at least once a day helps with dryness.  Check the products you are using for sulfates, sulfides, and parabens- I find using natural makeup and moisturizers really helps my skin",False,False

My skin is always the first thing I piss off with my ED. It usually dries out and becomes a lot more sensitive. I’ve had dermatitis around my eyes before and then it was around my mouth for a long time. Hated that. My hair also thinned a TON when I was super anemic.  I’ve had my ED for like 8+ years at this point so I’ve been up and down with a lot of collateral damage. Like I’ve been anemic, right now I’m struggling with low blood sugar, I’ve lost bone density, hair, I developed an arrhythmia, gastroparesis, etc. They tend to come and go a bit depending on how well I’m doing and what behaviors I’m using. Like excessive exercise caused severe back problems and plantar fasciitis in both feet for over a year.   I highly recommend seeing a doctor to help make sure your body is okay. They can monitor your lab work to keep you safer and to help alleviate some of the symptoms/maybe even recover.",False,False
