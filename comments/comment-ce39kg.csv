Restricting eating helps me cope with flashbacks during the day. I know it’s wrong. And sometimes when I’m dissociated, I don’t feel anything, and I don’t feel like eating.  But restricting keeps me up most nights, and causes me severe insomnia. It also makes me more irritable and it’s turned me into a control freak. All I think about now is calories in and calories out, nothing else brings me “joy”.",False,False

In turn, when I’m deep in the ED my therapist has told me that I exhibit symptoms of OCD (I’m a very obsessive person in general, but not pathologically so except for when my ED is especially severe.)",False,False

I'm much more pissed off to be relapsing because it totally feels like something that's been foisted upon me.  On the one hand, that kept me in denial about what was happening for months.  On the other, I've been more inclined to seek treatment because of it.",False,False

My most recent episode of depression is probably the worst I’ve ever had and I think is what triggered my relapse. I lost weight unintentionally, got positive attention from said weight loss, and then the ed kind of snuck up and took over full force. And my ed and depression interact and make eachother worse as my self esteem plummets.   My ED is basically my coping mechanism for depression, anxiety, my marital problems, existential dread...you name it. I pre-occupy myself with this shit so I don’t have to think about hard life things and feel uncomfortable feelings.",False,False

It gives me something else to focus on. Since I started having GI problems last year I've had really bad health anxiety, for example, and focusing on my weight gives me something to direct my energy towards that isn't panicking about my health (despite the fact that if this relapse continues it will inevitably make my health issues worse). I also used to use ED behaviors as a form of self harm and a way to pacify suicidal ideation--the idea that I was slowly killing myself made dealing with  intense depression easier.  I don't think the rest of my issues are related/interact with my ED though.",False,False
