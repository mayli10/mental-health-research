I personally view red line goals, as basically setting yourself up for failure, because what you are basically saying is that I will achieve this, and then I will be doing A, B and C. When the truth is that, that is not how we function as humans, we have our good and bad days, and setting a hard red lined goal mark we need to cross at a certain period of time, is unachievable unless you are willing to sacrifice all of the other things  that make you happy.   What helps me, is thinking in a more realistic approach that would allow me to fail. So instead of saying I will achieve this thing in this period of time, I say I want this thing, and these are the steps I'm going to take to better myself without a time limit,and if I achieve this goal or the deadline comes before I achieved everything, it's no big deal. I started at A and now I'm at M, so I will just keep going at my own pace until I reach Z.",False,False

It might sound strange, but in a heartbreaking way this was so beautiful to hear, as it both brought tears to my eyes and a hopeful smile to my face.    Hearing of how you interact with your daughter and are so confident about it is so breath taking, it really does give me and I'm sure others hope.    I wish you and your daughter all the best.",False,False

I've always wanted children and can not imagine my life in the future without one or two of my own, that being said. I can fully relate to the fear of even the possibility of having children right now, because of what my EDs might pass onto my children and how it would effect them in the long term.   However, don't let the fears you have today, become the fears you have tomorrow. Stop setting red line goals, that state if I do this, I will get this and leave no room for failure. We have got to come to terms that we are human and that we will fail in our journeys, but that does not mean that we should give them up because of it. Stop putting so much pressure on what you need to do to become ""fit enough"" like a check mark list you need to complete and simply enjoy the journey getting there. Sure it might take a day, a week or even a month longer, but we can't simply stop living our lives because we fear what may come, instead of experiencing what has come into our lives.  I know that this may sound corny, and even redundant. But the fact that you are thinking of what you do not want your kids to experience if you choose to have them, is at least 50 % better then how much though the general population gives into having kids. The fact that you wish to protect them, is already a good sign.  My advice, talk to your partner, therapist if you have one or someone close to you in which you can confine your fears in about the matter. Remember we only regret the roads we do not take in live, don't let your EDs control your future simply because they are causing worries today.",False,False
