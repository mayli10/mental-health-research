It was my way of controlling what i ate, getting what I wanted, and making sure that no one knew I was eating junk food. Honestly, I get that this is such a sick thing to think, but I wish I had the balls to go back to that time when I was still recovering from my restriction period and I was as desperate for food to the point where I would steal. I feel like part of that is because, as someone else has stated, I don't feel like I'm unhealthy enough to deserve to get better.   I haven't explicitly told my psychologist about that, but I have the feeling he knows now, based on a previous session we had a while back.",False,False

But its still a drug and affects us and I know I probably abuse it but again its easy to blow it off. That kind of stuff is always hard to talk about though.",False,True

It didn’t help that we also talked about her concerns about me bordering uw and still losing and the possibility of a higher level of care ,False,False

I've had situations where she's asked me things and it takes me a while to force out an answer. Theres just so much of a mental block there.,False,True

I drink probably 1-2 liters of diet coke a day (yikes) plus 1-4 cups of coffee. She knows I drink a lot of caffeine but not to this extent. ,False,True
