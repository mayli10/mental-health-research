Trying to recover made me binge until l was overweight. Now I keep flip flopping between wanting to lose weight healthily (whatever that means) and just straight up relapsing. I’ve managed to lose some weight by channeling all my energy into being stressed about school lmao. I use to binge a ton and my stomach only felt right if it was distended beyond comfort. Slowly lowering the amount I eat has gradually made my cravings for that super full feeling better. I drink a lot of water and tea, and eat like 5 times a day (small amounts not full meals). Actually allowing myself to feel hungry instead of always immediately responding to hunger by eating is super triggering cause now I feel that high you get when restricting. I just want to lose weight without the mental repercussions that come with relapsing into extreme restriction again. But I also want to be super skinny again. Lmao I can’t win I guess",False,False

Fasting has given me guilt eating frequently or during certain time of the day :(   I should push myself but it feels sooooo wrong,False,True

It worked pretty well for me especially when it came to reducing binge frequency. Unfortunately I got impatient...,False,False

It helped me a lot to know what i will eat later. And it kinda fulfilled my binge craving, because i eat a lot of low cal veggies. And, but this is the ill part, i dont eat enough to reaxh my tdee, which calms me down.  Still, i wish you good luck. Stay safe.",False,False

Counting cals is what delved me into this world of restricting but I’ve never truly tried OMAD, like actually eating for OMAD. I’ve fasted a lot and then eat and it either turns into a binge or I feel like shit for eating anyway and consider it bingeing.    I’ll consider actually trying OMAD. Thank you again.",False,True

Like, if you can stop binging, you should lose weight while exersicing.  Bilding up muscles burns calories, Having muscles burns calories, not binging helps staying below your tdee.  And if not... did you try counting calories? There are healthy people who can clunt calories without apiralong into an ED, but well, dont know...   Or OMAD? Eating one meal helps people undereat because they dont reach with one meal their tdee?",False,False
