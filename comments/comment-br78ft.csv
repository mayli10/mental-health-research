I would like to add that you can break down muscle mass above the BMI's listed. I start breaking down muscle at a certain ""normal"" BMI range. In addition, patients that are experiencing trauma (e.g. car crash, organ problem, chronic illness; usually anyone in the hospital) will begin breaking down protein/muscle mass. This is why there are clinical dietitians.",False,False

They figure you will start losing weight a lot faster if this happens, because fat has more calories than protein.  +  Homeostasis is things settling into place instead of spiraling out of control. When your body gets smaller, you don't need as many calories, so if you keep eating the same amount, your weight loss should slow down until it stops at whatever weight matches what you are eating (homeostasis).  They are guessing that if your BMI is under 13, bodyfat is under 3kg, or nonfat body weight (weight minus bodyfat) is under 30kg, you will probably just waste away and die unless you increase your calories.",False,False

Under 13 BMI the body has to burn lean tissue to survive, but there is only 4 calories per gram of lean tissue.  It‚Äôs ‚Äúspeculated‚Äù (not proven but thought to) be the case that below 13 BMI more rapid tissue loss (weight loss) happens because in order to get 9 calories worth of energy the body must consume 2 grams of it‚Äôs mass instead of just one.  Therefore, this is the point where the body becomes inefficient at using tissue stores to stay alive and will rapidly decline as it eats its own tissues (including heart muscle)   ‚ÄúFailure of homeostasis mechanism‚Äù = failure of the ability for cells to renew themselves and the organs may fail.  Basically it‚Äôs saying that under 13 bmi becomes dangerous and critical, eek I‚Äôve been v close to that üò¨",False,False
