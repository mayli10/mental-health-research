Or if there’s only “safe” food. Lettuce, sugar free, cool whip, halo top ice cream, chick peas, epic bars and a few other things are all that I buy. Mostly veggies. Also, it’s easier to buy less food when you have no money. And easy to explain an empty fridge by saying that you’re too broke to buy real food. Or you just eat out often.",False,False

Since I have false bravery, I just binge on whatever snacks my parents buy",False,True
