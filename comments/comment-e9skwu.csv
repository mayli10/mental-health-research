I think it's just because he's too busy? He works outside so unless he gets fast-food it's hard to make a decent lunch because they have to eat on site or in their car and there's nowhere to warm anything up. He might toss in a pizza when he gets home, but if he ""doesn't feel like it"" he won't eat anything.    I think a lot of it was how he was raised, too. He was an immigrant so they didn't have a fridge full of food. You ate when you were hungry if at all.",False,False
