Of course, I was 28kg when I was 10 (\~130cm idk) and visibly chubbier than the year before that.  And whaddaya know, 2 months shy of 11 i started counting calories!!   i'd do anything just to go back to when i didn't know what a calorie was and i could eat food because i enjoyed it. my (probably but not really ED) has also led to binges which are the actual shittiest so yeehaw",False,False
