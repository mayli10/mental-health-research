I recently lost my old pup as well, and I can empathize with how gut wrenching and emotional it is. Itâ€™s terrible to have to say goodbye to a special friend. :[ honestly, I 100% ate chocolate cake and buffalo cauliflower tacos afterwards and didnâ€™t give a single fuck. I think the most important thing is just being nice to yourself right now. I have a restrictive eating disorder, so for me, allowing myself to emotionally eat after the whole ordeal felt like self care, and I just tried my best not to hold on to any guilt afterwards. Maybe if youâ€™re unsure of whether or not itâ€™s what you /really/ want, going somewhere that serves slices vs. ordering a whole pizza would calm the urge without going completely overboard. Just be kind to yourself. My heart is with you.",False,False

I donâ€™t even know what to say really but I know that seeing your dog poorly is the absolute most soul wrenching thing and my heart truly goes out to you. sending you all the hugs and best wishes in the world ðŸ’–",False,False
