Really I'm looking back at old pictures from this exact time last year and crying. I was small, not skinny, but small. My medium dress was big on me and now it's so tight. I can't wear stockings anymore. I look frumpy. I hide in dark jackets over sleeveless black zip ups over a black loose v neck. I thought I was fat when I could have just lost like 10 to 15 lbs. Its more than that now. I don't feel feminine anymore. All I wear is black. I hate it.",False,False
