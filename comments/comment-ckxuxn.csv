I also live with my family and there's seven of us, so it is a bit harder to sneak away and weigh myself. hope this helped!",False,False

I was letting a number dictate how my day was going to go. Or what kind of mood I was going to be in. For me, it came down to pure motivation. Acknowledging that weighing myself so frequently was literally the most detrimental think I was doing to my emotional/mental well being, and wanting to correct that behavior. I honestly just started challenging myself to leave it alone. At first the most I went was a whole day. Then it became 3 day. Etc, etc. now I can go about a week if I need to. If I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm going to like the number, I don‚Äôt torture myself by looking at it. It took me a few months to get to that point. But it‚Äôs really just a matter of recognizing the impulse, and deciding to try and go against it.",False,False

However. I have kept mine and the only way I keep myself accountable for not touching it is with a silly little sticker chart like the ones they make for kids üòÖ It works great, I hate to see a sad face on the chart so I don't weigh myself.  It also helps to remind yourself that whether you weigh yourself or not, your weight is not gonna be different compared to if you had weighed yourself. Your weight can fluctuate 5lbs either way in one day. The results after that first morning weigh in are completely irrelevant to your weight loss. You won't see the progress until the day after at the earliest, and even then you may be disappointed by the minimal changes on the display.",False,False

I asked my partner to hide our scale because I was doing something similar to you. I set a guideline that I can ask for the scale once a week if I feel like I really need to. It helped break the cycle and still give me the security of knowing it‚Äôs still there. Maybe ask someone to do the same if you live with someone or have a friend you feel comfortable asking?,False,False
