I've got recordings of verbal abuse that she is aware that I made. I do agree that it's not okay but part of me does realize that it's her ED doing it and not her true feelings. I will look into some counseling for my own self. Also it is of note they I suggested counseling/therapy and I never pushed or repeatedly suggested it. Also we're both in recovery for drugs and alcohol and her sponsor is a counselor for ED so luckily she really suggested the therapy and I think that hit closer to home than me suggesting it. Her next session is in almost two weeks and it can't get here soon enough. Thank you for the reply.,False,True

If there is abuse happening in the relationship that's not ok, yes it's a mental illness no that's not an excuse.  You should seek help for yourself. Get a therapist for you alone. Encourage her to get help but you need some one there to help you more then strangers on the internet.",False,False

Their site also has info about eating disorders and about seeking help/treatment.   It can be challenging to support someone with an ED. My significant other struggles to relate to my issues because they’re so radically different from his own reality. We’ve slowly reached a stable place as I’ve found outside help that’s effective and we’ve established how I’d like to be supported. It’s been a messy journey that was really hard on both of us (and I was so lost in my pain that I didn’t even understand how hard it was on him until I started getting healthier). He even went to individual therapy himself for awhile. I hope your wife can find help that works for her and sending best wishes for the both of you.,False,False
