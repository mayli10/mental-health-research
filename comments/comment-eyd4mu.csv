Over the years I guess the people I live with have gotten used to me leaving the kitchen and saying ""I'll be back when you're done"" have trained them to either tell me the kitchen is clear, or to walk in, see me and then leave and come back.   And they just think I really hate being crowded out in the kitchen, they are none the wiser.",False,False
