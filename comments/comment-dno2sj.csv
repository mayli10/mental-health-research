It's a hard thing to accept, but she's extremely unlikely to change. I don't know her of course, but I know that it took me many, many years before I realized my mom was abusive. Once the veil lifted, I was able to stop blaming myself for her shortcomings and develop a whole new appreciation for the strength and resilience I have to make it through the bullshit. Honestly, I know it's hard, but if you're in recovery and are finding these kind of comments really affecting your progress... there's no shame in setting boundaries and distancing yourself. You're WAY stronger than you think.",False,False

My mom isn't abusive at all she just doesn't think about what she says sometimes. I've tried to get her to understand some of the things she says but I've just given up and joke right back at her. I'm glad you're in a much better place now! I hope that allows you to heal ‚ô°",False,True

If you're of age and able to work, I hope you can find a place of your own sooner rather than later.   My mom was abusive too and I moved out 5 years ago.

It was written by a person who had been obese and lost a ton of weight, so it was basically a diet book.  But what this lady did was she started paying attention to how other people around here were eating and behaving.  And if she saw them doing something different from herself she would just ask them what they were doing and why (like why are you just picking at the appetizers at the cocktail party, or choosing this one over that one, that sort of thing).  And then she just tried to emulate those behaviors and learn from there.  I doubt I could find it again in the absolute ocean of diet books in existence, but I was glad that I found that book when I did.  And it still sounds like good advice.",False,False

It's hard to reframe my view of food when no one in my family has a healthy view/relationship with it, so I'm always constantly amazed and jealous of my friends who just know how to est normally and I'm like how can someone just /do/ that?

Like a big factor of my BED forming was watching her binge when I was younger, and she's always been overweight/obese as I've known her, despite being fit and skinny as a teen.
