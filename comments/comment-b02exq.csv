That doesn't warrant a competition between you two, you are both attractive.    Second of all, everyone has situations where they don't want to do anything sexual. People aren't ready for that or in the mood for it, or don't feel comfortable in their body all the time. Of course it's peoples' right to break things off if they choose, but I know the feeling that maybe you should have ignored your discomfort and just let the other person do something sexual with you so they'd stay- no. If you don't want to do something, that's okay no matter what the reason for that is and you shouldn't force yourself if you're uncomfortable.   Trust me, I know the struggle with body image and getting intimate with someone but forcing yourself into it because you want their approval/ you don't want them to leave doesn't improve the issue (I know from experience). The thing that helps most is working on your insecurities before getting to that point, and finding a partner who is understanding and okay with going slowly if needed. Not saying there's anything wrong with him or you- sometimes things just don't work out and that's okay. You don't need to beat yourself up over it. This is a normal part of starting to date people and finding out how that all works.   Thirdly, he likely doesn't care about your weight, only you do. He already found you attractive before, remember? Plus, he has a new girlfriend who he's probably focused on now. When I had an active eating disorder, I had these fantasies too about becoming skinny and confident and impressing everyone but the truth is, people mostly don't notice/ care and if you have an ED you often don't look healthy and you have low self esteem no matter your weight.    It sounds like you're a teen. I was similar when I was in high school. And let me tell you, I messed up with boys a lot and boys messed up with me. I still cringe about those situations, but that's just normal. You're still learning how relationships work and who you're compatible with and that's okay. What's most important now is that you can learn to let that situation go. It might be awkward running into him, but remember that he has found someone new so you're not in any place to ""compete"". If I may give you advice, the sooner you focus on beating the disordered thinking and working on yourself, the sooner you will become confident and be in a situation where you can feel good about having sex with someone. (And always have safe sex, but you probably know that already :) )  You have beauty and value that is entirely separate from your weight. Nobody else but you focuses on your weight as much as you do. And it is so much more freeing to be able to think about other things, and see other people (especially girls) with love and admiration instead of jealousy or feelings of inferiority. Trust me, I've gone from anorexia to binge eating as a teen and now that I'm in my early 20s, I've made huge strides towards beating those behaviors with years of work and lots of self love, and lots of fallbacks.   You are worth investing love and care in yourself. You deserve to be healthy and feel confident, and you deserve to have a happy relationship (and sex that makes you feel good and that you 100% feel comfortable with). You can do that even if it's a lot of work. And it's worth it. I would never trade my lowest weight or the opportunity to have huge binges for the mindset and body I'm in now, even though I'm still recovering.   I hope you have someone in real life you can talk to this about, maybe a counselor or even a therapist (therapy really helped me put things into perspective). I wish you all the best. I don't mean to come across as patronizing so I'm sorry if I did. My heart hurt for you when I read your post because I saw so much of my younger self in you, and I know how tough that time was. I hope I can make a small difference in your life and give you the advice that I'd love to give my younger self.",False,False
