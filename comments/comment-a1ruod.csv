I‚Äôm pretty sure most patients prescribed a very low calorie (VLC) diet are inpatient or otherwise bedridden. Think severe cases of diabetes and people ala My 600 Pound Life.   I‚Äôm not 100% sure that they don‚Äôt prescribe this for functional obese people with diabetes, but I‚Äôd highly doubt it since, like you‚Äôve touched on, 800 calories is extremely low.",False,False

Not saying your wrong, I could definitely just be missing it. And I guess it says they get support after the program, so maybe I jumped the gun. I'm willing to just assume they are bedridden lol. Tbh that makes a lot more sense to me.   I guess that is a different story, if they're inpatient and bedridden vs if they're type 1 or 2 obese with diabetes. ",False,False

Usually these patients aren‚Äôt just a little obese they‚Äôre morbidly obese and need to change fast or else health consequences will catch up- is this isn‚Äôt already an attempt to reverse consequences. This is also usually done in the hospital with doctor supervision and very little exercise or movements. Many of these patients are bed ridden.   Again, it‚Äôs not perfect by any means, but it‚Äôs sort of a necessary evil and I believe as their weight goes down and their major health problems subside they go on more ‚Äúnormal‚Äù diets and learn about nutrition more.   Then again, I‚Äôm not a doctor so I may have missed some things. Anyone can fee free to correct me üôÇ",False,False

Reminds me of AN treatment.... They're treating a symptom, not the cause. They get your weight to normal and go ""u r cured,"" but the body and my relationship with food is much more complicated than that.   Like. You're not teaching them healthy eating methods. There's a ledger of how different foods affect your blood sugar (sorry I forgot what it's called), they're not teaching patients which foods will have the best impact on their blood sugar... Which is truly what's at the heart of diabetes. So after they go off their medically supervised crash diet, they have no tools to maintain their loss.   Also... What? Just because someone is obese it's okay to feed them less than a toddler needs? Fuck. If I decide to do that to myself it's one thing, but people trust doctors and might think that shit is healthy and okay. Or that those are normal portions. ",False,False
