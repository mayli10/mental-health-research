I consider mine long because it’s usually longer than my normal peach fuzz, and it’s kind of in thicker patches, if that makes sense. Like if I run my hand over it it’s a different texture than the rest of my body hair. And it sticks out a lot more in areas, like it’s frizzy? Idk most of mine ends up on my back so I don’t feel/see it too much LOL   Otherwise, yeah, pretty much everyone has the standard peach fuzz. If it’s super crazy noticeable, it’s probably lanugo, yeah. Don’t feel dumb! Tbh I never notice my lanugo since I shave most of my body, anyway. Lol.",False,False

Because everyone has hair on their face, normally.   🤷🏻‍♀️ worst case, most aestheticians offer facial waxing sessions. I’ve had it done, it’s not terrible but you do break out a bit. But no hair, so it’s whatever you wanna deal with.",False,False
