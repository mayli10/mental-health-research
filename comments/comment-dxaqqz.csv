Practicing with closed eyes is a great idea, as well as the modifications. I restrict very low and the instructor today was all about downward dog... not a good combo lol",False,True

I’ve done everything you described so many times I can’t count. I do yoga with my eyes closed the entire time now because otherwise I WILL be looking at the skinniest girl in the class and comparing myself to her the whole time.  I also don’t do certain poses when I’m low restricting, because my blood pressure is so low I feel crappy when I do certain things. I do Child’s pose instead of Downward Dog, and bridge instead of wheel, and things like that.",False,False
