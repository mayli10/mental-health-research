On the topic of ED podcasts, on stitcher there is a really interesting podcast called ED matters. It is done hosted by Kathy Cortese who is a psychologist. She brings in other doctors, psychologist, and recovery specialists to talk about different aspects of eating disorders such as comorbidity, SUDs, different recovery methods, new studies, etc. I dont know if it is morbid or not, but I just love hearing about the science behind what is going on in my brain and how people try to fix it.   Definetly adding ED recovery to my list though! Thanks!",False,False
