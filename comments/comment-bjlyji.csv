The absolute best person to see is a dietitian that specializes in eating disorders. I am definitely biased as a dietetic intern, but I think its a major problem among health professionals when on specialist oversteps their area of expertise. For example, I would never go into detail about how to help an injury, diagnose something that isn't in my scope of practice (e.g. diabetes), or provide trauma counseling to a patient. I think if you are able to afford a dietitian, it would be great to set up appointments. Otherwise, I think the PT could end up being potentially harmful because he is not trained regarding how to be mindful and accommodating to an eating disorder.",False,False
