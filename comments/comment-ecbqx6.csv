I donâ€™t mean to sound like a Debbie downer but I just want to let you know that laxative abuse can actually have a really negative affect on your body (not just ruining your insides) I saw a lady a few months ago on tumblr who had posted about her laxative abuse and how it had fucked up her stomach so much that it was now poking out of her to the point she looked a little pregnant.  Please be careful and wary! I hope I donâ€™t sound like Iâ€™m being mean i just want to let you know what Iâ€™ve seen:) xxx,False,False
