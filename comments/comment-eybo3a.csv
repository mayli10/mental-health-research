I read it a few times over because it made me so happy. I don't expect perfection in recovery, but what I do hope for is progress in a healthy direction. Thank you for the validation. It means a lot! You are so kind!",False,True

You have a different route that's working to improve your relationship with food than most, and the traditional medical paradigm isn't equipped to deal with people whose journey has to take a different route. While it's unconventional, it is definitely valid, and **the fact that it tends towards being a healthier relationship with eating is something you have the right to celebrate and be proud of**. Never let perfection be the enemy of progress. Needing to have control is absolutely valid, and if you can do it in a way that is healthy for your body and mind, I see no reason to stop you, as long as you don't backslide into actively harmful behaviours again (make sure your social contacts, not to mention your own self, hold you to non-judgemental honesty).  I have high hopes for you Birdie. But I recognise that you are a human. There will be false starts, and there will be falls. But every fall is a chance to get back up, to learn from your mistake and build yourself stronger.",False,False

I can feel my rigidity around food lessening, and it wasn't like that when I was in treatment. I feel safer. Proud of you for six months purge-free, btw! That's quite the achievement! It's nice to hear I'm not the only one who feels this way.",False,True

I’ve been self recovering for a year now. Been purge free for six months. I believe it works if you have the right mindset, but it is VERY easy to relapse. Since I gained a shit ton of weight now all I want I restrict again. I would never have gone that far in recovery if I didn’t take things into my own hands though",False,False
