Ate a bite of it and god it was so gross and disappointing. Tossed them all (only made 5 so I guess not that bad but still a waste :(...) Decided it wasn't worth the calories even wif I could cover up the taste / texture and I made toast instead.,False,False

It's SO frustrating that on paper, to a normal person, EDs are so simple to understand and fix. I understand what's behind it (I think) and even how to stop it (maybe).

I think food would have to taste closer to ""bad"" than just ""average"" for me to spit it out. Most other times I would at least finish the bite I'd taken, but I probably wouldn't eat the rest if it wasn't worth the calories. Especially if I know there's something else I'd rather eat. It also depends on if something isn't to my preference. If I'm expecting something to be really tart and it's just sickeningly sweet I would spit it out, even if it's still good. And if cake is really dry I'd probably spit even if the taste was okay.  My binge eating used to compel me to finish anything I started eating even if it tasted straight-up revolting, so I still struggle with not finishing things that are just average. But I'm more protective of my calories these days so I'm not above it lol.  That said... I think a lot of non-disordered people will also stop eating things that they aren't enjoying ""enough"". Spitting out the bite in their mouth might take it a bit far, but I think a lot of people would put back a cookie or a muffin etc if they weren't really feeling it.",False,False
