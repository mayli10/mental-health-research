That’s the weight that’s coming off. I was fluctuating between 4-6 lbs every b/p session and it was all a lie.   I’m really sorry to hear that... not that I’m encouraging purging or passing on tips, but I noticed that the purple listerene helps my mouth and teeth feel better faster. The aching doesn’t stop, but my gums don’t feel as raw. ",False,True

Have you stopped? Or managed to slow it down?  I totally get what you mean, but eating healthy foods and purging them seems so pointless. Like you obviously do it so you feel like you can just eat whatever foods you want and not have to face the consequences of weight gain and stuff. It’s such a slippery slope. ",False,True

That being said though, this happened last time, and eventually I lost control over everything and slowly started to gain.",False,False

Turns out I'm not as good at purging as I think, and every time I did manage to get enough up to cause weight loss, I somehow convinced myself eating something without purging it would be okay. That combined with the stuff I failed to purge meant I was still on average digesting around 1400 calories every day.  Obviously I could lose if I purged everything while keeping the caloric density low and not eating junk food, but that would basically be the same as just restricting and not worth having puffy cheeks and damaged teeth. There's no quick fix or easy way out.",False,False
