Would you have access to a dietitian and individual therapist? Does it include a supported meal 3-5 days a week and a few groups on those days? Usually IOP is offered at least 3 days a week, sometimes 5 for 3-4 hours. That might be a good fit for you if you would still have individual therapy and sessions with a dietitian. If you would not have access to those and would only have the group treatment available, it would be much more difficult. I'd try IOP if you are deemed stable enough and can get therapy and an individualized meal plan due to your concerns about lack of privacy, etc on IP unit. If IOP is not enough support, they can step you up to IP if PHP isn't available. If the hospital says you are not stable enough to start in IOP, see if you can do a time-limited stabilization in IP with set plan to transition to IOP. Talk with the program ahead of time about your reasoning for this, how motivated you are to get to IOP and why you think that is a better setting for you, and try to determine a timeline with IP for a short stay. Ask them to contact the IOP to coordinate your transition.   Good luck and please ask more questions if you have them about what to expect in an IP or IOP or what to pack if going to IP.",False,False
