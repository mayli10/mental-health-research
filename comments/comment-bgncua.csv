Please, please, please just go to the hospital.   But, this is what I do, and you could die if you do it, i don’t know your body. My body is different from yours.    Try to eat some veggie stew, and maybe some fruit. Work up to steamed/stir fry veggies in the next few days. Continuing with the fruit.  Then have maybe a smoothie and I like to eat a spoonful or a few of peanut butter and if I’m feeling up for it a banana with peanut butter and honey. Just a peanut butter sandwich is nice too because the bread can help keep you from having the shits, I like to add honey as well. Or throw it all together for a peanut butter honey banana sandwich, especially good on toast. Continuing eating the stew/veggies/fruits You could go for avocado toast with salt too. Fucking delicious. Next, oatmeallllll is the bombbbb.  Gradually, I stress, gradually add in more healthy foods.   BUT You have to know your body.  What works for me won’t necessarily work for you, it depends how long you’ve been fasting and your personal biochemistry.   You could die if you follow what I’ve said or anything you read online. Seriously.  Please, I stress, please, just go to the hospital.",False,False

It sounds like your life is on the line, the stakes don't get higher than this.  I think you know what you need to do. And it's going to suck but it's better than being dead.  I really think you should call the ed helpline for wherever you live (they're stickied to this sub I think, or you could google it). Or a suicide helpline. Maybe both.",False,False
