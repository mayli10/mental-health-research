If I pick meals that have lean meats and vegetables, I'll still be full and fueled without a ton of calories. You guys are really giving me hope! Thank you!",False,True

Even if that includes a cookie or ice cream here or there.   You can only do so much damage in a week, and the guilt is less if you still choose healthy options versus going full out glutton mode.   Also, you’ll be walking miles and miles a day at Disney, just remind yourself you are burning off a lot of the excess!",False,False

Then you don't need to feel like you're committing to a whole vacation of not counting, but instead just dipping your toes in to see how it goes.",False,False
