I think it sounds concerning because that’s a pretty low heart rate.,False,False

Being in the high 40s is something to be concerned about and see a doctor. Obviously fitbits aren’t medical grade; but regardless, your heart is not something to put off. A doctor won’t think you’re stupid. Trust me. They see actual stupid. They’d rather you come in just in case, too.",False,False

I wasn't sure how much was due to restriction and how much was due to exercising, but a resting HR below 60 is considered bradycardia and can be a cause for concern to medical professionals. I didn't encounter many [visible to me] issues from this except getting dizzy when I stood up and being cold/sometimes having blue fingernails.",False,False
