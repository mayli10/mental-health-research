I‚Äôm currently doing OMAD, because I honestly find it really easy to not eat during the day! It‚Äôs just when I get home, I cook a really nutritious, healthy meal for me and my bf, big portions but under my TDEE, I eat the huge plate of food and it just doesn‚Äôt satisfy me! My brain wants more straight away! I think television is a huge trigger for me, it actually kinda mentally hurts me to sit and watch tv without eating something, like it doesn‚Äôt feel natural for some reason.   And omg the 5kg thing is so true!! At just half a stone heavier than I am now I know from past experience I can maintain that weight without barely thinking about it! I just developed BED due to a big trauma in my life and then started throwing up (at first to lose the weight I gained, then after that to compensate from the binges that were happening again), and now I‚Äôm stuck with this. But I just wanna get back to how I was.  I am going to set my recovery start date and see my gp about therapy maybe? It‚Äôs something I‚Äôve been too wishy washy about in the past but I really really want this. I mean I hate my body anyway and I‚Äôm nearly underweight, so I might as well hate my body while being healthier lol.   Now I‚Äôve rambled too much lol, thank you so much for chatting it‚Äôs really helped ‚ù§Ô∏è",False,False

I absolutely promise you from my heart as good as purging felt (and it did feel good ngl) having lived both ways now i feel much better in my body and i did not realise how ill i felt all the time, and how it was ruining my beauty along with health, i totally thought i was fine, now on the other side i can see I‚Äôm much better off now   The only thing i will say is that there will probably be some nasty idiots who will comment because your weight will fluctuate a bit obviosly, not a lot as i said i didn‚Äôt turn into some huge elephant, but a bit especially during the early stages, i found it very hard to deal with people commenting on my body so be prepared for that, also comfy clothes and sweatpants are your friend, in a very loose fit, the last thing you need is a tight band arround your middle   I had times i just didn‚Äôt want to look at myself, BUT i knew i was playing a dangerous game statistically speaking and i dint want to end up dead so it was do it or nothing   Some days if i just couldn‚Äôt deal i had some ensure and some dry crackers and a multivitamin, i did absolutely avoid some dishes i knew i would purge like pho soup or yogurt, personally i don‚Äôt think there is anything wrong with having safe foods and foods to avoid at the start, you can always expand your foods later when and if you feel up to it   I‚Äôm so excited for you and sorry if I‚Äôve rambled on its just very close to my heart, i did it all alone and I understand you and care about you, and anyone reading this I‚Äôm not just some dr or idiot saying ‚Äúblah blah just stop!‚Äù I‚Äôve lived it, I know!  Also if you want to have a chat to your GP about it, just so they can keep an eye on you, you might need some specific vitamins (I was very low on some things) and don‚Äôt even bother with a scale for awhile untill the bloating goes away",False,False

Yeah i literally took a pregnancy test because I could not believe I could be that big just from food,  i would eat nothing in the morning but still be huge :( I really struggled to be naked around my boyfriend and since I am so used to my super dehydrated stomach I couldn‚Äôt handle it.   I know it‚Äôs silly but the only think stopping me from recovery at the minute is my first holiday in years is coming up soon, and I know I will just relapse because of the bloating, so I am saving up all my mental resources and am gonna go for a full recovery attempt when I get back, luckily I then get winter to cover up!  I have only been struggling with this for 3ish years I think? And I feel like I‚Äôve messed my brain up because I have no self control anymore :( but the fact you managed to recover after so long is so amazing and really gives me hope! Did you find the urges to binge ended up stopping after you quit purging? Thank you so much for your reply ‚ù§Ô∏è",False,False

Unfortunately for me if I‚Äôm really honest the super crappy bloating (as in painful to eat, body not used to pooping, everything hurts and this sucks) lasted about 3-4 months, and then about a year after that i started to not look like a beach ball with toothpick legs    I will say however that everyone‚Äôs body is different and remember id been purging since i was 12 and stopped in my early 30s, so id been at it a looooong time ( I cried when the Dr added up the years for a report, i felt so sad i spent so many years hurting myself)   The timeline for you to feel better if you are younger and have not been at it for quite as long id image would be much faster.   Despite how uncomfortable i felt initially and how everything was just different and weird about my body for a good chunk of time, i still say stopping purging is the BEST thing i have ever done for myself, hands down, i have so much more life in me now, and I‚Äôm not the huge whale id imagine i would become haha  If you have any other questions please ask ill try my very best to help you",False,False

Expect your face to slim down (I did not realise how puffy I was all the time)   Don‚Äôt be surprised if you actually drop weight  (I never binged per se and unfortunately started restricting a bit to help me stop purging)   Expect to really really have to fight the urge to vom  Going for walks or doing push ups was the best for me   Don‚Äôt be hard on yourself if you do purge remember everyday is a new day   Try your best, look at pictures of the damage it does to your body..I‚Äôve posted here before a very graphic picture of a girl who died over the toilet was the thing that helped me stop because I‚Äôd hate to be found like that it‚Äôs horrible but it‚Äôs a potential reality   It‚Äôs bloody hard to stop and might be worthwhile to talk to your gp just so they can monitor you   You don‚Äôt need to go to a fancy retreat you can do it yourself the kicker is you have to want to do it really from your heart   Best of luck hun xx",False,False
