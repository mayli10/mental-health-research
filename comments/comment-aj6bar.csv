When I'm too tired to get real food, and feel bad, I'll finally get some food that is 'worth it. Because I'm hungry I can justify starting to eat it, but once I start I can't stop.  Wish I could write an essay psychoanalysing my eating behaviour instead of what I actually have to write about.",False,False

Or I would've gotten a lasting whoosh by now.   But that's life, I guess. I'm confident that I'll finish cutting the extra gain and then get back to bulking. My big fear isn't gaining an extra one or two pounds; it's letting myself down and accepting it... presumably again and again until I'm fat again. But I haven't done that this time... maybe I'll eventually internalize that I will never do that, and it's gonna be ok. ",False,False

This was years ago, but I was talking to them about weight and such and their vision of ideal weight is literally underweight (55kg at 173cm) and the ""time they were fat"" is 70kg... Which is just 2kg shy of my high weight - you know, the one I was FORCED to get to in recovery???   I mentioned that, and they immediately got defensive and said I was dying and they are right, I'm wrong, blah blah blah... But my low weight was probably not lower than theirs and my high weight too high and it's just such an offense. They really went at me when they shoved me in that fucking recovery centers. They would point out what was ugly and boney and too skinny on me. They would say I was ruining my body, not trying hard enough to recover, wasting their money (I DIDNT WANT TO BE THERE???), wasting their time. In the first WEEKS of recover they would bring me to their friends house and show how skinny I was and then come to me and tell me their friends agreed that I was ugly skinny.   And me? The coward? The idiot? I went from a wonderful happy diet to binging. My stomach hurt, I had constant gas. I would only eat things I deemed healthy but in my rush and anxiety to gain weight and escape the hell of the recovery program, I would binge on 1000+ calories of nuts and hummus multiple times a week. And if I complained of pain, I was a liar.  I'm just angry I had to go through all this shit when I was just in the moderately underweight zone. I wonder if it wasn't me, but them, that had a problem, and they didn't want me to be thin and just wanted to control me. Im furious that they GET to weigh less, they GET to diet, they GET to not have to worry about being locked into the house, pulled out of school, have their life and aspirations RIPPED AWAY for losing weight.  It's so unfair. It's so, so, so unfair and now my high weight seems so so FUCKING fat and I'm PISSED again! Usually I can think about other things but I opened this stupid box in my head and ugh.   Someday I'll write a post describing my whole ordeal to see if anyone can understand the situation. I'll be deleting this comment in a few hours, just until I know someone out there has read it.",False,False
