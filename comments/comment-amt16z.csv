And for a while after, I can see that life is more enjoyable and fulfilling when I focus on myself as little as possible, and focus on other people more.  However, because I have an eating disordered brain, this only lasts for a little while before I'm back to obsessing about what my body looks like, even though it's only a temporary vessel.  ED sucks.",False,False

The only full length in our house is one we have leaned against a wall, and I’m almost positive it’s fake glass (if that makes a difference).   We’ll be out and I’ll catch a glimpse of myself in a different, more flattering mirror and I’ll be like “is that what I really look like???” But I can’t even tell which is real anymore, TBH.

The one I have now is a door hanging mirror, maybe putting a new one in a more stable spot will help.   I feel dumb for how bad this messed me up but i'm glad there's a community of people who understand. What should be an extremely minor event (time to get a new mirror) has somehow put me into a ridiculous panic/trigger spiral... because of course, if one mirror is jacked up, every mirror is wrong, and I can never trust any reflection ever again :/ ED brain is dumb.
