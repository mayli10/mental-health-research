Even if it’s sort of your choice to throw it up in the moment, it’s not your choice to feel the urge to do so.  It’s like saying being suicidal isn’t a choice. The act of suicide can be a choice but the condition/state of being suicidal isn’t.",False,False

People without EDs don’t experience anything like those compulsions, and even if you do manage to will yourself not to give in *once*, willpower is a finite resource and you will eventually run out",False,False
