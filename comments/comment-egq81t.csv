You want to eat more, and restricting your food choices will make that harder.  One thing you can start with is logging everything you eat in a week to see exactly how much you normally eat and then adjust your intake from there. If you search ""TDEE calculator"" you can input your height, weight, and activity level to get a rough estimate of how many calories you're burning in a day. To gain weight you need to eat more than you burn. Taller people do burn more calories by simply existing, and certain life styles can have you eating sparsely without realizing.  Eating consistently is important. Try setting alarms for snack time throughout the day. Protein bars are really good for this and even marketed to help with weight gain. They are calorie dense meaning you can eat more of it before getting full, and they have a lot more calories than say if you filled up on leafy greens. Some protein bars will have 300-400 calories a piece but can fit in your palm. You can eat 1 or 2 of those a day and see if that helps make a difference. There are lots of other good foods for this. Various nuts, butter etc. They also have protein shakes you can drink through the day best made with something fatty like milk.",False,False

The most important thing for weight gain is to eat more than you burn(find out your TDEE and depending on how fast you want to gain, add a few hundred calories to your daily intake). Since you're pretty tall, you probably burn more than the average person + I'm assuming your activity level is high or you're not eating enough.  So idk about you but lots of skinny people say 'I can't gain weight no matter how much I eat' however, if you tracked their calories you can probably see why they're not gaining. Some people tend to think just because they aren't hungry that means they ate enough. But that's not always the case. So I suggest tracking how many calories you burn walking, exercising, existing(so essentially your bmr) and weighing your foods to see exactly how many calories you're getting per meal. You might be eating way less than you think.  And if you struggle to increase your caloric intake through solid foods/snacks/meals etc, opt for juices or even better, protein shakes. Liquid calories are very easy to go as crazy as you'd like with, and it's very easy to get calories from them.  And don't feel bad about your natural body type. You probably burn a LOT which is great, meaning you can eat more and burn more than the average person. Make use of that and take it easy on yourself.",False,False
