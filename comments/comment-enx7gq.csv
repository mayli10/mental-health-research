I have no self control when it comes to food ðŸ¤£ I seem to sit around 1500 cal a day when I eat what I want D: but if I just get some self control I bet I can get there! :) (also don't be afraid to up your calories when you're going to the gym!

I am currently 4lbs from the goal but i do not think it will be enough, because Iâ€™m still so huge right now. I started going to the gym to hopefully change my body comp but i am so scared to up calories.   It wonâ€™t take much to lose! I started out overweight at 157 and it only took me about 6 months. I think you could do it pretty quickly! Itâ€™s not unattainable and itâ€™s also still in a healthy weight range.",False,False

I was 19-20 the last time I weighed that too. I feel that, constantly wanting to lose that last bit and do what I can to get back to that (even tho I wasnâ€™t being v healthy then).
