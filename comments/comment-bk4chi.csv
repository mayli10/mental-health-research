I’m in therapy and it’s helped quite a bit, but sometimes something will trigger a memory and I’ll be right back there in that house again. My life now would be unrecognizable to child-me, in the best way. It’s *because* things are better that I can finally peel back the scar tissue and extract the things no longer necessary to me.",False,True

I didn’t know about it and I’ll definitely poke around a bit!   I am in therapy. I haven’t discussed my grandmother yet much with her because I’ve been trying to recover from my ED, and memories of dear old grandma are severely triggering. She’s been trying to help me build momentum in recovery before starting to tackle the abuse.",False,True

That's a lot to have to carry with you.  You didn't deserve any of it.  Multi-generational trauma is a bitch.  May I suggest r/CPTSD? At the very least I hope you're in therapy with a really, really good, trauma informed therapist.",False,False
