Most nights I’ll just get to the point where I’m too lazy to get up from bed, and then will just think about food instead, maybe get a popsicle or hard candy (if you can handle people calling you an old lady, hard candies are great snacks imo.  Small amount of cal per piece, and you can suck on it for like a half hour so you constantly are burning that “I want flavor in my mouth” torch).  I just suggest right after/before you smoke (depending on your method) get under some blankets, put your laptop on your lap, and start a show.  By the time you may want a snack, you may be too comfortable to want to move",False,False

But lately weed hasn't given me munchies, it kinda makes me forget about food. I would suggest (if possible) trying to smoke strains that on Leafly.com don't feature hunger as one of the main effects. Also sorry if I don't make sense... I'm high rn. 😂",False,False
