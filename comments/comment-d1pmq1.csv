I didn't look like a child anymore, and I think they just wanted to make sure I wasn't uncomfortable/teased. Of course it had the total opposite effect lol, but I can sort of see what they were trying to do.",False,True

I'd gotten very tall very quickly, but it was what they expected based on various height/weight charts from when I was a baby? IDK. It's one of those things where in hindsight they realised that it wasn't normal, but at the time they couldn't even take me to the dentist, so... they weren't going to take me to the doctors just because I had breasts.",False,True

Going through puberty earlier than one's peers can be quite psychologically damaging, and your post eloquently expresses why/how your experience was traumatic.  If I'm being nosy, ignore me, but was no medical intervention attempted? Or did you have the kind of precocious puberty that doesn't respond to blockers?",False,False

I also felt suddenly huge, ungainly and like a fat almost-woman in the midst of a bunch of skinny girl children.    And it's not a silly thing to focus on, early puberty is a known major risk factor for developing an ED.",False,False
