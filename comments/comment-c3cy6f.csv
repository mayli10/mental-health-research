I asked what? And she smiles, points to my stomach and says, well, you are pregnant right?   No. No I’m not. And fuck you for your insensitive passive aggressive fat shaming lady. And I’m throwing out this shirt. Women should know better.",False,False

I dont know how someone could possibly think it's okay to say something like that. Some people are just wrong in the head. Like, scrambled. If you shook their heads, there would be a sloshing sound.
