I know this might be the worst suggestion, because I know it can turn into obsession in no time flat, but - what do you think about counting calories?  I was thinking that if we know the calories needed for maintenance, maybe we can resolve to eat within 50-100 calories of that. Then we can *100% know* that we're not making ourselves fatter, but eating enough to be like a regular person. Idk. I'm thinking about trying that, but things can spin out of control extremely fast, so I'm still not sure.",False,False

I actually don't know anyone who's Recovered (TM) who hasn't gone through it (I'm sure they exist but also...I haven't met them).   Keep in mind that binging is caused by restricting. If you eat a balanced diet regularly it doesn't happen.   This will pass.,False,False

You must change your mindset in order to recover TRULLY. Even if you're holding it back for now, it will hit you hard at some point. Try to think about it as little as possible. Like, if you are physically or mentally hungry... just eat. Try to focus on other stuff while doing it, like watching a show or something. Just to stay away from any thought even such as ""fuck it"". Because you know it, it's not simple as ""fuck it"". Eventually it will slow down. Because you're not paying attention to it.    Weigh-wise, define "" too far "", but you do it, not that damn evil thing. There are so many ways to look to it, here are some:    How do you know what you will look like in 20 years? How does that ""I went too far"" look in that 20 years range? Would you even remember how much you weighted or what size clothes you were using at that same point?   You binged for a while and that's cool, you worry about it. But do you think sometimes that, when recovered you won't really care what you eat and when. This means you'll have days where you're eating less than what you need. That's what usually happens. People over eat sometimes (especially holiday seasons), don't do much about it and bam... maybe in summer at some point they just don't have that appetite and lost some weight unintentionally.    I mean there's SO much more than it seems. Reward your body for now, it deserves it after all the suffer.",False,False

I eat more then just keep eating cause I’m fat anyway, I’ll never be as thin as I was . Then purging because it’s going too far.   I know the best way in theory to avoid binging is to eat regular balanced meals. But when I was doing that, I was still binging on top and gaining.",False,True
