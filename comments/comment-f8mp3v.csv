If you've never had Ensure, the thickness is between milk and a thin smoothie.  The person that I know that had the feeding tube while outpatient was a normal weight at the time. She's the only person I know that's had a tube while not in the hospital, so I'm not sure what the rule is generally. In the hospital, there were people of every weight class that had tubes, underweight to obese. In that setting it's used based on the amount of their meal plan someone is eating, and their level of malnutrition, not necessarily their weight. There's also a few people who just weren't gaining weight fast enough, but they're typically given the option to drink Ensure rather than using the tube.",False,False

I'm ok with Gatorade, water, juice and milk but I can't with soup, smoothies or things like that.   Is it only for people who are underweight and really really skinny? Because I'm technically at a normal weight (I'm able to maintain it by pure luck honestly). I only heard of people having a feeding tube because of GP and anorexia but really severe (like they would die without it)",False,True

The fluid they put into the feeding tubes when I was in the hospital was very similar to Ensure Plus (also made by the same company). Personally I'm bad with fluids and getting Pedialyte through a tube feed kind of helped me get over that, so I really understand your feeling. I'm probably headed back in that direction too.  It is actually possible to get a feeding tube through a gastroenterologist. A girl I've been in treatment with got one placed while living at home. It can be kind of dangerous without constant medical supervision though, and overnight you have to make sure that you're on an elevation or you can aspirate and die. Also, if purging is part of your eating disorder you can't do that while you have a tube or, again, you can aspirate and die.",False,False
