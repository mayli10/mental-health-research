We all have these moments and it is gonna be okay. Go easy on yourself. ‚ù§Ô∏è  Okay, yeah. You binged. You ate a lot of food. But tomorrow is a new day. Take a nice hot bath or shower. Go to bed a little earlier. Maybe go for a walk or do some yoga or some stretches tomorrow. Light excerise nothing to heavy. Drink some water. Don't stress about the binge. Take care of yourself and your mind first.  I binge myself too and I hate this swinging back and forth between high cal binging and low cal restriction. So just try to eat normally tomorrow. And don't feel ashamed! You binged, you can acknowledge it but don't beat yourself up. ",False,False
