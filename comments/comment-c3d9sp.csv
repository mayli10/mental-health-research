It's very likely that because you have a hard time keeping any food and nutrients down you are malnourished and have lost a lot of fat that would allow your body to be ffertile.Aso, the stress of constantly throwing up could alone be enough to cause you to lose your period. I'm sorry you're dealing with the stress of eating due to the involuntary reaction it creates. If it helps you, try to think of the feeding tube and the food it'll give you as a way to get your period back rather than something that will cause pain.   I havent seen anyone here with the eating disorders you have, but a lot of people have lost their period and gotten them back- maybe people who have fully lost and regained it can help you",False,False
