It was true that I wasn't the worst off (I was in the telemetry ward with a lot of very sick patients) but dismissing the fact that I was clearly suffering was not helpful at all.,False,False

I was in the hospital for lithium toxicity a few months ago and the doctors decided to take me off all my meds cold turkey (lithium, latuda, lamictal, seroquel, wellbutrin, concerta, and ritalin). I lost 8 pounds in 4 days. I couldn't eat. I threw up a lot. I was mentally a mess (didn't help that when I asked for medicine for the nausea/vomiting the nurse said ""you don't need it, theres people here that are soo much worse off than you"" - bitch, I was throwing up every 5 minutes for the whole day, to the point where blood was coming up). Overall not an experience I would recommend.   Did you talk to your doctor about it?",False,False
