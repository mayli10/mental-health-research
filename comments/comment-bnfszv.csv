I will try to keep all of those things in mind. Also I hadn't thought about the physical activity factor which will definitely be true as well.",False,True

You’ll only end up back here and it’s not a fun place to be, especially with all the health risks :(   This is one of those times where you’re being tested. Would someone without an ED lose weight before going on vacation (not talking about those ppl who are on diets, just “normal” people). No, right? They’d be excited and looking forward to enjoying all kinds of foods and making memories.   The weight you’ll gain during those 10 days will most likely be negligible. Water weight, sodium intake, carb intake, those are all factors that go into it. Plus, you’ll be walking around, dancing (maybe?), swimming (also maybe?, depending on where you go) and being fairly active. It’s not like you’re going to Hawaii or Japan and staying in a hotel all day.   If I recall, Stephanie buttermore has a few videos on the “after effects” after a vacation/cheat day and she lost the faux-weight pretty quickly without restricting.   Enjoy your vacation, eat and drink what you want and if you happen to gain, at most it’d be 1-2lbs, which you can easily lose after a few weeks of being back on track with your normal diet ☺️",False,False
