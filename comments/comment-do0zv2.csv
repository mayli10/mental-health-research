I’ve never had seizures, or fully fainted, but I have hair loss, bleeding gums, dizziness, weakness etc. We’re all different.   It also depends on the eating/exercise habits too, and how they get their deficit e.g eating low and no exercise, or eating reasonable and a lot of exercise. And of course other illnesses. I’m diagnosed PTSD and I swear to god it causes me hair loss from stress anyway.   I always thought my situation was fake (hek I still do).   Not everyones symptoms are the same, apart from the fact we all fucking suffer one way or another :(",False,False
