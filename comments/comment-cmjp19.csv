We sort of work together. It seems impossible that I could see him everyday, I just don't think I'm strong enough for my work not to suffer. He's a force that sucks up energy and attention and if we weren't together I imagine it would be all consuming. I don't know what I'm expecting - I don't think it's that it will get better, but maybe that I'll stop caring at some and ending things will be easy? I know that's dumb",False,True

What specifically makes you feel like you don't have the strength? Would it destabilize you financially? Is he key to your social life? Are you scared of being single? Are you scared of him? Are you staying with him simply to punish yourself?   Whatever it is, I guarantee there are solutions. And look at it this way: if it's bad now, there's pretty much only one way the relationship is going to go. While a breakup will be painful at first, it's ultimately going to hurt less than years of feeling unfulfilled. Whatever you decide, though, I'm so sorry you're going through this.",False,False
