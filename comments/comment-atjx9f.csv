It will rarely make more than a 2 inch difference sadly. (Did some research due to a comment about Terry Crews having like a 37 inch waist),False,False

I imagine you will get bustier and grow bigger hips. You already have a very tiny waist. I imagine that you're saying you have a sort of boxy or maybe a banana shape? A lot of that has to do with being so thin. You won't have a very feminine fat distribution cause firstly, you're still in puberty, and secondly you're underweight. If you were to gain weight it would go to places females typically store weight like the breasts, butt, thighs, lower belly, and love handle area. All of those can give you a very feminine shape and I think it would only get better as you age. You're also very self conscious right now cause you're deep in anorexia. I did not have a full blown ED until I was much older, but I was very body obsessed my whole life. I know it sucks. ",False,False
