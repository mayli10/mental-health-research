I'm 5'7.25"" (yes the quarter inch matters!) And my hw was 208. My lw was actually 128, but I bounced up to 140 again due to some emotional stress eating.   I was a size 16 jeans and didnt get new pants until I was suddenly a size 10 and then shortly after that an 8. 8-4 was slower to get to, now I bounce around 4-6. I have apair of 2s from target I got in the summer that I think are a lie. They don't fit me right now though.    Some of it is definitely vanity sizing, but my vanity does appreciate it!  I have a pair of true 4s (27"") that I want to get back in to. I think they will fit me again at 132-130 so just a few more lbs.   Then I get mad because I think other people my hight/weight ware smaller sizes and even at my hw people say they were only a,10/12. Even at 170 I was a 13/14. I hate my hips. I have a lot of xs tops now though, which is cool.  Losing a lot of weight is really a different world. I was actually told by a long time family friend that I could stand to ""**put on** some weight"" like...what? Don't you see how overweight I.....oh....right. Because I'm fucking not anymore.",False,False

I‚Äôm 5‚Äô11 and when I was about 150 lbs I always wore a size 8-10. I eventually binged my way up to 190 lbs and wore a 10-12. It occurred to me that I had been buying things HUGE when I was smaller (thanks mom). Because if you gain 40 pounds and your clothes still fit, they were probably a little too large! Now I stick to small medium large because I just can‚Äôt with sizing these days üòÇ  Find clothes that make you feel thin and gorgeous- you deserve it! ",False,False

Yeah validation doesn‚Äôt really help me tbh since I have such low esteem that I don‚Äôt believe anything anyone has to say. Tryna get into see a therapist but that costs money which I don‚Äôt have. Ive been trying to ‚Äúrecover‚Äù and lose weight properly by eating about 1000 calories a day but it‚Äôs been stressing me out. And 107 damn you are def skinny!! 120 is my gw so I‚Äôm almost there.,False,True

The brain is very weird, but i understand what you are saying",False,False
