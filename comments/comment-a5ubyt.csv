So I picked up climbing and running and yoga this past year. I maybe two something like that twice Week.   But damn yeah it's hard for me to exercise when I'm feeling Anorexic because it's like ""but if I exercise I have to eat because food is fuel but if I'm sedentary then I can StARvE"" but like I don't want to be skinny fat or necessarily underweight anymore since I don't exactly want to disappear like I did when I first summoned the EDemon when I was 13. I'm 23. And this relapse sucks ASS. Not to mention now I'm freaking out that my tits are finally getting saggy from my +/-10 lb fluctuations all the time.   I'm actually going running today so maybe I'll feel better about eating as much as I have. But then I also feel terrible because what if that turns into compulsive exercise and my ED ruins exercise again too????   ScREamInG.",False,False

Had to stop cycling. Built too much thigh muscles and calf muscles and it made my already pear shaped body awkward.

I also used to have super high muscle and super low bf because of my sports and having to bulk in muscle while cutting fat to hit my weight class for powerlifting. I still run and did a half marathon this summer, but I can’t lift at all if I’m restricting. I have no energy and just can’t do it. It’s been a few years since I was a powerlifter, and I’ve been wanting to get back into it but have found it hard. I can run on a fast and eat afterwards, but I don’t do as well. It’s driving me insane and I’m thinking of upping my intake because I want to be able to lift and be toned again",False,False
