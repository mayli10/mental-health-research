Muscle wasting from my ED has impacted me so much that i can barely *hold* my bow for longer than 2 minutes now, let alone shoot it, without my arms being ruined for literally days. Really sucks.",False,False

It’s a constant battle between restricting, binging, overexercising, and trying to maintain the energy/will power for all three. I’ve considered giving up exercise to make restricting easier but my mental health won’t allow it.",False,False

You deserve whatever support you’d like to have in this moment.   What kind of chat did you want to start??   My background: professional dancer so I rehearse 5 times a week for 3-4 hours if not more, and then I throw in resistance training as much as possible depending on what we’re doing in rehearsals. I’m a “normal” weight so sometimes I feel like I don’t belong either if I’m being honest.  I started reading a book about food science and listening to podcasts which started my journey but now I’m just constantly staring at myself in the mirror and binging due to my patterns of restrictive eating and then purging or over exercising because of that.",False,False
