A lot of people (including myself) have BED and losing significant weight would probably have a big impact on our health. I can't wait to exercise without joint pain, and to shop and have a medium fit me. My heart will be healthier, and it will signify me finally developing discapline that I know I need in other areas too.   In short, losing weight can improve your life...but it isn't always skinnier = happier. A 140lb person may be happier than a 200lb person, but a 80lb person isn't really happier than someone 120lbs.

When did I act like anything was easy? Living with this shit is hell no matter what weight, that was my point. I was trying to give words of encouragement. Apologies that this rubbed you the wrong way, but everyones disorders are different and it could be useful to someone else. Also had no intentions of trying to cure anyone of their disorder, just some food for thought. Iâ€™ve had an eating disorder for 7 years, I know itâ€™s not a choice and Iâ€™m not saying that at all..

I donâ€™t think many people here are under the impression that getting skinny will fix their lives.    I feel like this is an argument that Iâ€™ve been getting into A LOT on this subreddit lately, but nobody CHOOSES to have an eating disorder, and acting like itâ€™s that easy totally minimizes the struggles of the people coming here for support.
