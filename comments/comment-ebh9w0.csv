I have a friend, and she's currently struggling through an ED, and I'm one of the few people who know that she still has an eating disorder. I'm trying to help her, but I really don't know how. She says that she wants to get better too, but is too scared to go to someone else for help and this just makes me feel really guilty, because I know she doesn't want me to tell anyone but I know that I should, and I don't know what to do so I came here and someone please help.",False,False

My bf tries really hard to understand and I had to explain to him just yesterday when he asked why I’m so dismissive when he says I look thin and I told him he just thinks so because he’s never seen me at my low weight and that I know he’s never going to just agree with me when I tell him I’m fat. And also that sometimes him telling me I already look good makes it harder to not eat. Like quit trying to make me feel good about myself and maybe I’ll get skinny... but I do love that he’s there for when I catch myself in the mirror and burst into tears.,False,False
