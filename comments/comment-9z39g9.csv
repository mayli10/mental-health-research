Wanna weight!? ..well then I have to go outside and find that battery that I hid outside in a ziplock. It really helped me be able to weigh but not obsess :) now I weigh everyday but I’ve accepted fluctuations.. and let me tell you! Accepting fluctuations took me 10/15 years.. but god. What a relief! ,False,False

My SO put his foot down about it and we don't have one in the house. If I want to use a scale, I use one at a friend or family member's house.  In fact, I just did that last night. It's not an ideal situation, because at other people's house, I can't weigh myself the way I want - naked, first thing in the morning, after going to the bathroom and before eating or drinking anything. And I also don't know how accurate their scales are. But it gives me a general idea of what I weigh, a 5-10lb range, which I can use along with my body measurements to keep track of my weight loss.  I use bodyvisualizer.com to plug in my height and measurements and it guesses my weight. According to what my mom's scale said last night, it's pretty close. Then, I consider which clothes I'm fitting into (I gain and lose a lot of weight all the time, so I have a lot of clothes at different sizes and I know which ones I've worn at which weights in the past.) I'm never gonna know exactly what I weigh, but with those tools, I can narrow it down to a 5lb range, and then just make sure the number keeps going down.   So, right now, I'm somewhere between 135-140. In a few weeks, I'll take another round of measurements, pay my mom a ""purely social"" visit, and hopefully be 130-135. Rinse and repeat until I'm back down to 98lbs. ",False,False

I just need to know if eating ""healthy"" the last few weeks has actually contributed to maybe losing a bit of weight or the opposite, because even though I've been working out and eating more veggies, I feel bigger.   Also, I'm currently not subscribed to a gym so that's not an option.   ",False,True

Maybe you could have one at a friend's house so you can only check once in a while, or only check during doctor's visits? I have a friend who only lets herself check using the scales at the gym.  If it's less risky for you, maybe a tape measure or some clothing you know the size of might be better?
