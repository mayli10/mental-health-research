If I didn't get better under his care, that means he is failing. I told him this has nothing to do with him, he won't cure me. If he is open to it, and you are ready, you both could get a therapist so he can learn how to deal with this. ",False,False

That after a few days of care they'll resolve themselves and just disappear? How closeminded and frustrating of him, if so. Otherwise, I know some guys (and girls, but really, lots of guys) tend to feel like women/people in their lives who share with them their problems are simultaneously doing so to put the burden on them/expect a solution from them, which is ridiculous and often egotistical but understanding nonetheless. I don't know the best way to go about it, but (assuming this is a healthy relationship with communication) if there's a way for you to communicate to him that you dont expect him to valiantly save you from your problem, that your problem runs deeper than a cold and will not abate instantaneously, that his support and understanding is meaningful enough for now, I'd say this is the best thing to do. Im so sorry you have to deal with this, op. Wish you the best of luck. ",False,False

Don't ever regret asking for help or speaking up!!  When I confided in my boyfriend (also of 5 years, no kids tho) he didn't understand and it took him a long time to realize how ""big"" the issue actually was. I guess one of my friends had sent him a link to some article of ""how to support someone with an ED"" and he took it to heart. It seriously helped him understand the issue and he became more patient with the ups/downs/feelings. Perhaps look for an article similar and leave it somewhere for him to read. If he loves you, he will support you. No questions asked. But, again, don't ever regret speaking up for yourself. Recovery takes a long ass time (for me was like 2 years) but it will get better in time.",False,False

I can only imagine how that must have felt :( I think from his perspective he's tried to make an effort to help and feels let down in his ability to help u esp bc ppl don't realise u just wanna talk ABT how ur feeling, and they try to fix it. And then when it can't be fixed, they take it personally.  You and ur disorder are valid x",False,False
