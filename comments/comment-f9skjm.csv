It’s the girl starting to feel guilty about eating, which struck a memory of mine years ago when my ED started. Feeling guilty about eating and then falling down a dark hole after that first initial thought. It just breaks my heart to see someone go through it, or the beginning of one. Better to stop it before it gets bad. I’ve thought about messaging her.",False,True

There is a whole science behind fasting.  There is autophagy (cell repair), ketosis, etc, and its really really hard to make it through the first two days.  7 days is the suggested length for an extended fast.  It’s dangerous does people with ED but for normies it’s really not.",False,False
