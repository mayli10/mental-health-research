It's like wanting to be sick enough to ""deserve"" help and be worried about, but also not being too obvious about being sick to get sicker or to not worry anyone...it's so weird.   You too &lt;3",False,False

I've always been at the higher end of BMI but I hit a number this semester that freaked me tf out and I spiraled immediately. Like, 0-100 normal to disordered eating. I didn't spend long doing it, about two and a half months, so I never got any of the physical symptoms and also didn't lose that much weight (partly from poorly executed b/p cycles). I was so miserable though and a couple people got really worried about me, so I tried recovery for like two weeks, gained more weight, and now I'm back again. I have two assessments next week and also a doctor's appointment and it's really messing me up that I'm gonna weigh in heavier at all of them than when I started....so I too am fasting for a bit ðŸ˜‚.   *However*, no one who tried to support me through recovery, including my therapist, doubted my disorder because of my weight. I was *over*weight when I first saw her for this, and she didn't even ask me what I weighed, just what my behaviors and experiences had been. If you have a quality medical team, they will do the same: ED's happen at any and every weight, size, and shape, and with the exception of AN, diagnoses are not dependent on BMI, but on your behaviors (and even then there's still atypical AN).   Even now, if a non-disordered person read your post, they would say something is wrong without even thinking about it. No one who doesn't have disordered eating goes on a fast to lose weight for a medical appointment, or worries about the food they will ""not be able to get out of eating"" at a friends' party.    TL;DR: If they decide you're alright because you're at a healthy or higher weight, you deserve better - get yourself a different appointment, that's all. It doesn't mean you're not worthy of help or of knowing what's wrong or having a professional work with you, it means they suck and they need to go back to school, and you need someone else who is competent. Sometimes ""educated"" and ""licensed"" professionals are biased and, worse, act on those biases and end up harming their patients. Don't let them do that to you. *You deserve better.*  Hang in there and please be safe ðŸ’—",False,False
