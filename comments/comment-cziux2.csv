I’ve spoken to my doctor about vitamins to help with any deficiencies that may be causing my problems but he didn’t really give me any meaningful advice. Thanks for your input, by the way.",False,True

I’ve heard of Keto before but it seemed very confusing and I found it hard to know where to begin. Would you mind pointing me in the direction of any good resources that helped you start? Cheers!,False,True

I absolutely completely assuredly 1000% support the other people saying to eat more! But if you're having a day where that's just not possible, hydrate well. Take a drink every time you feel unfocused, stand up and stretch for ~15 sec if you feel sleepy (I was terrified of this the first time I did it, but usually no one even looks at me or one time someone else thought it was a good idea and did it too). Use breaks to walk a bit instead of playing on your phone. Depending on your body, you can also use caffeine.",False,False

I got good enough grades to get into uni but I could’ve done *much* better. So although this probably isn’t much help, all I can recommend is upping your intake slowly, so as not to overwhelm yourself.   I know, easier said than done.",False,False
