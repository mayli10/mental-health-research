The host is an RD in recovery and most of her guests share their experience with food/body image at the beginning of each episode, some of which are focused on eating disorders specifically and some of which are more about fatphobia, diet culture, intuitive eating, etc. There's a lot of episodes though, so some are probably relevant to your interests.   And I haven't actually listened to the [Eating Disorder Recovery Podcast](https://eatingdisorderrecoverypodcast.podbean.com/) yet so I can't vouch for its quality, but that's just about EDs and the host of that is also recovered. And to make things confusing, there's another podcast also called the [Eating Disorder Recovery Podcast](https://www.stitcher.com/podcast/the-eating-disorder-recovery-podcast-2/the-eating-disorder-recovery-podcast), which I also have not listened to yet but might be interesting.",False,False
