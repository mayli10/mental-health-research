I know it’s hard, but it doesn’t help to fixate on things that haven’t happened yet. I promise your feelings are normal and part of the process.   What you should do right now is make a list of all the reasons you want to/need to recover. At some point, the emotions might overwhelm you and you’ll want to retreat back to the safety of the disorder. Happens to pretty much everyone. So while you’re stuck in limbo, start being recovery-minded in little ways. Write down everything you hate about where you’re at so that when the disorder tries to trick you with rose-tinted glasses, you’ll be better equipped to fight back. Congratulations on taking some huge first steps towards recovery. You’re doing great. I believe in you. :)",False,False
