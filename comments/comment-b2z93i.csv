When I binge, everything goes out the window: depressive episode, self harm, room gets filled with trash, I don't do the washing up, don't do any work or see people I've arranged to see... it's just the worst version of myself. But when I restrict, I am very cheerful, love going about my day and getting things done, feel proud of myself for 'working so hard' to lose weight and like I am this fantastic disciplined person.

I feel like the reason for me is different than it is for most ED people though.      *TW*    I used to do a drug (I wont say which because I don’t want to “promote” it or have people wanting to try it), and was even forced to stay on it (by abusive ex) even when I knew my body/mind needed a break.      This drug makes it so that you can never sleep. It also makes it so that even the tiniest bite - like 1mm squared cube of food kinda tiny bite - would feel like the fucking cinnamon challenge. It would immediately turn to dust in my mouth and I couldn’t swallow the tiny bite, even if I tried to wash it down with a fuckload of water/other drinks.      So for months I lived off of Ensures and would probably be dead without them. Fasting and staying up late and/or having a fucked up/random sleep schedule makes me feel like Im back on the euphoric drug again a bit. I was skinnier when I was doing it as well (bmi of like 20.4, probably lower) so it also brings me back to feeling good about myself even though Im at a bmi of like 24 now. ",False,False
