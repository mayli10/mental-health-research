I’m waiting for everyone to go to bed so I can ask my SO if he said anything about it  My SO said “yea it’s a thing, just don’t question it” after he asked about it. My SO didn’t really like me measuring it but he’s coming around to it ",False,True

He’s more likely to think it’s a weird quirk than anything serious.  If he brings it up again or tells someone and they ask you could tell him something about being worried about how much alcohol you  consume either because you were considering having to drive later or because you had to work in the am or you get drunk easily etc.  it’s slightly weird but if you make it about the alcohol content instead of calories people won’t be concerned.,False,False
