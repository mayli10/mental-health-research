I was following loads of ed accounts on another site and mass unfollowed them. I told myself I wanted to be healthy and to not see myself as only my weight. I wanted to eat to nourish my mind and body. I wanted to stop deriving satisfaction from starvation highs and I wanted to stay away from binge foods.  Immediately I felt depressed. So shitty. It was like a fog lifted and I saw myself and the state of my life and it was so awful. I remembered why I wanted to run away from myself and why I began doing this in the first place. It all felt too real. tw I guess but I thought about killing myself. So yeah that little revelation lasted maybe an hour or so.
