My Dad even treats me differently if I am a bit heavy when I see him vs the previous time.  If I have lost a few lbs/weight, his treatment towards me is noticeably better.  A few years ago when I was extremely fit, I would get free food &amp; drinks all the time. My friends &amp; co-workers did not believe how often it happened. It felt so good, I‚Äôm just being honest.  I truly miss this, and am doing what I can to get back to that point.  Thanks for bringing this up!  It is so real.",False,False

It just gets irritating after a while to have my new experiences of preferential treatment getting invalidated over and over, I suppose.  Thank you! I am proud of overcoming obesity, if nothing else.

I think people deny treating you differently because they do it subconsciously. They don't think 'wow you look better than you ever did and I'm gonna treat you better' it's just wired in us naturally.  And btw congrats! You've come a long way and that's a huge acheievement ‚ô•Ô∏è I'm so happy for you.,False,True

You're 100% right about developing a different, more disordered mindset when you've been through both. I'm deathly afraid of being fat again because I get treated so much differently now that I'm considered slim and more attractive, and I unapologetically love being treated better. This fear is hard to shake, even though I know how I got that big and I know I have the mental fortitude not to get stuck there again.  Also, have you noticed that people are weidly in denial of how differently they treat you? People deny ever treating me worse or ignoring me more when I was fat, and now they deny that their new attention has anything to do with my weight. Like... guys, I know. You don't have to deny it lol",False,False

That's not bragging, that's calling a spade a spade. You realised that you're stereotypically attractive, that's true you're simply just acknowledging it.  I just don't get how one doesn't get disordered thoughts after living essentially what is 2 different lives. Even the people around you treats you differently. I am aware for every second of it.  I get up every morning and realise how different my day and life is going to be with how I currently look, be it good or bad. It's taking a huge mental toll on me.
