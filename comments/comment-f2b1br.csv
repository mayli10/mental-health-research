I still eat mostly safe foods (have added in some more ""adventurous foods"" like low calorie bread) but I'm eating what seems like a lot (no tracking). I haven't blown up in size...originally my mental hunger was seriously pushing me to down thousands of calories a day but it's attenuated so I think there's hope",False,True
