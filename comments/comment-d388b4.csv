It is a struggle trying to channel my love energy in a more positive way outside of restricting or comparing to other girls. I think we both have the strength of wanting to do our best for who we care about, which I do not think is a bad trait. So I see hope in that.",False,True

I relate to you, I gained some weight during the past year, and kept promising him I would get fit and skinnier until it almost seemed like empty words. My body has never been curvy, just expands and gets marshmallowy in all the wrong places. Now I feel like I need to prove myself so that he will see when I promise something I follow through, and he will want to take the relationship to the next level with me.",False,True

So sorry you are going through that. I feel like being skinny is my responsibility or something and I am failing until I get ultra skinny. I know he cares for me and was attracted to me at average size when we met yet I feel like I keep needing to get better looking or he'll lose interest. I am sure he loves the way you look now but I totally understand feeling that way. Ugh insecurities.",False,True
