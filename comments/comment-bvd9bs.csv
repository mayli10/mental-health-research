They don’t really know how to approach it when it’s someone else who is dealing with mental health struggles because it’s just so personal and complicated for each person. Of course people can be empathetic and understanding of a someone’s mental health, but if you haven’t gone through something similar, it can be hard to understand.   I think the person that said “ok” was trying to respect your wishes to take some time away from social media. Would it have been nice for them to reach out to you and say “hope you feel better soon”? Probably, but it they can’t read your mind, so they don’t know if that’s what you really want. Maybe they really thought you wanted space. On the other hand, people don’t really seem to be fans of when people post super personal or vulnerable things on their snapchat stories. At least from what I’ve seen, some people see this as “dramatic” or “desperate” and are inclined to just ignore it. Obviously this sucks, but again, not everyone knows what it feels like to go through what you’re going through.   No one thinks you’re less important than a block of cheese. When it comes to grating cheese, you don’t need to put much effort in besides just rubbing cheese against a cheese grater. A conversation with someone who is struggling with their mental state is a much more complicated conversation. It involves a lot more attention to detail in terms of empathy and careful choice of words. I would try privately reaching out to your friends, individually, and letting them know that you’re in a tough place right now and you need someone to talk to. This is way more direct than “I’m leaving social media” but it will probably give you the response you were originally hoping for. If the response is as dismissive and careless as before, maybe you should consider whether or not that person is a true friend.   And just my opinion: Snapchat is one of the worse social medias for mental health. If you’re in a low place, looking at stories of people having fun and enjoying life can be pretty depressing. I deleted my snapchat about 3 months ago, and I felt a little better because I wasn’t wasting my time, tapping through my “friends’” stories.",False,False
