Now she blames it on ""not having insurance."" My old counselor told me that I should come out to my family so I did. It was a bad idea. ",False,True

I came out to her as  lesbian and she pulled me from counseling. I've tried everything to get help and she always tells me I can't. I've even tried it through the school and she stopped that. I did open up to that counselor but she said that I was being ridiculous. I'll continue to try everything I can. Because this isn't the only problem I have when it comes to mental health. I thank you for giving me your feedback and being understanding. I really appreciate it. ,False,True

Since I'm a stranger on the internet and don't know shit about you, I'm not going to bombard you with strategies that worked anecdotally for me (in beating that demon, anyway... now I'm too light XP) but I will say this.  I'm not gonna lie, if you're not fairly overweight, it can be hard to get professionals to believe that you're struggling with over eating. If you do seek professional help, be very up front about what's going on, and that they must be willing to listen to you. If they don't, say you don't feel that continuing to consult with someone who is not addressing your concerns is going to be a productive and positive thing for you, and find another one.

Anytime my mom tells me that I have thick legs I cringe and say thank you. She says I have ""the perfect body"" I always have found that so hard to believe. I have my days but I can't stay happy forever (sadly). I really appreciate your comments and I thank you for letting me know I'm not the only one. I am really falling in deep and I'm afraid to say it to anyone I know. Thanks again, I really appreciate it ðŸ˜Š. ",False,True

Lots of us are in the exact same situation.  I personally relate a lot to the ""being hugged from the inside"" feeling of binging. It sucks, it's unhealthy, but that's what it is. I try to think of that feeling in the same way as other things I know aren't good for me--a thing I can have sometimes, but not always. Like the cookie monster! ""Cookies are a sometimes food!""  I know it's not as simple as that, and knowing rationally what's healthy can't always fix your behavior, but ONCE IN A WHILE it works. And honestly at size 7 you're completely healthy and way under average (at least where I am, in the US).   It's a disorder and it frickin sucks, but we're here and we get it. Feel free to PM me anytime. I'm 26 and have a history of bulimia and disordered eating since age 14. It's a battle, but it's one you can win! And I'm rooting for you :)",False,False
