Take ibuprofen, wash it down with orange juice (or any citrus juice), take a few shots (I prefer vodka) and go for a walk/jog (the vodka helps with this too). You don't need to do all of them, but I usually do it an hour or 2 beforehand.  Again, I don't recommend anything, it's just my personal experience of what works for me.",False,False
