But she's still really tiny and so gorgeous",False,True

(Sorry I stalked u a little bit) if it makes you feel better it doesn’t sound like she’s fully recovered that’s very underweight and your boy doesn’t want to maintain that. Stay safe ❤️,False,False

Hair is temporary and grows so if you take good care of it by next summer you can rock some highlights. Some of hair is genetics some is lifestyle choices. Highlights with a perm is out of my reach too. You have to have healthy hair that is at least average thickness and fullness. I have fine hair (unlucky genetics) and have a balayage but I take care of it. Maybe you can use sun in for some light highlights but if your hair is that damaged it would be better to wait.",False,False

Her hair might be just naturally more dense and yours more fair or thin stranded. I know some people without an ED who were told it’s not good to get highlights because of their texture. Genetics, all kinds of things can effect what treatments work best on what hair.  Comparing yourself is going to kill you before anything else. Schedule a hair treatment with the salon, they probably do some kind of wash and condition treatment. It’s still nice self care at the salons Perms (especially) and highlights aren’t good for hair anyway. I used to want to get highlights and all kinds of crap because my hair is so bland brown but all it did was really damage it, embrace you. Just take care of the hair you have. She’s going to be shit out of luck when hers falls out eventually.",False,False
