For example, I do it because I'm worthless sack of shit and being sick is a way to excuse my useless shitbaggery.   Rather than ""I won't, I'm lazy"" I get to say ""I can't, I'm sick""  I don't want to control *anything* and being sick is actually a way to shrug off responsibilities- the exact opposite. I'm helpless and I want to look as helpless as I am so people will take care of me.  So yeah, free lipo would soooo be something I'd do. ",False,False
