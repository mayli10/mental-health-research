I ate about 1500 yesterday and was able to get a solid 8hours of focused time in, which I definitely couldn't have done without upping my intake. Thanks again for calming me down aha :)",False,True

Last semester I did the same thing you're trying to do and very quickly got nowhere with finals studying. I realized that I needed to eat to pass and ended up trying to eat at a small deficit for the week. Guess what- I still lost a bit of weight AND was able absolutely annihilate my finals. :)  I understand that it can be scary and that you want to get to your gw asap, but for the sake of your studies maybe try to up your intake to maintenance? if not maintenance then at least 1000-1200 cals? I dont know your bmr but I'm assuming eating 1k a day will still put you at a net loss. ultimately, it's up to you what you decide to do!  good luck on finals!!! :)",False,False
