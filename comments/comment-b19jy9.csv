This is such a good point. Thanks for your comment. I hate it when people say ""just listen to your body/stop eating when you're full"" etc.. That might work for some people, but my food intake has almost nothing to do with hunger or fullness anymore.   &amp;#x200B;",False,True

There is no “recovery” for me, there’s only extremes.   I do feel like I have a chance of becoming a full-fledged orthrexic some day (my ED has become very focused on exercise and “clean” foods lately, though I still eat junk as well) but I’ll never be normal.
