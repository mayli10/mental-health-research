Trying to fight it clearly doesnâ€™t work. Your â€˜â€™willpowerâ€™â€™ likely wonâ€™t suddenly increase either.   Take a step back and think, â€˜â€™did I behave in a way that may have caused my body to view food as scarce, and therefore binge in order to store as much fat as possible since food became an uncertainty?â€™â€™  Remember, yes, youâ€™re body stored fat for later use. But remember too; youâ€™re body doesnâ€™t give a shit how good you look at the beach. It probably likes being chunky, makes it feel nice and safe when food is â€˜â€™scarceâ€™â€™ (which, I assume it is, in your case?)",False,False
