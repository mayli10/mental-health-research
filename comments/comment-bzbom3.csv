Now I'm not sure what my weight is doing as I'm being blind weighed as I'm finding it so much easier mentally.,False,False

This does eventually slow down or even stop once your body learns how to process the food again.   &amp;#x200B;  I definitely had this happen- I gained 2.4kg in a week on what should have been a maintenance amount, but that has slowed dow significantly.",False,False

It's so easy to shave off a few calories at a time.",False,False

But when you begin to intake more sodium and carbs, you will retain more water. Don't let it discourage you, and maybe try to stay away from the scale for a bit. You are stronger than this and you will beat it.  Breathe, and remember that you are not immune to thermodynamics. Your metabolism won't have slowed significantly, and I have heard that people in recovery from restrictive eating disorders may need *more* food in order for their bodies to repair damage.",False,False
