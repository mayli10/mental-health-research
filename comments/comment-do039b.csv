Once an old high school friend wanted to try weed so we went up to his family's cabin bc he was very afraid of cops (it's illegal here). And I was in recovery so I brought some snacks I really liked bc munchies and all he talked about was how he starves himself and eats like &gt;!600!&lt; calories a day and has lost so much weight and he would only eat out of this one bag of candy that *I* really wanted but I knew he wasn't eating anything else so I let him have the whole thing. And I had told him about my ED and that I was in recovery. He was like ""oh I do that too""  It was so fucking triggering to hear him talk about how he starves himself (after I told him that wasn't healthy and encouraged him to see a doctor) that I pretty much stopped talking to him over it. We were good friends but it just wasn't worth it.",False,False

But like ,, perhaps communicate with him in a straightforward manner? Like ""hey I dont think you have malicious intentions, but I have to be honest. as someone who struggles with an eating disorder, hearing you talk about not eating is honestly triggering for me."" I know you would think that any person with common sense would know enough not to mention not having eaten for 2 days.. esp around someone with an ed. but some people really are dense. It doesnt excuse his behavior cause that's def abnormal but yall are homies afterall I'm sure hes not tryina hurt his buddy.",False,False

Im not gonna let that dick wad mess with my recovery. As you can see my brother pisses me off. And you shouldnt let his messed up shit mess with your attempt at getting your life back.",False,False
