Please donâ€™t punish yourself for it. 25% of pregnancy ends in mc (my experience reflects those stats, 2 out of 6 times I mcâ€™d). Mine happened on the 2nd and 4th, but I would imagine Iâ€™d have felt scared and disheartened if both had been the first two. Donâ€™t lose hope, I know people who had multiple mcâ€™s before going on to have healthy pregnancies.  After mc you are likely to be extra fertile, so if youâ€™re emotionally ready to try again straight away itâ€™s important that you keep optimum health right now.  Look after yourself, and I wish you a swift recovery from this trauma. ðŸŒ¸",False,False
