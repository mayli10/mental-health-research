Whenever I would lose weight at my highest I seemed to lose it from my face first. Combined with the other two factors I could end up still being massively overweight but with a pretty distinct jawline. My pet theory is that a lot of plus size models intentionally lose/gain the same small amount of weight to maintain definition without sizing out of their modeling range.  Plus lots of photoshop. Plus size models are not exempt.",False,False

Having a good bone structure probably helped them have the confidence to become models. ",False,False
