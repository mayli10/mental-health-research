It's not worth it to potentially screw over your permanent GPA for a few days of restriction.,False,False

I’m not saying go wild if you don’t want to but right now in this moment you need to fuel your mind. Your finals are important and you can make a choice to be kind to yourself. Try upping calories a little bit. Something like starting the day with some oats or a fiber one bar kinda thing or some fruit. When you are studying reward that good behaviour with foods that make you feel good. For me when I’m at my worst I can still feel okay about eating super clean so my go to is smoothies or fresh juices. It’s pretty much a multi vitamins.   Sometimes I find it easier to eat with company or friends around. Thankfully I have great friends that won’t comment if I’m demolishing a tub of carrot sticks while they have chips and Junk when we where studying.,False,False
