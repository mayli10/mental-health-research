Obviously it doesnt solve anything underlying but its helpful when you need to make yourself eat more, just one puff and wait like 30 minutes, it brings enjoyment back to food for a bit, makes it taste normal again.",False,False

No harm done :p I’ll see if that helps. My mom controls everything in the house so I’ll have to ask her to start incorporating more natural things. Thank you :)",False,True

My intentions are super nice!!!) your body might be craving nutritionally dense, natural food. When I’m on a super health kick I’ll go eat at someone else’s house and I can’t believe how salty/sweet/greasy everything is. It doesn’t taste good because it’s so startling, even though objectively it should taste good. It’s possible that you’ve changed your taste buds and have lost an addiction to the way unhealthy food is being produced and normalized. It might be helpful to eat super basic fruits or vegetables or meats when you reintroduce foods back into your diet!",False,False

You said you started doing it so you can eat whatever you want for dinner, but it seems that you don’t really even want to eat dinner anymore. Maybe trying to eat a few small things during the day just to jumpstart any sort of appetite. You could always go back to OMAD if you start enjoying things again, but the path you’re on doesn’t seem to be working for your body anymore.",False,False

As long as it’s just the lettuce. I don’t get to have them often cause it’s not something my mom fixes a lot and I still live with her. She kinda controls the kitchen :/,False,True

My mom is the one who gets everything in the house so I don’t really have a choice over what I can eat :/ It’s usually up to her. Days I get to cook are very rare in my house lol.
