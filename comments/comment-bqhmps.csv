Like, MIND your own business DAMN. A few months back I was at this stupid big family dinner at a restaurant, so I saw relatives that I haven't seen in a while and they talked about how I've gained weight and they are bigger than me, damn SHUT THE FUCK UP. Do you have to talk about it on the fucking table? Then acted surprised when I didn't order anything and just drank water and stayed on my fucking phone the whole time, but that didn't stop them giving their stupid advice, like excuse me, but you are 3 or 4 bigger than me, why the fuck should I take your bullshit advice. I fall into the slight overweight category and I am working on it. But when people make comments, it makes me feel like shit.",False,False
