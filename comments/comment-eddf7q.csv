She asked me if I had ever restricted. I'm at a healthy weight and said that I hadn't and she said 'Well yeah you look fine so I guess it wasn't true.' Obviously I'm happy I was able to lie about it that easily but it also just made me want to restrict more so that if there's a next time I am obviously sick.,False,False

I wanted help so bad in the beginning (I was just as disordered but I wasnt underweight), I secretly used to wish people would be concerned for me or notice i barely eat anything and go to the gym and take long ass walks and even black out as a result but no one cared or said anything, as a matter of fact some people even congratulated me on having so much self control. Fast forward to now and everyoneeee is commenting saying i should eat more and i lost so much and its getting ""worrisome"" and i hate it so much because I'm way past the point of wanting people to notice. It's too late now. I don't want any help, I want to be left alone.",False,False

I’m down a very significant amount in 2 months and have had 16 ED admissions to hospital in the past 10 years (12 of those in the last 2 alone) but no one gives a shit cause I’m still “overweight” rn. Like I’ve nearly died from this but me blatantly skipping meals and purging doesn’t even register ✌️,False,False

I would hate to have anyone acknowledge it or pay any attention to it, that would get old so fast.  Them: ""Do you want a doughnut?""  Me: ""Sure I'm gonna go throw it up anyways""  Them: ""Hahaha""  Me: *dead serious but laugh too*",False,False

I agree that the whole ""only sick if you're underweight"" thing is brutal and messed up. My ED started in part because people kept accusing me of having one based off my weight/appearance (lanky stringbean child), so it's such a harmful mindset in so many ways. It's a MENTAL illness, and even the physical parts of it can mostly not be seen with the naked eye, like electrolyte levels and stuff.",False,False
