Unfortunately this post has already been reported as thinspo (which is by no means your fault but you can understand that it’s the reporter’s ED thinking). Would it be possible to repost this but hiding the pic as “nsfw”? I think this would help people avoid being triggered without warning. I also actually think it’s great that you did not include numbers in this post, because again it can be a triggering / competitive / comparison thing.  If you could do that, I’d give it my full approval. Congratulations again!",True,False
