Technically, you shouldn't eat less than 1,000 cal below your TDEE, OR under 1200 for most women (1800 for most men). Depending on your height those minimums change.  That said for recovery I started trying to just eat above my BMR every single day, and worked my way up to maintenance. Just increasing my calories a lot rapidly causes me to bloat and hang on to weight in a way that slow changes didn't do.",False,False

This number should be pretty ""normal"", far more so than any you get out of restricting or binging. I think teenagers have a higher BMR than adults (could be wrong here), so the number may be higher than you're expecting. Just a heads up!",False,False
