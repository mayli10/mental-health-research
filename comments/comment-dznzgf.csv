From your post, it sounds like he berated you for an extended period of time and left in a worse mental state. Which does not fit the (false) narrative he is portraying. Best wishes and I hope you find someone who actually listens and takes your medical history into account. ‚ù§",False,False

My mom once told a nurse about how I starved and purged all the time. The nurse came to my house to ‚Äúhelp‚Äù me and give me a talk but in reality she just scolded me the whole time??  She also talked about the starving children in Africa/other third world countries. Saying how I‚Äôm lucky to have food available to me and how I should be grateful to live this life.  She also kept telling me to ‚Äúnot be stupid.‚Äù She told me how eating disorders are only for dumb girls and that I should be smarter than to have disordered thoughts.   I just hate how a lot of medical workers are eating disorders as choices that we make and not as psychological disorders like they are.,False,False

I would LOVE to say that I replied with 'suicide and major depression is not a matter of 'intelligence', so saying that I was silly to act on very real and very intense feelings brought on by severe mental illness outside of my control is incredibly rude, insensitive and narrow minded of you' but i just said ...i guess'... in a very small voice because I was so upset and triggered and ashamed.

Which sucks. Is it possible to get an appointment with a different doctor? Sometimes there are primary care doctors with greater experience in mental health issues. (During grad school the counseling center sent me to a particular doc at the health center who had some extra mental health training.) I‚Äôd also consider talking with your therapist about how the appointment went down, to process, vent, etc. I‚Äôd also hope your therapist might avoid sending anybody else to that doctor.
