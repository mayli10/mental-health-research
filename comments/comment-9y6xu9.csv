Your first day will probably be introductions and allowing you to ease into the setting. They might ask you to share, but don't feel pressured if you don't want to. You can listen as much as you need, and honestly, I learned more from listening than I did speaking. Feel free to give input if the others are okay with it. If you do speak, open yourself up to people's thoughts and let their experiences help shape you.  It's so nice to be surrounded by people who just /get it/. There no pretense of health, no faking a smile or saying things are fine when they aren't and you wanna cry. You can be angry when you are angry, be anxious when you are anxious, and everyone just nods their heads because they know exactly how you feel. You get to get things out to a handful of empathetic, third party people, and get actually unbiased feedback if you want it. It's absolutely freeing.  I hope you take what you need from your group, and that it puts you on a path toward mental health. ðŸ˜Š",False,False

Listening to other people share is the best part, in my opinion. If youâ€™re feeling nervous about sharing, just listen and search for bits of other peopleâ€™s work that you can relate to. Itâ€™s kind of like lurking here! ;) Congrats in trying out something new!",False,False

You need individual therapy on top of group therapy because in group therapy they usually won't let you go into specifics (to make sure no one is triggered by anything) but it's a great way to not feel alone and to meet really nice people who get it ya know? ,False,False
