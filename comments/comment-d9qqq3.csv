I don't understand half the abbreviations people are using. *feels old at 30*üòÜ  It's nice that your wife knows your quirks and still loves you and wants to be with you. That gives me hope for myself. This guys tho, it kinda sounds like a star-crossed sort of situation? His leaving soon and all that.. Maybe a useful distraction to fuel your ed? AhahahaI'mahypocrite.   In regards to breaking my fast...I keep trying to eat but then spit it out instead. To be honest, it's kind of orgasmic to taste the food but not gain from it. I think my ed is evolving.. I definitely have to do something soon though because I keep coming close to passing out and I know I can't logically sustain myself like this forever.. Today is day 17 and I'm not really sure how to get myself out of this mess. Or maybe I'm not 100% about living anymore and I'm just kind of waiting here to die. It doesn't feel like a choice though. Just something that's happening and I'm a witness. If that makes sense.   I love talking with you. I hope I'm not too much of a downer.",False,True

I‚Äôm just emotionally invested in him and I‚Äôm pretty sure he doesn‚Äôt feel the same way about me?  Okay so my whole story is I‚Äôm married to a woman and she‚Äôs amazing and actually cool with my random damn crushes/spells of love I fall into occasionally. She‚Äôs the best and she knows she‚Äôs my one and only forever. But. This guy doesn‚Äôt know that I‚Äôm married AND doesn‚Äôt know it‚Äôs to a woman. I haven‚Äôt kept it from him but.... I haven‚Äôt gone out of my way to tell him. He‚Äôs foreign and I‚Äôm not sure his stance on gay marriage yet and it hasn‚Äôt come up. I am an awful person for not mentioning it yet, and I wanted to have a chance to have him see me in this way first and then I could tell him she‚Äôs okay with it :/ but that‚Äôs pretty delusional and manipulative I guess :(   I only fall in love rarely and hard and I‚Äôm really afraid of falling in love with him and having him not like me back or this be a dealbreaker and hurt him.   PLUS! He‚Äôs not guaranteed to work here past the next few months, it‚Äôs all up in the air :/ so my ED says ‚Äúoh! Time is running out! Better starve yourself fast and hard so you don‚Äôt run out of time to make yourself attractive and have him worry about you!!!‚Äù   I‚Äôm a mess.   At least like... it sounds like there is something undeniably there between you two, even if it‚Äôs not what you are looking for. I can see that being extra painful though. Everyone I know right now is in the throes of these unequal relationships with people who are married or committed or unable or unwilling to give their whole self. It‚Äôs a VIBE right now in the air.   When you break your fast, don‚Äôt do what I did and eat an entire burrito!!! My heart rate was 119 while I was just sitting there and I was seriously afraid I was going to die!! It was awful (not the burrito, that was delicious, just super worrisome).   Idk what is good to go with, vegetables or high fiber things seem like a painful choice... I hope you can find something you like!!!  (And yes omg why can‚Äôt we pick people that our dynamics would work WITH!!?? I‚Äôm all for arranged marriages now lol :P)  (Maybe we should start a chat message lol)",False,False

Power dynamic imbalances seem to be where it's at üòÜ I guess I might be masochistic in more ways than one. I totally let him kiss me yesterday, and grope me, knowing full well that he doesn't give a shit about me. Why. It's so sad it's funny.  I'm feeling..okay today. I drank some last night and that was probably a mistake, but it's the only way I could get through the potluck at work, so..   Other than that, I've been thinking about food again. I think I might break my fast soon, but I'm not really clear on when or what to eat. It's good that I want food though. I feel good about that.   Side note, we'd be a great couple lol. You could take advantage of my weak ass and I'd love it.",False,True

My depression eased and I tweaked my meds.   I am technically my crush‚Äôs boss!! So I feel like I can never let my feelings go anywhere anyway :/  What is it with power dynamic imbalances?

Different levels of investment in a relationship (any relationship really) just tends to break me. It sucks so bad being vulnerable and opening yourself up because you always risk finding that there is an imbalance.   The guy I like, I told him that I like to hedge my bets and protect my hopes from getting too high to avoid disappointment and he just looked sad and disagreed. I really feel pretty down about my situation (can‚Äôt read it anyway) but like... I guess I would have missed out on the highs and getting to know someone. Idk what the risk/benefit is to emotions.   People do move at different speeds though. I don‚Äôt say this to make you second guess or worry about ‚Äúfalse hope‚Äù or anything, just because I have a kind of black and white thinking about how people feel about me.   It really sucks how hard it is to talk about depression! I‚Äôm totally down for listening about this tho, talking about depression, oddly, never makes me more depressed?",False,False

Hearing about what you're going through really breaks the layer of isolation I've been in for a long time. I'm experiencing a nonbreakup/breakup right now and even though it was me that initiated it, I still feel hurt by it. And we were never even technically dating, just seeing each other every day and sleeping together. I ended it because he couldn't handle being open about us and it just made me so insecure to think that I was all in and he had his toes wet. I guess that is what triggered this relapse...

Your post really spoke to me because I‚Äôm feeling similar rn. I ate... something? On Tuesday? Except now that I think about it, I‚Äôm pretty sure the last time I ate was Monday night. I feel like I don‚Äôt NEED food at all, it‚Äôs bizarre. I keep making shakes and then tasting them and spitting them out and chucking it all.   I know I‚Äôve fallen deeply into depression lately. Unrequited love (crush? Infatuation? Whatever it is, I‚Äôm a mess) and it‚Äôs just pulled all the color out.
