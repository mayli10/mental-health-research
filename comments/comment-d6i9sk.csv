I have a rule where I'm not allowed any coffee until I've had at least 60oz of water. Today I've had about 90oz of water, one 12oz La Croix, and a 20oz decaf black coffee 'cuz I don't do caffeine so well. I'm actually not sure what my fiance and I are having for dinner tonight, but since dinner is almost always the only thing I eat it doesn't bother me. We cook from scratch and stick with a healthy diet - my MS degree is in nutrition and I put that shit to use!   If I decide I want something before dinner, I'll have some cucumber slices with salsa or a few spicy dill pickles.",False,False
