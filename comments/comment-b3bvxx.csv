Just don't forget that FMLA is a federally-protected thing and that paperwork allows you to take the time off as needed without consequences. Your employer has to figure out how to work around it. Maybe they need to take some people off your caseload and stop adding new people for now. ,False,False

Not sure how it‚Äôs going to work though because ironically enough I work in the mental health field and there are clients I need to see for a certain amount of time each week and coverage is limited.

In Canada and the US, employers have a duty to accommodate disabilities (although you may have to argue or take steps to prove that an ED counts as a disability) by offering time off for medical appointments,  offering alternative working hours, etc. Just a thought.

Are you taking a certain amount of time fully off? Another option is to do intermittent FMLA, which lets you take random days off as needed or reduce hours as needed. This way you wouldn't lose your benefits or your income entirely, but would have more time to take care of yourself, get therapy, whatever. ",False,False

Ime HR depts in large corporations are reasonably compassionate and are compelled to comply with procedures anyway (it would be illegal to fire someone for taking genuine sick leave). However the full pay is finite, and so is the compassion tbh as they‚Äôd likely expect you to recover and be fit for work again within a certain timeframe.
