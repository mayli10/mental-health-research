Idk if he was bulimic since he was decently skinny, but people definitely commented. I think they were more impressed that this small dude could put away so much food in one sitting. Iâ€™m pretty sure Iâ€™m guilty for saying something too just because I wished I could eat that much.   Usually if people say it in a mean way, they think youâ€™re fat and should be eating less. This is not likely going to come from coworkers though or most people in fact. So it was probably literally just a comment acknowledging it was a lot of food, not calories, not calling you fat, literally just surprise (probably because it looked like more than they though you could eat). They could even be happy that youâ€™re eating that much if you look underweight to them.   Point is there are many reasons, rarely is it going to be aggressive or rude.",False,False
