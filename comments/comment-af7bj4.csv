Iâ€™d like to post mine too if you donâ€™t mind ðŸ™‚  Snefferu, well done in gaining a kilo over January in preparation for your trip to the jungle in late february. Unfortunately in early February you will be struck down by a bad case of the flu, and you will be bedridden for a week. You wonâ€™t eat anything and youâ€™ll drop 3kg. Your fever will break on the day you have to catch your first flight, youâ€™ll still be in bed and consider cancelling the trip.   But you donâ€™t, and at the last minute you take your first shower youâ€™ve had in 6 days, you will almost faint in the cubicle and contemplate your madness in traveling across the world to take part in shamanic ceremonies that you hope to help you overcome some of your personal chaos. You know it will be hot as hell, full of mosquitoes, youâ€™ll be living off super low calorie fruit, rice and beans for a week and taking a medicine which induces purging. Itâ€™s not what your body needs to recover from the ravishes of the flu but youâ€™re determined to do it anyway.   You get on the plane and begin 36 hours of connecting flights, exhausted sleeps in hotels and hardly any food at all. You go to the jungle and you have some powerful ceremonies, one of which the spirit comes to you to help you with your latent ED, but she says youâ€™re not ready yet and you will cry.  You make it through, come home exhausted and jetlagged but feeling refreshed although your jungle and backpacking diet has taken another 2 kilo off you.  â€žItâ€™ll go back onâ€œ you think, but it doesnâ€™t. Youâ€™re accustomed to tiny meals, skipping meals and tolerating hunger now. You think you eat fine, but itâ€™s not enough.  In September you will break up with a girl friend, and it will be messy. The following month you will confront your sister who is in a really bad way with depression and ed. But you couldnâ€™t help her, and then you hear of her ill health problems, and you feel helpless and out of control.  Youâ€™ll notice shortly after that your weight has since nudged down even more, and people are making comments that this is serious now. Your bmi is under 16 and youâ€™re in bad shape. Youâ€™ll start to wonder if youâ€™re going batshit.  In December you admit you might have issues and youâ€™re terrified. You will make a big effort to fix them. Youâ€™ll gain insight from your ceremonies earlier this year about your ED and feel ready to fix it. By Christmas youâ€™ll have gained almost 2kg by yourself, and will feel really good about it, though the work youll have to put in to achieve it will be hard, you wonâ€™t like it one bit. But youâ€™ll be proud of yourself for doing it, and actually feel like youâ€™re the one in control, and not the ED demon, for the first time in 25 years.  You start off 2019 fairly positive. You have a goal to reach before your next beach holiday in February, and an ultimate goal to get back to your starting weight before the flu by the time you take your next trip to Peru in the spring. You feel confident this time to work with the medicine on your issues now that youâ€™re in touch with them and youâ€™re being more open and honest. Youâ€™ll feel optimistic. Maybe this is the year you can finally get full and permanent control over your demons.  You got this. Good luck!   Well done u/boopthisderp Good luck in recovery!!! :)) ",False,False
