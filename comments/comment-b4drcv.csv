Because in that case I think a good way to help explain any irrational mental-health-related things is to first sit down and be like, okay look this is a mental health issue. Which means it is irrational and it doesn't make sense but it is also real. So I understand the frustration of not understanding, but it's real, right? Eating disorders is like, definitely a real affliction that you have heard about. So whenever you feel like I'm being irrational and not satisfactorily explaining why I can't just eat, try to understand that I also don't really understand what's happening. All I can do is try my best to communicate what I'm feeling but at the end of the day those feelings are not going to be logical, they're symptoms of a disorder. So don't expect or look for logic when you're trying to sympathize.",False,False
