A coworker of mine talks about how she eats ""less than 30g of any sugar all day"" and ""less than 1500 calories"" and ""exercises an hour everyday"" but she also told us she is 212 pounds. Also, all the things she claims are lies. She ate a banana, 3 mini muffins, and some pasta with sauce one day, and it put her far above 30g and added processed sugar which she claims to have none of. Also, looking at her facebook and seeing her eat lunch, I can see that most days she exceeds 1500. And i saw her at the gym one day... for 20 minutes. Next day she was saying she was sore from doing the exercise bike for an hour (she didnt she me lol).   Even though i know she is lying, my brain tells me that bc I usually eat 1500-1600 I must be as big as her. Nevermind that I work out up to 3 hours, eith up to 6 hours of active hours logged to my Fitbit. Nevermind that I usually get up to 3100-3300 burnt on an average exercise day. Nevermind that sometimes I purge even my regular meals. Nevermind that I sometimes do OMAD. Because like 4/7 days a week i eat about 1500, my brain says i look like her",False,False

Just because you think something, doesn’t make it true and doesn’t make you a bad person. It just means your brain tried to make a connection between observations. That’s what brains do. Sometimes those connections are right and useful, sometimes they aren’t.  The fact that you recognize this thought isn’t true is a good thing. The fact that you feel bad about having the thoughts, is evidence to support that the thought didn’t originate from a malicious origin.   I’m sorry you had this thought that obviously distressed you. I have OCD and often have distressing thoughts like this. And working through them like this often makes me feel better about them. They’re also apparently quite common, even among ‘normal’ people. They just dismiss them more easily.",False,False
