I did a google search (“body odor restriction eating disorder”) and some interesting articles came up. Including some journal articles from studies suggesting AN folks may have a heightened sense of smell. You might be on to something! Also mentions of the body not having enough energy to process toxins optimally - which is intriguing though I have nowhere near the bio knowledge to assess plausibility. Bottom line - sounds like you’re definitely not alone in the experience.,False,False

Just, different? Stronger? Maybe its my sense of smell becoming stronger cuz my body is looking for food? Or all the fiber and artificial sweeteners? Idk.",False,True

People eating in a way that causes their body to enter ketosis sometimes report a change in body odor. Something about how acetone is a metabolic byproduct of ketosis? I sometimes get a weird taste in my mouth too. Unless you’re diabetic I don’t think it’s necessarily cause for concern, more just annoying.",False,False
