Did you restrict lactose products before, for a long time?  I ask because it's possible your restriction caused the intolerance. When we restrict for a long time, the microbes in our guts die off because they don't have any food - they eat what we eat. You might have heard something about eating fried food all the time making the gut flora that feed on those foods more populous - same thing with everything else, including lactose, proteins, gluten, vegetables, etc. I read about someone who thought she had a gluten intolerance in recovery, but suspected that it was caused by avoiding gluten-based foods for 10 years. She didn't cure those out, as uncomfortable as it was for a while, and then after a couple months she could enjoy them again, because the lil gluten-eating bugs in her gut had replenished by then.   I haven't looked into it that much, and I know adult-onset lactose intolerance is actually pretty common and I don't know anything about the causes of that (maybe it's because chocolate milk for breakfast isn't as acceptable once you're not a child???), so it's also possible that this isn't it.  However, I definitely feel like it's too much of a coincidence that someone who restricts a food group or cuts it out of their diets completely just also becomes physically incapable of digesting it. Anyways, I'm really sorry you're having to give up on so many good foods. Hugs üíó",False,False
