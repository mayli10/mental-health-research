It's been a lot better than I thought it would. I'm going to beat this. I am going to get better. So can you. Don't lose your life to this. I lost so much of my teenage years and my twenties. I want you to live and enjoy being alive. Life shouldn't just be about existing and enduring x,False,False

I'm sitting here in my 30s, not knowing how to approach my parents and my wife and explain that I really really need some help, hoping and wishing that they just notice and offer me help - basically take the choice out of my hands, offer me recovery, and just start me on that journey without me having to work out how to take that awful first step. Because if I have to wait until I'm truly, actually ready to recover then I never will. There will always be another GW. There will always be ""just one more kilo"". I just need someone to push me through the door of the doctor's office - I can do the hard work from there. I just need someone to get me to that first step.  I know you're probably angry, maybe upset and a bit betrayed. But believe me, they care about you. Take this step when it's being offered ‚ù§Ô∏è",False,False

It was hellish in my case, but it really depends on the competency of the people they force you to see. If at all possible, try to insist the doctors/counselors specialize in eating disorder treatment. It‚Äôs wild how clueless and insensitive so many medical professionals can be when they‚Äôre not.   If nothing else try to take this as an opportunity to be as honest as you can about where you are and what you‚Äôre struggling with, since I‚Äôm sure they are only trying to help. Forcing appointments like this does rub me the wrong way, but sometimes it‚Äôs inescapable and can be for the best. Just know it at least means people deeply care about you and want you to be as healthy and happy as you can be. Best of luck to you üíõ",False,False

Your first visit will be intake/assessment, so expect a lot of paperwork and questions, just like a normal doctor's appointment. Typically after filling out the paperwork you'll see a doctor/therapist/social worker (it depends on what country or type of clinic you're going to) and you explain why you're there. They'll ask you questions about your mood, sleep habits, weight loss/gain, school, stress, etc. You can request to talk to them without your mother or with her present. If you're under 18 they may want to talk to her alone and for her to fill out paperwork too. They want to see how they can help you and they will probably recommend different therapies or psychologists or therapists. Someone may or may not take your vitals (height, weight, blood pressure) depending on what type of facility it is.    Please try to keep in mind that people in these professions really *want* to *help* you. All these people are there for you. I didn't realize this when I first got into therapy as a 14-yr-old.  I hope this helped. You can PM me if you have any questions or just want to vent. Good luck! üñ§",False,False
