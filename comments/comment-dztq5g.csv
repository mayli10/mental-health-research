Idk what the future hds for me or if I will ever be happy. Im depressed and I try to be in a good mood to not upset my loved ones but it is difficult. My ed is a reminder to me that a better me is possible and at arms reach if I just restrict and when I do not eat for 2 yo 3 days I notice a difference in my face and I am instantly joyful and find myself giggling because of how Happy I am with the reflection on the mirror. So I restrict more eventually eating again after the 4th day only to start all over right after my realization that I have broken my fast. Stay strong üíó,False,False
