If I leave it charging all day and check the calories it says I burned, it's pretty close to my bmr that I calculate separately (+/- 100 cals). When I wear it on a regular day and it tracks my steps it's also pretty close to my tdee. I think what helps it be the most accurate is the heart rate monitor and when you input your height/weight/age into the app and that's how it does the calculations for you! I've used my fitbit to help me maintain for a few months now and I haven't noticed any big changes in my weight.  The only thing that I'd say it overestimates a bit on is during exercise but otherwise it's pretty solid",False,False
