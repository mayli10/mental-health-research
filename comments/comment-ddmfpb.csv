Diet would have to eliminate carbs except for breakfasts. Try apple cider with warm water every morning. Eat 30 mins after.  If you dont have time to rehydrate. Eat less before the fight but stay hydrated with BCaas.,False,False

Do they weigh you before a fight or do you have to make weight on a certain day to qualify?  If it's the former, you could do what some UFC fighters do. Cut and dehydrate to the point you're beef jerky, make weight, bloat up again, and have a slight weight advantage when you actually fight.",False,False
