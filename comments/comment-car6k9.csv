I'm trying harder to keep track of my 'trigger' foods, but I'm finding it incredibly hard to cut back on garlic &amp; onion because they're some of the only flavor-boosting foods I can even vaguely stomach (I cannot handle ANYTHING spicy). It's also hard when even eating a small amount can leave me so bloated I feel like I just binged. I'm happy to hear you're trying too :) We can do it!",False,True

I just try to avoid foods that I 100% know trigger my IBS ( I have FODMAP malabsorption) and remind myself that the uncomfortable feelings aren't going to last forever. Peppermint tea also helps me and giving myself time to rest and being distracted after eating lets the feelings pass.",False,False
