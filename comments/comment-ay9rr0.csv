Pretty much the whole family had a lil meeting where they told her they loved her and are there for her and are gonna get her treatment  And it triggered the FUCK out of me. I am so baffled and jealous that families like that exist. When my parents found out out about my depression and self harm when I was younger they scolded me, told me not to do it again. And that was that. I always dealt with my problems on my own. Now that I'm older and independent I'm away from my parents, in a much more healthy environment and know I have people that love me. I haven't struggled with mental health in a while. But to see that outpouring of love to someone, to know that families like that DO exist, made me so fucking bitter and jealous that I completely sliced up my thighs for the first time in...5 years? 6? Idek   Basically I'm fucked and can't handle someone else getting the care she needs. I love my bfs sister like she's my own and I'm so happy she has people there for her.
