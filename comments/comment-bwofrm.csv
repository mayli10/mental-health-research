My mouth hurts after some time and taste just becomes meaningless and texture feels like shit. Its just such a craving and compulsion that I cant stop but its never enjoyable... the day after is always worse than the binge itself.. Im sorry that you had to go through this. Just know its going to be okay, and while I by no means want to endorse your behavior.. just for the sake of your current  mental well being- weight loss is never linear and one binge wont affect it by much at all.",False,False
