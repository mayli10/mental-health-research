Even if I'm tripping at a music festival all I can think is going to a mirror so I can see myself. I *know* I don't look like that normally but I can't stop staring. I've spent 10 mins in the bathroom at a show because I was hypnotized by the mirror looking at my shoulders. Acid is also very hard on my brain, it gives me a lot of headaches during and after the trip, and the visuals sometimes get too strong and it triggers my anxiety really bad.   On the other side tho, I think that tripping on shroomies can be very relaxing, and I feel more connected to my body. Yeah, there are still things I'd like to change about it, but I feel more comfortable with my flaws. I feel like my ED voice goes to sleep when I'm on shrooms. Shrooms have helped me a lot in recovery. I'm trying to get better because I know now that I can accept my body if I work on it.",False,False

Obv it didnâ€™t last forever but during the trip I was looking in the mirror and I really saw myself differently, as a beautiful human being, who wasnâ€™t just a collection of fucked up experiences and a mess no one could ever love, but actually, I felt a love towards myself that I reserve for an intimate partner. It was nice. I even ate afterwards and didnâ€™t feel bad about it, for once, because In that time I believed I deserved a belly full of warm, good food. The feelings began to fade over the next couple days, and things did go back to normal, but for the first time I really believed that someday, I can see myself that way: sober. And I still do believe that.",False,False

However the last time it did a large dose of mushrooms ( probably my strongest dose) I decided to sit with a mirror directly across from me and draw a self portrait from the reflection while peaking. I ended up doing two.  Shockingly even though I put myself in that realty trap that I would never recommend to someone tripping, I had an overwhelmingly positive experience.   I felt a part of my body, I usually feel so disconnected to my meat suit. Of the two portraits one all bright colours and fairly idealized (though drawn tripping so maybe not lol) and the other was very dark. But the darker one didnâ€™t give me any bad vibes, I just felt like it was closer to the me I was really. That connecting with my morbid side isnâ€™t harmful, and far less so than straining to be ideal.   Iâ€™m not disproving things very well. DM if you want to see the photos.",False,False

I had stripped naked and stood in front of a mirror and just cried for myself. Following the trip, I spend months trying to recover and actually took care of myself.  Those 4-5 months were the healthiest physical and mentally I had been in years...but then I relapsed :/ Iâ€™ve dropped a few more times since, but am too scared too look at myself in the mirror again.  But it was a strangely beautiful experience to see myself objectively for once, and how my instinctual reaction was to love take care of the person in front of me.",False,False

In my general experience with hallucinogens tho: itâ€™s important as heck to be in the right headspace going into the whole thing. At least as much as you can be, u kno?   Like if youâ€™re having a super Bad Body Day beforehand, maybe hold off on tripping if possible...? Of course itâ€™s easier said than done and there are still no guarantees really, but try to go into it broadly thinking the Good Thoughts.  Also, make sure youâ€™re with cool people you trust, ideally including at least one sober personâ€”and make sure youâ€™re in a safe place, ideally with some positive stimuli and so on. I mean, Iâ€™m sure you know this stuff, but reminders canâ€™t hurt. :â€™) Have fun! Good luck! ðŸ’›",False,False
