This would explain why I've lost muscle despite doing far more heavy lifting at work over the holiday period. But I also wasn't taking in great amounts of protein to help sustain my muscle mass. Maybe one day logic and facts will overpower the sick part of me, so I can regain strength.",False,False

However it also depends on how large of a calorie deficit u are in. Keep in mind that tour body will prioritize muscle loss so most of the protein will first be used for repairing damaged tissues from working out before and muscle protein synthesis is used for hypertrophy.  This is why bodybuilders do cut/bulk cycles. Focusing on gaining muscle and losing fat separately is much more realistic.   tldr: possible but not optimal",False,False
