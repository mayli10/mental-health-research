Obviously I'm not sure what your personal budget is, but I don't think that you spent an exorbitant amount. If money is a concern, I love the website BudgetBytes for tasty and cheap meals :)   Please don't fast, you deserve love and compassion for yourself. I hope the rest of the 11 days of the month are much better for you.",False,False

Please know that you're not alone, and nobody is judging you here. Please try not to be so harsh on yourself. Okay, this month was bad for you, by your accounts, really bad. But there's always next month, and fasting is not worth it, you don't deserve that. Truly, what you deserve is to feel good about yourself, and I guarantee if you're struggling with bingeing, you very well might end up in a worse position by fasting. Binge/fast/binge/fast/binge - it's never-ending. I'm going through something similar, and it makes you feel like such a mess, but you don't deserve that. I'm really, really sorry you're having a rough time and I hope things look up for you soon :)",False,False

The past 20 days I’ve spent $747.78 on food... not including a ordered box of McDougall’s noodles for $258...   I’m not even rich (polar opposite) that’s literally my months paycheck gone on food.  Fasting isn’t the answer. You’ll be ok. I’ve started browsing the frugal food subs on here for inspo on how to spend less. But it’s hard. It’s so hard.,False,False

I totally understand the feeling of ""I deserve it"". But you sound like you're feeling really distressed right now, and that could possibly lead to binging again. I know it would for me.  I know it's really hard but please try to take care of yourself. Make sure you're caught up on sleep. Get some fresh air if you haven't lately. I think if you start starving yourself again, your body is going to protest, so let it relax for a little. Try to eat filling and nutritious foods, and get lots of electrolytes if you've been making yourself sick. I know it's really hard. But just try to give yourself at least a couple days to balance out so your body is not so strained and doesn't fight so much. I think this will help you in the long run. ♡",False,False
