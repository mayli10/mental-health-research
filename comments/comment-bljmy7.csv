EDs are fucked up to begin with, let alone what society/others tell us about them. Follow countdowntocontrol's advice. The fact that you are thinking about this and posted here shows you do want to get better at some point, but right now you have a war within yourself and we've all been there fighting that fight. Take it day by day. You're not alone.",False,False

You deserve recovery, but let's take that out of the picture for the moment. Think of some things you can do to make this situation just a little better. Take a hot bath and warm yourself. Wear soft warm clothes. Take a multivitamin. Call somebody and talk about the weather. Step back from the panic and the pressure for a little while, and when you're ready it will feel at least a little more manageable to sort through all of this stuff. I hope you feel better soon x",False,False
