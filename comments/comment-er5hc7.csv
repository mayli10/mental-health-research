It sounds like you're definitely relapsing, and you need to reach out before you slip too much. Relapse is nearly always a piece in recovery, but it's not the permanent life you have to live, and it's not the life you deserve. I hope you'll consider reaching out to a doctor or therapist because the quicker you get help, the less damage will be done, and the easier it will be to get back to recovery. Good luck darling, I'm sending as much strength and love as I can &lt;3",False,False
