I‚Äôve been feeling down lately, so I‚Äôve been seeing him more often bc he makes me feel safe, but he eats so unhealthily, like fast food everyday.  I go wayy over my maintenance whenever we eat together.   We also just came back from a trip over seas which I said ‚Äúfuck it‚Äù to as well. So now I‚Äôve gained so much weight that my coworkers even commented on it. I feel like a monster. I‚Äôve been pretty much binging for a month now. Ugh. ",False,False

I often get into a ‚Äúfuck it‚Äù mood for a while after bingeing really catastrophically, like it can stretch on afterwards and can become more like compulsive overeating because UGH FUCK IT!!! :/ Yeah.  I‚Äôm right there with you and have been for a while in an attempt at like ‚Äúbulimia recovery‚Äù or whatever, but I feel like it‚Äôs just BED now??? :( I keep gaining weight and am high key pining for death. I mean, I‚Äôve been ambivalent about ‚Äúrecovery‚Äù and am like really only sort of trying to resist fasting because I keep being assured that ‚Äúregular eating‚Äù will help me, except now I‚Äôm just being a fatass again lmao. I‚Äôm super out of control and don‚Äôt know what to do.  ‚ÄúModeration‚Äù is straight up not a thing I can do anymore apparently?! So that‚Äôs great. I feel like I NEED to fast to ‚Äúreset‚Äù myself and I‚Äôm probably going to for as long as I can after today tbh (after today only because I have plans with a family friend who knows I‚Äôve been struggling with this sort of cycle, and I don‚Äôt don‚Äôt want her to be concerned if she notices me avoiding food). I just. Don‚Äôt know what else to do at this point.   Anyway. YEAH. Fucking...yeah... I feel this. üò´ You are not alone. üíúüíõ",False,False

When I fall into this it usually lasts a week or two, but somehow the guilt and anxiety  still lingers in the background.
