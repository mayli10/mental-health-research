After I realized that that was AWFUL for my body I started doing Vodka Diet Cokeâ€™s exclusively when I went out and then trying not to purge later. Also carb loading before drinking for me is a no go, so I usually start with a low cal beer on an empty stomach and move from there. Alcohol is a complicated relationship lmao",False,False

I end up ordering some wack drink usually with tequila or vodka. I like lime juice, soda water and tequila with salt and limes on the rim. Other times I do tequila shots with a Modelo or other light beer. Orrr diet ginger ale with vodka, limes, and mint for a low cal muleðŸ¤· I also don't eat if I know I'm going out, which also helps me get drunk quickly and on less, so I save money lol.",False,False
