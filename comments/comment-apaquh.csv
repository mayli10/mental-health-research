She obviously feels inadequate, and being an overweight teenager myself, might be made fun of for her weight. I've been at both ends (starving 94 lbs and binging 140 lbs) and both make me feel disgusting and worthless.   Here's what I want most from the people in my life, which I never get: To give me a hug and tell me they love me no matter what.  Once your sister feels more love for herself she will begin to change her habits.  For me it's been a long road of hating myself and binging to cope with it, but I've finally been broken down so much that I have to start loving myself again. I'm slowly incorporating healthy foods and exercise in my diet while trying to not fall into starving, cutting, etc. It's difficult but possible if you treat yourself right.
