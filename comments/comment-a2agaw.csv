Your brother and sister in law probably won't pay a ton of attention to you. You could also try cooking normal meals when they're not home and tell them that they can have the left overs or something? Like don't cook much, pretend you had some and say you left some for them to have dinner or something. Maybe you can excuse your eating safe foods by pretending that you're eating other things when they happen not to be around.   The group project will be over soon and you won't have to deal with those idiots again.  I don't know how it works where you live but it's pretty hard to hospitalize an adult against their will. So worse comes to worse, there's always that.   Also, happy cake day! I'm sending all the warm and calm vibes your way. I believe that you'll be fine.  ",False,False
