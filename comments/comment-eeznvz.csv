That was the most productive time of my life. I slept maybe every other day and ate even less, but I became a real powerhouse. My chores were done, I walked a few miles a day, I worked my 60 hour a week desk job and got nothing but praise from my bosses, it was great.",False,False

It’s rough tho and i’d day def hasn’t done my body image any favors even if it can be an appetite suppressant. Idk if any of that is relevant to you, but that’s my experience",False,False
