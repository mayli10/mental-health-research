I had some vague impression of pity for ED/depression suffers, but I just didn't *get* it. Why would anyone want to die? Poor fools. Mostly, mental illness was never on my mind.  Now I'm depressed as all hell and haven't been mentally stable in over three years. My weight goes from critically underweight to barely passable for treatment and I haven't maintained anywhere since I was a freshman in high school. All I want is to die. I can't see a future for myself and I hardly expect to live to see my next birthday.",False,False

I didn‚Äôt think much of them at all, I didn‚Äôt realize how common eating disorders are. I thought it was some rare phenomena that occurred in a small population, but I‚Äôm starting to see how widespread body image issues and eating disorders are. I see it everywhere now. I see in people I thought were ‚Äúnaturally thin‚Äù, I notice people going hours without eating, I notice people eating one meal a day that doesn‚Äôt give them all the calories they need. I think this is more of me growing up tho and seeing things for how they are idkkkkk",False,False

I‚Äôve been really skinny before I hit puberty and I got a lot of negative comments about my weight.
