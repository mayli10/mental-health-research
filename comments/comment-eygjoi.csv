I tend not to give in to fishing compliments and fire back with a harmless funny/whitty remark because I believe a compliment should hold some weight and not just be meaningless words. In reality this could be not as bad as you think. If he wanted to just shower you wish compliments, he would. He thought you were serious and gave you a serious response worded lightly instead of just shrugging it off or just saying “meh well maybe hit the gym more, or try a diet”. He may just want you to be your best self. Also, being a pharmacist may have had a lot to do with his answer. It’s the first connection he made, so he voiced it.",False,False
