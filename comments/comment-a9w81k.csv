Relish in that feeling. I know I will once I get back there because I feel like that everyday. Everytime I think about what my body looks like it destroys me completely. I have literally zero confidence and i just wish I could be put out for a few months until I lost the weight and then wake up. I hate leaving the house or going anywhere because all I can think about is what people must think of me. ,False,False

Granted, I hated myself everyday for it and wouldn't leave my house because of BED, but I'm still angry I couldn't just lose the weight when I first tried years ago. Instead, I had to waste years of bingeing and purging just to get somewhere a normal person would get in several months.",False,False

When I was at my heaviest I was 5 pounds away from being overweight BMI-wise and I looked crazy. I cringe to look at pictures and think of myself trying to socialize, talk to boys, be taken seriously in any capacity, etc. at that weight lol. But the transformation has been insane!!

I hate my weight now but I can't look at pictures of myself when I was overweight without cringing and feeling like crap.
