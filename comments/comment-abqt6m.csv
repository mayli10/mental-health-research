Don't go down that road, the risk isn't worth it.   Put it in a drawer forever and tell your mom you lost the charger or keep forgetting to charge it. Throw away the charger.",False,False

I'm trying to see it as a neutral thing. This doesn't mean I have over exercise. It just a minimum everyone should reach for their health.   I plan to take it off if I start relying on it in ways I shouldn't. ",False,True

A good amount of people get the trackers as New Years resolutions to “get fit” and then later realize there’s more to it than spending money and give up. If you wear it for a bit and then stop you’ll perfectly match the trend!,False,False

I wish you could figure out a natural way to decline it but if you are very young or feel a lot of pressure about needing to use this gift I do understand....I'm not sure how old you are, but I'm sure that if you'd like some type of excuse that would help you you can likely think of one. Some posters have suggested ideas... You could just say you find the data overwhelming? idk... I've never had a tracker so I don't know what info would work for an excuse",False,False
