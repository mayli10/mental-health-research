I moved out early because I got into university early which helped some but not all. Depending on where you live, some areas allow minors to make their own decisions for certain medical and mental health issues after a certain age or if you can demonstrate that you’re mature. So like if you need to check yourself into a hospital ever, know that it may be an option even if you’re under 18. If you’re in America, most places consider failure to provide adequate mental health care a form of neglect/“inadequate guardianship” and grounds for a report to child protective services. And if worst comes to works, call a hotline and don’t tell them your age. It really does get better after 18–still hard but for me at least I had more agency which led to more hope and more motivation. You’ll get there!!",False,False
