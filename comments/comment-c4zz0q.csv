And as sucky as that was, my body seemed to come to an equilibrium and I no longer had as many urges to binge. Although this was over the course of like almost a year, so definitely not ideal because it came with weight gain and feeling overall depressed :(",False,False

You (I at least) feel powerful and invincible. I just figured out how to hit ctrl-Z on eating, that's magic right?   Personally, I became addicted to that feeling of power, and the realization that I never *had* to keep anything down because I could make that choice, I had the power to turn back time. But the issue is that even if you dont want to binge, you want to purge, cause you're high on the control...  Then there's the compulsive side of it, that unavoidable voice at the back of your head reminding you you shouldn't have eaten. I remember once purging a fucking salad which was just maybe a cup of iceberg lettuce and a tsp of mustard. It was like AN whispered ""shouldn't have eaten that, fatass"" and BN hugged me and said ""dont worry babe we can make this right."" (For reference I was diagnosed with AN B/P subtype).   At least that's how I always felt. I hope things get better for you. They did for me and I know they can for you ‚ù§",False,False

Binge, feel guilty, purge and then your brain feels guilty and you‚Äôll try to restrict a bit and then that‚Äôll make you binge again. It‚Äôs honestly one of the hardest things I‚Äôve ever had to over come and I hope you find the strength to recover from it soon because it is such a vicious cycleüòî‚ù§Ô∏è",False,False

It certainly got way more vicious in my case. I‚Äôm in the same boat as you right now; used to only binge on enjoyable foods now it‚Äôs switched to whatever I can get my hands on. It also used to only be a once-a-week thing &amp; now I‚Äôll b/p any chance I get, which is almost a daily basis now that schools out for summer &amp; i‚Äôm home alone.
