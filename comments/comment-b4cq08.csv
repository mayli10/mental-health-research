Tell her that you want to prepare the meals with her and that you only want to eat the 'notmal' three meals per day, or two, or whatever your family does.  Like, tell her you want to be healthy.  Then, you can male better choice. If she wants to make you meat, just choose low calorie options, low cal fish or chicken. Low cal Steamed veggies instead of Fried catbs or whatever.

I tell her not to cook for me and she says yes, but she still does. and when she does, she cooks meat... which I know is for me because she doesn't eat that. if I went vegetarian, she would still cook for me because that's what she eats lollll this just isn't going to work",False,True

I used to be the same, it was so hard to say no to food, but since publicly going vego it’s like a switch in my brain and its easy now since I don’t want to be called out for not really being vegetarian  It also helps in that I can have complete control over what I have for dinner, since its different from everyone else  If your mum loves to cook though this may backfire and she might start cooking with you in mind, and in that case you **can not** say no ya feel?",False,False
