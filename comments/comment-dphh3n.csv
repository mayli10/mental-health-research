A least you made the effort with the catsâ€™ ears and wearing all black. I didnâ€™t even wear a chequered shirt.   A Raggedy Ann Maga Supporter, America and Mr Tump would be proud.   Now as I sit in my office and gaze at a rainy wind-swept day in Dublin, Ireland. I prepare myself for the pain and anguish that is Christmas.   Thanks for the support.",False,False

Had a really good run this morning and I'm feeling good aside from being in my body. Lol. What kind of an engineer are you? I'll be thinking about you when I'm running tonight after work ðŸ˜Š Glad I'm not the only one staying home.",False,True

Just wanted to congratulate you on yourself improvement. Change is hard but your doing it. Hopefully next holiday you will get to show off your gains and losses. Should be proud of yourself your getting, there. Take pride in your strength to change.        I am sitting it out and heading to the gym. Its been a shitty 2019. I thought the odd numbers were the lucky ones. I love Halloween always have since I was a kid. Not the food but the expression, the decorations and the costumes.   I have had a problem with food since I was 14 and Christmas always felt so food orientated.       Halloween was about expression and storytelling. Living your heroâ€™s.    I always loved fashion and thought I would work in the fashion industry but ended up becoming an engineer.  I am not a big fan of the slut costumes and think itâ€™s a bit tacky. I have always maintained its not the lack of clothes that make a woman sexy but the clothes themselves. How they are created, fitted and accessorised.   Anyway, I will miss seeing all the work people put into their costumes. Admiring all the thought and effort. The empowerment people receive from there costumes.",False,False
