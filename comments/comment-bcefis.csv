It was probably more that I interpreted this as ‚Äúdon‚Äôt eat when you‚Äôre hungry‚Äù to an extent.  Also, when I gave the example of eating a whole pizza and she advised against it, it made me feel as though the extreme hunger that I occasionally feel is unhealthy and wrong, so I shouldn‚Äôt listen to those hunger signals and should restrict myself - which made me feel even more confused.  Ah well, I‚Äôll get through this I hope. Thanks again!",False,True

Sometimes with meal timing I think the idea is that if you eat at the same time you will train your body to be hungry at those times. You can always ask questions ""can you explain why you're recommending _________ ?""   Also, those instructions ARE restrictive. They are literally ""you are to eat under these conditions."" So your feeling matches reality. You're not wrong.",False,False

The dietitian says she's very experienced with several decades in this field, so I'm hoping she knows what she's doing. I agree with you in that I think she may be thinking I'm still trying to eat very little and 3 is a challenge, as well as keeping me from binging then feeling guilt. Prior to my meeting with her, I ""binged"" in the sense that I just ate whatever I felt like when I wanted it for a day or two once I released myself from tracking - though I didn't feel guilty at all and it was quite liberating in a sense.   I contacted her, letting her know my feelings and she mainly reassured me that she knows what she's doing and she needs to know what and how I'm eating right now. She said that if I can eat 3 meals and 3 snacks at the same time each day, then she's happy with that right now. I think I'm more comfortable to eat what I want right know, though still feel some judgement from her (which I know is nonexistent) from when I want to eat loads and maybe not of the most nutritious of things. Also, I'm happy she's told me I don't need to limit myself to 3 meals and can have snacks, but even still feel a little restricted that I NEED to have them at the same time each day - but what if I feel really hungry for a snack at a certain time one day, then not at that time another? I don't know. It's still quite frustrating and I suppose all I want is permission to eat. I can give myself permission, though feel like her instructions to structure my eating already and ""over-the-shoulder-non-existent judgement"" from taking photos is sort of restrictive.   Thanks again guys for your support and views, it really means a lot.",False,True

The difference is I never opened up abt my ED or anything, just told my doctor my weight loss was accidental and came from me being lazy bc I didn‚Äôt wanna say I relapsed, and also I‚Äôm not severely underweight, just underweight. (At least for my age of 17. According to my bmi app, I‚Äôd be severely underweight if I was two years older lmao)   I also find myself thinking ‚Äúif I‚Äôm going to gain, I want to enjoy it‚Äù and sometimes this does mean things like 4 donuts. (Or in my case, two donuts, mini cinnamon roll, ice cream, etc) or pints of full cal ice cream at once with cinnamon bread. But I‚Äôve found that sometimes I really do still feel guilty afterwards, since I‚Äôm not mentally recovered, and I‚Äôm almost stuck in the same binge-restrict cycle as before, except with slightly different thoughts. I just tell myself I will eat what I want, and feel bad, then restrict and try to pass it off as just being ‚Äúbalanced‚Äù as part of ‚Äúrecovery‚Äù but in reality I‚Äôm maintaining and my nutrient intake has probably gone down. So I haven‚Äôt gained . Or recovered.  Your dietician MIGHT just be trying to prevent this. Again, I don‚Äôt know as I never got professional help or anything, but seeing that we have similar mindsets / goals kind of, and I‚Äôm not doing any better and don‚Äôt have the help of a dietician, this seems like the case to me.   Maybe try asking how you could incorporate the foods you‚Äôre craving so you don‚Äôt feel restricted! Because god, I know I‚Äôve missed sweet foods so so much. So ask how you can start incorporating desserts or snack foods if they‚Äôre not part of your meals, because you deserve to have what you want, enjoy food again, and recover at the same time &lt;3 best of luck!!",False,False

If not so experience...I would say this is poor advice - look up some stuff on Tabitha Fararrah's (sp) site. It sounds like the dietician is assuming you are eating very little right now, and thinks that 3 meals will be a challenge. I think she is maybe also trying to ""keep you from bingeing"".  For bodies coming out of starvation there are no bad foods and there is no such thing as too much food if you're hungry for it.  As for being judged, I think it's understandable that if you haven't had a donut in X amount of time you want one... dieticians above all peopel preach the ""denying yourself makes you want the thing more"".  Keep us updated.",False,False

When I had to gain weight I ate 6 times a day because I couldn't eat a lot of food at once so that was easier to get all the calories my body needed.   Be careful however with the mentality ""I want to eat 4 donuts if I want"". Those donuts aren't going anywhere so maybe eat one or two but don't overdo it as it might end up going towards binge eating.   Please talk to your dietitian as your recovery is about you before all things. She should work with you and not only tell you what to do. Make sure you tell her how you feel and good luck on your recovery üíñ",False,False

It is designed so you can take a quick snap photo of your meal, you can set meal time reminders. It does not track calories and I think it is designed to help people eat more intuitively.   I do also disagree with eating only 3 meals a day, and it is contrary to advice I have gotten from medical professionals. I would have a serious discussion with your doctor/dietitian about how you feel restricting times is going to be triggering for you. Eating at least 1 snack should (in my non medical opinion) be encouraged.",False,False

I felt similar, like 'shouldn't you be telling me to eat whatever I want? shouldn't it all be like those recovery girls on social media who tell you to have the cookies whenever?'   But she is a trained, experienced expert who knew that I wouldn't do that and just be ok with what I ate if I ate too much, and I completely understand that.  I'd assume/hope the person you're seeing is good at their job, and probably knows the ins/outs of an ed brain and doesn't want to shock your system.  I would talk to them about it at the next appointment, or you could even text her and ask what she thinks the next time you want to eat outside of the meal plan.  When I went back for my second appointment, she told me that if I ate more than what I was told she would be happy and that it's perfectly alright as long as it doesn't lead to compensatory behaviors or extreme guilt, so maybe yours feels the same and was trying to ease you into eating normally.  If you feel uncomfortable about texting the food definitely say something, but eds fuck up all of your habits with food and having no rules right away doesn't work for everyone when they try and recover.  Good for you for doing this and good luck!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",False,False
