That sub was really the most helpful thing I've found in a while. I've never been able to talk about the weird shit my disorder makes me do because it's so embarrassing, and I'm so ashamed what I do with food. The shame we feel while suffering from this disorder is so incredibly isolating but when you can finally share and someone says ""oh, I also totally binged on straight ketchup!"" it seems a little less shameful.

I will never feel another sense of community this deeply. The ED community on Reddit is by far the most open-armed one I have ever been on. It's something I NEED.
