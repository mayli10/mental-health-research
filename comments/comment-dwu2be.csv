I've been resting, eating and staying hydrated for about a year and it's safe to say it's helped me rewire my brain (i.e unlearn food rules and disordered behaviours). Neural rewiring has helped me recover long-term :)",False,True

Obviously this is *my* experience, but yes I do find that I eat without a second thought! I eat what I want, when I want it and how I want it. It's a long, tiring process, but now I can eat my ex fear-foods and think, "" what was I scared of?!""   I am also pleased to say that the anorexic voice rarely tries to quarrel with me anymore, because I am stronger than a whiny little bully! &gt;:)  Rest, eat and stay hydrated. Recovery is possible. Gaining back your life is possible &lt;3",False,True
