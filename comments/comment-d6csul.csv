The only way i’ve found to lose it is restricting really low but then i just binge again.  I would say start of counting your calories loosely. don’t weigh everything, it’s ok to estimate. if you start counting cals really strictly your going to want to give up.  Also don’t give yourself a really low cal goal. it sounds as if you have a cycle of binging and restricting (like same) try higher cal goals (1200 is what i aim for) and exercise.",False,False
