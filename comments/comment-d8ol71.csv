I was making myself eat breakfast, have a small snack at 10, eat lunch, have a snack at 3, eat dinner..... it honestly felt horrible. I felt uncomfortable and full all day and idk... I ended up restricting for a day and then binged and purged all day the next day and then went back today to only eating ""lunch"" (like 200 cals worth) and dinner and it's like. Feels way more natural to me. Like I feel so relieved right now. Like this is how it's supposed to be for me.  Which is messed up cos when I was eating the 3 meals a day I had a reasonable healthy calorie limit that I stuck to and was eating healthy foods and not binging but. I just felt awful.   I'm at a bit of a loss because right now I'm trying to be Recovered and eat 1500-1800 a day and like 110g of protein or some shit and I like have to eat 3 square meals to do that but. It just makes me feel so fat???? But im.supposed to be focusing on fitness like I'm not even weighing myself right now cos I'm trying to focus on eating enough of healthy food and hitting the gym and making gAiNz and whatnot but.

What I am doing now that helps is eat two big sustainable meals well balanced meals a day. I am far in my recovery and allow myself to eat 1000 calories each meal. If I am hungry in between, I eat some type of fruit. I hate the feeling of hunger and sometimes eating tiny portions makes me hungrier than actually fasting. I like this way because it’s less planning and I feel it’s easier on my mind to eat to satiation.",False,False
