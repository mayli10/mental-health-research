I have periods where I accept that there is something wrong with me when I cry about having to eat and sometimes can't eat without totally distracting myself. I also spend the majority of the day thinking about food or my weight or my clothes or my appearance in general. My brain heavily subscribes to the 'not skinny enough to be sick' rhetoric.,False,False

I allow myself to eat fast food every now and then but i still have an unhealthy obsession with food.  It isn't normal to hate yourself after eating and it isn't normal to look at thinspo yk.   All of these symptoms make your ED real.  And valid.,False,True
