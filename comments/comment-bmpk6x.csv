My mom has it and a lot of the risk factors apply to me, so I was probably going to get it eventually whether I was anorexic or not. My ED definitely aggravated it, however. Like, my mom doesn't take any special medication or eat a specific diet and she seems almost fine, but I constantly feel so awful that I can hardly leave my bed most days. Fortunately my symptoms mostly seem to be pain, discomfort, and bloating, so I can technically just ignore it when I *really* need to. Things would be a lot easier if I didn't have to ignore this stuff though.",False,False

I'm not sure if my gut issues existed before my ed, but they might have. The ed definitely makes it worse. I think generally the professionals recommend eating regularly and letting the gut learn to digest foods first before trying an elimination diet, and that should only be done under strict supervision.",False,False
