I tried a few times to eat to the point of involuntary vomiting. Didn't work only got stomach pain the next day. I can make myself vomit but I would prefer if fate could grant it. I also have witnessed my family members getting sick to the point of vomiting multiple times and I just don't get sick? Or if I do it's not to the severity of vomiting like them. It's irrational to be jealous or envious but I am ðŸ™ƒ,False,False
