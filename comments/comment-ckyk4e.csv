I will be an RD in one year after I pass my board exam, and I would never intrude on another eating disorder dietitian's clinical experience. Even a regular, non-ED dietitian wouldn't be able to give you proper advice. I presented about the Standards of Practice for eating disorder dietitians a few months ago, and the profession is heavily reliant on experiential learning. There's is not a precise formula for eating disorder nutrition therapy, and each patient should ideally have individualized care.   Your ""eat a sweet potato"" goal sounds like goals I had in treatment centers (mine was ""eat a banana."") Some other goals I remember having were about hydrating properly, trying a different brand of a ""safe food,"" paying attention to hunger/fullness cues, waiting 20 minutes before engaging in a behavior (with the goal of continuously adding 20 minutes until behavior urges like purging pass), trying a restaurant item without augmenting it (e.g. no replacements, removals, putting things on the side, etc.), and making grocery lists instead of anxiously wandering stores for 1-2 hours.",False,False

Same thing. Having trouble with needing PHP but being self reliant, so a lot of it is game planning how I can get into PHP because when it comes down to it, that would benefit me the most. I need more support than OP offers. They‚Äôre still working on my ED, but also being really helpful and trying to help me with insurance, looking at grants, looking for an outside clinic ED therapist for added support if my 90 day OP program ends before I‚Äôm able to get into PHP.  Definitely give it another try! If you‚Äôre lucky enough to live in a big city like I do, with multiple clinics, try a different clinic. My care team takes on the approach of yeah, I need higher care, like NEED it, but what can they do in the meantime to give me PHP level care and support with the time they have working with me, and get me on track to being more stable to try getting into PHP with everything else I have on my plate, or find the next best option. Recovery shouldn‚Äôt just be an option for those with perfect life circumstances, and I really hope you find a team that realizes that, this time around!  Also, just going to warn that a lot of RDs won‚Äôt work with someone needing a high level of care if you don‚Äôt already have a psych working with you, because they won‚Äôt, in good consciousness, take your money if they don‚Äôt think it‚Äôll be beneficial for you. Start with a specialized psych, even if it‚Äôs not through a program, you can get a referral list of ED therapists through a recovery center. I would start there! :]",False,True

I did attempt a very slow based recovery recently and was pushed way too fast by my therapist, who ultimately told me after a couple of months that she couldn‚Äôt in good conscience continue to treat me because I wasn‚Äôt getting ‚Äúbetter‚Äù fast enough. By this she meant gaining weight, while i was just confused that we hadn‚Äôt even begun to attempt tackling my dysmorphia, which I felt was much more important. She pushed me to try food-related situations that scared me (much like your fear food example) but didn‚Äôt give me suggestions, just expected me to work it out for myself, and this caused chaos in my brain.   You‚Äôre lucky you have what seems to be such an understanding care team, I hope so much that this attempt is successful for you. Best of luck.",False,False

I was honestly so scared because I thought my entire treatment team would throw the hammer down on my exercise, which is *critical* to me because 1. It manages my anxiety and 2. I have a neuromuscular condition and exercise helps manage pain. My whole treatment team has used my love of running/biking as a motivator *shocked pickachu face*.  I also want to encourage anyone who‚Äôs been in the game a while and went through treatment some years ago and it was gutter shit so that scares you; it‚Äôs an entirely different scene now. Treatment now vs. 10 years ago is night and day. I was pretty much traumatized by shitty treatment 10 years ago but now? My whole treatment team is amazing.
