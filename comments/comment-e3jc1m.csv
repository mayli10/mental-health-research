It was hard for me to feel comfortable eating today because I was associating it with those negative feelings from last night. Buuut now I've finally got some food on the way, I'm watching a movie, and I'm feeling fine.   Thank you for your help and support. It's really appreciated.",False,True

It's just hard for me to accept the fact that they're not the best people for me to have around because they are my family and I do love them. But it seems as time goes on that they just become more and more insensitive and toxic. Luckily my parents are always supportive and immediately told everybody off and left with me. We had our own Thanksgiving without the dramatic extended family.   Thank you so much for your kind response ❤️ it was very helpful. I'm glad you had a nice Thanksgiving on your own! I'll have to try that next year.,False,True

Maybe the vegan cheese (vegan cheese is so good tho and I'm not even vegan) but the rest is like... ""Normal"" food ? Like probably something all your family eats ?  I'm so sorry you had to go through this. This is not okay, even if you came with really weird food (which was not the case). To be honest from my point of view they are the one humiliating themselves with their ignorance. Not you. You tried your best, even challenged yourself and they acted like 4 years old.  I hope you are doing okay. ♡",False,False

As I’m sure you can already see, none of that is okay, and especially after you told them it was making you uncomfortable...I can relate to having toxic family members, especially when it comes to food/veganism.  I spent yesterday alone for that reason among others, and it was really nice. I hope you’re able to take some time to yourself today to do something you enjoy. We can not control our families shitty behaviors, and most will never change. We can’t dwell on it, we just have to accept it and either guard ourselves better next time, or refuse to put ourselves in a bad situation again. ❤️   My heart is with you today, I really hope that you’re okay.",False,False
