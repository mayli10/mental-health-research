I can drink one after my workout and a second one as a late night snack which gives me a total of 50g of protein for only 220calories.   Iâ€™m bad and usually add a cup of unsweetened almond mild as well which is another 30cal but you donâ€™t have to.,False,False

I could use like another 40g of protein per day, but reasonably I'm shooting for 15g-20g because I can't eat as much as I'm supposed to. I at least want like two thirds of my protein goals in an average day since I consume about two thirds of the calories I'm supposed to. I should probably go for a probiotic yogurt I guess, but I'm sure any yogurt is fine.",False,False
