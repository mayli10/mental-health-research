I get a lot of satisfaction from that (probably a disproportionate amount tbh), but idk if it turns me on per se. I’ll contemplate it. ",False,False

Idk if this can make you feel any better but a friend of mine feels the exact same way as you do regarding eating and eating sounds, she does not have an ed she just is naturally repulsed by this kinda stuff. She told me that she's disgusted by eating in general and that if she winces or looks disgusted while I eat to not take it personally. She told this to everybody in her life, including her boyfriend, and we all understand and try to make her feel better. What I'm trying to say is that maybe your repulsion is not necessarily caused by your ed but it's something completely separate, and even if it is tied to your ed try not to feel too bad about it, it doesn't mean you're broken or you're a bad person, you're not the only one to feel like this, it's just a quirk some people have.   Besides finding it attractive has it's downsides, I think I sometimes give guys ""bedroom eyes"" while they're eating. It's fucking embarrassing, makes me feel like freak. ",False,True

Instead I find it absolutely repulsive, which isn’t great in a relationship. The sounds people make when they eat, their messiness and hurriedness, really gross me out and sometimes it’s hard for me to hide. The last thing you ever want to express on your face to your partner or friend is disgust. I mean, it *is* a manners thing. Chomping and huffing out words obscured by a half-masticated ball of mush isn’t something most people find acceptable. But most people are capable of politely ignoring the behavior. I can’t stop myself from frowning at it. Messy eaters getting bits of food stuck to their face is generally handled with a laughing but loving reminder to dust it off. But I find myself unable to divert my attention from the specs of food being worn by someone to the point that I can’t even register what they’re saying. I have to interrupt them to let them know before I’m “ok” again. It sucks. Not only do I have my own anxiety and stress around food, but in some twisted, fucked up fashion I’ve started feeling that anxiety and stress *for* people about food. Like I’m compensating for them or something. It’s sick. Sometimes it seems like the more I shrink, the more this illness grows.",False,False

It wasn't until long into my recovery that I was consistently attracted to the opposite sex again. Literally nothing would ""turn me on"", even the most overtly sexual things. I'm not gonna lie, this was an awesome aspect of restricting because life is so much simpler when physical attraction and arousal is impossible. I felt like I got some kind of freedom from it.",False,False
