It is possible to restrict, but if that's what you want to do, you have to adjust it to the culture.   People will be very concerned with feeding you (especially as a guest and someone who is younger). A common greeting is ""Have you eaten?"" and if you say ""no"" they are now basically required to feed you -something to be aware of.   That said, for better or worse, people are very frank about dieting and weight and will not question you if you decline certain foods/extra portions because you're dieting. It's a complicated balance between eating (especially home made) meals that are offered to you and using dieting as an excuse to get out of eating.  ***Note: I am in no way giving tips or weight-loss advice. I just want to help you understand the cultural climate within which you'll be operating so you can make the decision that's best for your physical and mental health.
