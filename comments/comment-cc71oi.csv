Before you binge do you know what think/feel?  How I deal with my binge urges is I write down what I ate the whole day with the calories. This is to create awareness. I'm guessing you're restricting ALOT making your body seek out extra calories.  Replace some carbs in your diet with protein or veggies instead to fill you up. And chew and chew a lot. Notice the texture and flavor, you can cut your food more to slow down.  Before I reach for junk food I stop myself and I ask “what's a healthier alternative? do i really want this? am i so hungry i want to eat a salad?” if the answer is no: throw it away.  Remember: instead of purging just exercise and sleep it off!  The key here is to say no and replace it with an healthier alternative and to keep exercising and sleeping well.",False,False
