I tell him I can't, like I just can't. I can't follow some diet plan and magically be cured.

I try to look at it from a scientific outlook. Cannabis does two things, it raises a hormone called ghrelin and decreases a hormone called leptin. Ghrelin is the hormone that signals your brain that its hungry. The appetite raising hormone. Leptin is the hormone that tells your brain its full, and to stop eating. As you can imagine, and have probably experienced like most pot smokers, this is a recipe for eating everything. It's like the floodgates are open and you can't seem to get full. To me it's like a bottomless pit, even after a bunch of food it's like I can still eat more.   To combat this I usually just smoke with friends, my bf, or eat a little before I smoke to get some satiety. Sometimes it works and sometimes...well you know",False,False

Except that, if I could actually do this the healthy way, I'd be much lower by now. Instead I have to eat nothing all day and binge all night. What is wrong with me? Why is it so hard to just not smoke pot at night???   Like that's the problem. Get home, and it's 1 of 2 excuses. 1) ""but I have homework and I must fuel my brain"" or 2) ""it's the munchies""  Honestly when it's the munchies, I don't even think about eating. It just goes down the hatch. The rest of the time I am thinking about not eating, but once stoned..... Idk it's almost like a habit. I don't even particularly enjoy it and I certainly don't need it.   What is wrong with me T.T ",False,False

Fuck my eyes for thinking that my body actually looks slightly better despite being 2 pounds away from my LW still. Perhaps it's just that my eyes got so used to being three pounds away from my LW that the one pound loss is seen as amazing to them.  I KNOW what I'm freaking out over is water weight, but why can't I lose the water weight like I did before my binge?  I've been wearing my Fitbit again recently. And even though it used to underestimate on me when I was fatter because I'd get too sweaty for it to read during exercise, and even though I knock off 100 Calories from it, I still think it might be overestimating now. Or perhaps I'm underestimating my food. I'm trying not to go back to tracking because then I can't eat hyper-healthy dishes, and I purposely try to overestimate the Calories I ingest..but maybe, just maybe, I'm still not accounting for things enough.  Idk, I guess I'm still down in an okayish amount of weight this month, but I need to try harder. I just need to get rid off all this fat as quickly as possible before my breast reduction tbh. (Also, I looked it up, and if they take 450 g from each boob [which is average for a breast reduction] I'll have two pounds cut off of me! üòª..even if it's not two, it'll certainly be one. And I'm sure I'll have trouble eating afterwards, so it's essentially -2 hehe)",False,False
