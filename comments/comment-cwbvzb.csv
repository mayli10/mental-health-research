I mean, I don't want to be thicc or anything like that, but I'm also largely conflicted between not wanting to be thinner because I would look unhealthy and also wanting to be thinner because my ED says that is good. I also have health problems which made it very difficult for me to put on weight when I was trying really hard to, but I eventually managed to control my symptoms well enough to get back to healthy weight. I really liked it, I thought I looked better than I had in ages, but also my ED brain also told me that since gaining weight didn't solve all of my health problems that I may as well just start restricting again and get down even lower than my lowest weight. I did well to not give in for a while, but then my health took a turn and I started losing weight anyway so I decided to eat less and less to see if it would help me feel better and now I'm just sort of eating less because I want to lose weight again. It took me over a year to gain nearly just 15 lbs and now I'm already 6 lbs underweight again. I made a meal plan for myself recently which would involve eating three meals and a snack which is super healthy, but I'm worried it might be too much food and also it's not even enough calories to maintain my weight if I was down to 100 lbs. Things are really hard when you have health problems that impact your ability to eat and it's even harder being anorexic on top of that :(",False,False

A girl I worked with was gorgeous. Flawless skin and incredible with makeup. Adorable face and a cute haircut. And MY GOAL. She was SO TIMY. We always took our breaks around the same time. She always offered me chikfila fries or McDonald’s fries. I always felt rude saying no but wanted to cry when eating them. So I said yes.   After a month or so of this I asked her work out routine. “I don’t. I can’t gain weight. My metabolism is super fast, I’ve tried.” She’s SO TINY. She looked at me and said “girl I wish I had those sexy curves!” While looking at my thighs. Like, what?!? I was so confused too OP. I feel you. I guess it’s true that people all want what they can’t have.",False,False
