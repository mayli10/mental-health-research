I spent like a month in a summer camp, working as a counselor, and it was impossible to restrict because I was constantly surrounded by people. I feel like I gained at least a kilo or two but I'm too scared to weigh myself. Makes me feel like a failure, like I can't even have a proper eating disorder haha",False,False

When I’m by myself I don’t feel like there is a reason for me to eat. When I’m with people it feels like a group thing.   Now the other side of that is when people are commenting on what I’m eating and trying to be nice by saying “eat more take more you have so little” over and over again. Then I get too stressed out to eat.,False,False

I worry I'm too in the way, too obnoxious, etc.... He reassures me I'm not, so I don't have to cope by restricting/bingeing/etc.",False,False

I am oh-so freaking normal and casual about the food situation around others. As if my brain isn’t yelling at me and preoccupied with this garbage 24/7. As if I don’t binge and purge in secret. Makes me feel like how can I be sick if I can “control it” so well? However it helps to remember that a lot of the time a symptom of the disorder is the secrecy - we will go to any lengths to protect ourselves, including putting on a show for others.",False,False

When I’m alone, I just either don’t eat or barely eat. When I’m with people I put on a show and I’ll eat so no one questions me. I hate that I feel like I have to do it, but I can’t deal with comments so I just suck it up and do it. But no one thinks anything’s wrong because they all see me eat, even tho this is prob the least I’ve weighed in a few years. Oh well.   But yes I get how it feels almost invalidating. Just another way your ED tries to trick you, also to avoid feeling invalid it makes you just want to isolate and stay alone so you don’t have to eat. It’s all the ED, but it’s normal, and I’m the same.",False,False

Just this weekend I was with my parents and “ate normally” the whole time. But now that I’m back on my own I’m back to fasting and restricting. Sometimes I don’t even know what this means but I get so anxious when I’m eating with them which kinda makes me feel validated. It makes me so freaking paranoid lol.,False,False
