Now I know the pain of exercise purging and I think it will stop me from doing it again. And yes I'm exhausted lol. Probably gonna have a lot of nap time today,False,True

I took it really easy so my heart rate stayed in the far burn zone. I didnt really sweat till the end with 40 minutes of running which really isnt that much so hopefully I didnt exhaust my electrolyte supplies,False,True

I find it mentally clarifying to challenge myself to give up something it scares me to give up.  And i am worried about being able to go purge free but i think that the physical pain of exercise purging the way that i did it and the fact that i didnt purge through vomiting after binging 3300 cals means i should be able to do it. It wont be easy but I've got stuff to look back on and learn from",False,True
