Thank you so, so much, for your honesty, and vulnerability, and for sharing that about yourself. It means more to me than I can express and was what I needed to hear. I’m happy for you that you overcame this. That shows so much inner strength, and is a huge inspiration to me. I know I have a long hard road ahead, but seeing people like you fight these same demons and thrive, it really gives me hope that it can be done even on my worst days. It’s the reason I keep on pushing. I’d have given up long ago otherwise❤️",False,True

The reason I failed so many times before was because I never really wanted it. The time where I was really able to do it was because my mindset changed, and that time was the winner.   If you are serious about wanting to get better, here's what honestly turned it all around for me -   ED used to be my coping mechanism too, and just like you, I enjoyed the attention and jealousy and felt it was the only important/defining thing about me. The only thing I'm ""good"" at, so to speak.   What really pushed my recovery was finding my worth in something else (I don't know what it could be for you, but for me it was my academics/career). I found a new coping mechanism and a new way to feel good about myself. I studied very hard and tried to get very high grades. Once my priority shifted, the ED part of me started slowly fading away into the background. The fade takes awhile, but you will wake up one day and realise you no longer care like you used to. It seems surreal, just a few years ago, I wouldn't have even thought it was POSSIBLE. But it happened. I didn't need it to feel special anymore.   All it takes is finding that something else to make you feel good about yourself.",False,False

The guilt from wasting all your parents' money on expensive ED treatments, yet inside secretly knowing it's not working. Feeling like nothing will ever work. My ex-boyfriend once cried in front of me. My mother cried in front of me. It still wasn't the push I needed to get better. I was that way for a very long time, but I like to think I'm pretty good right now. I know this may not mean a lot as you won't believe it, but hopefully, in time you will feel better (and get better) too. It took many (slightly over 6) years for me. My mindset now is that although sometimes I miss being thin and the (false) sense of ""power"", I honestly would never, *ever* want to go back to how it was and how bad it felt. I don't even have a weighing scale in my house anymore as I don't even want to give myself the opportunity to fall back in that trap. I hope that is how you will feel one day.   I don't really know what to say because I know that words from a stranger can't help much when you're feeling this way and this deep in. But I just wanted to let you know that there is someone out here who truly understands how you feel - and to offer you some hugs and comfort. You are not a bad person, this is an illness that fucks with our brains and gets the best of us. I hope you have better days soon.",False,False

I’m used to it. It was the norm and once it was removed, I started to crave the dysfunction because I knew how to act and feel. Dysfunction is home for me.",False,False
