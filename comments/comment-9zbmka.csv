It is really nice to hear that you can relate. We ARE worthy of self love &amp; self care.  I am flying back home on the earliest possible flight tomorrow. Obligations fulfilled. I‚Äôm fucking outta here!!  I hope you had a good Thanksgiving too. Do you have any self-love/self-care plans coming up? I‚Äôm thinking about taking a nice hot bath tomorrow night with lots of delicious smelling oils and maybe even some rose petals from the backyard. Aaaaaah, I can‚Äôt wait.",False,True

I literally don‚Äôt feel like I have a purpose in life except to sacrifice everything to make sure they have perfect, happy lives. I‚Äôm basically killing myself slowly and putting everyone else‚Äôs superficial needs ahead of my basic well being and mental health. I‚Äôll literally do ANYTHING that I think might make them say ‚Äúoh, she did all the dishes I‚Äôve been piling up in the sink / cleans my room every week / spends the whole day running errands for me / etc...maybe she‚Äôs not as useless and pathetic as I thought.‚Äù   And the line about just wanting to know who/what/where you are...I am literally in that state of identity crisis 24/7. So I totally empathize with you and I‚Äôm sorry that we both feel like we‚Äôre never important enough to take care of :( But we are...no matter what our brains tell us or how our families treat us, we are worthy of self love and self care. I hope you can eventually leave that toxic environment and surround yourself with people who can recognize how kind and selfless and caring you are towards the people you love.  Happy Thanksgiving bb&lt;3 please feel free to dm if you ever need someone to talk toüíõ",False,False
