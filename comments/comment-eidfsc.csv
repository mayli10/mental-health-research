My ED started before I was interested in relationships so it's impossible to tell. I like being with people but I hate myself so it's hard to be physical sometimes or I clam up after. I never feel like I can give as much as the other person cause I just can't feel that strongly. I don't know how to explain it its like I get to a point and then my emotional range just stops. I don't feel emotions to the full extent.,False,False
