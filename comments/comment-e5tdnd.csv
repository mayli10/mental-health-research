Even if they don't tell me the weight, it still gets entered in the record, and then it pops up in the patient portal. So you still see it.  Even my poor PCP, the last time she asked to see my phone -- that's our agreement, that I don't get on a scale there, but she can ask to see my records -- entered the number in her \*clinical notes\*, so not even in the vitals section, and the assistant who cleans the records/verifies saw it, and entered it in that section anyway. My PCP was horrified, and now just asks if I'm gaining, losing, or maintaining. She knows I'm not going to lie to her.",False,False

Unless you are on a medication that requires an exact weight, or you are getting a procedure like an echocardiogram -- which you wouldn't be at a regular appointment -- there is absolutely no need for them to weigh you.",False,False

My place plasters the numbers all over the paperwork afterwards too, so its very in your face..  Thank you so much for being kind &lt;3",False,True

(It’s uncomfortable, but it’s way more uncomfortable when my brain freaks about the difference between home scale and their scale.)   Depending on your medical circumstances and the purpose of the appointment, I’ve heard declining to be weighed can be an option. (I just haven’t tried it myself.)",False,False
