I think there also some other liquid sweeteners like agave nectar. Depending on the smoothie flavors fruit could work. Bananas tend to be higher than other fruits. Grapes in good amounts are higher to other things by comparison I feel like.  Peanut butter maybe? I have a nut allergy so it's something I don't think of but it does get touted as high in calories.,False,False

My stomach is so messed up that I really just wouldn‚Äôt do any of this if I wasn‚Äôt serious about trying my best, especially so early on :( but you‚Äôre definitely right.üíñ",False,True

You are doing enough if you are doing it consistently. And it's okay if you slip up and don't meet your targets every single day. If you keep trying, that is automatically more than not trying at all and the results WILL compound with time. Just keep at it luv, not being too hard on yourself is ALSO a part of recovery!!!!",False,False

A tiny handful of mixed nuts is like 150cals, eat a small bowl of trail mix or something and you can easily add a few hundred cals into your diet to help.  Make it a trail mix with some other salty and sweet things and just YUM.",False,False

I‚Äôm just wondering what to add to the smoothies for extra calories beyond protein powder. I actually used the mayo trick on a sandwich earlier ;) (I accidentally added too much and it was so gross lmao) but ty so much for the advice! üíñ,False,True

I feel like using condiments and sauces and jellies, butters, oils etc. could help add up calories to your food too while not adding much in the way of extra bulk. Mayo is dense calorie wise but a good source of dietary fat and coconut oil/avocado oil/ etc can have some health benefits too",False,False
