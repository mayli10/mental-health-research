HARDLY ANY IMPACT. I can't believe it. Over a month of applesauce and yogurt for nothing.",False,False

I don't wanna scare you or anything but the recovery isn't as easy so I wouldn't recommend getting it before nye.. in my case I couldn't speak and looked badly swollen for many days after. it's not fun.   also I guess because of the lack of sleep (I couldn't lie down comfortably) and my body recovering from the surgery I was ravenous and lost nothing. this was my case of course but if I was you I would do myself a favour and scheduled it some other time because the following says will probably suck and do you want your holidays to suck? :(,False,False

The post-op experience also really sucked for the first 18 hours or so (disorientation, pain, nausea, an annoying ice-pack protocol). Even as a destructive person who heccin loves being knocked unconscious, I wouldn’t choose that experience again.   I also think you’d have a pretty hard time scheduling elective oral surgery for what is essentially a holiday week.",False,False
