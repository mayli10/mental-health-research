I do believe you should be at peace with your body unless your health is in immediate danger and I’m the last person to really talk but knowing they will never starve themselves because “we love our bodies and will eat that damn cake for breakfast because it’s our bodies and it’s our choice!!” gives me a sense of comfort because I’m the only on in the group who looks like a skeleton :-?,False,False

I suspect my friend has an ED and it stresses me out so much. Like she started when i started and has kept it up while i went into recovery and i feel inferior to her because of that. I think that because hers has been going on for longer than mine has that she is worse and mine wasn't that bad.,False,False
