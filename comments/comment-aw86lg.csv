So claiming you NEED carbs is, technically, not correct. It doesn't mean removing them completely is a swell idea, either. Which, in turn, doesn't mean people who follow restrictive diets are automatically eating disordered or will become so.   What I dislike about THIS sub is the ""hammer and nail"" problem. If all you have is a hammer, every problem becomes a nail - because it can be solved with your hammer! So because we have eating disorders, we see them in everybody else, and it's simply not true.

People tend to think their diet is superior than other diets and it becomes like a cult lol  One example is veganism, a lot of vegans claim to be healthy and to have all the nutrients they need from plants, but a popular vegan youtuber came out about not being vegan anymore because she had serious health issues and surprise surprise, some of her ""people"" turned on her. She used to be one of those types so I hope she learned that not everyone can sustain a vegan diet.  Anyway, a balanced diet is definitely important.

I understand that, what pissed me off was the comments, but I honestly have nothing against keto or any other highly restrictive diet as long as it's done in a healthy way y'know?  it's like, they treated what to me seemed a lot like ed recovery advice/venting as stuff from the fat acceptance movement and as if it was completely ridiculous?  so when I said what I said on my post I was not referring to people like your mom or people with health problems who need differentiated diets to help minimizing those conditions",False,True

I have personally found this to be true! I gravitate towards high-carb, low fat, moderate protein.  I definitely feel like I'm in the minority in this, but I don't like the taste of many high-fat foods and never did, even as a kid. I actually now have to make a conscious effort to include things like olive oil in my diet ‚Äî¬†I tell myself it will help my skin and digestion and aid with antioxidant absorption... it's far too easy for me to forgo it entirely.  My dad, on the other hand, is a keto convert and constantly suggesting that my high-carb, nearly-vegan diet is going to give me diabetes and metabolic syndrome by the time I'm fifty (despite the fact that I'm an underweight runner with, you know, a restrictive ED), but I guess some people just need to feel like their diet is The One True Way...",False,False

When I actively try to push protein I get 25% and my carbs go down to 45%, but my fat pretty consistently stays around 30%   I had my gallbladder out at 19 and was told to follow a lowfat diet for at least a few months. That was reccomend at 20-25%. I did not follow that. Then years later when I was trying to lose from my hw I did an almost a keto lite diet at 40-50% fat. I don't think it is coincidence that I started having severe symptoms that were diagnosed as gastritis. The recommendation for diet changes? Eat a low fat diet high in whole grains, and lower acidic foods/drinks.   And that is why I strongly encourage people to talk to their doctor's before starting a new diet lifestyle. This goes for people interested in vegetarianism or veganism too. Make sure you know what foods you need to eat at what frequency to keep yourself healthy. My SIL and my best friend from HS were vegetarians. My friend was iron deficient and my SIL (who we also suspect has/had ARFID) got really ill because they were not consuming enough of the right micronutrients because they cut out whole food groups.  Also, I am not anti-keto. I think it works well for *short term* fat loss. I don't think it is sustainable for most people long term.
