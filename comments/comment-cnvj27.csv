I think for me it was partly due to anxiety (like diarrhea caused by anxiety that comes up once I’ve begun to binge), and partly due to having crammed so much food in me that it like jamms the poo out of me. That’s if I’m restricting, then all my backed up restricted poo finally comes out. If I’m only eating when b/p then I don’t really shit cuz I get everything out of my mouth.",False,False

I purge essentially the entire binge within less than an hour of eating, and it all comes up whole and undigested so I don't think it's as a result of the fibre content of the binge? Especially since I tend to binge on classic junk foods (chocolate, candy, chips etc) with basically no fibre anyway?",False,True
