Like I have diagnosed, severe, recurrent depression, and I exercise every single day, and go to work every day. You know what else I do?

Bulimics tend to binge on more food than people with BED. There's only so much food you can fit in your stomach in one day. Bulimia on the other hand? There is absolutely no limit to how much food you can eat if you empty your stomach every time you're full.   That being said, I often personally binge more with BED than BN, but at least with BED, it's staying inside you. Buying $30 worth of food only for it all to go in the toilet 30 minutes later, with you left malnutritioned and famished again seemed especially wasteful. Like, BED is ""privilege"", but being able to throw up the food you binge on is even more so üòπ",False,False
