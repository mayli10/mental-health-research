I’m incredibly squeamish and it’s kind of a gruesome procedure. It also doesn’t prevent weight gain in the long run; it removes some fat cells, but that just mean the remaining ones might grow depending on weight fluctuations. I personally go through binge periods, so I don’t want to pay a couple grand for what might be temporary results.   At the end of the day, it won’t fix the underlying issues. This may be insensitive, but it’s honestly just a waste of money unless you have a healthy relationship with food. It’s like putting a bandaid on a stab wound and pretending like that will solve the problem.",False,False
