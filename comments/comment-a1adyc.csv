We rarely hve the chance to get together, so when we do there’s usually food involved. As much as possible, I join them for events such as birthdays or other celebrations. But if they just wanna go out randomly and get kbbq or try out a new place - I bail. My friends don’t know about my ED but they think I’m on a healthy food diet (lol) so they leave me be when I decline certain food items.   The one time I really binged when I was with them was when we all slept over at a friend’s house. She was sick and had been hospitalized and was needing surgery etc etc, so I figured I wouldn’t raise hell about food because the gathering wasn’t about me. I didn’t want my friend who was sick to worry about me and my eating, so yes I ate pizza and cake. It was awful, but she and the others had a great time bc they didn’t feel awkward that one person wasn’t eating so I guess it was worth all the crying and stress when I got home 🤷🏻‍♀️",False,False
