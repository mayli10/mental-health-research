I have illnesses, but my body still works pretty well. All of my limbs are intact, for example, which is really convenient. My skin is not clear but it is also not burned or blistered, and it is not so dry that it cracks and bleeds (except in the winter, fuck the winter). my clothes do not comprise my ideal closet but they keep me warm and I can still make some cute combinations with them.  and it's something. ya know. I just try to appreciate what I have because one day I might wake up without it.  Sorry if that's like painfully cheesy lol",False,False
