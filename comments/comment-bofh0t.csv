I’m ‘recovered’ though struggle with the ED thoughts. When I don’t see the scale go down, I usually do end up binging cos *why the fuck try when it doesn’t show?* Then of course it goes up. When I binge I come to that realisation then just want to purge. But I can’t anymore, not allowed to. I don’t restrict like I used to, but well below my expended calories for the day (on days I’m not binging) but goddamn is it slow. I just get the urge to relapse, according to maths it’ll take me about 37 weeks to get down to the weight I want (I put on a lot of weight following restriction and b/p, mostly from just binging constantly, my goal is well within the healthy range and I’m trying to go ahead with weight loss as healthy as possible). Past, especially, and present me definitely understand that frustration",False,False
