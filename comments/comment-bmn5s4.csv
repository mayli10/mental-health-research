You can always PM me if you‚Äôre struggling. I‚Äôm so happy my experience helped you, even a little :‚Äô)! Recovery is never linear and it‚Äôs exhausting and frustrating but you are showing such strength to continue choosing it.",False,False

I had another shitty day but now I'm in a much more positive mindset bc I want to beat this shitty thing, and in order to do so I have to stop throwing myself pity parties and fight the urges head on even more persistently. I'm trying to get into med school! I want to be a psychiatrist! Gotta fix myself first though. Thanks so much :)",False,True

You went two whole weeks without b/p after a whole year of doing it. That means for two whole weeks you were battling your urges successfully! At square one you didn‚Äôt have a single day under your belt where you did that. Your recovery has not regressed, it has merely halted and you have a choice. You can go backwards and continue to b/p for a whole year until you‚Äôre truly back to square one, or you can decide to keep moving forward with fighting your urges. Going back would be easy, for sure as this is your go-to coping mechanism and it takes time to rewire your brain. However going forward would not be as difficult as it was when you first decided to start recovering. Clearly something was working for you these past two weeks, you have tools in your belt you didn‚Äôt have before. Please have some compassion for yourself.   I took the MCATS too and it was suuuuuch a stressful couple of months leading up to it. I really feel for you. I cycled between restricting and binging constantly. Planning out a binge was the only enjoyable part of my day. Would immediately regret it as soon as it was over and then starve myself until the next binge. Would not recommend! What really helped was planning out my meals in advance, and having nutritious snacks for while I was studying. I would make sure food had lots of protein, fat, and vegetables so that I had enough energy to study. I also did not allow myself to starve. I set a timer for four hours and when it went off, I either had a meal or a snack no matter what. I was very tempted to skip, especially if I was ‚Äúin the zone‚Äù reading or writing but telling myself ‚Äúno girl, if you don‚Äôt eat now, you will eat the whole fridge later‚Äù provided huge motivation. Also the meal planning took up the headspace that would have normally been planning exquisite binges. I could give you a rough idea of what I ate in the day and the reasoning behind it so you could cater it to your specific tastes.   Also, listen to your cravings! Try to identify what your body actually wants. Is it salt, sweet, or fat? Or do you just crave the sweet hell of being so full you could burst?   If it‚Äôs a physical need, find a way to meet it in a healthier way. When I want to gorge myself on McDonald‚Äôs, I think ‚Äúhm what I‚Äôm really craving is something with fat and salt‚Äù and then I will go to a more slow eatery and get myself a REAL burger with a salad instead of fries. Or I‚Äôll cook up some liver with onions and saut√©ed veggies. Either of these options give me what my body needs, in a more controlled amount with more micronutrients and for less money than a binge.  If it‚Äôs a mental need, like the need to numb myself, or comfort myself with fullness, I have to tell myself ‚Äúwow I am freaking out and need a break‚Äù and give myself it. I train my dog, or weed my garden or do anything else where I have to focus on the task at hand and not whatever I‚Äôm feeling. This is very useful when you‚Äôre stuck in study grind mode. After a certain point, your brain needs time to process information, and you will have trouble concentrating so it‚Äôs very important to take breaks. Don‚Äôt let yourself feel guilty for taking time to yourself. Tell yourself it‚Äôs essential to your study process. While you‚Äôre taking a break, your subconscious mind is processing and properly storing away information in the right place. Half hour to 45 minute breaks for me worked best and allowed me to get back to it less stressed than I was before.   I wish you the best of luck. I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôll do great on your exam :) are you trying to get into med school or vet school? Either way you‚Äôve come so far and I‚Äôm very proud of you and you should be too.",False,False
