Me every time. The amazing thing about eating normally, which I never thought was possible, is that my ""trigger foods"" no longer trigger me. It's crazy! I can, for the first time in my life, eat a single spoonful of peanut butter.  One more thing that has been one of the most important parts of my recovery: accepting that I inherently deserve kindness. Because I am alive, I deserve to be treated with kindness, as everyone else does. Whenever I want to do something that's self-destructive or self-harming, I ask myself, ""Is that being kind to my mind/body/self?""  Another mantra: ""Am I acting according to my values?"" My values are achieving my goals, living the healthiest and happiest life I can, treating myself well, treating my boyfriend/family well, doing the best I can. My values are not: perfection, thinness, vanity, self-destruction, illness.  &amp;#x200B;",False,False

I've posted this elsewhere but it may be helpful:  &gt;The app Sober Time has been helpful for me. It's basically just a counter for the last time I've purged. It's kind of the ""cold turkey"" solution that may not work for everyone. Basically one of my motivations right now is that I don't want to reset it. I am so proud of these 3+ months that I don't want to see that number drop down to zero. In the beginning, I would get maybe 3 days, but then I would challenge myself to get 4, and so forth.   &gt;   &gt;There have been a handful of times recently (Thanksgiving being one of them) when I really, desperately wanted to purge. I am able to talk myself out of it by saying things like, ""This fullness is only temporary. Purging will not make me feel better in the long run. I would not want my loved ones to purge, so why should I want that for myself?""   &gt;   &gt;I also have a few friends I can reach out to in these moments who will talk me out of it.   &gt;   &gt;Comforting myself helps: putting on soft loose pajamas, wrapping up in soft blankets, drinking a cup of ginger tea if I can stomach it, cuddling with my cat.   &gt;   &gt;And distractions: put on my favorite sitcoms. Nothing to dark or hard to follow. Normally a book won't do it.   &gt;   &gt;Each time you refrain from purging, it will become easier, even if it's really difficult in the moment. It's worth the temporary pain of a full stomach to achieve your goals. My therapist says that quitting purging is also the first step to quitting overeating in the first place. You won't continue to overeat if you know you purging isn't an option anymore, because overeating is so uncomfortable (mentally and physically).   &gt;   &gt;For me, it's kind of like exercising a muscle. It's not fun to work out, it hurts, but if you don't make yourself, you will not progress.  And to give you the honest truth, people are right when they say that you must eat to not binge. Restricting will lead to bingeing.   Also, you don't have to fix it in a day. When I was first starting out, I'd make small goals like, eat breakfast, or eat two meals, or don't go to the grocery store when tired or stressed (because that's when I buy binge food).  It's also helpful for me to note what triggers my binges and purging. Whenever I do it, I write down: the situation, what I was feeling, what thoughts were going through my head.  My therapist helps me to delve into the deeper issues of low self-worth and anxiety. I recommend using the CBT and DBT approaches.

I do plan to stay active. I used to be a runner and recently signed up for a half marathon so I'll be training for that for the next 5.5 months. I think that's going to help because it will allow me to eat more throughout the day because I'll be needing to fuel. And it's a way to be active without being compensatory. Instead of running to burn off the calories in a cookie I ate, I'm working towards this tremendous goal of being able to run 13.1 miles.    There are habits I don't want to give up. Counting calories is one of them. I do have a goal weight which I haven't reached yet. It's a healthy goal weight and I'm only 8 pounds away so once I hit it I want to maintain it. I usually eat around 1500 calories when I'm not b/ping so I think eating here and then like 300 extra calories on the days I'm training will be reasonable. I'll feel that out a little more though.   And that's a good point. I have an all or nothing mentality and when I mess up it usually triggers a huge serious of mess ups. I need to learn to forgive and forget. Everyone makes mistakes. One binge is not going to destroy my progress.   I am going to try to have one sweet a day. I do have a sweet tooth but whenever I try to eat 100% healthy I end up going to the store and buying a cake, so if I can work a candy bar or cookie into my daily caloric limit, I think that would be healthy.   Thank you so much for your comment. It does help! &lt;3 I'm happy to hear you're trying to practice healthier habits as well, I've decided it's okay to keep some neuroses around food as long as I'm not being dangerous about it and that makes recovery seem so much less daunting (another person on reddit gave me this advice)",False,True

The first time I went into recovery I went to a therapist because my parents were footing the bill.  I was 20 at the time.  At the time I was quite underweight (88 pounds at 5’3” at my lowest) and prone to fainting spells so it was probably for the best.  Purging disorder is the absolute worst and I wouldn’t wish it on anyone.  They fattened me up to about 110 and I HATED it.    I relapsed at around 23.  This time it was much more short lived because I had an epiphany before it got too bad.  I realized that I didn’t really want to go through all of that again.  The magic moment happened when I was right around 100 pounds.  I’m not exactly sure.  All I know is it dropped off quick.   Getting used to eating is the hardest part.  I didn’t have a strategy there.  I ate stuff that I liked and felt safe eating.  I tried not to eat myself much during this time, but I needed to see some progress so I did occasionally.  The mistake I made, and I blame my warped relationship with food, is that I “over-recovered.”  A term that I invented myself (I’ll take my Nobel prize in the form of cash, please).  Because I was trying to get myself to gain weight and have a good relationship with food I ate what I liked.  And I kept doing it, and didn’t stop when I should have, and didn’t learn how to eat in moderation.  And then all of a sudden I found myself weighing 200 pounds.  So I more than doubled my weight over the course of 8 years.    The point of that part of the story, is to try learn healthy habits.  Obviously now your main focus should just be on not having an eating disorder.  But as you start to get that down try to get some balance so you don’t go in the wrong direction.",False,False

Lawrence University  4. Wheaton College  5. Sam Houston State    I’ve recovered before, (sorta trying to now). Looking back I would’ve done things very differently.    I’d stay active during recovery, but in a different way than you are now. So for example, let’s say you do tons of cardio, and your intention is just to burn a lot of calories. You could change that to a daily walk, and set different goals/intentions for your body. I.e, stay active, but don’t connect exercise to calories/steps/etc.    Gradually increase your calories. Add 25, 50, 100 a day, or maybe a week. Don’t beat yourself up for setbacks.    To add to that last bit, I read something once about counting overall days instead of counting one bad day as a total failure. You set a goal to not purge for 10 days, and mess up the last one? Great, you did nine days and you can do nine more.    Eat healthy, but don’t set restrictions on what you can/can’t eat. This one is hard, but it’s worth it. If you ate a cupcake after a whole day of healthy eating you still had a healthy day.    I hope this helps? Good luck to you man, I’m proud of you.  ",False,False

Once I hit my gw, I gradually increased my calories from around 600 by about 100 every 3-4 days and monitoring my weight. There was increased water weight but eventually it stabilized. Once I got to my TDEE, I stopped increasing and ate at my TDEE, still counting calories but was much less obsessive about it; I estimated a lot.  Bingeing wasn't as tempting because if I had a food craving, I budgeted in the calories for it. I also tried to keep in mind that even if I couldn't fit it in today, I could make room for it tomorrow and the food would still be there.",False,False
