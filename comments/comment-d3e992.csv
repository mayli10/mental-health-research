And she's also asked me to limit my workouts to an hour.  I notice that I feel more energetic in the morning if I eat 1000 to 1200 but I struggle with it. I want to only be eating 600 to 800 and exercising it all off, ideally. But I know that's not sustainable, even in the short term.  It's really hard.",False,False
