Since Christmas Iâ€™ve been eating more and now it feels like I canâ€™t go back to how I ate before (tiny portions, ignoring hunger a lot).   For example, last night I had 4 slices of pizza and 4 pieces of garlic bread... I wasnâ€™t even hungry after the second slice of pizza but I just felt so desperate to eat more and I have no idea why :( Why do we have to deal with this uuUUuGhHH",False,False

I also eat just because I'm cold as I hope that the food will heat my inner oven but it doesn't fml.
