She's cool with the idea that she won't be running around on Instagram half naked telling the world she loves her body everyday but she's also busy building herself up and making her non weight related dreams come true. The body is a vessel that she preens and looks after as she wishes but she is not limited to the body.,False,False

She doesn't think a lot about her body image. However, she uses a lot of products she thinks make her pretty. It is.. unconscious I think.. I don't know if it will work for me.. but well the other day I was able to wear a top showing my shoulders thinking of her attitude. I sometimes think of my friends attitude too. I have a lot of (what they call) a normal weight friends who simply don't care about what they wear. They like the feeling, so they wear the clothes. I would like to be confident about my image. Why are they confident? Maybe it's just a question of attitude. I'll keep playing this role",False,True
