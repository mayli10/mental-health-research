I’m not noticeably smaller and no one’s asked anything, and I don’t know why but I just can’t mention anything. A part of me is like ‘oh no I don’t actually have a real issue cause I feel like I can stop at any time so why bother telling anyone if it’s not true’",False,False

It would probably be more productive if I did actually tell her. Oh well.,False,False

This was when I first developed my disorderd behaviours so I've been left with a massive distrust and have never mentioned it again. My psychologist has it in my records so now every time I see a psych or GP they ""casually"" mention my eating. I'm constantly having to avoid questions and have excuses ready. It's tiring, honestly.",False,False

I have a psychologist, psychiatrist, and a case manager. They don't know about my ED, but they do know I struggle to eat. I told them it's just anxiety, which isn't true even tho I DO have bad anxiety...but yeah. I take Prozac and Seroquel, kind of scared of them upping the Seroquel dose bc it gives you the munchies. But I also do want them to up the dose bc I need more for it to work ??? Idk man. Mental illness is a fuck.",False,False

I'm actually inpatient for drug abuse and depression and managed to lie and say that I don't know how I lost weight.
