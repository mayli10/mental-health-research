My bf likes to watch food network and food videos, and I literally start gagging sometimes because the food looks disgusting. Like too much cheese or too much grease is disgusting, or they use so much butter and I get anxiety. My bf will be all ""mmmm yummm"" and my stomach is turning and I'm gagging lol  But there are some vids on youtube that are like food aesthetic (?) videos and pleasing to watch. I like the plating videos because they're relaxing lol",False,False
