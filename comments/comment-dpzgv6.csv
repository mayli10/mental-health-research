Sometimes I feel like it's absurd to have this problem because I'm an adult and should have gotten past it. It's helpful to be reminded how difficult recovery is. This is a mental illness. It's not simply an adolescent obsession with being thin. I hope my post helped you realize that you're not alone either. I hope you stay strong, too. You deserve health and happiness. ♥️ This is a dangerous illness. Keep taking care of yourself.",False,True

I gained 40, yes, 40 pounds in the last year. I'm in a normal BMI range now, but it doesn't feel good like I hoped it would. I'm still trying. The thoughts don't go away. Sometimes I am closer to relapsing than others. I don't think this really helps you in any way buuuut the point is, you're not alone. I'm glad you are here and getting these things off your chest. Stay strong. &lt;3",False,False
