We can get back on track. We can lose that weight again and we can get to our goal. We're basically the same age and same height and same weight with similar goals (around 120 was probably the best weight I've been). We can get there. One step at a time.,False,False

I was in your shoes about 6 months ago and had the same feelings. I felt malformed and unloveable. I felt trapped. I was depressed and frustrated. But the tide will always turn eventually. Some random stuff in my life kind of fell in to place and I was able to lose the weight I had gained. I didn't happen as fast as I wanted and I'm not as close to my goal weight as I'd like to be, but the urgent feelings of violent dysmorphia have subsided. Don't underestimate the effect small changes can have on your self perception. Hang in there, friend.",False,False

I‚Äôve lost nearly 30 in a month at my worst (not recommended, but just for example). You‚Äôll be okay! 10lbs is nothing and it‚Äôll come off so fast. Stay strong, you got this! Being upset will only make it worse, at least it does for me. Cry what you need to, then pick yourself back up and realize that you‚Äôre capable of being exactly who you want to be. ",False,False

I have really similar stats to yours &amp; I guarantee you‚Äôre not alone. Sometimes it‚Äôs a nonstop battle &amp; sometimes it‚Äôs a whoosh. You just have to give yourself a bit of a break &amp; tell yourself to get back on the wagon. You will get there in the end.  And if you need a friend, please reach out :) ",False,False

I let myself get disgusting. I dont blame men for having no interest in me. I'm not pretty. I will never be pretty or desirable. Life is worthless alone. I can no longer use my age as an excuse. I'm almost 31. I am in fact a complete waste of space. I'm nobody's #1. At this point in my life I have to face the fact that it's too late. People say since I look young I have all this time. But I can only have kids for so long. Everyone has someone in their lives more important than me. I kinda wish I could take cancer away from someone with a family and absorb it to myself. I wish I could give my life to someone who has things to live for.  I am a waste of life. ,False,True

I spent so long just wishing something bad would happen to me.   You deserve to be happy and to feel good about yourself. Sending hugs ‚ù§Ô∏è don‚Äôt make this a bigger obstacle than it needs to be. Just do your best. ,False,False
