Like, I don't do super long fasts (the longest I've done is 48 hrs), don't faint, have never been hospitalized, I have a normal BMI, and I still have my period, plus i don't have body dysmorphia, so it's like, do I even have an ED??",False,False

Turns out it was BED rearing it's ugly head and I didn't realize for a while. Now I'm back to restricting and I'm so ""out of practice"". I'm like ""well I can't fast so obviously I'm not ~really disordered~""",False,False

I have bad food anxiety and health anxiety which causes me to restrict/binge (some have called it orthorexia, not that that's an approved medical term yet). But it's not really a body image thing for me. It's not about the parts of me I can see in a mirror, which is what half the posts here seem to be about. So I wondered whether I was ""disordered enough"". Do you have to be underweight? Have AN? Purge by puking? Does purging by exercising ""count""?  &amp;#x200B;  Like sure, I eat \~1000 calories most days (sometimes a lot more though tbh when the binge comes out), and I've never been dangerously underweight or treated inpatient, but I did cry about a yogurt covered pretzel last week if that's worth anything",False,False

It’s a symptom I believe most of us have. I just got back healthy bloodwork which complete invalidates everything I’ve done so now I’m fasting. It’s maddening. I can’t stand this. You’re not alone.   The question to ask yourself is, what is sick enough? Where will you draw the line in the sand? ",False,False
