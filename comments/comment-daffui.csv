My highest weight ever was 50kg and my weight distribution made me look pretty chubby at that weight.  Like even now, although I’m underweight I don’t look that underweight especially when I’m wearing a lot of clothes. There’s still areas with fat (thighs, stomach) that I’m trying to tone, so I’m trying to lose a little bit, maybe a couple of kilos to get down to around 38kg",False,True

I completely agree with everything you said. Considering I’m getting a lot of protein, nutrients, iron etc in the 1,200 calories I’m eating; do you think that this restriction is gonna be bad for my health?",False,True

I think you can have a fairly healthy relationship with food and still eat less to keep a low weight(although you should be aware that it's of course unhealthy to be underweight in the long run, it might not affect you while you're young but can be a problem when you're older). If you did gain let's say 20 lbs, how do you think you would feel then? Would it cause you a great deal of anguish or would you be able to deal with that without too much anxiety? Do you feel that it's very important for you to stay thin, like urgent beyond common vanity? Are you aiming to maintain or lose weight currently?",False,False
f1qun18,t3_daffui,t3_daffui,red_ossifrage,1,2019-09-28 16:40:27,/r/EDAnonymous/comments/daffui/whats_the_difference_between_restrictive_eating/f1qun18/,"&gt; But I don’t want to lose too much weight, just enough so my stomach stays flat and my thighs thinner  This doesn't mean you're not anorexic. Anorexia doesn't necessarily mean starving straight to death. It can also mean purposely/obsessively maintaining an underweight BMI. (In addition, just because you're saying you don't want to lose too much now, that doesn't mean you won't end up moving your GW further down in the future.)  In addition, your BMI is low enough that, if you were diagnosed with AN, you'd fall into the ""severe"" range of anorexia. To me, that BMI is a gigantic red flag on its own.   Also: another DSM symptom of AN is having a distorted view of one's body or disorder. It's very common for people who have AN, especially those who haven't had it that long, to insist their weight/eating is mostly fine, and certainly not severe enough to qualify as anorexic.   In my opinion, it sounds like you have either anorexia nervosa, or restrictive EDNOS.",False,False

You seem to meet the diagnostic criteria for anorexia nervosa:  (1) You’re underweight (2) Persistent behavior that interferes with weight gain despite being at a significantly low body weight (skipping dinner, eating less the next day, eating only 1400 calories when you run 5km a day, having days where you consume less than 1200 calories, etc.) (3) Lack of recognition of the seriousness of low body weight   Also, you don’t need to have lost your menstrual cycle to be diagnosed with anorexia. They removed that from the DSM for a reason. And, bloodwork is a notoriously bad indicator of the overall health of people diagnosed with eating disorders; it’s extremely misleading.",False,False

So imo the only difference between AN and what you describe is just a professional diagnosis.   Tw this paragraph... Restriction comes in many forms. When I was at my lw with a BMI in the 14s I was eating 1650 a day and walking like crazy. I knew a tall guy who ate over 2k and reached the same point. Restrictive behaviors and maintaining an unhealthy weight don’t necessarily mean not eating or being afraid of food. It’s all on the same spectrum, though, so the definitions are more or less what we make of them.",False,False

If you continue on how you are then you most likely won’t develop full anorexia criteria behaviours (although you already have some) but if you begin to fixate on weight loss and calories and develop a fear of gaining or big meals i wholeheartedly believe that you will develop anorexia and should seek help in such a case.   just make sure you are eating enough calories for your height and activity level and try to maintain a healthy relationship with food. also, do not become a regular for this community. even lurking has the opportunity to manifest into a mental illness you do not want.   stay safe xoxo",False,False
