I'm already on a waiting list for something that I've had before and doesn't help and I was planning to ask a doctor if I could get help from the place I close to, and I'll be honest about my disordered eating. Their waiting list for ED is 3 weeks, I hope they're not just inpatient because that would mean problems with film school, but I guess time will tell... Anyways, thank you so much, I'll save your comment!",False,True

Not outright like ""today is the day I develop an eating disorder"", it's more subtle, like accidentally missing a meal and enjoying the ""high"" from it. Then you choose to dabble in it to keep experiencing that and distract from what you don't want to feel, and before you know it, you're in over your head.  None of us will ever feel sick enough, and that's difficult to come to terms with. But it is far better you receive help now than years down the line, where you may have caused irreparable damage. EDs do not have a set look to them, so however you appear physically should not determine your eligibility for help. And if it does, then you're not seeing the right person, and should immediately find another professional to help you.   This is a mental illness that just so happens to come with a variety of physical effects, but they're only symptoms, and as with any other illness, treatment is far more effective the sooner symptoms are discovered and when treating the underlying cause.  To have told your mother is an incredible feat and I'm proud of you for that, I'm sure she is too. Discuss your worries with her, even the ones about her trying to get you to have more calories. If she says you need to see a professional, know it's the right course of action, as reluctant as you may be for it.  I know I'm being hypocritical since I've kept my ED hidden and never spoken about it with the numerous health professionals I've seen, but if I could go back to my younger self when I was first having these thoughts, I would strongly advise myself to seek help. I can't do that, but I can do it for you.  It won't be an easy road, but it is far better than falling so deep you can't separate the disorder from yourself as a person. Treating it now means a higher success rate of recovery, and you'll be able to start living your life sooner. I have too many memories tainted by the fear and hate I felt because food was involved, no matter how small.  This got a bit long, but I hope it helps you to realise your feelings are valid, your disorder is valid, and you are deserving of help even when you don't feel like it. A life with an ED is no life at all. They enter with promises that things will be better if you achieve xyz, but instead they rob you of everything and more.",False,False
