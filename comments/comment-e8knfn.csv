I use sports drinks and juice to keep my blood sugar up. Tea to keep my tummy and my body temp happy....being cold seriously compromises my studying.   Smoothie are also grand if yoy got time for that.  I always try to snack right before I sit an exam. Something little like a breakfast or protein bar.   Good luck!,False,False
