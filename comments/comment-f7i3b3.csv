Someone gave me some good advice RE: restricting. Often we set ourselves calorie limits for the maximum allowed; try setting a ""minimum"" as well as the maximum, and try to eat at least that minimum every day. EG if your maximum is 1000cals, aim for minimum 900. After that, you can try working on increasing the maximum to safer levels. But aiming for a minimum each day can reduce how much you restrict.",False,False

It was 3 meals a few snacks . And yeah true :( I just feel better about myself when I restrict vs when I binge , as Iâ€™m sure everyone here does, but it alwuas leads to a binge in the end.",False,True

How many meals?  I'm glad you didn't binge, but restriction is just as unhealthy depending on how much you're doing it/how hard you're going.",False,False
