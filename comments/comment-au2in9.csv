There are so many people who care about you, then issue is that you think they don't. I have no idea how your relation is with your family, but please talk to them. Call them today, and ask if they love you. Call your BF and explain what you are going through. I kbow you can do it, and i hope you will.   Because you matter. You have so much you can do in your life. And all You need to do to get there is to talk. If not to your family then talk here, talk to someone. Because it will help. Believe me",False,False

I've begun to face the music at this point. This is my life. I haven't been good enough for 25 years so why would that change just because I lost weight? I still get treated the same. Still never been in a relationship. Still depressed. Still worthless. I'm tired of having that little gleam of hope that I'm just gonna wake up one day and everything is gonna do a 180. When? That's always the question. But I always knew the answer. Just evaded it. Maneuvered around it. Some people do get a say in life, some people inevitably draw the short stick. I'm just accepting it now. It's better than pretending. ",False,False
