There was a Ted talk about a women treating anorexics which was very eye opening. Theres different chemical reactions to food and those who are only restrictive dont get a normal dopamine response to food. Similarly, those who only overeat and binge have an extreme reaction on dopamine when they eat.   The compulsions themselves may be different but I feel like the food obsession is the same.",False,False

However, I think that binge eating vs restricting are two sides of the same coin. Both of us are controlled by food. Im bulimic with many years of ednos under my belt. I've been fatter. I've been thinner and addicted to exercise. Sometimes when I'm overeating I just cannot stop. I feel out of control. Similarly when I'm ""dieting"" I get anxious around food and I'm unable to force myself to eat. Neither of us have control. Food dictates all.   I've been panicked when work ordered lunch and I couldn't count the calories. Once I went to get lunch for the office and I didnt get anything for myself, opting to eat my WW zero point soup for lunch instead. I was unable to fathom eating bread. Alternatively, I've eaten a whole pizza to myself. I'd fathom there are many people like me here who essentially have multiple eating disorder behaviors going on at the same time.   I get that sometimes our fucked up ed brains wish we had anorexia instead of BED. But there is a separate BED sub for that reason. I used to wish I could throw up after a binge. Now that I know how it's a skill I'm afraid that I'll never unlearn and may some day kill me. For that reason when I see anorexia related posts it reminds me how much stress I felt and about my severe food anxiety I had when I was thin. Occasionally I'm not in the mood to hear someone thin freakout over gaining two lbs but I can relate bc I've done the same thing. I even do the same thing being overweight.   As long as you remain respectful and dont say stuff like ""I don't understand how anyone could stand to be a 20 bmi, it's gross"" and rather ""for myself I cant stand being a 20 bmi and it makes me feel the following ways even though I do logically know it's a fine BMI to have"" you're fine (there was once a post like this if you couldnt tell lol).   I also think it would be fine if you wanted a place strictly for people suffering with anorexia. That's why I also subscribe to r/bulimia although it's not nearly as active or supportive as here.",False,False
