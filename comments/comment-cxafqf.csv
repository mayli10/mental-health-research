I‚Äôd have one food that I could eat and I‚Äôd eat it for months until I switched to something else and then would never eat it again. It didn‚Äôt have much to do with calories or nutritional content so it was disordered for sure but it wasn‚Äôt anorexia (which I have now).   Examples include:  Sweetcorn microwaved in a bowl with butter.  Tuna fish mixed with mayonnaise and sweetcorn.  Knorr pesto dried pasta packets boiled in water.  Quorn ‚Äúchicken‚Äù strips.  Frozen phyllo puff pastries with feta and spinach.  Frozen tomato and cheese cannelloni.   I would never dream of even sniffing at this stuff now lol.,False,False

Then progresso light soups (160-190 depending on flavor) for a month or 2 until I got tired of it. Wraps w lunch meats for mooonths. Now I‚Äôve been eating lean cuisines lol   Same with my snacks. I basically eat them until I get tired of them or I start bingeing on them and then move onto something new,False,False
