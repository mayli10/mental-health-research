It's a nutrient powerhouse.  In my own humble opinion, sockeye is best, all other types are mushy, but I'm a west coast salmon snob, so ymmv.  Beef liver is also an excellent source of fat-soluble vitamins (A,D,E, and a bit of K), a bunch of B-vitamins including folate, choline, and a ton of minerals including iron, magnesium, phosphorus, potassium, zinc, copper, manganese and selenium.  People with EDs are particularly prone to zinc deficiencies, so it's a good one to make particular note of.

Kale, spinach, chard, cucumber, celery, broccoli, cauliflower, tomatoes, Brussels sprouts, and cabbage are all very high in micronutrients and fiber.   I would also recommend trying to get cottage cheese, egg whites, lean poultry, fish and/or tofu in your diet, those are some of the best sources of protein per calorie, and the cheese and canned fish has the added benefit of calcium.    Nuts, beans and avocados, while being more calorie dense, have a really high satiety value, and are very good for you. You can just add a little bit to meals, and it'll make a difference! 100 calories of those foods will give you more nutrition and fill you up more than 100 calories of rice cakes or crackers.   Random: low cal tortillas are a life saver, super high fiber. Protein powder is also amazing, and some are even fortified with vitamins and minerals. Many spices and herbs have lots of nutrition for few calories, so feel free to add green onion, cilantro, mint, ginger, garlic, parsley, etc to everything. Things in the allium family like leeks, onions, etc, have sulfur compounds that are really good for you and are flavorful and low cal.   Some of the things I do:  Tuna salad made with 'dressing' of pureed white beans, onion and mustard, on top of shredded cabbage.   Mixed baby greens blended into a smoothie with ice and flavored protein powder.   Shakshuka- spicy tomato sauce with veggies like eggplant and spinach, with eggs/egg whites poached into it.     Asian salad- I use the carrot ginger dressing from trader Joe's on top of greens, with edamame and/or tofu and avocado    Low calorie tortillas filled with shredded chicken breast, mustard, and greens.    African peanut stew- I make this with garlic, ginger, red onion, chickpeas, tomato paste, collard greens and pb powder. Sometimes I add chicken if I haven't been getting much protein.    Asian fish wraps- I mix sardines with kimchi, and use it in nori wraps with cauliflower rice, shredded carrots, bell peppers, cucumbers, cabbage, avocado etc.    Cottage cheese with bagel seasoning, mixed with hot sauce, topped with popcorn seasoning, with cucumber and salt, all make great snacks    I mash cauliflower up with garlic to make fake garlic mashed potatoes.    0% fat Greek yogurt mixed with psyllium fiber supplement, frozen berries, and maybe topped with a few almonds or a tsp of chia seed    Broccoli and Brussels sprouts roast really well, I like making them into bowls with an egg on top.    Celery stick, cucumber sticks and baby carrots dipped in hot sauce and/or sprinkled with low cal ranch seasoning are great.    Low calorie fruits like grapefruit, strawberry, and watermelon make great snacks    Jicama sprinkled with tajin is amazing.    Powdered peanut butter and chocolate protein powder make a great dip for apples or ryevita crisps.    Shirataki noodles are great, but they are not nutritious at all! I usually add tofu and bok choy to my soups, or make them into a noodle stir fry with red pepper and soy sauce/Sriracha",False,False

You can use it like green jackfruit to make vegan ‚Äúpulled pork‚Äù or ‚Äúbuffalo chicken‚Äù.   Stick to more nutrient dense grains like quinoa or barely. Even couscous is better for you than cheap, bleached flour noodles products.   I can personally feel really satisfied with about 50 grams of couscous and 150-200 grams of roasted veggies (tomatoes, zucchini etc)  Leafy greens are a great way to get a lot of nutrition and also fiber (helps you feel fuller) Squash, pumpkin and even sweet potatoes are a superior choice to potatoes.  White beans &amp; chickpeas make great, hearty stews. It‚Äôs as easy as adding some canned tomatoes and your preferred seasoning.  Look into plant proteins like tofu &amp; seitan as well. A little tofu in a bowl of miso soup goes a long way.  Also ginger has a lot of flavor and health benefits for not very many calories. Same for garlic. The better your food tastes, the less deprived you feel. ",False,False
