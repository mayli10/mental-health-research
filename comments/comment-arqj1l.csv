So fiber is basically my only safe food (I live off protein bars, low carb bread substitutes, and oat fiber). I obviously get WAYYY over the RDA of fiber.   I get hella constipated and then when I do finally go, it's incredibly awful and painful and I deal with bleeding hemorrhoids and TMI stuff like that.   Make sure you drink PLENTY of water, and if you can balance your diet out a bit, you definitely should. (Easier said than done, of course!)",False,False

It’s awful. ,False,False

The ~internet~, sound reservoir of logic that it is, says that some people may start having adverse reactions around 40g/day, so I may just be one of the lucky ones.   My real problem is probably that I'm having this wonderful confluence of orthorexic and binge tendencies and am regularly binging on &gt;1000 calories of raw fruit. Today I had 4 clementines, 2 grapefruits, 2 plums, a large pear, a bag of dried mango, a starfruit, + two bowls of oatmeal. Yesterday I had a wake up call when I unironically googled ""anal leakage.""",False,True
