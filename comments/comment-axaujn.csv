I agree that the b/p days likely derailed everything. I haven’t binged or purged in ~3 weeks and have stuck to just keeping calories low  - just worried that my new maintenance after long-term restriction is 800 cal and I won’t get back to being in a deficit.  I really appreciate you reading through and offering your support, it means a lot.",False,True

I can never get everything up when I purge, so I stay bloated for days, even if I fast. And it's well known that purging causes ""chipmunk cheeks"".  It sounds like your diet has been all over the place. Bodies arent perfect, they dont reflect every new change overnight. If you can manage to get your intake to a low but healthy deficit and stick with it, everything will return to normal, provided you don't b/p again.   Good luck",False,False

I’m sorry to hear you’re grappling w weight gain and purging. I know how distressing and painful it is to watch your body respond in ways you don’t understand/want.

I lost a lot of weight in November via restricting. Then started b/p in December, some weight came off. Then shit hit the fan last month and I’m up 8 lbs. I also started increasing my workouts which is what’s causing stress of the weight gain (I pile muscle on like crazy).  I plan on restricting again and vow not to purge anymore. Also decrease my work outs to atrophy my muscles a bit. I look the same to my partner, but my pants used to be a bit baggy around the knees and thighs and I want to get back to that point.  I hope if I increase my water intake, some of the bloating will go down (also decreasing my sodium).  I’m sorry I have no words of advice, but hopefully you’ll realize you’re not alone in your struggles.",False,False
