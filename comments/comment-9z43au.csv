Before, if you were to be Dx'd with EDNOS, it's not thought of as seriously, there are not the same resources offered and available, and people (even medical professionals) don't know what your specific EDNOS looks like.",False,False

I've been diagnosed with so many random things that I have little to no faith in the system. Doctors diagnose you in order to treat you. That's it. It's dangerous making it into an identity.    But also I'm a hypocrite and heavily identity with my AN and orthorexia dx.,False,False

I have not been underweight, but I fit all the other ANA symptoms.  I can lose weight so fast (I've lost over 100lbs several times in just a few months), don't mind others eating around me at all, restrict with the best of them, and am obsessed with control. I also feel the push toward my final form but I'm trying to resist it... for now. ",False,False

No one did anything but reward me for losing weight. I liked how they lowered the criteria for purging for bulimia, though. Previously you had to purge 3x per week and now it's just once a week for 3 months.   My flair says ednos bc I'm really trying to stop purging but even before I threw up I would restrict or exercise after a binge, which I did for years. Always been a bulimic at heart. ",False,False

I’ve met every criteria except low weight for many years, but that’s only because I started so high. I haven’t yet reached my final form. ",False,False
