Not saying that i am against any diet i just want to tell her story. Since high school she started to put so much effort in order to gain an ideal weight, althought to my eyes she wasn´t overweighted or something, although she kept telling me her other ballet classmates were even more skinnier than her and she believed it helped them to perform better. So she followed this extreme diet and her family supported her because they thought they were helping her to achieve her dream i guess. But little by little she became weaker, she was sometimes upsent at school and she often had wounds in her lips (i think it was due to malnutrition) . Although there were all those signs, i didnt realize the problem was that serious because she seemed normal and our friendship was as usual. Time passed, we graduated high school and while i started college she pretty much unfriended everyone in facebook and eventhough i tried to contact her there was no answer. Also, by that time she had moved and i didn´t know what her address was. But one day her mother contacted me and other friends and told us where they lived and that my friend wanted to meet us. it was all of the sudden an I was thrilled to meet her. When we finally met she told us everything. She admitted that because she had an ED she was embarassed to meet us and that´s why she blocked us. It got to a point in which she fainted in her house and thats when her parents panicked. then she got treatment with a psychologist and little by little she dropped her vegan diet. however it took her like a year and a half to recover. of course, in that time the dream to becoming a ballet dancer dissapeared. it was not possible in her condition.   At the end she told me that she was feeling better but she was still mad with herself because she felt she spent so much time in something she felt it could have been avoided. She felt she was too old and unprepared for ballet now so she had to change her dream. Now she is studying to become an actress and she looks happier than ever. so from this experience my little advice is to try to think about what you want for your future, or to work in something that gives you joy, even if its something crazy, if it makes you happy look for it, fight for it. But please don´t harm yourself, don´t be the person who is keeping you away from the truly best version of yourself. time is passing and there are millions of possibilities for you, dont miss the good ones and keep in mind that the sooner you´ll recover, the sooner you´ll be free to fly wherever you want. And me, as a person who couldn´t see the seriousness in ED I just can say that I wished she told me about it before, i wished i realized sooner. However, at the end she told me about it and im truly glad because we got this closer and it also helped myself to open up about other problems i was also ashamed to admit. So now our friendship is even stronger.    Please dont put a shell on yourself, speak about it to your loved ones, your friends, dont isolate, dont be ashamed. The more you speak about it, the stronger you´ll get because the ED wont domain you anymore. Maybe not everyone feel the same pain as you, but believe me when i say that everyone is struggling and battling their own demons. You are not alone in this   Sending tons of love :)",False,False
