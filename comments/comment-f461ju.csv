He tries to be empathetic but it’s hard for him. Something that helps me is to think about how glad I am that he is incapable of understanding this. That he literally can’t understand it because he is healthy and happy and has a good relationship with food. I’m glad that he can’t feel this pain even if it means I’m mostly alone with it.,False,False

My disorder didn't start getting bad until I was an adult, and I remember how upset I'd get at loved ones who had EDs. I couldn't wrap my head around it, it felt like a conscious choice that the person is continuing to make because they're being stubborn or something. I tried to be empathetic but I just didn't get it. How could you not like food? Why would you deprive yourself of a basic need!   I think to truly understand this kind of illness 100 percent you'd have to have it. I understood the basics, but had no idea the brain consuming demon it all really is. If he's willing, you might be able to find a YouTube video or a documentary in which people who have recovered explain. Find ones that really resonate with you. Eating disorders in people with BPD are fairly common, you may be able to find content by someone with both.",False,False
