You have not used your digestive system in 2 weeks though. You should start with liquid food first to avoid danger. Then go to soft foods after a week. Then after 2 more weeks go to hard food. Also get some metamucil at the store while your at it and take a cap every day for the first 3 days, then once every 3 days after that. Stay safe.",False,False
