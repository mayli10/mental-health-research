But as am exercise I am writing and reading it myself, very helpful so far. In panics attacks I can't even text, but I send GIFs and emojis, he gets them :).",False,True

In case you have trouble saying things out loud you could always use something like emergency chat. It's a chat client that stays on one phone you can pass to each other. I myself find it very helpful any time I want to say something but can't get it out (especially with panic attacks) I type and my boyfriend just talks to me when he's read it. You can also both type and switch sides.  Might help a bit with the communication issues.   ,False,False

He knows why I push back and he is incredibly patient, and is doing research on how to be supportive effectively.    I love the idea of turns to talk about our issues, we both have communication issues due to irrational fears, so that seems like a good system, to open a channel. We have done that a few times and we felt great afterwards, but it had to be a massive crisis to get there. So making it a habit will avoid crisis and be super helpful in the long run. I will make sure that for each complain, an appreciation accompanies.      Thank you again. ",False,True

Set backs and relapses are a part of life and, with that, a part of recovery.  Try your best to be honest with your therapist. She's there to help you, not judge you.  As for your boyfriend. Explain to him that you're not comfortable with him seeing you, but that you do still love him. You could try to set something up where he can give you a hug in the dark or something like that.  I know it may be hard, but try to encourage him back to therapy.  As for now, you could always set up a system where one gets to talk bout their problems one day and the other listens (and supports) and you switch the next day. You could even make it something like one tells something, that's dealt with, then the other tells something, that's dealt with and you switch back. That way you both get to talk about what's bothering you but neither is silencing the other.  Communication is key here. If he doesn't know what he does right or what he does wrong he can't improve. Mentioning the good parts is important by the way. It makes him feel less worthless and it keeps you more positive.   Good luck, stay safe. I hope you and your boyfriend feel better soon. Now go get that A (you can do this). ",False,False
