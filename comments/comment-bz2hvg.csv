They're small bags that are 100 cal each but you get a lot! They have kettle and butter and it's called smart popcorn. A little expensive but you get a lot of bags and a low cal yummy snack.,False,False

You need a doctorate in mathematics just to figure them out I swear to god.  I love popcorn so I ended up buying one of those microwave popcorn poppers and a big bag of regular kernels. Much cheaper in the long run if you eat it often enough and you can track exactly how many calories youâ€™re getting. I like to put garlic powder and nutritional yeast on mine, but lately Iâ€™ve seen a lot of flavored popcorn seasonings in the store that look super interesting if thatâ€™s something youâ€™d be into!",False,False
