Got a pint in my fridge and an iron will not to eat it right now. Can’t wait for 4am to roll around when my will fails me and I tell myself for 500th time to just hurry up and finish it so I can’t binge on it (makes sense right? Lol.) I hate that I vacillate between binging and restricting because even though I don’t really gain weight I can’t ever fucking lose it either. It’s a ton of misery around food for zero net change.,False,False
