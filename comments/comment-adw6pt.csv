I started ballet when I was in the 1st grade, or at about 7 or 8. I did ballet til I was about 14. When I was in elementary school I used to do it on purpose because I thought I was gaining weight. Now I have the same problem. I am 24 now. That's 16 years of doing this. I'm am an average sized lady. About 5'5 and 135 lbs. I find problems with myself relaxing my stomach in the mirror. Because I hate what it looks like. It's like triple the size I normally look. But pushing out doesnt feel natural to me. It feels like fucking work. Idk what to think about this. Just wanted to let you know that you're not alone.   Also I sleep, eat and constantly live this way too. By sucking in my feathers. It doesnt hurt me, and I'm not doing it excessively. But I feel like I trained my body to do this especially by doing it for 16 years. But  I dont know if this is natural, or if it hurts me in the long run.",False,False

Recently (this past year or so), I‚Äôve realized I‚Äôve always had body issues.  I either am eating so low calories or I‚Äôm binging the fuck out of food and not purging.  I either have no self control, or the most self control.  So, whether I‚Äôm 100 lbs or 160 lbs (I‚Äôm 5‚Äô2‚Äù so even 5 lbs makes a huge difference‚Äîgaining wise), I‚Äôve always sucked my stomach in because I‚Äôve never had a flat stomach.  It‚Äôs always been kind of round ish, but it‚Äôs even worse after having 2 kids.  I have major diastasis recti.  It took me over a year of really working out and majorly cutting calories and consuming large amounts of caffeine (because it boosts caloric burn am I right?) to even get close to a nice looking stomach.  I hate how big I got during pregnancy, and I hate that even when I suck in I look like a middle aged woman smuggling a rectangular box in her shirt.  I hate that it will probably take me a year or longer, because it takes so long to really get control of my eating.  I hate that (a lot of the time) I just eat until I feel sick and even when I do well, I drink enough alcohol to blur my thinking and then I end up eating some stupid high fat carby shit like pizza right before bed around 12am.  Why can‚Äôt I have a normal brain without food issues?",False,False

But it's really hard to visualize how natural and effortless good posture should feel, if you have tension in deep postural muscles that prevents it from feeling natural and effortless...and lots of people do have that tension. I've been getting deep tissue work done on my psoas and diaphragm and iliacus lately, and when those super deep muscles are *truly* relaxed then it feels like my other abdominal muscles have suddenly a LOT less work to do, because good posture ""just happens"" subconsciously instead of requiring a conscious effort from me.  me and my unpopular opinions lol ",False,False
