TMI but its not completely digested when it comes out because it goes straight through you.   Laxatives are good for me when I know I want to have a huge binge and dont want to gain, but they dont work at all to simply lose weight. I have used them for years and years for periods to maintain my weight though, and for my body it works. Theres also the fact that your body is bad at absorbing massive amounts of calories at a time. So if you have a huge 5000 calorie binge, your body can't absorb the calories as efficiently as if you ate an extra 1000 over 5 days. That fact + laxatives seem to really work for me in not paying on the scale for huge binges.",False,False
