Some people are interesting to look at, some people are interesting to be with. Obviously you can be both (and I bet OP is/will still be) but the latter are the type of people you stay closer to for longer.",False,False

I'm a very calculated person and I know I don't have a lot going for me. I have red curly hair and When I put the work in can have a fairly nice body. I try to make up for my horrendous skin ( so no make up besides like eye stuff). But like - that' all I got. My friends all have (or are working towards) degrees, have jobs that are important to their future,  they are so fucking smart and driven. Then there is me.",False,False

I sometimes envy skinny bodies, but the people that I find interesting and want to spend time with are the people who dedicate their time to their passions.

In all seriousness, though, when you are in a healthier place, emotionally (with therapy) and then eventually physically, you will be empowered to put that energy and effort and time and thought that your ED currently vampires away from you into your actual hobbies and passions, which will allow you to grow as a person and become genuinely interesting from the inside out. You will never be irrelevant.",False,False

It could easily turn into orthorexia but a way to be healthy and have a more ""sensational"" body (I think every body is not just average bc nobody is the same but society disagrees smh) is to workout to build muscle  Anyways, I'm sorry that society values thinness so much and that you've felt that so strongly. I can tell you that I personally (a bi woman) find so many body types not only attractive but enviable. Curvy, a lil chub, strong but thin, regular thin, all good. All beautiful",False,False
