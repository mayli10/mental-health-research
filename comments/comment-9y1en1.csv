The steep time is around 5 to 6 minutes, but I actually prefer to leave that in there for a long time because it doesn‚Äôt go bad if you leave it in there much past the steep time. It‚Äôs really great if you‚Äôre busy or have to put it in but don‚Äôt have time to take the teabag out until later.  For the roobois I am a big fan of African Nectar by Mightly Leaf, though I really like Teatulia for both my earl greys and roobois.
