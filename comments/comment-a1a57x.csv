Mine are largely due to sensory-type issues and I don't flip out or restrict if I'm not able to abide by these weird preferences, so I won't overthink it. Thank you!",False,True

As long as you're eating enough and have the proper nutrients, and the way you're eating it isn't detrimental in any way, then I say go ahead.   Also I agree, pizza with a fork, especially if you're doing something as well that requires clean, non-greasy fingers.",False,False

I understand why they would have those restrictions but it's not really the action or the behavior so much as what is driving it, IMO.  Some of us are just fancy af and need to eat our pizza with a fork ;)",False,False
