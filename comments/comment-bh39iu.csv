That's a HUGE step forward! I used to have to write down things like that for a therapist and sometimes she would ignore what I wrote down/said out even tell me what I was feeling/thinking was wrong and I had no right to think/feel how I did. About a year after I stopped seeing her I realized she was a horrible therapist and was totally wrong. What I feel and think is valid, just like everything you wrote down is valid. Doctors are trained to listen to patients and take everything you say and feel into account. Even if you're tests come back 'normal' they should listen to and address your concerns. And if they don't believe you, or think you're making it up, don't let it discourage you. It doesn't mean you're wrong, it just means they're bad doctors. Forgot about them and try to find a doctor who will listen to you and work with you. Good luck ♡♡♡",False,False
