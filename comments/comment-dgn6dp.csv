She was more concerned about alcohol use and explained to me that the combo of alcohol and Wellbutrin lowers your seizure threshold even MORE.   Luckily I don‚Äôt purge, I used to years ago in my early ED days. One day I just couldn‚Äôt make myself do it anymore? A blessing and a curse I suppose :/   But this is a very important warning. It‚Äôs insane how so many ED behaviors can become deadly in the blink of an eye, yet here I am practicing them daily despite my knowledge of the potential consequences.",False,True

The only thing that can be tracked are ‚Äúscheduled‚Äù drugs.   Medications like narcotics, opiates, benzos (Xanax and Klonopin) ... there is a national registry where it gets recorded when you were last prescribed the med, how much you were prescribed and when you picked it up from the pharmacy.   I only know this cause I‚Äôm an RN and worked in a clinic in a veryyyy rough neighborhood with rampant drug addiction. The docs would always check the registry when prescribing any scheduled meds.   But if you just go to your doc and act normal/naive and just kinda say you sometimes have panic attacks they might be cool with giving you Xanax or whatever without even looking shit up. If you‚Äôre young, well-kept, white, don‚Äôt look strung out, you‚Äôre way more likely to get a script without much questions ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è that‚Äôs racist and classist and horrible but it‚Äôs the truth from what I‚Äôve seen in practice.",False,True

Definitely DO NOT drink on the klonopin because you can very easily accidentally OD. It happened to me and I woke up choking on my own vomit üôÉ   But yeah klonopin was amazing for my anxiety and prevented the panic that I get from the Wellbutrin!,False,True

The thing is that for me, it‚Äôs never been permanent and it never will be. I‚Äôve been gaining/losing the same 20lb for the past 6 years.  I didn‚Äôt know that the appetite suppression would go away though so I kinda thought this was my magic ticket :(   Back when my ED was at its height and I reached my UGW, I was doing the EC stack daily.

You gained the weight back the first time you went off of it, didn't you?   i see it like wearing spanx - yeah you'll look skinnier for a while, but it's not a true/long term improvement because once you take them off you're back to normal  And accutane can seriously fuck you up, it's not worth it for a little temporary appetite suppression  Seriously please try something else, like even doing the EC stack is better than this",False,False

When my psychiatrist found out I have anorexia, he took me off it immediately because it can cause seizures if you‚Äôre not eating enough. My solution was to find a new psych and lie to her.
