Drop into boiling water for 3 minutes, rinse, boil again, rinse, boil a third time, rinse and then dry fry. I've been adding them to stir fry with chicken, peppers, peas, onion, carrot, celery, soy sauce, lemon juice, and crushed red pepper flakes. DM me if you want the recipe üôÇ",False,False

I grew up on pasta and my mom ALWAYS overcooked the pasta, so this texture is actually really similar to what I grew up with.  I second the advice to add other ingredients.  Even though I love them, I can't eat them plain or simply seasoned. I've been really into mixing them with shredded veggies - iceberg, carrots, cabbage, etc - becuase they all have a similar shape, so it also masks them, and it's insane volume for very little calories.",False,False

The less water that remains the softer they will be. Rinse, boil for 3-4 minutes, then pan fry while stirring for 8-10 minutes. You want to cook them as much as you can before they start drying out.  As for the batch you already made, they might not be a lost cause. Try microwaving then on high for a couple minutes and see if that helps.  I've also found its better to cut them into shorter pieces. I dunno how they sell them in other countries but in Japan each noodle is the length of my arm it's insane.  In the end though if you don't like them there isn't much you can do üôÅ",False,False

Then I rinse them again, pat them dry (not too dry, just the excess moisture), and dry-fry them in a skillet for about thirty seconds. This sounds a lot more labour-intensive than it actually is, and it‚Äôs super worth the effort imo. Also if you can get the NuPasta brand, I vastly prefer them to the generic noodles that come in bags.",False,False

Then I load up the soup with green onions, baby spinach, shredded carrots and any other veggies.  I think that cooking them the second time in the broth is what changes the texture to make it a little better, and they soak up the miso flavor (more than they did for other broths in my experience)  so they taste good.   I didn‚Äôt like them at first but I really like to prepare them this way! And adding other things to the soup is a good distraction from any weird texture lol",False,False
