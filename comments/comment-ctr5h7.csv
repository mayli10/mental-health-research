Well idk maybe some suggestions would be nice :)",False,True

I think where you have to be careful is considering whether all she’s doing is telling you this, or if she’s also teaching you the skills to make it happen. Sure it’s your choice to purge or not, but you’re seeing her because it’s really fucking hard to make that choice and stick with it. Her job isn’t just to tell you to make that choice because clearly you know that, it’s to help you find strategies that help you avoid, delay, or reduce purging. For example, figuring out how to distract yourself after eating, exploring what contexts you are least likely to purge in, deciding who in your life can hold you accountable, etc. If she’s not teaching you the tools, maybe it’s time to look somewhere else.",False,False

She is *right* but yeah I feel like the whole “just stop” thing doesn’t fucking work or I would have stopped!!! Idk anymore maybe she’s frustrated because we’re just kind of going in circles I’m not sure. I guess I’ll see how the next session goes,False,True

This comes off as being like ""just stop"". ...alright, cool, I guess mental disorders are just spontaneous decisions we make to self-destruct because there's totally no underlying issues that are causing the disordered actions.   I don't know, I'm not a therapist so I don't know what works, but this response would personally be unhelpful at best, and make me hate myself for having the disorder because it's ""my choice"" at worst.",False,False

That’s why I wanted to ask. Part of me understands why she was doing this and doesn’t think she’s undermining me. The other part, my ED, doesn’t want to hear it and is like what doesn’t she get?? But you’re 100% right. I am in control at the end of the day, I just need to figure out how to get back to feeling like it. Hopefully we keep discussing and I can get somewhere because I’m just really feeling like shit from this disorder lately.",False,True

Because when it comes down to it, we CAN stop if we want to. No one’s holding a gun to our head making us restrict/binge/purge etc. It FEELS compulsive and unavoidable and unstoppable, but when it comes down to it, we are the one in control. Not the eating disorder. By your therapist telling you that yes, you CAN do it, you’re just refusing to, it’s actually a way of empowering you by placing the power back where it belongs: with you, not the eating disorder. Ultimately, you rule it, but by insisting that it rules you and controls you and you’re powerless against it, you’re only giving it more power. It’s hard to hear, but it is important in reminding you that YOU are the one in control of your actions.",False,False
