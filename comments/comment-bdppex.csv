I was being seen outpatient for BED at a fucking dedicated eating disorder center. ""YoU bInGe BeCaUsE yOu DoN't EaT eNoUgH. eAt 3 mEaLs aNd ThReE sNaCkS a DaY."" Wow thanks, I'm cured! Turns out I was just *hungry* all this time, my b ðŸ™„. Not like I've ever binged after eating a full meal before. Or binged all day until my stomach felt like it's gonna burst, woke up the next day full from the previous binge and continued binging all day. Turns out I just needed three meals and three snacks ðŸ™„ðŸ™„ðŸ™„",False,False

I can relate. The only way I've ever lost weight was through some form of extreme calorie cycling or alternate day fasting. I *need* to know there are days where I can feel uncomfortably full or I feel empty.,False,False

I heavy restrict to manage my weight but thatâ€™s secondary to keeping my general intake low specifically so I can ingest 8000 craving calories in one go and get it all out of my system. Otherwise Iâ€™d be grazing and snacking all day every day.,False,False
