Then I was like ‚Äúwell I looked like this up until now and I‚Äôm still alive so I‚Äôll be okay if I stay like this just a bit longer‚Äù and I got rid of the deadline and I feel like a weight was lifted off my shoulders. We‚Äôre in different situations so I can‚Äôt speak for you but OP, you have your whole life ahead of you. Take your time, you‚Äôll get where you want to be soon.",False,False

I'm on the same boat, I've been unemployed since I graduated last year and I haven't dated anyone in years lmao and no ""friends"" that I can actually talk to or really want to hang out with. I dread what's in store 'after' (if there is one) because the thought of death and being non-existent is so comforting &amp; no way can it be that easy with our luck.",False,False
