I made maple syrup cake from scratch, at least it tasted heavenly. I might suck at restricting but I sure can bake! And eat...ðŸ™ˆ thank you, your comment lightened my mood a little. Hope you're having a great day.",False,True

Every second of the day has been a war with my mind on my body and I just feel like thereâ€™s no way for me to win it.

I try to ignore it but it always ends up in a disaster when I 'slip up'. And I'm glad the cake didn't have a label (baked it myself) otherwise I'd feel even worse.,False,True

I saw something (maybe on here?) talking about how you wouldn't kick your phone around if you dropped it, so you shouldn't let 1 slip up or broken rule ruin mean that you give up on the day. I know it probably doesn't help much but it's the only analogy that every made sense to me. Hope things get better and peach comes back soon ðŸ¤ž",False,False
