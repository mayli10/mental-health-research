They did dump a lot of stuff on me too, but don't want to listen to me which is kind of sucky. I've been considering online help but I am at point where I don't want control around food to be taken away from me...",False,True

I had a group of really close online friends (some of whom I've since met in person) that lasted over 2 or 3 years. Then, randomly, I did something that hurt one of their feelings without even realizing it. Our conversation led to other stuff I've done wrong and I basically then went to each of them individually to ask what I was doing (since it was implied by the other one that other people felt similarly) wrong that I had no idea about. Basically, it was a dependence I had created on using them as an outlet for my issues. Which is ironic bc often times they were completely unhelpful anyways but at some point you have to learn the difference between a therapist and a friend. And friends shouldn't have to be your therapist. A rant here and there or checking in is all good and fine but I learned regular sharing of pretty serious stuff can wear people down after a while. I moved on by repairing my friendships with all of them except the one whose feelings I hurt directly. I began journaling, taking time when things are getting rough to self-reflect, and I'm hoping to soon find a therapist in my city that I like. I'm sorry this happened to you and therapy may not be accessible for you currently but there are therapists you can talk to over the phone or in video chatting sessions. It may be a good idea to also find an ED or mental illness support group online or, if possible, in person.",False,False
