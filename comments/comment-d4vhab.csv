Losing weight/being skinny is really the only thing I feel I'm good at. It makes me feel like I'm more worthy of respect and love when I'm underweight and sick.

I'm very goal oriented and strive for self discipline in all areas of my life. I like solving problems too. I don't feel good about my body? Ok, I'll fix it.  I think a big part of my recovery was realizing I wasnt in control of my restriction anymore, it was controlling me. It's the same thing with my relapse. I felt out of control with what what I was eating.",False,False

I love gaining controlled back when I lost it in a binge with a purge.  • I love my body getting smaller. I was overweight and have lost almost 60kg by now. •I love the suprise when I can fit in smaller sizes I haven't fit in years  • I love admiring comments from family friends and random people who see me occasionally.  • I love it when people tell me I don't eat enough • I kinda love people worrying about me •I love the distraction it gives me. It's sort of like a comfort because I don't have to deal with my other problems.  •I love the feeling of actually doing something when I'm not really doing anything productive but not eating is productive because I lose weight.  • I love binges. Food tastes so amazing and I can eat so much and erase my mistake by simply purging. •I love not having a gag reflex much anymore. If you know what I mean.  Yeah...,False,False

I like the feeling of satisfaction that comes with the control, that comes with knowing I am finally \*winning\* over food, that comes with losing weight and being lighter. I love the numbers. I love how I can write down what I eat and KNOW, for certain, that I will lose weight, because the numbers are \*right\*. I love seeing the numbers go down on the scale. I love that it's so much more certain that i'll get quicker results from restricting rather than eating more and lifting, that my body will get \*smaller\*. I love watching myself shrink. I love imagining how it will be when i'm at my GW. I love when people worry, when they snarkily imply I don't eat enough in a way that makes them sound more hurt and concerned than angry, because if they're worried i'm doing it \*right\*. I like getting worse, because I deserve the pain and punishment but at the same time I feel like i'm becoming something better.",False,False

Life feels so much more in order. I have so much focus on everything around me because I have to think and do everything I can to not eat or think about eating.   I just get so *confident*. Powerful. I finally feel attractive when I see I’ve lost a pound or hit a milestone. Better than those around me.   I also like that high I get when I’ve fasted for more than a day- I’m airheaded and a bit dumb, but everything is so fuzzy and light. Like when you’re kind of *almost* falling asleep. It’s just nice.   Also I save so much money on groceries.   Unless it’s binging, in which case I blow all of my money- but the plus is that food always tastes *so fucking good* when I’m in Binge Mode. Like holy *shit* pizza just tastes so much *better* in bulk. Also, it soothes a hole in my heart (temporarily) I didn’t even know I had.",False,False

I keep up on my vitamins, take electrolytes, make sure I'm drinking enough water. Everything but eating.  It's probably because when I'm restricting I'm trying to exert control and get my life straightened out again. Someone with their shit together has a skincare routine and cares about water.
