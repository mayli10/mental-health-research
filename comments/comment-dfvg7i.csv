I definitely don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm the only one, but I always get so in my head about eating or looking weird for not eating when it‚Äôs like... normal people wouldn‚Äôt notice anyway, and normal people can also choose not to eat bc that‚Äôs a choice they‚Äôre allowed to make.   Thank you üòä",False,True

Just make sure the date isn't actually just lunch or dinner, and if you aren't comfortable with it, just don't eat, even if he does, this time. If he's normal, he won't think anything of you just saying you're not hungry, so don't let it stress you out (easier said than done, I know). Just focus on getting to know him and have fun :).",False,False

Because it says HE fessed to liking OP and OP ""agreed to go on a date"" with him.   No indication he wants to keep it casual in the post, if anything, the opposite since he asked OP on a real date.   Just saying, cause if OP were anything like me, reinforcing negative thoughts like ""he doesn't like me, he's only interested in sex"" could lead me to sabotage a really good thing.",False,False

You can still eat something small (or sip on a soda or smoothie) with him.   I know it‚Äôs hard, but I hope you guys can be clear about your expectations for the relationship.  It sounds like he has wanted to keep it casual, and if that‚Äôs still the case and you‚Äôre not feeling it, then please please get him to back off before your heart is in a million pieces.   ‚ù§Ô∏èGood luck!",False,False
