It was from Jacqueline Wilson’s Girls Under Pressure, a book I randomly picked up off the library shelf, when I was like 8. It had a strange effect on me, I fell in love with the main character and for some reason her descent into her disorder was super fascinating and almost inspirational, I really admired her sense of self control and wished I could be that strong. And of course I wanted to be skinny still back then even though I didn’t hate my body so I almost immediately tried to restrict like I have been doing now and started trying to exercise like my mum did when she had an ED. (even though I didn’t know she’d had one at the time, or that she overexercised, I just naturally decided it was a good idea.)  I had to stop after a week or so as I was too young to restrict like that with my family and school, I had to eat 3 meals a day still. It makes me sound a bit like a wannarexic but it’s less that I wanted to have a disorder more that I wanted to lose weight as quickly as the girl in the book did. What surprises me is how easily I fell into trying to restrict and also the face that I attempted to overexercise just like my mum did 25 years earlier, which is something I would do now if it weren’t for my CFS. It’s interesting as it seems to indicate the genetic element to EDs.  The book is still super good though even years later, that’s the main thing to take from this.",False,False

One was a family friend talking to my mum about anorexic teens and how they were clever at hiding their illness. The other time I was watching a reality show and a contestant snuck away to purge and the cameras found her. I don’t think I really understood fully what either thing was about at the time but it is bizzare how well I remember them.  I grew up to be weirdly obsessed with eating disorders fueled by spending hundreds of hours of time on the old school hey day of Ana tags on tumblr. I have read multiple different books on eating disorders a dozen times. I watch every movie I can find about five times even the crappy after school special ones. I have a whole playlist of songs and I subscribe to every kind of diet sub. It’s an unhealthy obsession that I just can’t explain. I’ve never had an eating disorder I would say but I have dipped hard into disordered eating patterns on and off my whole life. Maybe it’s partially having friends with disorders at a young age.,False,False
