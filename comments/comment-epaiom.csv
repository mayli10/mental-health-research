You think that never crossed my mind? I was gonna add context, but then I didn’t because I don’t need to explain myself. It’s obvious I want to move out. Anyway, thanks for understanding",False,True

People don’t live at home when having issues with a parent for fun, it’s often out of necessity. Sure, be glad you have a roof over your head, but you’re allowed to complain about issues and invasions of privacy. And people suggestions “move out” every time you want to talk about an issue you’re having is as annoying and dumb as people saying “just eat” when talking about eating disorders imo lmao.",False,False

Trust me that’s not something that’s never occurred to me, I was just ranting",False,True
