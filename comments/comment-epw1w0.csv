And my coworkers will ask me why Iâ€™m not eating and it makes me so uncomfortable and I just tell them Iâ€™m not hungry or that I ate before my shift. But the company kept giving us candy and hot chocolate and we had sâ€™mores day during the holidays and chocolate is something I binge on ugh. I try not to even work long enough to have breaks so that I donâ€™t have to be in the break room around all the snacks.,False,False
