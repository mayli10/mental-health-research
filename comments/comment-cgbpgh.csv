Like my grandmother was sweet and all but fuck if she wasn't racist af. My other grandmother is all gloom and doom and thinks that all women traveling alone are going to be straight up murdered. Idk, yo. Different generations are something else. They also say shit without any kind of filter since mental illness wasn't really a ""thing"" when they were growing up. Not justifying, but it's things I have to remember for myself when my grandmother says something insensitive. She's pretty old, so, I don't feel like giving lectures on stuff she definitely won't understand from a perspective of someone my age.",False,False

All mine kinda sucked. It's somehow worse when they say mean things to you because in movies and tv grandparents are always these cute nice little old people. Wtf real life.,False,False

I haven’t spoken to her since, I don’t need that negativity in my life lmao. She wanted to visit when my first child was born and I straight up just said no. She was a bad person for other reasons, but tbh that was the first thing I thought about",False,False
