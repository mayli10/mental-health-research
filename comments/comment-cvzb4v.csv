Eventually, I just stopped letting people take my picture, unless they have some photography training and are using an actual camera. If you have no understanding of depth of field, appropriate angles, or lenses, or if you're wielding an iphone camera...sorry but I can't. For years I suffered from suicidal meltdowns over innocent pictures (especially those posted on social media without my permission), and I just can't live that life anymore.    Even when the photographer is talented, though, you have to keep in mind that a photo inherently adds some wideness due to the flattening effect of the single lens (versus the more accurate binocular image we get from our eyes). ""The camera adds weight"" is a real thing. But it can easily be made much worse by shitty lenses, or by photogs who make no attempt to play with depth of field and so on.",False,False

I saw myself in the mirror and thought, “How does this look not that bad to me today when the picture yesterday made me want to hide in a hole and never come out?”  Perfect too because I’m in a wedding in October and those will be the pics my best friend will have of me for the rest of his life. I’m freaking out.",False,False

I don’t know how people post new ones every few days where they’re hanging out with their friends or partners and they all look amazing, like who’s even taking these? Did you hire someone to follow you around??",False,True

My boyfriend sent me the pictures he developed of us at the beach. There's 2 he really liked, but when I saw them I had an absolute meltdown. My nose looked bigger, my face was so so round and my hair was disgusting. I freaked. Is this how people see me? I am so much uglier than I thought. Anyone I showed the picture to said it was cute? So is it a cute picture? Or just a cute picture of an ugly person?  Sometimes the opposite happens where a picture is taken and I look super skinny.",False,False

I see nice pictures of other people, documenting all the fun stuff they do in pictures, and I get sad that I don't have anything like that. I'm a super sentimental person and it bugs me to not have pictures, but I can't bear to take them, much less ASK someone to take them for me (the horror).",False,False

Sometimes I feel ok looking in the mirror, but then later see a pic and I just want to crawl in a (giant) hole and die.   I think maybe that when I look in the mirror, I subconsciously avoid looking at the parts I hate most, and focus more on the things I hate least. With a pic, you just get the full package all at once, and have to look at it all.",False,False

Or you start to think you look ok in your home mirror but you check yourself out in a dressing room mirror and all of a sudden your a big ass blob. Nice, thanks body",False,False
