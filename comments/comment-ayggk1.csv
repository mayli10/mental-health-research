But I feel like it could be dangerous too. The subs mentioned in the other comments are probably the closest thing, but I feel like they can be overly harsh on a lot of things (certain features, and especially with PoC) but present it as objective. I disagree with a lot of what they say, and everyone should know that flaws and attractiveness are totally subjective. One that sticks out in my mind is people telling this gorgeous native American guy that his native-inherited facial features were unattractive, and when he asked if he should cut his traditionally long hair bc he felt insecure about it, everyone said yes :/  Regarding size, I could imagine them saying shit like ""yeah, you're definitely skinny, but your ____ is still ____"" and other unnecessary bullshit. Idk, maybe they've changed since I last went on them. You could be like: ""Disclaimer: I have an eating disorder and just want to know if I'm skinny. I don't need any other commentary, just tell me whether I'm skinny or not so I know."" Regardless of what you choose to do, BE CAREFUL and practice self-care if you feel able to ❤️  While not the same at all, mybodygallery is probably your best bet bc you get to see people at your height and weight who aren't you and assess whether you see them as skinny. If they are, you likely are too. It's not a panacea and it's still totally easy to be like, ""they're all skinny but I'm the exception!"" But it's something to try if you haven't already.",False,False
