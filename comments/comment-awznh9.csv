I know logically that its food/water weight, but its still really upsetting. I'll try the heart rate app and I have a doctor appointment this week so I should be okay. Thank you for the reassurance.",False,True

Especially if you're irregular, it's the food moving through your body which you didn't have to account for when you weren't eating enough. You cannot gain ten pounds in three days eating 1500 calories a day, even if you were not burning any calories at all, it is not possible. What you're experiencing is the weight of the water and the food. You might gain a little but at 1500 calories a day, probably not. Take your heart rate, there are apps that can do it. If at rest, it's consistently over 100BPM you may want to consider seeing a doctor (I have tachycardia but they've determined that I'm not at risk for more heart issues immediately), but it is probably the result of extreme anxiety. Seek medical attention if you feel like you are at risk of more health problems, obviously I can't tell you whether you are or are not in danger because I'm not a doctor. ",False,False
