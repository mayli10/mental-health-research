OD on fat soluble vitamins or iron (and maybe other ones) and it can be dangerous.    The gummy vitamins I have seem to put in fairly small amounts of the more potentially dangerous stuff, and I‚Äôve always assumed this is to protect people like me who might down a whole bottle. Honestly, the thing that stops me from buying hydroxicut gummies is knowing I‚Äôd do the same thing and very possibly get myself in serious trouble.",False,False
