Also interesting: employees do watch people using them (not to see their weight, but just probably bc theyâ€™re bored) and apparently now they see a lot of people weighing their luggage, and itâ€™s not unusual to see people stop in to weigh their dogs!",False,False

Also, if you stand with people, it'll help when you can see how much better they look IRL than on that screen, and apply that to your own face.

I have eczema so even though the skin on my face is smooth and clear nowadays, it still looked ghastly in the camera because my skin cells still aren't the same as ""normal"" skin that's never undergone that roughness, I guess.

I know grocery chains arenâ€™t universal so for anyone whoâ€™s confused about what Iâ€™m talking about, Iâ€™ll explain: Publix (the major grocery chain giant in Florida, and other parts of the south) has scales at the entrance. They look like giant versions of the fruit/veggie scales in the produce department. But they are for people, so you can weigh yourself when you walk in. PEOPLE ACTUALLY WIEGH THEMSELVES, IN PUBLIC (also in Publix...), AT THE FUCKING GROCERY STORE. Jesus Christ, that still blows my mind. Never in a million years would I step on that scale (tho part of my was dying to every time I walked in).   Yikes.
