I think you're making good decisions, especially for someone in your position right now, and I would like to add one thing for your consideration - I'm so glad you're able to use him as motivation and inspiration to improve your health issues. I think this is a great idea as far as the short term goes. For the long term, consider this - imagining yourself being able to handle this without him.   Imagining yourself dealing with a tough situation and still succeeding is a great tactic, and I find that the more reliant you are on a specific someone or something for your recovery, the harder it is to maintain when that element is gone. That isn't to say that refusing help is healthy, either - rather, just having a healthy amount of ""How could I handle this situation if this element wasn't here"" planning can help you if rugs get suddenly pulled from underneath you. You'll be able to adapt much faster.  I wish you the best of luck, and you are absolutely allowed to eat without having to feel bad about it.",False,False
