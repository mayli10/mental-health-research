We only talk about food and calories and exercise. It’s a sick little competition. I used to love it but I’ve grown to resent it,False,True

I’ve never looked into a recovery buddy because I’m afraid my behavior would be triggering for someone else also suffering. Like I’m just starting the “recovery” process (I’m not even doing it right really)  I would never want to harm anyone else’s recovery or hold them back.,False,True

It sucks to break up with friends but sometimes it has to be done. Just remember to be gentle with yourself afterwards because break ups are rough.   If you want a recovery buddy, especially someone who also suffers from bulimia, this community is really good for that! I've thought about reaching out a few times myself.",False,False
