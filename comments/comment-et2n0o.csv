There are many people whose eating disorder has threatened their life and their marriage, and there are many people who have gone on to enter long-term recovery to save both.   Your BMI necessitates professional treatment to make sure your recovery is medically safe. A little more on navigating eating disorder recovery without insurance: https://youtu.be/p-JS21ANPQg  One of your free options to augment your support and accountability is SMART Recovery, an international non-profit that offers evidence-based peer support education on the self-management of addictive behaviors including bingeing/purging. I am a volunteer facilitator (never a paid position) for SMART and would love to ""see"" you on my Wednesday night online meeting from 7:30-9PM CST with msandoval at smartrecovery.org. PM me for the details.   SMART is for all kinds of addictions, but there is a disordered eating online meeting Saturdays at 4PM CST, and The FREE Unofficial SMART Recovery Handbook for Disordered Eating can help you translate the tools from substance issues to food issues: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vPk9JbgWrGCL4LbjAmVbVW-g2fD5DFBP_P-8ov2F4sY/edit?usp=sharing  Feel free to ask any questions you would like to see answered or tools you'd like to see covered in subsequent chapters. I hope you find it helpful. Good luck finding a treatment center that's right for you/financially workable. Recovery is possible.",False,False

Look into treatment grants, locally and nationwide. Idk, but I’m rooting for you OP!",False,False

You can't put a price tag on your life, but still. I've looked into the general meal plans they have inpatient and shit, that's even more terrifying. From what I read it's 3 meals, 3 or 4 snacks, and around 2500 calories a day until you're weight restored. I'm making an appointment with a GP soon, just for a general check up, which is something I haven't done for the better part of 7 years. I'm not sure if it will accomplish much but I hope it's a step in some positive direction.",False,True

I just wanted to let you know that I read this and I really feel for you.  Have you considered inpatient? It sounds like you really need the structure right now .,False,False
