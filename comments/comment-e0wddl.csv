(I started out really heavy though)   Keto isn't as bad as people think, but I spiraled further into my ED because I got obsessed with the numbers.   That's on me, not the diet as some would like to blame. I'm the disordered one.   You don't have to eat a bunch of fats. Just enough to keep you satiated. You definitely want to hit your protein though.   You tend to not feel hungry often when you're in ketosis. Plus I had energy for days. Felt like I drank several pots of coffee and a shitload of energy drinks.",False,False

It is not magical,  any claims of blood sugar levels changing metabolism or fat burning are bogus. Ultimately it is purely CICO. Please be cautious if you're feeling bad with it, its really not a wise diet outside of people who need it for epilepsy or diabetes or other medical reasons.",False,False

Don’t but I would say that just limiting carbohydrates in your life is better than getting rid of them",False,False

From what I’ve understood, since it causes you to have hypoglycemia, then you should be able to eat more and still lose because the lack of insulin at work causing you to store energy",False,False
