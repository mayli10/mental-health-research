Sure I'd eat as ton in one sitting sometimes, but then I wouldn't feel hungry for a longer period of time after.  It's hard to do but I was just raised doing it I guess. Nobody in the world can eat whatever they want whenever they want and not worry ",False,False

My/our BMI is under 20, my waist is 27 inches, my wrists are 5.5.  We're normal, but definitely on the thin end of it.  Don't forget that body dismorphia messes up our perceptions of our bodies.",False,False

I was chubby as a kid and into my teens because I ate what I wanted without care. It's never been natural to me. I remember being 11 or 12 and 140 lbs and my friends all ate with the same reckless abandon as me but were much thinner. The body image issues really started there    Maybe I just get kinda jealous because I've never had that freedom with food and if I ate everything I talked about daily, I'd be overweight.

That was me for a long time.  I just ate when i wanted and stayed at a good weight for years, because I just ate when i was hungry until i wasn't.  Now I struggle more with binge episodes, snacking, restricring.  I'm still skinny but it's no longer ""natural"" to me",False,False

I want to be that cool girl that can eat whatever she wants and still have a tiny body. Does that person even exist though? Like are there healthy people out there (not people with say...undiagnosed hyperthyroidism) that truly can eat a lot of calories without gaining?   At the same time...I get SO insulted when someone implies I don’t have to work for my body.   “Oh, you’re lucky you’re tall because you can eat whatever.”   “I’d be that skinny too if I was your height! My fat is just squished closer together.”  Bitch you don’t understand the self control it’s taken for me to maintain this weight! I run and workout and eat less than a fucking toddler lol ",False,False

We're the same height and you're very close to my ugw  Secondly I don't understand anymore why people think anyone is ""naturally thin."" It takes effort for everyone. Some people might not think about eating, but they're still mindful when they eat. So yeah I don't get it either",False,False
