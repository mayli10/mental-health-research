My mom screamed at me over the phone in front of the counselor, then both parents screamed at me for hours when I got home. They ignored me for a little over a week after that. I don’t think they’ll ever get to the point where a professional will be able to explain it to them, and even if they did it probably still wouldn’t get through to them. Thank you though",False,True

However, if you do go to a recovery clinic and start off with outpatient therapy, your therapist can talk with your parents and help them understand that this is serious and not something you’re being dramatic about. don’t let your parents halt you from wanting to recover, if they don’t support you, then you have to take matters into your own hands and just hope that eventually they’ll come around and begin to work with ya instead of invalidating you",False,False
