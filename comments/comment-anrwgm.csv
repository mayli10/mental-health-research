I take a shot glass full ever other day! Awesome for bloat and whenever i feel a late night binge coming on i take a shot to stop it. Nothing kills a binge more than a mouth full of vinegar. ,False,False

And if you are at risk of purging that makes the risk of damage much worse!   If you drink too much it can damage your throat and stomach as the vinegar is super acidic.   If you’re super concerned with bloating (from water retention) I would recommend dandelion tea. It’s supposed to be good for your liver since it helps with water retention. You could sneak a teaspoon in your tea or glass of water if you really want to try it out! ,False,False

I sometimes drink it with green tea (beyond gross but every time I had a big dinner I drank it before bed and I never gained more than 100 gr.) and sometimes I carry a bottle of cold water with some acv as well (not really that gross),False,False

If you purge, I would say definitely do not use ACV. ",False,False
