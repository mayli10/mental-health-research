Every time I restrict I’m not ... regular .. even if I’m not low restricting.  I swear, the first time I got to my LW I was losing like .2 DAILY. AND I was being more consistent and eating exactly 1300 everyday (which is more than I consumed this week) so I basically feel hated upon by life right now! ",False,True

Been literally 800-1000 daily and last night was my highest but still only 1300 because my maintenance for the day was 1900. I guess we really answered our own question but damn, even after eating even a couple hundred cals and still being under you’d think the week of under eating would still make up for it. That was my logic.  I was like, “yeah I actually ate a healthy amount of weight loss calories last night BUT I ate a lot less every day so I’ll def be a pound lighter” nope ",False,True

I weighed myself today, last time being Tuesday and it was THE EXACT SAME WEIGHT TOO!!
