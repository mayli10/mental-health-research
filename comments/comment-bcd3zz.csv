I started nighttime eating many years ago, because I would wake up STARVING at like 2 am.  Then I'd eat whatever was in my fridge, which was luckily healthy stuff, but still it was frustrating.  I've gained to a normal weight but now....it's just a habit. I wake up in the middle of the night to use the bathroom and end up in the kitchen...why?  I'm not hungry!  I think it's becuase my mind is freer and less disciplined then, though I don't eat junk that I usually restrict (though I did go thru that :fun: phase for a couple years....yay).  I don't know, I've tried a lot of things, but the only times I didn't do it would be after a huge late night binge and then I'd sleep through the night. Sleeping pills help so I can sleep thru the night, too.",False,False

Yesterday I managed to have Greek yogurt and soup instead of lasagna but that still felt bad. I listened to the brain over binge podcast episodes 5 and 6 which kind of acted like a coach. And then I promised myself that I could binge tomorrow.   Thats all I got lol,False,False
