He invited me out to breakfast and I was so resistant at first...It took me a minute to actually agree to go and I'm sure he noticed my hesitation. So we get to the place and I'm mentally not in the right frame for food so I order a coffee and tell him that I'm not really a breakfast person. That goes okay and I feel like I'm in the clear because everything was so nonchalant. Breakfast ends and we drive back to drop off his room mate and grab my massage stuff (I'm also an LMT) to do a session at his place. We head up there and all of this stuff has just been weighing on me and he's so intuitive that he actually asks me how I'm doing and we wind up having one of the most soul-touching conversations I've had in a long time. Tears, laughter, all of it. We both get around to realizing that I'm not in the right space to give a massage and so we decide to take the day to go have fun. Fun for me is the library, so off we went. Then he asked me about getting lunch because it was getting later in the day, and that's when I said that I was actually fasting and didn't want to make a big deal about it so I just said I wasn't a breakfast person... And he asked me why I was fasting. He asked me point blank, in a friendly way, and I was compelled to answer honestly. I told him that it helps clear my mind and helps me focus when I'm emotionally overwhelmed.. And he says ""I bet it's a good way to punish yourself for not being good enough, too"". Like. Damn. So my disordered ass replies ""well...but, it's also a reward."" And it felt. So. Good. It felt so liberating to lay all my cards on the table and not even worry about the reaction or the judgement or anyfuckingthing . I didn't feel like I overshared or dumped my baggage on him like I normally would if I shared.  I don't know what this means, I mean, I am definitely still in a restrictive state of mind and I don't really want to stop, but it just felt nice to be real with another human in daily life. I don't feel so...isolated. He's much older than me, 34 years older, and I think maybe that might have something to do with it. He's not afraid of vulnerability. I have a safe space now.",False,False
