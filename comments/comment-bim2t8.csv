I‚Äôve been lurking for so long and saying my first post can‚Äôt be lame. But fuck it. I‚Äôm grateful because I thought I would be short more. I didn‚Äôt eat it ALL, but I‚Äôve never been short before. I don‚Äôt get paid until next week. I shouldn‚Äôt be eating anyway so whatever, right? Who cares if I can‚Äôt buy a single thing until then, right? What‚Äôs so scary about being hungry? It was used as punishment when I was a child. And a teenager. I attach the feeling of hunger to deep trauma. I got told I wasn‚Äôt hungry when I was. As I grew, my school lunches never did. I was eating what a seven year old should eat in 7th grade. I was the last to get breasts and the last to get my period. I got teased for being skinny all the time. Fucking bitch malnourished me. I didn‚Äôt do it to myself! And now every time I feel that hunger feeling I see her face. I hear her screaming at me about some THING I neglected to do‚Äîa kitchen cabinet ajar half an inch, a floor rug slightly askew, BREATHING. It‚Äôs funny when you can feel how much your parental figure hates you with every fiber of their being. Funny like strange? I don‚Äôt know what I mean. And yet they can‚Äôt kill you because they don‚Äôt want to go to prison. Not because they realize you‚Äôre just a growing person who‚Äôs ya know, LIKE A FUCKING CHILD WHO SHOULD BE NURTURED AND PROTECTED AND NOT FUCKING ABUSED! So every time I say no to food I have to say yes to her fucking lard faced double chinned ass looming in the front of my memory like some greasy smear on a dirty window pane. Fucking fat bitch. She didn‚Äôt want me to eat because how dare I be skinny without having to diet and suffer like her! Idiot never realized I was skinny because she was starving me! For eighteen years she was starving me. ‚ÄúHow can you be hungry, you had dinner!‚Äù I weigh the same as a 6th grader you dumb bitch and I‚Äôm in the 10th grade‚ÄîLET ME FUCKING EAT SOMETHING!!! I didn‚Äôt mean to make a wall of text for my first post. Dunno. I‚Äôm gonna let it ride. Maybe I‚Äôll delete it later in shame. But it feels good to finally participate in this sub because I‚Äôve been reading for a long, lonnnnng time. But sometimes you have to let it out, ya know? ‚ÄòCause it‚Äôs not like you‚Äôre the only one wanting to slap the shit out of your roommates for smelling up the house with all their yummy cooking as you walk in the door with grand plans for diet soda and..........gum. Why? Because a two week binging spree has visibly changed the composition of your body. There are consequences for that shit. Food isn‚Äôt evil. But what I‚Äôve been doing with it is pretty close to it. A few nights ago I weighed a purge in a garbage bag and wondered if it was normal to puke up that much or if it was verging on overboard or if really wasn‚Äôt that much. Is been in ‚Äúremission‚Äù from that for two years. Instead I transitioned to restricting and had been restricting heavily since October. And finally when I looked in the mirror I LIKED what I saw. Every bone, sinew, vein. It was like ‚Äúsee, SEE!!!!‚Äù But saboteurs encourage you with lies like ‚ÄúYou can have some. You can try it. It‚Äôs okay.‚Äù So you eat, because after all, the sweet little 60 year old office admin with the five grandkids isn‚Äôt trying to hurt you, right? She just wants to make sure you don‚Äôt faint, right? So you eat. Not realizing you just lit a match. For one month I‚Äôve been eating like a possessed monster. And lying to myself that somehow the calories will dissolve into the mist, not go down my esophagus and straight to my thighs, my abs, my ass, my back, my arms, my FACE! Oh what have I done to my face?!!  It was finally looking how I wanted it to look. Finally chiseling away at that damn baby fat to reveal the high cheekbones I KNEW always lurked beneath. So no, no, tonight I will NOT eat. Tonight I will tell the saboteurs to FUCK OFF! Misery loves company and I prefer not to join them. I prefer to float. Float on in the double digits, float on through the kids‚Äô section in every clothing store, float on through skinny reflections in office high-rises, float on through x-small leggings, float on through butt bruises and cold hands, float on with my hip bones, float on with my pretty petite wrists, float on with my bony feet, float on in that lightheaded dream. Don‚Äôt need drugs because you‚Äôre already half out of it. Float on through green tea, Bangs, Reigns, coffee, and Feisty Cherry and Strawberry Guava. Float right the fuck on. Love you all. It feels really good to finally just SAY something haha. This was nice :)",False,False

How did I get so desperate?
