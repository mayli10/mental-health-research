I know I'm at a normal weight, but I still throw up a lot, to the point where I'm being physically effected by it. I'm just not skinny.   After this incident, I feel like I'm not ""sick"" enough to try and get better. Stupid, I know, but I feel like a fraud. ",False,True

I'm thinking maybe she was extremely busy that day and may not have had time to read her notes or even grab a pen and paper. I hope it was just that, and not a lack of interest or concern. But usually if that happens they ask if you can wait a moment. Maybe bring it up next time? Say that you don't feel supported or like you are being taken seriously.",False,False

Maybe she didn't have time to? Or does she not take notes?",False,False
