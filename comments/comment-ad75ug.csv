Its a good thing it wasnâ€™t dark though. I did see someone earlier post a more helpful article that seems to explain it more better. Hope you manage to have a quick recovery from your throat. Itâ€™s really tough out here :\",False,False

You can still damage and irritate it with just your hands too btw. Purging alone is SO damaging to your throat and drying. If itâ€™s dark then it is from inside intestines which is dangerous and needs a check up.  Iâ€™ve irritated and opened up small wounds in my throat before too. The first time it happened it scared me and feel shameful. Mostly because that meant I had to lay off purging. You have to lay off purging, 100% to avoid making the wound worse or bigger and then actually having to go to the hospital or need surgery.  I know itâ€™s so difficult to cut back. I ended up relapsing and doing it 2 days later but I saw more blood first and my throat was the most irritated it hurt to swallow saliva. I scared myself straight by reading up on cases where they actually needed surgery and for me it helped to ask my boyfriend to keep me accountable.",False,False

I know i should but i'm too scared.  I really do not want to come across condescending here, but we are not doctor's so we can't ""just tell you what the problem is"" because it could be a lot of things, and unfortunately only a doctor would be able to do the appropriate tests.   I can give you a link to the mayo clinic website that lists possible causes of vomitting blood.  https://www.mayoclinic.org/symptoms/vomiting-blood/basics/causes/sym-20050732   The ones that pop out to me as being possibly associated with bulimia or vomitting frequently are  &gt;Mallory-Weiss tear(tear in the esophagus associated with pressure caused by vomiting or coughing)  &gt;EsophagitisÂ (inflammation of the esophagus)  &gt;GastritisÂ (inflammation of the stomach lining)  One major danger is that if the bleeding persists you could lose too much blood. You could be bleeding into your stomach which will cause side effects of their own. You could cause a larger tear by continuing to vomit and that could literally kill you.  If you start feeling light headed, get blurred vision, feel nauseous and especially if you start having breathing difficulties (rapid, shallow) you are in immediate danger.  I really do feel for you, and I really apologize if I came across as rude or insensitive. Please take care of yourself and try to practice as much harm reduction as you can, like the other comment reccomend. ",False,False
