Would it be worth asking him not to comment on specific parts of your body? Maybe just limited to more broad terms, that could describe you inside too, like ""beautiful"" (or when getting it on, ""sexy"", etc.) It's difficult to describe to a partner when confidence fluctuates so dramatically :/ this might not have helped very much, but I def feel you!!! This hit hard",False,False
