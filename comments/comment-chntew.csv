My mom (nicely, though) watched me walk into a door after having lost a lot of weight as a teenager (I was pretty overweight) and said something to the tune “I thought it was just because you were bigger.” It kind of hurt but was also hilarious. She’s so supportive all the time and did not at all mean it in an unkind way.  Update - still constantly covered in bruises because I walk into everything",False,False

I haven't read any of them so I can't say whether they're any good, but I do remember scrolling past and thinking, ""Yeah, that would make sense.""   Of course, I'm never sure if my problem is anorexia or gender dysphoria, because my main issue is my hips. I never remember I have hips until I bang them on something yet again, and get depressed. I developed hips about a couple years into my eating disorder, and that's the first time I really remember feeling dysphoric, with my brain going: ""??? no??? this is not in my blueprint??? does not belong!!!!!""",False,False

I have lived in my house for almost 3 1/2 years now and I still hit the same kitchen counter corner and doorframe half the time I exit the kitchen. I've had the same bedframe for even longer but wouldn't you know it, this clumsy bitch still got a huge bruise on her thigh from hitting it ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯",False,False
