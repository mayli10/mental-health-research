After a big binge cycle, I def try to not buy any foods I've currently been eating/craving and just some functional foods (ie. healthy things that are low cal, nutritionally dense, but not fun to eat).  My cabinets are just full of old (possibly expired) boxes of pasta and canned emergency food.  I look at them as basically not existing when it comes to ""what I have on hand to eat right now"".",False,False

I live with my bf, and we share a fridge and a pantry in our apartment. My entire side of the fridge is empty, except for some Monsters. And I’ve taken up half a shelf in the pantry with safe foods.  Genuinely too afraid to fill up my side of everything. I’m afraid I’ll binge.  Eating disorders suck.",False,False

I grew up poor and so now I have the urge to make sure there is constantly a plethora of food around in the cabinets and fridge and freezer.... but I won’t eat any of it because I’m afraid that one day I won’t be able to buy anymore and that’s all I’ll have.,False,False
