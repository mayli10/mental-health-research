I’m 2 inches taller, but also my frame is just bigger than hers. she’s got these tiny bird bones- tiny wrists, small hands, small hips, just everything. at one point she was seriously underweight and struggling with an ED (I think, we’ve never talked about it but she was seriously looking sick) and has since recovered. but still even though we’re closer in size now, and yeah sure I wear small and xs clothes, I will never be as small as her or look as cute and petite. as much as I love her I’m so jealous 😩",False,False

Then, OF COURSE, my already tiny sister just has to go and lose more weight, so now that I’m technically a really nice weight, I’m the fat sister again. I will be careful with the tights!🖤I’m used to sweltering heat after years of living in the south and wearing all black. I hope you manage to have a nice time with your twin. Sending love!",False,True

Because I’m the same, I’ve lost a ton of weight, and my twin “cares” and is “worried for me” despite never calling me, and please be careful with the tights! Don’t overheat, it’ll really make your family think you haven’t eaten if you feel woozy! My twin dropped a lot of weight and nobody said anything, but I do, and boom! They still don’t care (only my grandmother, which it was easy to get my parents to ignore because my dad legit could not give a shit less in fact he encourages my weight loss and fuels it heavily, not that he knows that but 🤷🏻‍♀️)",False,False

She’s SO thin! She’s down to 95 pounds.” I’m 5’2 and my sister is 5’5. Anything I do, she just does better. I have no ill feelings towards her; she’s an amazing sister,  it’s just my mother is always comparing us and I’m never as good. It’s unfortunate that siblings can be so triggering. I have to wear a dress tomorrow and I’m going to have to wear tights in 95 degree weather just to hide some of the bloating.",False,True
