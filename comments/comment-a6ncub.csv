If they're okay with it, ask questions! Getting to know foreign this is always good. üôÇ  I'm glad to hear you'll still be able to treat them the same way. Some people can't but I don't blame them, ED's are complex and hard to understand like many other mental health issues. Sorry about the PTSD, it sucks. I have it too.   Have a great day!",False,False

And let her know you‚Äôre here to support her if she needs to talk about anything. Or if you want to be more direct, you could say you are concerned about her health/some of her eating habits. Purging is so damaging to the body and she might literally have no idea of that. You just have to be gentle about how you approach it and word things carefully so she doesn‚Äôt feel persecuted or embarrassed. I know as a person with an ED myself that it‚Äôs very uncomfortable for me to talk about food overall.",False,False

Chinese culture normalizes telling people that they are fat and need to lose weight, point-blank. Lots of East Asian women feel like they need to be dieting all the time. Looking at their media and expectations of what women should look like, it is clear they have an obsession with unhealthy thinness. (I‚Äôm not saying America doesn‚Äôt, but our standards are a bit different. Impossible/disproportionate hourglass or pear-shaped bodies are prized here, while in East Asia, women with very thin and delicate limbs are idealized) Underweight bodies are very much the standard of beauty there. Also, have you ever looked at online clothing from China (or East Asia in general)? I know East Asian people tend to be more on the petite side, but sizing there runs super small. I imagine this would cause a lot of body dysmorphia for girls and women who grow up there.",False,False

I'm from South Korea and I really do believe that it played a big role in the development of my ED. I was delighted to hear that the feminist movement is finally gaining some traction amongst netizens (Korean Internet users), but god, we still have such a long, long way to go.",False,False

I sometimes ask her questions about it out of curiosity. She says thingd don't trigger her but I'm anxious not to.

Eating disorders are very personal problems and some people feel ashamed talking about it. Maybe ask her if she's okay casually or let her know you'll be there for her and she can talk to you if she wants to.  If she admits she has an eating disorder don't push her to recover or get help. Forced recovery doesn't work. The person must want to recover too.  And don't treat her differently! I admitted having anorexia for a few friends and now one of them is kind of awkward around me. It sucks, I've had AN for a decade and suddenly you treat me in a whole another way than before just because I opened my mouth about this? Ugh, so annoying.   Sorry for the mini rant but I think it's important to say she's still the same person as she was before.",False,False

It's most often not seen as a mental illness there, but as something that people just do to manage their weight, like sub-500 calorie crash dieting mixed with obsessive anorexic tendencies.  I remember a thread from MPA where a Japanese user shared how she and her friends would gather together to binge and purge as a casual way to pass time. After binging they would stick plastic hoses to down their throat all the way to the stomach, diluting the stomach's contents to mush with water and bringing it up by bending downwards and pushing on the stomach. They did this instead of the gag reflex to avoid staining their teeth or causing facial swelling, both of which are very frowned upon in their society. She also showed a screenshot of these hoses being sold on a mobile app comparable to Wish, with the seller explicitly describing that the hoses are specifically made for gastric lavage to purge binges. The description also described how to dilute with water and chew food during binges so it wouldn't get stuck in the hose.  It's obviously a serious mental and physical problem to be throwing up food under any circumstances, but the casual approach to it is probably cultural if she's Chinese. In Western culture it's always seen as a serious problem and people try to hide it to the best of their ability, but her casualness shows how purging is most often approached in Asia.",False,False

It sounds like she‚Äôs aware to some degree but is repressing the magnitude of how bad it is. She also probably feels shameful and guilty, as pointed out when she runs from the kitchen. Just a simple comment such as ‚Äú hey are you doing okay‚Äù and/or ‚Äú hey if you need help I‚Äôm here‚Äù. Usually that‚Äôs a good way for introducing that helpful hand without dragging them through the window by directly asking.  ",False,False
