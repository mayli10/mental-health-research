And hey, don't worry, I'm pretty down this hellhole so anything I do is on me. Much love to you &lt;3",False,True

It's very, very distinct. It tastes bitter, and idk, how I imagine something like battery acid might taste. You can also feel it burning your mouth/esophagus if it's enough. It's just very, very distinct from food, and it happens usually after all the solid food is purged and you're just getting the bits of liquid in the bottom of your stomach up.  I feel very hesitant sharing that though because I don't want you to get worse.",False,False
