Once he got me an XL shirt when I was a medium at the time and told me he wasn't sure it'd fit me. I'm not sure if that was his attempt at a joke, but it hurt nonetheless.  Especially since he got my mom the same shirt in a small/medium.",False,False

My mom and dad used to call me a skank and my nickname was â€˜muffin topâ€™ when I was at my heaviest. And ofc their attitude towards my ED now is just utter disgust and â€˜why donâ€™t you just not have an ED?â€™ My dad loves to call my stomach a gut to this day lol. ,False,False

Even when I was a small/medium she bought me XL clothing. It made me think I was HUGE even when I was an underweight teenager. I still donâ€™t know how clothes are supposed to fit me ðŸ˜‚ ,False,False

Such unnecessary and hurtful comments but they wouldn't see the issue... When I was at my heaviest I wore a floaty vest top that I'd had for years. I love that top and had worn it at many weights. This is after a childhood of internalising my mother's body insecurities and never showing my upper arms even though we both looked perfectly fine.   We were in Stockholm at the height of summer and I wore it even though I felt a little uncomfortable that I was quite overweight. My dad decided to tell me that it was an eyesore. Gee thanks you absolute bastard. Guess who's hidden her arms ever since despite losing 25lbs since...,False,False

I've been sick with GI issues for a year and have lost a lot of weight and all he could say is that I look better when I'm not fat? like never mind that I've been in the hospital all year what's really important is how attractive I am,False,False

Heâ€™d have to be one of those viral super free spirit dads not to.  Iâ€™m sorry he hurt your feelings.  ,False,False
