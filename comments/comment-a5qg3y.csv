Originally 1200 was fine, then 1000, then 800, and now I set a daily limit of 650 (which I do go over quite a lot tbh). It was literally just one day where I decided to move it to 650 and since then I'm uncomfortable going above.",False,True

First the perception of my body, I donâ€™t see the skeletal body everyone else says they see. And now Iâ€™m working on gaining weight Iâ€™m realizing how much I overestimate what i eat and the calorie content. I was guessing my chocolate intake to be twice what it really is. Iâ€™d been guessing my meals to be 500 when they were more like 300. Yesterday I ate 2700 cal and boasted to my husband how Iâ€™d eaten 3000 and he said you canâ€™t round up like that! Also I said Iâ€™d gained almost a kilo and he said it doesnâ€™t count because Iâ€™d recently lost a kilo. Fml lol ðŸ˜©ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­",False,False
