Granted it was sooo frustrating not to see any results for a while. But then the scale would show I lost like 4 or so pounds and I would be so happy. ,False,False

It basically stays in the same 2 pound range and it‚Äôs so frustrating. ",False,False

Then it‚Äôll kinda ‚Äúwhoosh‚Äù away and release the water and that‚Äôs when you‚Äôll see the scale move. I don‚Äôt really know the exact science or details behind it but maybe you can look up ‚Äúwhoosh keto‚Äù for more resources that explain it",False,False

I know I just need to ride it out, but I‚Äôm only eating about 700-800 a day and the IF the scale moves at all it keeps going up 1lb/down .5/up .5/down 2lb/up 1.5 etc   I‚Äôm going nuts.
