If you're in the wilderness, you are much more likely to acquire food if you're looking for it.  I think ""consuming"" food-related media is just the more enjoyable way of tolerating that endless stream of thoughts about food. I imagine we get a tiny dopamine bump from looking/hearing/smelling things that help us imagine the sensation of eating. It kinda feels like that, at least, and I think it would make sense.  edit: although, SS vs SS is a different breed altogether. That show fuckin feels like it was made to be an ED trigger. there is a LOT going on there besides the food itself lol",False,False

Superskinny and like... gross cooking videos and mukbangs and stuff like that. I think it's partially a way to trigger myself, like my ED encouraging me by saying ""oh there's no Way you wanna look like That."" But I've also found myself deep in the hole of Good recipes and channels like Bon Appetit, so maybe it's just our preoccupation with food seeping more into everyday life - like our brains say ""Don't Eat That"" so our bodies turn towards staring at the next best thing??
