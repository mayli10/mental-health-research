I think there’s just something to seeing my overall rate of binging go down, but seeing consequences nonetheless that bothers me. Like if I just followed her lead, I would be in a much better place until I stopped all together. It’s a messed up attitude to have, I’m aware, but on the other hand the behavior seems like such a good help since I’d *only* need it once in a while. You’re right that I shouldn’t try and be striking a balance of disordered behavior though; the fact that I could have my medication taken from me is just one of many consequences for those actions.",False,True

I definitely should not have phrased it that way, since it’s more down to her behavior’s effect on me. It just seemed at the time like I’d rather be able to binge and purge vs just being in post-binge hell when this happens.   I’m waiting for her to get up to discuss the repercussions of her actions on my recovery. She seems to be realizing the full extent of how fucked up her behavior is to me. I think it’s been difficult to have her eating disorder make a resurgence relatively recently after not dealing with it for a while. Difficult for her, of course, but also for me.  She has been supportive of my recovery, but her recent actions seem to be coming from somewhere else and are deeply concerning. I can’t help but wonder if the competitive side of having an ED is coming into play on both sides, since consciously or not she’s been dragging me down with her a lot more often than not lately. Our dynamic was very bringing each other up until her recent relapse and now it’s flipped.   Long story short, I guess I just needed a space to rant about the situation and how unfair it felt. I feel like we will be having a long discussion about what our goals are and about defining clearly what the expectations are in the future. If she won’t be able to be a positive force in my recovery or if my recovery is triggering to her, then we will probably need to set some boundaries around space or sharing space, particularly while eating.",False,True

I think reminding yourself why bulimia fucking sucks is helpful for you and your recovery, not because you should feel bad for wanting one or the other. They all suck, and we all sometimes wish we got more of one behaviour and less of another. Hell, that's a lot of what keeps me in this, and keeps me from recovering, thinking I can just find the right balance of behaviours to realize all my dreams, haha.",False,False

Your gf is being unfair and really insensitive.   To be generous to her, your recovery might be triggering for her too. I've never dated someone with an eating disorder, and I can't imagine what it would be like.   But Jesus, that sounds really bad. As in her behaviour seems really bad. If you've talked about it, I don't know what to say except if you both can get a bit of space to reflect alone, that might be good. But maybe just more talking? Because that's just so unreasonable and messed up for a relationship dynamic. &lt;3",False,False

For someone who is usually so careful about treating myself mindfully, avoiding temptation, etc, watching her go and buy all these things I’d have loved to have binged on set me over the edge.   Then of course we both ate the things we bought at home, but she threw them up whereas I was just stuck feeling in awful pain. I decided I was going to purge just once, because I knew this would set back a *LOT* of progress. But she wouldn’t even let me shower for fear that I would. I hate that she triggered me so badly knowing how I struggled, let herself purge the food from her body, then just left me to feel terrible and bitter about the inevitable weight gain, digestive issues, and the amount of time it will take me to reform my mindset and get back on my recovery track.   I guess I wrote this insensitively. I don’t actually want to trade-in BED for bulimia like a fucked up Gamestop, I just wish she wouldn’t have triggered me. I wish she wouldn’t cheer about her weight loss when she loses it in a bad way, because I’ve worked so hard to be in a place where I’m even losing weight healthily. Especially in the next few days, if she jumps for joy at her weight loss, I know I’ll just be so upset because I will carry this weight gain for at least the next 4/5 days. She said we’d have a conversation about it today because of how torn up I was last night, but I’m just really bitter about the whole deal. It seems so unfair.",False,True

Because honestly, I am sure she doesn't mean it this way, but it seems fucked up for her to openly binge and purge in front of you, knowing you're recovering from BED. It's also kind of tricky for one of you to be actively working at recovery from an ED and the other one to be just living with one.   I agree with the poster who said it's no walk in the park.

And let me tell you, you can't even undo a binge just through purging. You still absorb some of it even if you manage to get most of it out... Maybe focus on trying to restrict without binging. Bulimia is a express ticket to the hospital. It deteriorates your health much faster, and it took me a long time to stop purging and even then I still do sometimes.

I admittedly should have phrased the title a bit more precisely. This was sort of a feeling dump so forgive me for that.   Because I used to purge in the past, I’m not unaware of how unpleasant it is, but I am simply upset because I do still feel it would be nice to have the option to purge, especially in light of how the perceived consequences of bingeing sets back my recovery 10x over. For me the side effects of very infrequent purging would be worth it, I think, hence why I’m rather frustrated by my situation. If I could manage, I’d do neither. But one purge would do me wonders in stopping the subsequent spiral of binging (because the fact I cannot get rid of the calories leads to feeling out of control and incapable of regaining my footing in the days that follow).  I think a compounding factor is that my partner does not have any side effects besides the sore throat and enamel damage. Both of which suck and which I have experienced in the past. To me though, seeing her 2-3x a week routine is just triggering and upsetting. She doesn’t hide it at all. It’s hearing her brag as if her progress on the scale was the result of the same hard work and recovery mine was.  That’s all I guess. I lost the coping mechanism that allowed me to deal with the occasional binge, which has made it worse. And now I experience a constant in my face trigger.",False,True
