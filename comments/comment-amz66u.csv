They can cause tissue damage and restrict your breathing to the point of danger/permanent damage.  There are lots of chest binders made specifically for that (never use them when exercising though). Gc2b makes the best ones imo. Just dont use ace bandages!,False,False

The ballet moms always made little remarks while sewing a little extra in the costume, like thanks Im not crazy enough.  After I had my son they went up to a DD.  Gained weight stayed DD...Lost 50 pounds yup still a DD.  Our bodies do love to hold on to certain things :/    &amp;#x200B;  Hang in there!",False,False

I just want to achieve a specific sort of androgyny, i.e. I want to be basically flat with a straight-ish body shape. And somehow every single part of me is too big for that. My measurements are 31-21-34. I wear a 26D, which is the volume equivalent to a 32A, BUT because my rib cage is so small, I’m always self conscious and concerned that my breasts stick out on me like a sore thumb.   And then, even on days when I do feel like they look sufficiently small enough, I’m struck by how wide and fat my hips look, as I’m slightly pear shaped. I have broad-ish shoulders, which for the most part balance me out, but any time I really look at my hips in context with my bust, I basically want to cry.   There’s literally no winning.

My wife was a professional ballerina, now a ballet teacher, currently an MSc Physiology student.  She wears a 30C. Her breasts were fairly standard in the various companies she danced in - she was not pointed out as being any larger or smaller busted than others, nor did she herself notice this. She did not need different leotards or costumes.  Your breasts are normal. And as a lesbian, may I say in as non-creepy a way as possible, a lively handful.  Enjoy your ballet class. Enjoy your body.
