I had to talk to multiple different doctors to get a diagnosis and then my insurance denied me for treatment anyways. I feel like most people donâ€™t care unless your bmi is like 13 and they only care cause it makes THEM uncomfortable. ",False,False

While Iâ€™m underweight now (just barely), Iâ€™m near my highest weight and no one cares about my ED until I get noticeably underweight, like near my lowest which wasnâ€™t even that low. I feel like such a fraud because I only lost 9 pounds from my pre-ED weight to my LW (I was already UW before my ED) while it seems like most people with EDs lose at least 20 pounds and have to go inpatient. Iâ€™ve never been sick enough to need treatment aside from seeing a dietician and therapist for a few months until my parents decided I was well enough. It sucks to not be validated, Iâ€™m so sorry ðŸ˜•",False,False
