Lol. But seriously.. Sounds like he got his own ED issue and is using veganism as a cover. I mean I don't see what IF got to do with being vegan. Concentrate on you. If all else fails, kick his ass to the curb.",False,False

I've been telling a (vegan) friend of mine that I wanted to become vegan too, and after I told her about the good ol' ED, she was instantly like, ""uh no? that would be restricting your food intake even more when you already have a shitty relationship with it, stay away."" Support is always the most important thing, I felt infinitely better after that",False,False

My wife recently went vegetarian, and although she isn’t saying anything like that to me, she did ask at one point if I might want to go vegetarian with her.  I said no, but my immediate internal dialogue was like, “I should say yes and then apply guilt anytime I eat anything but a vegetable,” and even just that was something I didn’t get out of my head for a few days",False,False

Changes in lifestyle can really impact a relationship a lot, so make sure to talk it out with him.  Also coming from a long term vegan - I was extremely preachy in the beginning and refused to even see animal products around me. After a few months I got more relaxed and I simply state some facts if people ask me to, but I never try and convince anyone I am right or disregard their dietary choices.   What this means - he might become less militant after some time, but you not speaking up for the time being isn’t a good idea. Telling him how that makes you feel and that you respecting his new diet means he should mutually respect yours.  If you are willing and interested in compromise try finding safe foods that you both can eat or cooking simple meals/going out to eat at a vegan place staring once a week? But only do this if you are comfortable and he will accept that this won’t turn you vegan overnight.  Good luck :)",False,False

I’m sure he doesn’t understand how this is triggering, and I don’t think he’ll get it overnight, but he’s gotta manage this behavior like right now.",False,False
