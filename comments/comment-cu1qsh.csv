I‚Äôve since yo-yo‚Äôd around and am at a lower bmi now but I‚Äôm pretty sure I would get it if I stopped taking my birth control because according to a metric fuckton of tests my doctor made me get recently, I‚Äôm perfectly healthy aside from being underweight.   Just for anybody who is beating themselves up about ‚Äúnot being skinny enough‚Äù to lose theirs.",False,False

All bodies are different. Some will stop having periods before someone reaches an underweight BMI. A lot of time it comes down to nutrition and vitamins/minerals. If anything it means you're not anemic - and people can be very very very dangerously thin, and still not be anemic (not common, but possible). Personally I'd love to be extremely thin without any of the negative health consequences associated with low BMI (hair loss, lanugo, anemia, etc).   If anything I see it as a plus. Like I'm able to be ""dangerously"" thin without bearing the brunt of some more serious health complications related to EDs. I also don't want kids, but I'd probably be somewhat scared straight if I lost my period, because no period = major nutritional deficiencies.",False,False

I think I've royally fucked up my cycle because I've been bleeding for a straight month. Mostly light and spotty, but the last week has been heavier. It's quite annoying. I wish it would go away. I don't want kids. I don't need this shit.",False,False

My uterus just keeps on trucking ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è. The first one after the skipped one was AWFUL though. Like 9 days and about half were heavy (usually 5 and maybe 2 heavy). Bodies are weird. Maybe mine sticks around regardless because I've had kids?,False,False

When my period first returned after weight restoration I was still very thin, like barely above 18.5 BMI. Then it disappeared again even though I kept gaining weight. Then it came back again at like BMI 23 for about a year. Now I‚Äôm still approximately there (went through a slight loss period but I was still getting it throughout that, now I‚Äôve gained...), and it‚Äôs gone again? Makes no sense. Maybe it‚Äôs stress, idk. But yeah I remember very clearly that first period after like 4 years of not getting it, I cried my eyes out and was honestly terrified of tampons lol.   On one hand, getting it makes me happy that at least there‚Äôs one part of my body I haven‚Äôt fucked  up, and I‚Äôm lucky to not have super intense periods so it doesn‚Äôt affect me too much I guess. But on the other hand it just makes me feel super...idk, fertile and plump and disgusting lol.",False,False
