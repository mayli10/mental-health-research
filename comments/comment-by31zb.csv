I do the exact same thing - I either have to be totally empty or totally bursting. I appreciate so much the offer to be available - I will probably take you up on that!,False,True

Like any emotion other than like ""content"" and I feel the need to binge. And if I'm already having a bad day I will purge.  And I hate feeling full too. But binging/purging has messed up my body so that unless I'm so hungry I almost faint, I dont recognize it as hunger. And unless I'm so full I'm cramping and food is cing up on it's own, I dont recognize it as fullness. And then in binge phases I feel like I HAVE TO be 150% full at all times. And then at some point the feeling of heaviness and fatness is too much and I purge.  As to learning the consequences of our actions, kinda, yeah. Like we purge BECAUSE we know that our actions will cause weight gain if we do nothing about it. But the purging means it's more likely to happen again and usually more severely. So yeah we gotta kinda reteach our bodies how to eat, tbh. If you are ever struggling feel free to message me, it seems like we experience similar symptoms/emotions and maybe we have different tips to help cope that the other hasn't thought of",False,False

Zero shade - I just appreciate it.  I know you’re right. At various times in my life, I’ve successfully stopped binging or purging, but I’ve never stopped both at the same time! For about 18 months, I was doing a pretty good job at binging ~1x/week and purging it maybe once a month. Life events have contributed to my ramping up those numbers and purging almost every time.   I HATE the feeling of being full like that... I am already overweight and hate hate the idea of being fat without purging to fix it at least a little. For the past few months, it’s like I’ve forgotten every other coping mechanism I have, and now half of the one that works doesn’t even do it anymore.  Sorry you’re going through this process, too. Are you saying that we’ll eventually lessen our binges because we’ll learn the consequences of our actions? :p",False,True

So like, you already know the dangers and dont want to hear about it, that's okay. You know that the number one thing you need to work on is not purging. The wellbutrin will start to help with that. You already said that the binges arent enjoyable. Eventually, IF you put some work into ignoring the impulses, your urges to binge will lessen.  If you are binging less you will most likely be purging less. However, even if the binges dont stop, you just have to stop purging. It sucks. Its shit. But you have to force yourself to sit there and feel the pain of gorging yourself. Purging trains your body to interpret say, 2000 calories of food as 500 cause that's all it absorbs. If you sit there with your binge, your body will get all the calories and after a while you wont have such intense urges to binge because your body has readjusted to the amounts of food and the actual calories of those amounts.  I'm also undergoing that process and it really fucking sucks. Like sitting here right now after a binge, knowing I cant go purge cause it only makes the next binge bigger, is awful. My brain is screaming at me that I'm getting fatter. And theres nothing more terrifying than that.  But to stop the binges and purges, it's the process that has to be done.  Good luck &lt;3",False,False

Vyvanse is the ideal choice, but has no generic and is out of my price range as a college student self-supporting.  I was on and off Effexor (and Zoloft, for that matter) from ages 14-18, and maxed out twice. My doctor decided it doesn’t make sense to go down that route again.  I appreciate your other options, but like... I’ve been through it, meds-wise. If you do have other suggestions I am truly open to them.

If you’re at the max dose (450mg) and purging, your risk of seizures does increase pretty significantly. Not sure if it’s all MAOIs or just Wellbutrin, but docs will almost never prescribe Wellbutrin to those with a history of bulimia due to the risk.   If you’re under the max dose, seizure risk is not clinically significant, but doctors are def going to play it safe and just fully not prescribe in the case of bulimia.",False,True
