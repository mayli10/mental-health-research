You don't lack self control, you have the discipline and strength to wade through school and work and your own brain fighting against you. Sometimes you need to take a break to do nothing for anyone but yourself, sometimes your brain wants to enjoy food because it's nutritious and brings some measure of happiness when times are hard, and god that's understandable.   Take care of yourself, weight loss shouldn't be a top priority right now, your health should be. Wear some comfy clothes and make or buy yourself a meal you know you'll eat slowly and appreciate, watch a movie you know makes you laugh, take a long walk or drive, let yourself be sad if you need to, whatever you need right now. You've been through a lot.   Best of luck with everything! I hope things start to go your way!",False,False
