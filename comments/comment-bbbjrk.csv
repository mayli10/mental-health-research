Never has. It takes significant effort on my part to keep his weight up. I finally fed him enough to get him to a healthy weight and now he‚Äôs lost weight again.   He was telling me the other day ‚ÄúI have a significant breakfast, a yogurt &amp; a banana‚Äù and I told him nah... that‚Äôs like 150+110 calories depending on the size of the banana. That‚Äôs what led to this post. I literally just know that calories right off the top of my head like a fucking food encyclopedia",False,True

You can never know to what degree the water content is affecting the weight of these these, and so weighing them is kinda moot. Just to illustrate, weigh a piece of bread before and after you toast it. It‚Äôs gonna weigh much less after toasting, but the calories are the same. But even before something like toasting, the water content can be variable (and tbh water is heavy), and this can affect the weight of the item in relation to the serving size weight on the package.",False,False
