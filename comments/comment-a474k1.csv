Like others said, you can expect some water weight and that’s due to more food in your system in the digestive process, and you won’t gain fat/muscle/etc. from it. But since you don’t have a scale you probably won’t notice so it’s all good!",False,False

I’ve googled the depths of the internet trying to find just one other person say that they increased without gaining because of “starvation mode” thank you lol ,False,True

It took me a while to believe that but eventually I was eating 1600 calories a day and maintaining consistently after gradually bumping up by a hundred or so calories every few days. That was starting at 600, and I maintained for a couple years with no issues.",False,False

I’m just worried about the whole metabolic damage stuff (even though it’s impossible I feel like my body has suddenly decided 500 is the max before weight gain) since it’s been so long since my body has had more than that,False,True
