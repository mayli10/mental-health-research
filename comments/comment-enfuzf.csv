I think it's something we can all work through however, and I'm wishing you the best. It's all self destructive behavior fueled by our own negative mental states, and when it's you vs your self it can be a hard battle. I'm writing this on an Adderall withdrawal right now because talking with others makes me want the better for myself, so hopefully you can find something that works for you too. It's ok to relapse, cause shit happens, but only as long as you can find the strength to continue fighting on again.
