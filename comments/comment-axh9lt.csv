If your boss caught you drinking a no sugar monster would you be written up? Fired? I feel like this is something that you should speak with a human resources employee. I doubt any company can enforce what an employee consumes at work unless you work at the counter of a health food store or something.   Unless you work in a state that doesnt require reasonable cause for termination I just feel so confused over this bizarre enforcement. Would they write you up? And on it say ‚Äúthey wouldnt stop drinking sugar free red bull‚Äù this is so ridiculous i cannot take a rule like that seriously.  Id say challenge authority and continue on, speak to hr about it, or just sneak them in. Its bullshit the whole thing.    Also what about just a regular monster or coke? Those are allowed? What about coffee? Fucking..bubble tea? Im getting mad thinking about this lol",False,False

Diet soda doesn't have any more chemicals than other factory food products. I'm drinking a can of Coke Zero right now according to the ingredients listed it actually seems like a healthier choice than a lot of the other drinks I've had in the past. Something nice about it is that a lot of the ingredients are made of potassium, including potassium citrate which a bio-available form of potassium that you can buy a powder supplement to help meet your daily needs. I read that over 90% of Americans don't get enough potassium in their diet, so it's definitely important to get as much as you can. ^(()*^(For the record, bananas are #1 on any list of foods high in potassium and yet eating 2.5 bananas only accounts for 22% of your potassium needs. Most foods are very low on potassium. In a meal plan I made recently I also needed 2 meal replacement shakes, 2 servings of potassium citrate powder, and a cup of carrots to reach almost enough potassium.)*^()) I don't believe Coke Zero actually has enough potassium in it to make a noticeable difference to your health, but these people clearly don't know what they're talking about, so it would be reasonable to assume they might fall for it if you presented that information. In reality the only reason companies present ingredients by their chemical names is to protect their recipes. Since they order ingredients from most to least it wouldn't be hard to figure out what everything was if they used the more common names a lot of ingredients have. As an example, just off the top of my head, most people don't know what ascorbic acid is. If you google it you'll immediately find out it's a form of vitamin C that a lot of products use as an additive. People might read acid and think it's unhealthy though. If you spent enough time reading up on things like this you could probably compile a huge list of things that sound like dangerous chemicals which are actually just completely ordinary things our bodies actually need to function properly.",False,False

Balance and moderation are a part of health- so I‚Äôd send them a list of things/get research about:   (1) research on how caffeine has thermogenic and appetite suppressing effects  (2) how sweeteners like aspartame are only neurotoxins etc in INSANELY high amounts  (3) how setting up strict standards and expectations only increases the likelihood of weight gain, and unhealthy eating habits  (4) how moderation and balance are key- eating one cookie at the office isn‚Äôt going to make you horribly unhealthy, and if anything the stress of feeling deprived is (IMHO) worse than just eating one damn cookie  (5) how your personal life and health are only their business if it impedes with your ability to do your job; if you pass the physical and fitness tests, they have no right to think about or intrude on your diet  (6) that energy - the energy they would spend trying to police peoples food (fucking insanity if you ask me) would be better spent having a weekly cooking class or some BS incentive program; banning what you can bring to the office doesn‚Äôt ban what you can have out for dinner or in the comfort of your own home.
