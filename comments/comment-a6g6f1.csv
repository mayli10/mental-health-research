I'm in a teaching program (if I stay in it, I'll graduate with my biochem degree as well as a teaching cert) and there's about 25 - 30 people per class in the classes for the program, so the profs know us really well, esp since attendance is required. I missed 3 classes in a row for one course (1.5 weeks) because I've been falling apart and the prof literally emailed because she was worried about me. Granted, I emailed her earlier in the semester when I missed a few classes because of mental health reasons, but still, I felt so bad about it? And I was so anxious, I never responded to the email. She was my favorite prof and it was my favorite class this semester and I just felt particularly bad about missing her class. Ugh.  Best of luck to you as well. This shit sucks.",False,True

I also failed a couple of finals and I’m just crossing my fingers I pass everything. I wish I could express to my professors how sorry I am and that I don’t mean to be a bad student, it’s just so hard when to be honest having an ED is like having a whole second class schedule. It takes up so much time and energy and when you fail at ED things it hurts just as much as actual school. Best of luck and I hope things go better for you in the future. ",False,False
