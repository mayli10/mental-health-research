Oreos are a great example of a good with half calories from fat and half from carbs. It is how dieticians get underweight kids to gain weight. Your body burns through the carbs first and then stores the fat for later. ,False,False

There are lots of different body types.  It may be easy for you to gain weight or it could be really difficult.  For me, it takes a week of increasing calories to gain.  But my boyfriend has been eating as much as he can every day for 4 months and hasn’t gained a pound (it’s very upsetting for him).  I don’t have advice but some budget friendly ideas are honestly McDonald’s, Taco Bell, and just those fast food places that have a lot of calories packed into small meals.",False,False

Chocolate chip muffins with peanut butter on them. I gained ~17 lbs this winter pretty much on those alone. Big bowls of cheesy-creamy pasta will also help. As will pierogis with full fat sour cream. ,False,False

You’d want to focus on naturally calorically dense options.     Avocado Salmon Eggs Healthy oils like olive, avocado, walnut, coconut Nuts -cashews, almonds, walnuts, macadamias, etc Fruits- don’t make them the focus of your calorie intake (like less than 30% of food) but you have pretty much free range over which ones you want to eat  Dairy products - cottage cheese, cheese in general  ",False,False

For gains choose one you like the most so you’re motivated to eat more of it. My fav was always special K. I think unsugared cereal and low-fat milk are actually better for weight gain tbh, because they’re less satisfying. If you want to gain weight go low fat. Ironically I learned this when I was trying to lose weight, very early in my ED I went through a phase where fat was a fear food, but without fat ime the appetite is insatiable. More recently my relapse was due to eating too much fat (like 45-50%) it’s so filling I could only eat 5 or 6 mouthfuls before I was full up. My dietician advised me to increase carbs and I did this and my weight went up.",False,False

It seems balanced meals and healthy lifestyle are key to long term weight management whether to gain or lose weight. ,False,False

Sadly I don't own a blender (though I've been wanting to get one), but whole cream milk + cereal is something I can definitely get done.  What type of cereal do you recommend?
