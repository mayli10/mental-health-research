Our society is SO ingrained in diet culture that for others theyâ€™re automatically conditioned to praise others for losing weight. But they donâ€™t know the extremes youâ€™re going to or the mental distress youâ€™re in. If you base your recovery or relapse on others, youâ€™ll be entirely contingent to the whims and often-incorrect beliefs of everyone. You know youâ€™re sick. You know youâ€™re valid. WE know youâ€™re valid. Donâ€™t listen to them ðŸ’—",False,False

I feel fine and I feel like I'm not thin enough or sick enough to stop. No one irl thinks I have an ED. They all praised me for my weight loss. I feel like nothing is wrong with me, I'm just okay. Idk why I suddenly feel this way",False,True

I think most people feel or have felt the same way. When I was inpatient I was crying and talking about how I didn't need to be there bc I wasn't thin (which... body dysmorphia) and my clinician told me that most people in the unit had the same conversation with her.,False,False
