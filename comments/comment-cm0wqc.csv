If I eat at or over my TDEE at all, I think about the fact i'm not losing, or will gain a fraction of a pound. The fact I don't know my TDEE for sure makes it even worse, cause I'll never know if my maintenance is 1500 or 2000 because there's no info on TDEE in transgender people after hormone therapy.",False,False

Like, I used to buy the light yogurts with 70 something calories and I started to up it until I was eating ones with a granola topping at 180 calories.    I deal with it, and eating in general, by eating something that isn't a ""safe"" food, but also not something I wouldn't touch with a bargepole at the mo.  It makes me anxious and guilty BUT then I tell myself, oh well, it's done now.  It helps.  When I had CBT for other anxiety symptoms YEARS ago I tried the elastic band on my wrist thing where I snap it a bit onto my skin and say STOP.  It's kind of like that.  When I say, it's done now, it's almost like telling myself, okay you've eaten, no point thinking about it any more.  It actually does help if you do it enough times.  I also know 1800 cals sounds a lot to you, but it really isn't.  I've just got back from a 6 day break by the sea.  No scales, couldn't buy from my usual supermarket, a hideous mirror in my room that makes everyone look larger than they are, ate some things I wouldn't usually (sugar free licorice and hard candy).  I weighed myself as soon as I came home (sad, huh), and I hadn't gained.  Weight exactly as it was when I left.  I maintain, but I'd prepared myself (and was prety much okay with, the thought of maybe gaining a couple of pounds, but nope.  And I felt I'd eaten loads (hadn't really).  I didn't feel guilty though because I told myself it was okay to eat unfamiliar things and have those treats.  tl;dr  It's difficult, but tell yourself there's no need to feel guilty for eating less than what's the daily intake of most people who aren't eating disordered.  Tell the part of yourself that's being harsh (your ed) that you refuse to give it the ability to make you feel guilty every damn time you eat.    It really is okay to eat.  It's as natural as sleeping and there's no reason to feel guilty about getting some sleep.  x",False,False

Your body is going to cling to every calorie it takes in when you undereat and it's built to adjust for variances in calorie consumption from day to day. I have anorexia, but I have never counted calories because it just becomes an obsession and in reality, most calories are not accurate so it doesn't matter as much as you think. Eating 1,800 is still probably less than what you need. My therapist always tells me that our bodies are built to adjust. Maybe you are extremely hungry one day, so you eat 3,000 calories, but then you aren't nearly as hungry the next day so you eat closer to 2,000 calories. Our bodies have hunger and satiety signals for a reason. Everything evens out in the end.",False,False
