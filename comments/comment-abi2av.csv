I hit lower than my gw and lost my period then binged for two months straight. ,False,False

For now I've given up on the concept of bulking and am just going to do fasted workouts. If I'm going to get even heavier I might as well shoot myself. It doesn't help that everyone around me gives me shit for the way I look.,False,False

I kept telling myself that I was ""bulking"" so I'd eat like an asshole and then be too stuffed to lift, but tell myself I'd put those calories to good use tomorrow but then tomorrow I'd freak TF out about how many calories I ate the day before and would do 2 hours of repentance/cardio which would increase my sugar cravings.....  Repeat that for months and here I am - 15 pounds of pure fat heavier than I was on Jan 1 2017.   I am just thankful that I didn't put on MORE than that.   Could be much worse!",False,False

I'm gonna be honest, it's not gonna look great on paper. but that's the thing. on paper, things tend to seem worse sometimes.   the best thing you can do is put away your scale for a bit (if you can) and just focus in getting back into a more stable mindset. the holidays are over, so if that's been a trigger, celebrate, it's over! try to get out and do things if the weather permits, take up a new hobby, and most importantly, don't stress! on paper it might look ""ruined"" but stay calm, and you'll get back to where you're comfortable before you know it ♥️ we can do it!
