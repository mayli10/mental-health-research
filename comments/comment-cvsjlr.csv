Biologically, the water is a reactant in a process called hydrolysis, where polysaccharides are broken down into monosaccharides and disaccharides (english: water breaks down the big carbs into smaller, digestible carbs) if you donâ€™t do it you get constipated along with some other stuff.  Green tea helps with inflammation. Napping will also make you feel better.",False,False

I've been there and I dont even want to put liquids in me but when I've made an extra effort to drink water all day I noticed less bloat and even clearer skin.   If you still feel bloated simethicone (gas x) really helps with bloat. It's not something that makes you poop or flushes you out so its perfectly healthy to take.",False,False
