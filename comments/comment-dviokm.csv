It does get harder to lose the less you weigh though. And there are a number of health conditions which can impact metabolism. I mean, I am stuck at 108 lbs right now, but I have been lower before. I was healthier last time I lost weight though. And I am eating more than I did last time I weighed less. I'm sure that eventually as I manage to stop being sick my weight will probably drop very suddenly.",False,False

It‚Äôs very common that it‚Äôll start storing the fat in the midsection/stomach more than other areas.   It does balance out after a few months, though. But Recovery Belly is a thing.",False,False

I saw that kind of stuff as an anorexic middle schooler, and it made me feel like I was doomed and might as well just go full steam ahead. Feeling like my metabolism was already permanently screwed, and that if I ever tried to eat well again I'd probably just gain and gain weight, led me to conclude that starving was literally my only option not just to lose weight, but to maintain a normal weight. For the rest my life.  This is not true. But the thought of it haunted me for years.",False,False

You cannot ‚Äúdamage‚Äù it to the point where your body stop burning this set amount of energy (calories) to function. Having less body weight *will* effect your BMR/TDEE to a point- but nothing more dramatic than maybe a hundred or so calories than a ‚Äúhealthy‚Äù weight.   However, your body will store fat differently when you‚Äôre in recovery for a while and hold onto water *much* more than it did before. Once you start eating, hunger cues go into overdrive as well and you do tend to crave things naturally higher in calorie and that take less energy to convert to energy- fats and carbs. Your digestive system is going to react, as well, so gas will also be an issue with bloating and ghostweight, as well as not processing food very well at all which adds to feces build up and ‚Äúwasted‚Äù calories. This is where things get inefficient, but again- not to the point that you‚Äôll have to eat 200 calories to lose 0.0003 pounds a week. Your metabolism will maybe, *maybe* be effected to the point of your TDEE/BMR dropping by like. 50 calories.",False,False
