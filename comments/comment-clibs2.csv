I want to send you flowers or something. You've managed to clear up so many things in your message that I've been refusing to acknowledge. I don't even know where to begin, everything you've said is so helpful and honest and true... it really (without trying to sound corny) has helped me feel seen and understood. I talked a bit to my boyfriend this morning and he said I beat myself up too much about everything as well, which he's said before but after reading your message I understand it more now. I'll try to do these things... it's daunting to start when you've been accustomed to talking down to yourself your whole life.",False,True

And no one mentions how you can absolutely believe abortion was the right choice, but still be broken about it. I think it’s a subject pro-choice people are reluctant to broach for fear of anti-abortion activists latching onto these stories as proof that abortion is bad. But I think they do a disservice to women when PP on their pamphlets say the number one feeling women have when they get one is relief. No woman I’ve met who has spoken about getting one irl, didn’t have some kind of negative feelings after the fact. It’s not talked about so you’re left with shame that you’re not coping with it as well as you think you should. Personally, after thinking about it, I think it’s good that I felt sad about it. I ended a life inside of me. It was my right and privilege as a female human to be the arbiter of life and the future of the species to do so. Female mammals abort and reabsorb their fetuses and even kill their newborn young, if conditions aren’t right for them allll the time. That doesn’t mean I cannot mourn and recognize the significance of what I did; I extinguished an entire universe of possibility. This doesn’t make me a murderer, it’s not something I should let myself feel guilt for. But I did have to let myself mourn to come out on the other side. Pushing it down and trying to pretend I’m okay was not working for me. Abusing myself and feeling guilt wasn’t either. Allowing myself the recognize that the right choice is often hard to endure is the only thing that did. I am confident you will come out on the other side of it and not feel wrecked up inside.   As for the mental self-abuse being the only thing to motivate you, I can relate hard. I still struggle with how the only way I can get myself to do anything sometimes is by mentally abusing myself. I was in denial and told myself that I was practicing tough love on my lazy ass. But there’s absolutely no love in it. Self-hate can definitely fuel you, but it’s toxic bad fuel and it will eventually corrode your sense of self away. What you describe as “laziness” is more likely a case of executive dysfunction from an untreated mental illness. When learn to manage your condition, it becomes so much easier to get shit done. When you are kind to yourself, you do the things you should, because you are not actively self-destructing. Take exercise for example. Exercise is GOOD and should FEEL good. However the way you’re motivating yourself to exercise is self-flagellation, so you’re not trying to do good for yourself, you’re punishing yourself with a run for being worthless or whatever you tell yourself to make yourself do it. I would try out different forms of exercise. I hated running and had to hate myself enough to actually go through with it. Rollerblading though? I’ll get home from work and think “it’s so nice and I have so much daylight left, I should go for a blade” and it’s great. You NEED exercise to function as a human and everyone feels this need manifest in different ways. For me, I get this nervous energy. On really hard days, I’m filled with this anxiety but I’m also paralyzed by it and I can’t seem to make myself do ~anything.~ It used to be I’d beat myself up about it until I had a breakdown and end up doing something productive in this fit of rage with myself.  I try not to let myself get to that point. If I have that “stuck” feeling, I’m annoyed, but patiently explaining to my goblin brain that if I just do one small thing to get started, I can take it from there. I don’t let myself call myself any names or bullshit, I just say “hey you know you’d feel better if you went rollerblading. So let’s just start with going into the mud room and grabbing them.” And then basically coach myself through every tiny step until I’m out the door and I don’t need to anymore. This honestly made me feel like such a moron at first, but then I got into the habit of not calling myself names, and treating myself more kindly has helped motivate me so much more than abusing myself. I hope you found some of this relatable and applicable to your situation and you don’t feel alone.",False,False

It was definitely a no-brainer to seek out a termination, and even up until the day of,  I was quite calm about it. Even, at times, during the process (kind of see-sawing between zen and panic I guess). About a week later I plummeted to rock bottom and stayed there. I really appreciate you sharing your story too, I haven’t talked much about it to anyone I know here except my SO and I often feel like I’m exaggerating it because I have nothing else to compare it to. So thanks. It helps and I’m sorry you went through a similar thing too. It’s a very strange thing.  In regards to the self monitoring and social anxiety, while it obviously affects me in ways I don’t want, I’m worried about silencing it because it’s also the only way I keep myself disciplined with food and exercise. I’m a very lazy person at the end of the day and if I’m not constantly telling myself what a shitty disgusting person I am and how I don’t deserve to be around normal people, then I’m not also going out for a run.  Lol. Typing it out is helping me see more clearly how bizarrely fucked that is. I know your advice is good. I just feel like taking it is losing or something.",False,True

I never want kids so when I got pregnant, there’s no question of whether or not to get an abortion. I felt relieved after it was over, but I was also very, very sad. The sadness was confusing bc I was so miserable about being pregnant, why wasn’t I feeling so much better now that I’m not? Almost failed school because I couldn’t get out of bed. Took about 8 months to fully recover mentally and physically from it. I can’t imagine going through that while in a foreign country and battling legal issues at the same time. That would double the time at least it took to heal. You are doing great for someone in your situation, trust. You’ll come out of it and everything will be okay. You didn’t “waste” a whole year.   It sounds like you have some pretty bad social anxiety on top of things. I used to suffer from that really badly, and it comes back whenever I’m not taking care of myself. I can understand how exhausting it is to be constantly self-monitoring yourself. It really helps to write all the bad things you think about yourself, and then pretend it’s your best friend who wrote it about herself. Then next to it, you’d write what you’d say to your friend.   Example: “I am annoying and boring.” “If you were  so annoying and boring, how do you have a boyfriend. Doesn’t he tell you he loves you? Why would he love someone annoying? You have things that make you interesting.”   Then when you have responses to the stupid stuff your hell brain comes up with, you can argue with yourself. It’s exhausting and takes practice, but eventually, the voice that tells you that you’re fat, stupid, worthless, etc, will be quieter and will speak up less and less often.",False,False

But reading your response, saying that you *deserved what happened to you* broke my heart. Would you say that to your best friend, if they went through the terrible time you did?   It's not your fault what happened. Some bosses are assholes, and you were in a foreign country. Also, pregnancies happen. It doesn't make you a bad person to have one (especially when it was bad timing), and it definitely doesn't make you a bad person to have terminated it. You didn't make these shitty things happen to you. Please give yourself some slack, lovely internet person.",False,False

Reading it over, it truly is ridiculous. I'm baking so many cakes!! I'm really not getting any better at it and I don't even know how I picked up this hobby in the first place since I don't even like cake! Truly! Pastries, however... you have my attention. What varieties are you making? Can you send some express to Berlin? The ones I've had here are awful. TIA xxxxxx  I really appreciate you even reading this, let alone writing something back that's thoughtful and kind. I do see the situation objectively every now and again, and realise that it's a big thing to have gone through, but then my dumb brain chimes in almost instantly reminds me that I'm the idiot that got myself into that situation and I deserved what happened. It's pretty exhausting.  I like how you approach social situations. I want to do that. At the moment trying not to think about myself, as gross is it sounds, is virtually impossible for me to do in social situations. I can literally feel each awkward movement and hear individual sounds I'm making, so that's why I interact as little as possible. Up until last year I was the total opposite and this never happened, by the way. I was very social, people liked me, I generally liked them.",False,True

It did make me chuckle.   What happened is that you're in a tough spot and you had a very challenging, vulnerable year. Not many people would be able to handle such an event of instability like that. Having to terminate a pregnancy and enlist legal action, all while being in a foreign land? Please take a moment to realize what a badass you are for getting through that year, and coming out relatively on top by getting a new job and keeping a regular exercise schedule.   I have trouble with baking at home, too. As a pastry cook, you think I'd be able to make a damn cake at home but it always feels like I need to sacrifice my first born in the process. And, of course, no cake scraps can escape my cavernous maw. Baking a cake at home  means like a 1000% chance I'm eating cake for dinner and breakfast, and kicking off a festive binge cycle.    Also, social shit is HARD, dude. It took me forever to be comfortable enough around my SOs family/friends to where I was like 'eh, fuck it' because if they dont like me, I dont blame them lmao. But something I try to do often is not even think about myself at all. When im on the verge of getting self conscious, I redirect all my attention to the other person/people, and focus on making them feel seen and important. So even if they dont like me, I like them, and as long as I succeed at that I'm doin pretty good.",False,False
