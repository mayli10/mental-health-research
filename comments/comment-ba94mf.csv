I was on BC and the estrogen pushed me to be very hypothyroid and I started mass gaining weight due to intense water retention and slowed metabolism (but mostly the water).

I remember when I was put on seroquel years ago and looked up the side effects and it said it can be a contributor to developing diabetes (most likely from the sugar/carb cravings it gives you).   Mix that with unmedicated/uncontrolled insulin resistance (which I have) and you're basically asking to be hangry for carbs 24/7. I don't take Seroquel anymore despite still having prescriptions for it because I would probably gain 100lbs in 2 weeks. I was on Metformin but went off it years ago and have just tried to be as low carb as possible. I'm seriously considering going back on it despite the GI issues it gives me because I'm having issues with carb cravings ATM.,False,False
