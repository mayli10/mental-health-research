Ever since young I was conditioned to think thinner is better,  beautiful, feminine. Especially being from a country where feminisim wasnt around so much at the time when i was a kid there. And either im depressed and want to eat a lot or anxious and i cant eat, and even more frustrating when i cant eat i still am fat, and when i am eating i feel guilty and puke it all out. I simply cannot keep anything down or i feel like I've stabbed a binch of people and must repent. Knowing that i WILL throw up, makes me want to binge because well, I'm gonna puke it anyways right?  I am the ""lady of the house"" to a 4 bedroom that i havent cleaned in so long my pot i cooked mac and cheese in tuned into a crap smelling purple mold bog, and the only reason i ever got around to it was because im bipolar and had a mania episode that helped me get that much done.  Another familiar situation you mentioned is that did something stupid too. i moved across the country for a guy I thought would care about me (cali to DC). Left my job, even my kid. She was with their dad so I could go. And when i got there i realized not only did he not like me like he insisted he did, but also was talking to a bunch of girls all over the place and wasnt remotely as serious as he insisted at one point he was... the ones that were prettier, he'd do things for that he never bothered doing for me.  To really help with the ED, ofc he was only actually attracted to thinner women. Despite telling me it didnt matter to him and insisting me chubbs was ok with him in our early conversations.    I'm not a slender girl in the least at 5'5 and 180. But i was hoping to find a guy into chubbs or something that wouldnt really matter so much to add to my self hatred. i myself hate being fat, i abhor it. But i didnt need the extra ball busting thats for sure lol  At the very least I know not to ldr anymore.  I left everything for a temporary fix to feeling alone and depressed, for someone who made me feel way lonelier than i ever was alone.   Sorry you feel so poorly. I dont really have useful advice other than i hope you do better, and i wanting to let you know youre not alone. Sorry about the rant, but I know sometimes having someone in the same boat helped me confide and at least vent. Feel free to message me ever, if you ever need anything. I know easier said than done, but at least we can try.   *hugs* hope you do better lovely    ",False,False

There’s a light at the end of the tunnel though.  Have you tried group meetings? They are a little less intrusive than one on one counseling and it helps—for both depression and bulimia.  I had to cajole a friend into taking me to and from, and I don’t regret it at all.   Please don’t do anything stupid.    E-hugs. (&gt;O_O)&gt;",False,False
