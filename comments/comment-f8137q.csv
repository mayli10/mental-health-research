I broke down and told my boyfriend about 4 months into the relationship (he was absolutely oblivious despite the clear signs/weight loss) and he’s been nothing but supportive. He’s done his own research to learn more about it and he’s helped me a lot. He is happy for me when I’m doing well (eating a moderate, healthy amount of food and keeping it down) and is there for me when I am not doing well. He’s never judged me or tried to “fix” me. Your boyfriend may need some guidance on how to support you best but it’s worth telling him.",False,False

Do you think you could try to talk to him more/open up a little more about how bad the ED is? Obviously you don't need to go in guns-blazing with print-outs of body checks and a 20-page essay lmao, but just little comments or conversations here and there that help him realize what's going on for you? EDs are isolating enough, don't let this mental disorder cut your boyfriend out of your life.",False,False
