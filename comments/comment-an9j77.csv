Now I’m 26 and I feel a bit guilty and mad if I accidentally ate animal byproduct. But I only cook my own food. ,False,False

It’s my choice and belief. Don’t point it out and make fun to make yourself look “better” or “cooler.”  Sorry this is personal, I just hate this effing bitch who constantly brings up how being vegan is bad and I never even talk about it. I especially would never talk to them, knowing how annoying they are.   I’m in my states vegan/vegetarian group on fb and everyone seems friendly and nice. Just too many mushrooms in recipes, blegh.

I grew up in a vegetarian household and have never tried meat.  Personally, I’m always really anxious when people ask me about it. I’m not a confrontational person and I’d never want to impose my opinion. Because what do I know?   But it’s also an ideology I strongly believe in.  It’s in my values and it helped form who I am and what I determine as right or wrong in other areas of life.   I just wish people didn’t hate us so much. I know we have some bad seeds but that doesn’t make the whole garden bad. (Haha, vegetarian)   I don’t even like to tell people anymore, because every time I do they want to debate me and prove me wrong.   I wish people would respect it, the same way you would respect a Catholic or a Hindu. For me at least, it feels kinda like a very similar personal experience. I don’t mind talking about it at all, I’d love to share my opinions! But I feel like every time someone invites me to talk about it they just want to shut me down.   Not saying this is you! I’ve had this on my mind for awhile! You just gave me the opportunity to share my thoughts - so, thank you :) ",False,False
