Very few people irl know, I think some people who have known me for 30 years would be surprised. I love it when people see me eat and feel able to joke and call me “fat-ass”, because they obviously think it’s safe to make the joke as I’m so clearly super underweight and it confirms they have no idea about my ed (bc they wouldn’t make a joke like that if they did).  It’s so funny because it seems like many “normal” people would quite like to have the “glamorous/troubled” label, and for us it’s our most cringe secret. Haha.   And then there are those who think we do it for attention. Omg lol. Couldn’t be more wrong...",False,False
