Not 3 meals a day, but once it's past 3:00PM, the second I start getting even the slightest bit hungry for the first time I *have* to eat at least 200 cal or I'm convinced I'll binge",False,True

If I bring food I'll probably just eat it immediately anyway so might as well eat while I'm home and get it out of the way. The only reason I don't binge on outside food is because I don't bring cash or cards with me, lol. Otherwise you bet I'm going to be excitedly browsing the clearance shelf of a Sprouts for some ~healthy~ snacks. Even though I've only almost fainted from exhaustion maybe once this month, numb hands and legs and all while biking (with may have also been from the extreme heat), my brain is constantly scared lmao",False,False
