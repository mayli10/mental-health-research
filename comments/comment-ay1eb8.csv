When I was right at my UW goal, restricting wasn't even difficult for me anymore. I had little to no appetite, and when I did, it was for super light, low calorie, often healthy stuff. I gagged on a piece of pizza at one point because all I could taste was pure grease.   Then I started relaxing and trying my old favorites here and there and totally went back down the rabbit hole.   That's one of the scary things about EDs, I guess. We don't know what healthy moderation is. So we go hard one way or the other. ",False,False

I was convinced i didn't even like carby foods and sweets anymore, but once i reached my gw, i decided to relax my obsessive carb counting and the cravings came back with FURY.  So, congrats again, but be aware that once you're at gw and start relaxing, things could get hairy :)",False,False
