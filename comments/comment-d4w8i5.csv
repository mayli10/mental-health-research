I was supposed to do PHP and I know theres a huge variety in that group, even a boy. Insurance didnt want to cover anything so IOP is a compromise and I'm still nervous about it.  I'm there to get better but I'm also terrified no one will like me.",False,True

Contrary to stereotypes, eds effect a range of people. You also 100% won't be the only person who isn't underweight. Again, eds effect a wide variety of body types.",False,False

There are seventy year olds in my program and always have been.   I think everyone thinks that everyone else is going to think one way or another about them because of their weight, but a lot more people are normal weight or higher in these programs than are actually underweight. I thought I was going to be the biggest one there when I enrolled in my program and ended up being the thinnest (Also ended up being hospitalized within a week but that's a whole other story).  I hope that IOP is able to help you. It's really hard but it's so worth it.",False,False
