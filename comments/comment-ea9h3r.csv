Like...what? Either way,it is fucking me up hardcore. Like I feel he never listens to me and doesn't understand me at all. I got diagnosed with bpd. And once broke down crying for no reason. He asked why I was like this. Its like dude I have bpd, you know, why the fuck wouldn't you do research on it? If you love me, why the fuck not? Sorry. Just very very upset right now.",False,True

Two years is a long time for someone to remember a small talk that never got talked about again or explained fully. More than likely he just wanted to send you a treat. Maybe now would be a good time to have that in depth talk so you don't spiral in the future. If you don't want them throw them away, Give them to a work friend, your postal carrier as a gift or whatever.",False,False
