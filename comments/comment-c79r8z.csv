Youâ€™re right, I was talking about kpop. I have a really strong love-hate relationship with it because I enjoy the music and the community but constantly seeing only beautiful, skinny people everywhere is triggering just like you said. Thinking about it now, do you happen to know any groups on here that specifically discuss how south korean media affects them?",False,True

I really enjoy k-dramas and it triggers the fuck out of me, consistently watching always makes me eat less, and feel worse about myself.",False,False
