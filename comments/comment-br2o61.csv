He was in the bathroom when I arrived and while I was waiting for him to come to the door I trusted a fart and just straight up shit myself on the doorstep. He came down and let me in and went back to finish showering and for some reason I didn't tell him, I just went to the other bathroom and cleaned myself up (super luckily I had a spare pair of jeans and underwear). I then had to wait for him to finish in the shower before saying ""oh hey, I have a plastic bag full of shit covered clothes, can I stick them in the washing machine?"" Luckily he was great about it, but I haven't taken them since even when I've needed to because I get mortified at the thought.",False,False

I was wearing light grey leggings at the time and had to panic waddle to the womens restroom (conveniently located on the other side of the gym as the treadmills).
