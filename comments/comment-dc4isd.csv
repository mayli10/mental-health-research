I know it hurts but never be anyone's second choice cause it's not worth the pain and hurt you'll feel. You need to take care of yourself first above all else. Also anyone who apologises using the excuse of they were drunk is lying. Drinking makes you more honest in my opinion because it takes away your inhibitions and guilt that stops most sober people from acting on what they really want to say or do. Also he said he was trying to hurt you? Wtf? A partner should never try to intentionally hurt the other one in such a malicious way. I'm really sorry this is happening to you but you need to leave and move on from him. He doesn't deserve you and he's overall an ass.,False,False

Every. Day. I tried not to let him know which made me cry more. Each time I accepted it was done I cried more and more. It took me physically not being around him that I knew I could breathe and quit the second guessing; then the crying stopped. Don’t get me wrong the memory still hurts but honestly I think I rather live happy with myself than unhappy trying to measure up to someone’s idea of a person they once loved.",False,False

I’m always the second choice no matter what I do/accomplish/look like for some reason it doesn’t measure up... I can tell you this though you’ve probably been someone’s first choice this whole time you just might not have had the chance to explore it. I broke free from my 3+ year relationship and ended up with the guy I always crushed on turns out he’s had a crush on me all 5 years of him knowing me.,False,False
