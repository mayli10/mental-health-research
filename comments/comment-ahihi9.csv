She orders a burger with fries and ranch dressing.  I order grilled chicken salad. ‚ÄúWell now I feel bad about eating a burger. Why didn‚Äôt you order first? Why didn‚Äôt you tell me you were going to eat healthy today?‚Äù It gives me so much anxiety I have ordered and pretended to eat (and maybe sometimes have even eaten) things I didn‚Äôt want to just to not ‚Äúguilt‚Äù her.

One time that sticks out was when my little cousin was visiting in the summer. She's also into several lean build sports, and underweight. At a family dinner, I noticed she was looking at me and my lack of dessert. Thing was, I'd actually eaten maintenance that day at 2700 calories. But she had no way of knowing that; all she saw was that I was abstaining from the cake. I felt super self conscious, and the next day when I took her out shopping, I made sure to find a way to bring up the huge pot of oatmeal with protein powder and peanut butter I'd had for breakfast. And I took her to subway for lunch, because I figured that was bound to be at least safe-ish for her. :p ",False,True

If I was going to eat something but then realised I was the only one, or I saw someone thinner than me not eating I would absolutely change my mind and not eat, because i‚Äôd feel like they‚Äôd be judging me for being greedy and disgusting.
