I’m leadership team so I have to be v v careful with showing symptoms lmao. Propel makes powder and I put like 4 of those in my water jug. Also coffee/monster zero. Take vitamins!! U can also take those little salt packets from restaurants and take a pinch or two of salt if you feel really bad/dizzy (salt raises blood pressure and keeps you from passing out for a little bit) I also take naproxen sodium before rehearsal and that helps with pain/inflammation. Don’t do extended fasts, it’s not worth it. Prioritize sleep and protein. Stay safe please!!",False,False
