Even if I just eat one bite I’m like surely that was at least 50 cals.. but that’s probably too low so should probably make it 100. But that could have been a big bite.. maybe 150-200. Then I realize my whole day is fucked,False,False

My SO was so pissed Sunday bc I wouldn’t try even a bite of the breakfast tacos he made for cinco de Mayo. Then he got even more pissed bc I ended up eating lunch (the same thing I eat every day... low cal &amp; I know exactly how many cals) but wouldn’t eat his breakfast tacos  I’ve already been eating too much &amp; gaining weight. I’ve been so stressed about it. I definitely wasn’t going to eat his tacos when I had 0 idea what the calories were,False,False
