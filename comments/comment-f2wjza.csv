Make your bed, call a relative, find a hobby, dress up for no one but yourself, just sit outside and breathe some fresh air. If you can convince yourself to work out, it'll help you feel tons better because of the endorphins that you're going to get from it. Maybe go on a short walk, sure make sure to eat a little bit more afterwards since it does burn calories. I find that I feel a lot better after I take a walk or exercise. Make your favorite food, learn something new. Something that will help is counting down from 5 to 1 in your head when you don't feel like doing something. Every morning I wake up, I count down and find that it helps me avoid laziness and forces me to get out of bed. You've got this. It's not easy by any means, but I believe in you",False,False
