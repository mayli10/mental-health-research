And the media! For giving the idea that if you have anorexia, or any ED tbh, you'd have to be dangerously underweight. It's easy to internalise shit like that and I think lots of us struggle with that. So sorry that you're through it :(  But EDs are *mental* illnesses that have wayyy more to do with your relationship with food, your relationship with yourself, control issues, etc etc than how much you weigh. Please please don't think that you *need* to reach a certain weight and and further the AN so you can be valid :( you don't need to be ""skinny enough""; pain is pain.   And recovery is what you absolutely need and deserve! It doesn't mean that you lied to yourself about being sick. It doesn't erase the fact that you have been - and are still - struggling with the illness. It just means that you are trying to pull yourself out of it, which is a  brave and wonderful thing to do, and will help with your long-term wellbeing far more than AN ever can.  Lots of love &lt;333",False,False
