I made a post on Anonymemes about this exact thing lmao. My dysphoria ED overlap is so overt it's almost one in the same. At this point my attention is completely on body shape than weight. I mean yeah it's still there the whole ""you're fat, you weigh too much, you're ugly etc etc etc"" but it's mooooore like ""you got too much curve, your face is too round, hide your goddamn body shape!"" Fun times, huh? ",False,False

The shitty thing is that on E the fat does not *only* go to your hips and breasts. Love handles and batwings are real things when gaining weight. Also genetics still play a large role; I've always been like my mum even before hormones and when my ma loses weight, it shows on her face first. Same for me. Even at BMI 20 my cheeks will start looking hollow. I can't be 'pretty underweight' like Natalie Portman in Black Swan, with a tiny, bony body but magnificent cheeks. ",False,False
