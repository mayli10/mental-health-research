They have all different kinds, but my personal favorites are the baked cinnamon apple and the peach cobbler. They also have a dessert line with teas like butterscotch blondie and glazed lemon loaf which are AMAZING at satisfying that sweet craving. This sounds like a sponsorship lmao    Anyways they have all different kinds (green, black, etc) and it gives you the caffeine level on each box too.",False,False

White tea, Green tea, and Black tea are all real tea (like made from tea leaves). These are the caffeinated teas. Everything else is herbal tea, and it does not have caffeine (unless they add it in).  White tea is young tea. it has very little caffeine and very mild flavor. It's my favourite ""real"" tea. Green tea is more mature. it's got lots of good properties BUT it is easy to oversteep and it tastes like dirt/grass/mowed lawn if your oversteep it. it has a mild amount of caffeine.  Black tea is the most mature and has a strong, bold flavor. It also has the most caffeine. This would be the best replacement for coffee, but it doesn't have all the magic properties of green tea. Chai tea is spiced black tea, btw, and it's extremely delicious with milk.  So that's tea tea. The true ""tea"" drink. But imo, herbal teas are where it's at. MY favourite is mint. peppermint or spearmint. it aids in digestion and feels good on the stomach. Dandelion tea has a slight diuretic effect so I sometimes drink it when I'm bloated.  Some teas are best plain, and others taste best with a little sweetener or a little milk (seriously, chai with milk &gt;&gt;&gt; chai without milk) so don't be afraid to prepare your teas differently if you're not feeling them the first time you try it.",False,False

I particularly like Ceylon, Darjeeling, and oolong.    Ceylon and Darjeeling are each named for the region in which they‚Äôre produced (Sri Lanka was formerly known as Ceylon and Darjeeling is a region in India.). Their origin accounts for the difference in taste, but they are very similar, with the former being stronger and the latter sometimes referred to as the ‚Äòchampagne of teas‚Äô.  They‚Äôre both good with fresh berries or cake if I‚Äôm feeling brave.  Oolong technically isn‚Äôt a black tea, but a category on its own.  (All tea comes from the same plant.  Anything else is an infusion.)  The more oxidized and fermented the leaves are, the darker and stronger the flavor.  Oolong falls somewhere between green and black on that scale.  Tastes a bit earthy and I think it‚Äôs best with dinner or something savory.  I never sweeten mine just because I prefer it that way.  *Don‚Äôt buy store brand tea.  You don‚Äôt need anything expensive, but store brand tea isn‚Äôt nearly as good.  I‚Äôd recommend loose leaf instead of tea bags.  Approximately one teaspoon per cup.  Add a teaspoon of leaves ‚Äòfor the pot‚Äô if you‚Äôre making a large amount and extra if you plan on cooling it and drinking it iced.  Tea is typically steeped for 3-5 minutes depending on preference.  The water should be very hot, but not boiling.*  For loose leaf teas, you can strain the leaves out, buy an infuser, or use refillable keurig pods.  If you want, add lemon, sweetener, lavender essence, etc.  Some good infusion flavors are chamomile, anise, and lemongrass.  Those are good if you want to have something relaxing without the caffeine.  Chai lattes are amazing, but it‚Äôs hard to find a good chai tea that‚Äôs not in liquid concentrate form.  Chai is black tea with spices such as ginger, cloves, cinnamon, black pepper, etc.  Tastes great with milk and brown sugar.  Sorry for the ramble.  Can you tell I‚Äôm obsessed?",False,False

Some people who think they hate green tea are actually drinking burned or overstepped tea.  Brewing 101:  Black tea has the most caffeiene. Boil water for black tea and steep 4-6 minutes.  Green tea also has a lot of caffeine, but it is metabolized differently from black tea so it may affect you differently. The water should be around 76 (170) degrees for green tea and brewed for 2-4 minutes.   Rooibos can be added to boiling water and steeped for 5-10 minutes.  Oolong tea should be 88 (190) degrees and steeped five minutes or more.  White tea should be 76 (170) degrees and steeped 1-3 minutes. The flavor is usually very light.   Herbal tea has no caffeine. Boil water and steep indefinitely. (Most low maintenance and difficult to mess up)   Don't be afraid of loose leaf tea but also don't let people make you feel bad for using tea bags. Of you have any questions, feel free to ask üôÇ",False,False

I also second English or Irish breakfast tea if you‚Äôre looking for caffeine. As a coffee substitute, Matcha is very concentrated green tea, which is great with coconut milk and sugar, but I cannot drink it on its own. It just tastes like seaweed without sugar! Lol. Most teas I think you can pick either a milk or a sweetener when hot, but when iced they can be good on their own.  My tip would be to start by buying some variety packs of teabags at the grocery and see what kind of things you like, then you can move on to the fancy loose leaf and infusers and all that jazz.",False,False
