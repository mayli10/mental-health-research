I know you are right but considering full recovery feels impossible to me right now üòû like even if I eat a healthy amount and try to maintain, I will still have to count/weigh everything I eat and be just as weird around food, so I just feel like there will be no winning with her, you know? Which then leads into the whole ‚Äúwhy bother trying at all‚Äù thought process.",False,True

She ought to be! If she's done her research she knows just how destructive EDs are and that you are in mental and physical danger. She loves you and is terrified of you being hurt or even losing you forever. The ""right"" answer here is recovery, to be really honest. Our EDs hurt the people close to us, and the worse we get the worse they get too. Of course we don't want to hurt them or make them concerned, but as long as we refuse recovery, it's inevitable.   Now if you want your mom to get off your case, you could try making a deal with her? Like, hey mom, it makes me anxious when you look over my shoulder or ask about my intake, and it makes me want to eat even less! Of course she doesn't want that. But you may have to strike an agreement. Like, mom doesn't ask about my intake, as long as I stay above XX weight. Identifying a marker of when she's justified and allowed to be concerned- according to you.  Once my family found out about my ed, I basically asked them not to bother me about it and explained that it would make it worse. They mostly listened.  However, sometimes I wish they would have made a bigger deal out of it. On a big level I really wanted help and not to live in the hellscape that is ED anymore. And if you push your sources of help away, it becomes harder to get it when you need it :/  ",False,False
