Even though I've spent the better part of my life at least passively suicidal, I was still terrified of the idea that I'd be jogging down the street or getting lightheaded in the shower and then just be gone.

I was physically unable to make myself throw up. I would spend hours in the toilet trying to gross myself out, and nothing. I started thinking about finding something that would cause me to throw up, but that was finally my limit. ",False,False
