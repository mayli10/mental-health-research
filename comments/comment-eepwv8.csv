The only reason I havenâ€™t gained much is bc I restrict to less than 700-800. I promised myself that December would be different, that Iâ€™d restrict all month (or mostly) so I could enjoy Christmas but alas, Iâ€™ve binged so many goddamn times this month itâ€™s crazy.   Iâ€™ll be spending my Christmas fasting and go into January restricting until Iâ€™m back down to an acceptable weight for me.   Happy holidays to you too ðŸ’–ðŸŽ„ I wish you a better 2020",False,False
