""wow they have more cuts then I do"".. ""wow when they talk about xyz theyvseem a lot more fucked up than me"".. it sucks and it led me to being hospitalized two more times...   To me those places are also addictive? Like I wasnt there for an ED so it was different, but being away from school, friends, family, ect was just relaxing.. like a mental break from all the drama, bullshit, and having to hide my depression. I could just sit in my pjs and look at a wall and just not. It made me way worse. Lol, i know this post wasnt exactly related just thought Id share and felt really good to type out.",False,False

I would think about it a lot and wanted to go back (why?!!?) and just wanted to be sick enough to make that happen. those thoughts fucked me up for a long while, but it's been 15 years and I've almost forgotten.

I've been IP several times and we were allowed our phones and laptops, even had wifi. We could hang out in our rooms a lot if we wanted to, and we could hang out together without staff present. That's not to say we didn't have rules (we had a lot), but it seems so relaxed compared to what I've read about other people's experiences, especially in the US!  And just remember - if you were invalid, you wouldn't be there in the first place. They wanted you to go for a reason - you needed help. ",False,False
