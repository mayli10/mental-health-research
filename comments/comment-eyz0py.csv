In some ways, though, I think that there is a wider range of accepted beauty ""types"" than ever before, and that movement really started in the 1960s with a celebration of ""ethnic"" models. Some of us have never and would never exactly match a type--I am one of them--(have fat upper arms ever been stylish? Lol) but at the same time I think we've never had higher expectations for ourselves and each other. When there are a million ""girls next door"" amateurs on social media and explicit websites looking like what we used to be exposed to maybe 1000 looking like, over a lifetime...that's a lot of pressure to feel like you have to look perfect within some category, all the time. Or at least be fucking photogenic every once in a while! üò´üòÇ",False,False

I've got a bit of a baby face which ironically seems to point out the other ways I look old (to me).

You're right, in the 90's when I was a teenager stars, models etc were SUPER thin.  Heroin chic was IN.    I could fit in with that.

Now that the ""expectation"" is to be super thin, huge thigh gap, but also a huge chest, thick thighs and ass etc.  That is what gets in my head and wears me out.
