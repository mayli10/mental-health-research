That literally giving someone advice to starve themselves to death. If you don't have the nutritional knowledge to fast for 2 months you shouldn't do it. If anything, recommend a fruit fast, with nuts allowed ( including nut milk) and tell them to do their research and read academic journals about nutrition and daily allowance.",False,False

The most I've ever lost in a month was 15 lbs and it made me a zombie bitch. You should not loose 30 lbs in a month. Please be kind to your body and eat nutritious food. It's not recommended to go below 1200 calories.,False,False
