Honestly, if you're up to it, just have a couple cups of green tea and try to relax if you can. It probably won't make the ED part of you feel better but it may ease the vegan part.

I could only see it being ‚Äúokay‚Äù (which in my eyes it‚Äôs absolutely not okay) if it‚Äôs only made in a place that non-vegan things are made. But still. Fucked up.,False,False

That's bullshit. See if you can complain to the brand or something? Also sorry the labeling misled you, that's so not cool :(",False,False
