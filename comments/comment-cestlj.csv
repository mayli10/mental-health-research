Maybe not in a sense that you need to beat them, but perhaps in a sense where you have to at least be equal to them. It's sort of hard to date someone who you think is settling for you.",False,False

I've been seeing a girl for a couple weeks and she's so much shorter and smaller than me that I feel like a disgusting giant next to her. I've lost 20 pounds in the past 3 weeks and it has been brutal on my mind and body tbh,False,False

For me, my problem is more that I find many different types of women super hot and attractive...but I'm not satisfied with myself even if I could be into someone whose body is really close to mine. There was a girl at my work who was about my height, super nice, absolutely BEAUTIFUL curves, just absolutely adorable. I had the biggest crush on her and even though her body type wasn't super far of from mine..I thought she was gorgeous but think I'm disgusting and huge in the mirror.",False,False

Like while my ED ass aims to be the flattest skinniest girl on earth, my SO is a bit fuller in shape, big boobs, etc. She constantly feels insecure about her body because ""you look so thin and I've gained so much weight lately"", but for me she is perfect the way she is and more importantly, she doesn't have an unhealthy relationship with food...   And actually when we met, I was a lot bigger than she was, at my highest, and I felt pretty much like you OP. But now that the tables have turned, I find myself still as attracted to her as I was years ago :) And I hope she feels the same, even when I'm not as comfy as I used to be lol   I guess what I'm saying is, it's all in your mind my dude. Take that love and accept it as it comes, because there's no way to know, to see ourselves with the eyes of the ones who love us for who we are. You just have to trust them and try to remember that beauty is subjective, and that not all attraction is based on looks. If it helps, flip through a magazine and realize that even if the models are ""conventionally attractive"" like you say, you won't be attracted to 100% of them.",False,False
