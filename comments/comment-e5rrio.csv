I sorta locked myself in one room at work so I don't eat any of the fatty foods. That room only had really fatty sugary foods, so as an orthorexic I wasn't really prone to overeat usually.   Sadly someone got like 4 packs of several roasted nuts of my favourite nuts. Let me tell you, that was a dark week.   (I'm not a gluttonous asshole, it's a shared kitchen sponsored by the employer, so I could eat whatever I wanted and just get more)",False,False
