I've had anorexia nervosa (binge &amp; purge subtype) for 11 years this year. Luckily I don't have any severe, life-threathening complications so far but I have a lot of ""not so serious"" complications.  When I still was purging (quit that about a year or so ago) I damaged my teeth pretty bad. Several cavities, my dental enamel is pretty much gone and on top of this I'm extremely afraid of dentists. Because of that I'm quite positive I'll never get them fixed. Well, that's my own stupidity though.  At the age of 18 I was diagnosed with a minor heart problem. Nothing lethal, just prolonged QT but it still freaked me out. Last time we checked my heart was in a better condition but that was years ago. I don't know in what condition it is now but hey, I'm still alive!  I also have awful constipation (abusing opioids sure doesn't help haha), thinning hair, lanugo and a hard time sitting in a chair with no cushions; my assbones hurt. Even sleeping in my own, comfortable, soft bed hurts if I am too long in the same position.   So yeah, far, far away from glamour! üòú",False,False
