I know the feeling too. The one person I would be comfortable with lives too far away :(,False,False

I can’t do it, I just buy things but then if they don’t fit I just feel like shit when I get home. I wear the same old clothes too. I don’t really let myself buy or look at clothes anymore because I just feel terrible buying them because I don’t wear them. I’ve been trying to get into skincare as a way I can improve myself that’s not as destructive. Asian skincare has been fun to look at and try. Idk if it will help you but it gets my mind off it for a little and helps make me feel better.",False,False

I want to get new clothes at Target but I just cry in the dressing rooms. I don't look like I used to. I feel alone and isolated inside. I stick to my baggy shirts and my old dresses and refuse to buy anything that shows my body. It sucks :(,False,True

It’s been a month since I’ve been out of rehab and I don’t know what to do or how to feel. I want to quit and go back but this is the farthest I’ve made it without relapsing and I’m at a point where my body likely wouldn’t withstand another relapse. But I don’t look like myself, I don’t feel like myself. I don’t like any of my clothes on me and I get super paranoid if my thighs touch or my stomach folds. It sucks.",False,False

Then the assumption that since one appears to be eating normally, everything is now ok.   I've also got barely any support, I don't talk much about my ED to others and haven't gotten professional help for personal reasons. Recovery is a weird thing because logically you can know it's the right thing to do but everything about it feels so fucking wrong for reasons I can't even really put into words. I'm still trying to push through the temptation to backslide, and don't really know when I'll stop feeling this way.   Just know you aren't alone in this!",False,False
