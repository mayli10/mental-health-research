Try to find something enjoyable in your life and remember that people do care about you even if you don’t know it   *hugs*,False,False

I haven't lost enough weight. just a stupid attention starved idiot. I doubt any medical professional would take me seriously. wish my body would just give up and die already. feels like it's going to. I'm sorry. I'll probably delete this later.
