From my understanding the people over there think that fat people actually suffering from atypical anorexia are going to lose weight fast, not that normal- or overweight people can't have restrictive eating disorders and that some (not all!) fat people claim to have anorexia when they don't have it.   These people do exist and I honestly can't stand them - no, eating an apple for breakfast doesn't make you anorexic.  But every person no matter the weight can have disordered eating or suffer from an eating disorder and most if not all comments over there are in favour of this.  Sadly some people are assholes and they can show up everywhere, but I think OP('s ED) might have misinterpreted this.   Everyone suffering is valid and worthy of treatment, no matter what, even if your ED is trying to tell you otherwise (it's lying).",False,False

There’s a huge difference between referring to atypical AN as “fat AN” and quoting a hypothetical person who has atypical AN and identifies herself as fat (whether or not it’s true is immaterial).  However, perhaps there was another highly upvoted comment I didn’t see?  Edit: excuse my flair. I’m actually smack-dab in the middle of the normal range right now",False,False
