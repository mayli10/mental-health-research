It wants to keep us safe!   She had me imagine a fridge or pantry and picture “putting the items away” in my mind, whatever I’m obsessing over. That way, I can “save it for later”, when I do have time to think about it, and my brain kind of calms down. It’s been decently helpful, although I’m still an obsessive mess lmao.",False,False

It's not for everyone but if you can do it your cravings go away almost entirely, or at least that's my experience. The only time I feel hungry is when I'm genuinely way too deprived and I absolutely need to eat something. Ever since I stopped having cravings I don't think about food much at all since I have no appetite/desire for it.",False,False
