I do really well eating about 3 meals a day consistently for a couple weeks then BAM I wake up and my stomach is a rock. I cant even out food in my mouth without already gagging because it feels lile the food is past my throat. I cant keep anything down and everything and water comes back up. I have finicky blood sugar and fibromyalgia along with my chronic underweight and recovery battles.  what saves me in these moments is actually (please hear me out) - baby food.  like the purees that come in the pouch like the Togo applesauce. you really can't taste a difference and they put other things in there. like yogurt or carrots and veggies so you get the nutrients.   anything with bananas too. try a slice with peanut butter and saltines. (I'm allergic to bananas,  but it sounds amazing) protein and potassium is super important to keep your heart healthy. especially with getting sick and not able to eat much. try something with bread even.  also electrolytes. be very cautious to not overlaps and imbalance your system too much, cuz that's super dangerous. but you need electrolytes.",False,False

Is purging a goos idea? No, never but your digestion is absolutely salvageable. Your stomach feels awful because you were *ill* you were *not eating* then you ate a whole load of low-quality food all at once. This would fuck up literally anyone's stomach! Like those fuckers who donate for fecal transplants aka the luckiest healthiest people alive with amazing guts and everything else, even they would feel awful after the week you've had.    Your body can recover from what it's been through. You are not broken or defective or a lost cause.   I'm so sorry you feel shitty and hope it gets better soon x",False,False
