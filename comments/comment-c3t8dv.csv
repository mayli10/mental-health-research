I’m exactly the same now, like scrolling h&amp;ms website and just noticing the ankles! Super weird. I don’t know if this is a new thing though or if its always been that way and I haven’t noticed? Do you have any idea why? I don’t really drink much at all and apparently if you’re dehydrated you can hold onto water weight in your ankles, but how do you know if its water weight or just fat?",False,True
