The other day, my friends were all on FaceTime and they all wanted to weigh themselves because they hadn’t in forever and I just didn’t participate, but it was hard. I admire the way you handled it. I hope one day I am able to speak to people with that sort of kind assertion. It sucks that people don’t understand this aspect of the disorder. Don’t. Make. Comments. Publicly. Jesus",False,True

I can relate to this so much, and these comments also make me super uncomfortable. I have started to become more vocal and tell people their comments are inappropriate.   I have a coworker who recently asked me how much I weigh while we were in front of numerous people. I told her that was an inappropriate question, then she pushed more and stated several times that I am just skin and bones. I walked away, cried in private, then decided I had to confront her. I told her that I don't appreciate her commenting on my body, I find it uncomfortable, and I told her how unprofessional it is. She apologized and said she won't do it again, so hopefully she doesn't (this has been an ongoing issue).   I have a hard time standing up for myself, but I am slowly learning to. I don't owe anyone an explanation for my weight, and I don't have to explain my eating disorder. And hearing comments on my weight is not helpful for my recovery.   I hope you never have to experience those type of comments again, and know those comments are not okay.",False,False
