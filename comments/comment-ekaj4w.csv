A lot of the immediate weight gain you’ll see is the food weight (I’m sure there’s a better term but you catch my drift) and water weight, drink some water (something with electrolytes and salts is even better! bc it helps with water retention, so the bloating goes away a lot quicker) most of it will go away in ard 12h and the rest will leave after a day or two at most (depends on if you’re constipated I find that stretches the bloat period out a little). Sending support!!",False,False

One day, in the long term, will barely affect anything and any difference you see is going to be mostly water weight. Don’t freak and try and be kind to yourself!!! Especially if ur healing from an injury",False,False
