I literally almost had a breakdown waiting for a professor to give an exam back in class.. an exam that I got 108% on. Ridiculous brain stuff.",False,False

I used to demand that I get 95s and shit. I have no idea how youâ€™re able to manage seven classes holy.   Iâ€™m just so anxious and out of it and like I have no idea how to navigate school or even life anymore. Iâ€™ve been doing intensive trauma reprocessing with a therapist, and it has been wildly effective to the point where Iâ€™m now a completely different person. I wouldnâ€™t trade the progress Iâ€™ve made for anything, but Iâ€™m still learning how to live as my new, not-traumatized self.",False,True

I'm in a similar situation. Struggling to even get out of bed for anything other than work. Going to class is a struggle. Working is a challenge. Had to leave work several times in the last few weeks because of anxiety then recently asked for a few days off so I can get myself together.   I've been trying to be more social and find/create positive things to look forward to. I hope you're also able to find things to motivate you and keep you going. ðŸ’™,False,False

Wonder where the ED perfectionism came from, yeah?   Are you too busy to study or I know I have issues because I feel like if I sit for too long I need to pace which doesn't help? Because honestly I feel like I might drop a club or something too just because trying to balance eating properly and all the schoolwork is not easy.",False,False
