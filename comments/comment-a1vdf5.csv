I can't say that I truly know what it feels like to be suicidal, but I think I've experienced deep hopelessness, and then I ""foresaw"" that there wasn't a future for me and it frightened me so much. Like you said, (often) it's not really a death wish so much as an inability to see that there's anything good left for you.

I am glad you are alive, what comes after this is your redemption, your rebirth, your becoming of ultimate self. As much as I wish to have never experienced the things that made me want to die, and how I really wish I never tried to kill myself, I can honestly say that it was a beautiful experience to have overcome. Through my attempt to kill myself, I killed the parts that haunted me. When I decided to not kill myself, I learned to kill the rest of what would make me want to. In the things that died made room for the things that could live, that could make me want to live. I am so proud of you, I know the suffering you have beared has been heavy, and you are strong for carrying it and choosing to overcome it. You have a journey ahead where you will become the hero of it. I would love to PM if you would like support through this. I got some really good books that have immensely helped me. ‚ù§Ô∏è",False,False
