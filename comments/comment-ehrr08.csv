Now it has completely flipped and I have been restricting massively the last few weeks. In my opinion I was suffering most with the BED - especially mentally. I felt so gross and disgusting and shameful the entire time, but also had a lot of problems with stomach pains, diarrhea or constipation and reflux. The reflux only got worse when I switched to purging as you can imagine. Yes, I physically suffered a lot more when I purged, but mentally it was easier on me. I didn't feel as guilty and shameful.   Eating disorders are mental illnesses. You don't necessarily have to suffer physically to have one - even though I definitely did suffer physically when I had BED.  Your ED is valid. Don't doubt yourself.",False,False
