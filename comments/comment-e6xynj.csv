The best analogy I have is you know if you sleep funny or sit funny and you get a dead limb - you don’t notice or feel it until you start to try to use it &amp; then it’s the horrible pins and needles and half strength and such until circulation finally comes back and you’re normal again. I feel like recovery is a bit that way.,False,False

Like I feel worse now I’m ‘recovering’ than before. It’s such a mindfuck,False,True
