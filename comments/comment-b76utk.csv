I have this compulsion to eat anything that is old, broken, etc. I swear someone had posted in proed about it and they described themselves as a ""human garbage disposal"" and that is exactly what I am and I cannot stop. I cannot shake that I personally responsible for eating all of the leftover/unwanted food or it will be a waste of money &amp; food. I also think that if I eat all of the ""bad food"" in the house that I will remove the temptation so to speak. I know it's all illogical and faulty thinking but I can't change it.",False,False

I fall into and out of habits very quickly. If I restrict successfully for a day, it becomes easier and I do it the next; then from there I’m full force. Till I give into the binge urge. I’m EDNOS so I’ve come to accept I’ll have these cycles but the times I logically realise that my binging has become a habit (like done at a specific time, at night) then it’s much easier for me to distract myself and kick it.   Or give in and say I’ll do it tomorrow lmfao",False,False
