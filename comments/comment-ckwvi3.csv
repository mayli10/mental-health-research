The thing that made me quit was my body dysmorphia. I literally could not stand my own reflection so I would have breakdowns before and after classes. I don’t think my ED was caused by dance but it was definitely worsened. Standing in a mirror with a bunch of skinny girls several days a week is not good for a disordered brain,False,False

Ballet definitely played a role in triggering my ed but i had disordered thoughts before I started dancing too. I guess it just kinda caused the disorder to surface. I’ve been told by teachers/directors to gain weight but having to look at myself in the mirror all day in a leotard and tights makes it impossible for me to even attempt to recover.,False,False
