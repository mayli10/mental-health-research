Not sure how long she’s been dieting but I can almost guarantee it wasn’t lost in a healthy manner, given how much she has lost. As others have said, she has a history of lipo/photoshop so I take it with a grain of salt. I agree with the comments about yo-yo dieting to an extent, but the magnitude of her changes make me wonder if it’s a restrict/binge cycle",False,False

One day, she makes a video about lipo/diet/vegan/health shake, whatever, then the next day she makes a mukbang. she's been ""losing weight"" for years",False,False

Did she really lose weight? I perceived her to have an issue with bingeing based on all of her eating videos and such",False,False
