Even the suicide hotline. I know you're not actively suicidal but they helped me a lot even when I was just having a crisis. Things can and will get better, but you have to give them a chance to change. I remember being so so sad and trying to starve myself to death. You're not alone. But things got better for me and they can for you. I'm taking antidepressants and my whole life is different now. I never thought I could be happy again but I am. Please please please.

It shouldn't matter and I was really confused at first but for some reason it does hold some subjective weight for me (just like hitting completely arbitrary weight goals that only I know about).

I know that oftentimes, depending on the country or insurance or whatever, treatment levels are determined by medical stability, which includes weight as one criteria. At an anorexic BMI, you are *definitely* going to be suffering health effects that you might otherwise avoid at higher weight.   B/p-ing is super unhealthy, but the dangers are amplified when you are significantly underweight, which makes you more medically fragile (chronically low in all sorts of nutrients and electrolytes as well as potentially having heart damage, etc).",False,False

Even if you're ""bulimic"", if you meet the DSM weight criteria for anorexia (anorexia severity is determined by weight, bulimia severity by frequency of episodes) then you're actually ""anorexia nervosa binge/purge subtype"". The other is ""anorexia nervosa restricting subtype"" which I suppose is someone who meets the weight and mindset criteria for AN and doesn't have b/p episodes.",False,True
