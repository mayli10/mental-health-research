I participate in a sport that has weight classes, and weight can fluctuate (and be manipulated) much easier than you think.   A decent meal usually weighs anywhere from around 2 to 4 pounds, 16 ounces of water is one pound, and that's not even accounting what clothes you may have had on when you weighed in (pants tend to be 2 pounds, a shirt .5-1 pound, hoodie 2-3 pounds).   I've definitely had my fair share of gaining up to 15 pounds in a day after a hard weight cut, dropping 7 pounds the next morning, and getting back to my scratch weight after 3-4 days.",False,False

I promise you didn't eat 15,400 calories in addition to your TDEE. Stay hydrated, go for a walk, take a self care nap and try to relax.ðŸ’•",False,False

It will most likely be water, especially if you had a lot of sodium.   (Oh and also if youâ€™re female it may be due to hormonal changes.)",False,False
