So the three main electrolytes  that I make sure to watch are sodium, potassium, and magnesium.   What I personally do to make sure I’m getting enough potassium is I put this stuff called NoSalt on my food that’s sold as a sodium-free alternative and it has a lot of potassium in it! Just be careful because you can have too much potassium. But this is a super good way to get some more in your diet.   For magnesium I’ll just take a magnesium pill at night, which can also sometimes help with sleep :D  Edit: If you’re looking for a good multivitamin, I spent a lot of time trying to find some quality ones when I was looking for one for myself and I think “Nature’s Way Alive Max3 Daily” is a good one, I’ve been taking it for a few months now and I think it helps :)",False,False

Potassium, magnesium, etc. The kind of stuff you get in sports drinks like Gatorade. (There are 0 cal versions if need be)  Biotin is B7 - a vitamin people take to help skin/hair/nails. It's useful, but not really directly related to energy. B-12 is usually a really good one to supplement for energy, although a mixed ""B complex"" vitamin is a good idea as well.   &amp;#x200B;  Bare minimum, ensuring you have electrolytes is key. Beyond that, protein is very important if you have been realllly pushing high restriction as it's what's gonna keep your body regenerating, healing, etc. Having a simple multivitamin is not a bad idea as well.",False,False
