As someone who spent four years in recovery it's DEFINITELY worth the mental clarity and space. I feel like I'm spiraling in circles and I just want to get my head back up above the water. Recovery is actually incredibly worth it. And you generally won't gain that much weight. And at the very least you'll gain new skills out of it like reducing body dysmorphia, reducing purging cravings, better body awareness etc etc. ‚ù§  I get you on being crazy while working in healthcare. I work in fucking mental health for Christ sake lol",False,False
