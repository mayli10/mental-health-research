Quite weird to wake up with your hand around your arm. I do it every chance I get. I'll go so far as to cross the street at a certain angle at night, so the light behind casts my shadow directly in front of me, and then I can see what I look like walking.  I like feeling my chin/jaw, my collar bones, when I'm lying in bed it's my hips and ribs. Sometimes at work I'll grab my leg to adjust my jeans or something, and then that triggers more checking. I've recently started checking the bones in my feet and my ankles. You name it, I probably do it.   I'd likely have more pictures on my phone if I could figure out how the hell to get a decent shot of my back. I've seen others body checks of their backs and I'm like ""how did you manage to take that?"" I have an entire hidden folder that is subdivided into body parts.",False,False
