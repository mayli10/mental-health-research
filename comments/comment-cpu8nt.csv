Here‚Äôs a giant myth busted: Treating the hair itself will only help prevent damage to the hair strands themselves and not increase growth or anything like that (one exception: exfoliating your scalp increases blood circulation and can bring a marginal amount of nutrients to the hair follicles, but that‚Äôs more about the massage and less about the product itself). Once the hair has left our scalp, it‚Äôs all dead cells that are not being fed nutrition by our bodies and cannot regenerate. If you have color treated hair, products with protein in them (like Olaplex, Shea Moisture, coconut oil, or anything with keratin in it) can be helpful in restoring some of the proteins that have been stripped from your hair, but if you have virgin hair, an excess of protein will likely damage your hair. Silicone products can give the appearance of smoother, healthier hair, but it coats the strands and prevents moisture from entering and will create breakage due to lack of moisture *or* due to damage from the harsh detergents that are necessary to properly cleanse the silicone from your hair. It‚Äôs basically like a tourniquet for your hair that can only be removed by stripping *everything* from the hair, including all of its natural oils.   **Actual advice begins here!** It sounds like your body lacks the necessary nutrients to build the hair you used to have, and that the hair that is growing is significantly weaker and lacking nutrition. There are two things you need to do: provide nutrients for the hair to grow from your scalp, and protect the hair once it does grow.  If you don‚Äôt already take one, try to find a multivitamin with folic acid, folate, niacin, vitamin C, B1, B2, B6, zinc, iron, and copper. You may need to look into prenatal vitamins for find all of this, and if you can‚Äôt find one that has *everything,* don‚Äôt worry. Biotin can be extremely helpful as well, but some people find that it causes acne. Try to avoid supplements with ‚Äú1666% DV biotin‚Äù and you‚Äôll probably be fine unless you‚Äôre extra sensitive. Horsetail extract and MSM are also very helpful if you‚Äôre not opposed to taking an extra few pills (I get powdered MSM and add it to smoothies). I‚Äôve heard great things about Halo Beauty‚Äôs HSN supplement, which has all of this and more, and they have shocking before and after photos. I don‚Äôt have that kind of money so I use Target‚Äôs Simply Balanced women‚Äôs multi and add any additional extracts or supplements that I really want and work for me. It‚Äôs like $10 for a 3 month supply and it‚Äôs the single best multivitamin for under $30 a month that I‚Äôve ever found.   As for protecting you hair, here are some tips. You don‚Äôt have to do all of them of course, any improvement is still improvement. I go all out but hair is kind of my thing.   - The number one tip I can give you is to *watch what you put on your hair.* Sulfates and silicones are extremely damaging, and manufacturers are now coming up with new names to call them to trick us into buying their junk. I follow the ‚Äúcurly girl method‚Äù to pick products, but it‚Äôs not exclusive to curly headed people. Check out isitcg.com and plug in your products‚Äô ingredients to see if they‚Äôre safe for your hair.  - Washing: Don‚Äôt use sulfates if at all possible. Wash the roots of your hair only; the length of your hair will get clean when your rinse the soap off. The ends are too delicate for you to wash them directly. Wash as little as possible. Use a deep conditioning treatment either biweekly or weekly, whatever you feel is most helpful. I recommend a scalp exfoliator once a month or biweekly. Don‚Äôt use super hot water. Get a shower filter ($14 at Home Depot) to remove chlorine from the water. It‚Äôs easily installed and uninstalled if you‚Äôre in an apartment. I thought it was overkill until I started using it, now I can‚Äôt shower without it because I can feel the chlorine sticking to my skin and hair and drying me out.  - Drying: Use a microfiber hair turban instead of a towel after you wash your hair. Terrycloth is *so* rough on hair and way too heavy to be on your head, especially since hair is most delicate when it‚Äôs wet. Bed Bath and Beyond and Ulta are good places to find these, but most places carry them nowadays. Do not rub your wet hair. Gently press excess water out then put it in the turban. Don‚Äôt use heat unless absolutely necessary.  - Brushing: Use a detangler before you wash your hair instead of brushing wet hair after the shower (girls with super curly or kinky hair ignore this one; brush your hair in the shower with conditioner). Only detangle your hair when absolutely necessary. Use a gentle detangling brush rather than your typical firm brush or comb. Wet Brushes are a good, affordable option that can be found in Walmart or TJ Maxx. Use a boar‚Äôs hair brush or wooden brush on a daily basis to distribute the oils in your hair without damaging it. Be gentle with your hair, don‚Äôt rip out tangles!  - Sleeping: Use silk or satin pillowcases. Most hair breakage is due to rough pillow cases. You can get them at Bed Bath and Beyond for like $5-$10. Put your hair in a ‚Äúpineapple‚Äù (a loose ponytail or bun right on top of your head) while sleeping to keep from rolling over on your hair and causing friction. This also prevents acne!  - Use soft hair ties. Elastics should be out of the question. I use the kind that feel like the same material as dressy tights and I love them. The kind that look like an old school phone cord are better than elastics, but only marginally. Soft scrunchies are a good option too that are available almost everywhere.   I hope this helps. If you or anyone else has any questions or I wasn‚Äôt clear at any point, let me know!",False,False
