I was semi-regularly taking a multivitamin and the rest of my blood test was normal. I'm more careful to take my multivitamin daily and extra D on top of it. It might be worth getting a basic blood test if you can. ",False,False

The short answer is that yes, if you are not ovulating because of low estrogen (which can happen with low body weight or just restriction), the longer you do not have a period, the more likely you are to develop osteoporosis. Hope that helps :)",False,False

I have always had a super irregular period but it gets worse when I restrict and I'll go 2 or 3 months without it, maybe longer I don't really keep track. I'm definitely not gonna get pregnant lmfao so I don't mind having it this often but I don't want it to cause other health problems.",False,False

Heme iron is derived from hemoglobin. It is found in animal foods that originally contained hemoglobin, such as red meats, fish, and poultry (meat, poultry, and seafood contain both heme and non-heme iron). Your body absorbs the most iron from heme sources. Most nonheme iron is from plant sources.  Iron tablets on their own are of debatable use, because it's not very bioavailable.  Look up foods with significant amounts of heme iron and try to rotate those into your diet.  It needs to be heme iron to be bioavailable in significant amounts, which is unfortunately why a lot of vegetarians and meat-avoidant people with EDs tend to become deficient.  Losing your period for a significant amount of time (like a year) will negatively impact your bone density and hugely increase your risk of osteoporosis and future broken bones.  You want to get on top of this ASAP to protect your skeletal integrity.  The decreased estrogen that causes amennorrhea will also put you at higher risk of depression, and make any depressive episode you have more recalcitrant and treatment-resistant.",False,False

I've lost it when i was overweight. It's because you're restricting. It's most likely lack of iron. I don't know about the consequences... But most of all it's a possible sign of iron deficiency and that in itself is bad. You should takr some vitamin C tablets and iron supplements. Whenever my period is late i take them and it comes after 1 or 2 days so i know for sure that's why. I don't take them every day, some months i get it normally even when heavy restricting, sometimes it's just a much smaller flow. But when it's late i take iron because it's a reminder that I'm probably lacking. ",False,False
