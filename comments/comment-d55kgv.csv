I hate binging at night, it skews my weight so so badly and makes me over exercise and fast and restrict and feel like absolute crap the next morning (esp if I wake up hungry!! How dare my stomach betray me like that!!)  Anyway, what time do you sleep? I found that sleeping earlier helps, obvs hehe. If you can’t sleep earlier for whatever reason, I’d def recommend “binging” on watery, fiberous (is that a word?) fruit, like cantaloupe and watermelon and apples n shit. 260g of watermelon fills me UP and it isn’t that many calories, especially compared to my usual 2.5-3.3k binges.   Last night I almost binged and had the pancake mix in my hand and scale in the other, but I looked at myself in the mirror (I keep my pancake mix in my room lmfao) and out loud said “NO!” You have the control to stop it. You are in control of putting the food in your mouth. You *can* stop it, it just takes hella willpower! You’ll feel AMAZING the next morning knowing that you shut that binge monster’s voice up.  Best of luck 💖",False,False
