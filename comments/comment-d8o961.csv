That‚Äôs why a lot of people with ADHD/ADD end up self medicating with caffeine/cocaine/some other stimulant. so if you feel chilled out on a stimulant then you probably have some degree of undiagnosed ADHD/ADD. two birds one stone!",False,False

I know it's not technically for weight loss but my doctor kind of implied that's what it was for because I'm now 285 and gained 35 of it in the past few months. So she agreed that something had to change or my weight gain would be nearly impossible to reverse. I'm hoping to stay on it until I'm at least in the normal bmi range and I'll start going back to cognative behavioral therapy before then to hopefully offset any weight gain after stopping it. And I hope you find something that helps you stop binging I'm sending you all the love in the world ‚ù§Ô∏è,False,True

The chances of you binge eating and even worse then before are huge when you stop. I use to binge 3-4 times a week then just binged 2 times a week on vyvanse. I stopped vyvanse and binged daily for a week straight. Morning until night. The worst experience of my life. I really hope it works for you.,False,False

It's an amphetamine so it's a controlled substance with a high rate of abuse.

It basically kills your appetite and when you do eat you don't get this huge high like you would normally.
