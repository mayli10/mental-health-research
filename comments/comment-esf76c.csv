If he's supported you in the past I'd be shocked if he intentionally said that.    Definitely sucks but I'd assume he didn't mean it the way it came across,False,False

He maybe thought you were saying it was a mistake not to calorie count and he thought you were basically telling him you binged and are now worrying about it.  I know that's NOT what you said, but it's really hard for some people to grasp what an ED is like. Source: married for several years, frequently tell husband how I'm feeling about my ED. He frequently asks if I want a takeout etc. He loves me, he just doesn't understand.",False,False
