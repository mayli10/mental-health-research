I state the theory as a possibility, not a fact. I would never present it as a fact because if there's anything I know about nutrition, its that we have barely skimmed the surface regarding knowledge about nutrients and how they interact with our bodies. Its not rare for genetics and predetermined factors to determine aspects of our weight, and its ridiculous to think otherwise given the amount of studies that address this. I also never equated Set Point Theory to things like race and sexuality lol, I personally think that its likely more of a spectrum if it exists. Anyways, I know people on Reddit like to be right. We aren't going to agree. If you are studying nutrition, I recommend being open to hearing multiple viewpoints.",False,False

Even if it does seem to be evidenced in those twin studies, it sounds like people are still finding themselves at a normal weight - not over weight or obese. It is extremely rare for a genetic or other medical condition to CAUSE obesity in an individual. Over weight or obese people are that way 99% of the time because for whatever reason they ate too much over an extended period of time.  As you said yourself, set point theory is a theory, and I’ve seen nothing to say a person is unable to change their weight in the way that they are unable to change their race, sexuality, or gender identity. Therefore, I think it’s very reductive to co-opt the term of privilege to describe the experiences of discrimination over weight or obese people experience in society as a result of their weight. People at higher weights certainly have negative experiences as a result of being a higher weight but no one has ever ended up homeless or feared that a person might beat them to death on the basis of their weight alone.  Typing something into google scholar doesn’t necessarily make the information invalid. I just wasn’t going to go and log on to my own school’s academic libraries merely to make a point on reddit.",False,False

In addition, n=24 is an extremely small sample pool. The Harris study, besides being 30 years old, is only an abstract that you extracted that statement from. Its not available in my school's library, so I can't really comment more on it.  You typed ""set point theory weight"" into Google Scholar, I imagine. However, studies that experiment with set point theory use different key terms and parameters to study the theory without blatantly calling it a ""set point theory"" study. A lot of the studies I've read that support it study sets of twins in a controlled environment and monitor weight loss. The studies are useful for hypothesizing that the theory could be valid, but more-so to show the influence genetics have on weight. I think the theory's main merit is that some people will be unable to achieve the low weights they desire or be unable to maintain that weight in a ""normal"" manner.

Weinsier, Nagy, et al. (2000) ‘Do adaptive changes in metabolic rate favor weight regain in weight-reduced individuals? An examination of the set-point theory’. - “Failure to establish energy balance after weight loss gives the misleading impression that weight-reduced persons are energy conservative and predisposed to weight regain. Our findings do not provide evidence in support of adaptive metabolic changes as an explanation for the tendency of weight-reduced persons to regain weight.”  ^^ it’s human action through excess consumption of calories that causes weight gain, not an inherent biological return to a certain weight. People don’t change their eating habits sufficiently enough or old habits creep in and that’s what causes the weight gain.  Harris (1990) ‘Role of set-point theory in regulation of body weight’. - “It is concluded that regulation of body weight in relation to one specific parameter related to energy balance is unrealistic. It seems appropriate to assume that the level at which body weight and body fat content are maintained represents the equilibria achieved by regulation of many parameters.”  ^^ a number of factors are at play that might cause someone to regain weight lost, including environmental factors. Basically if you eat more calories than you’re burning you will regain weight but if you eat the same amount of calories you burn you will maintain your weight. Your body won’t somehow turn a lack of excess energy into fat.",False,False

I do understand that people suffer negative experiences as a result of being overweight but it REALLY bothers me when people try to equate the negative experiences of being overweight with the negative experiences that come as a result of being a minority or oppressed race, sexuality, gender, or social class.
