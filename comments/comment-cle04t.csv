If I ate him it would be like one of those times when you're out of the good stuff mid binge and just eat saltines or old bread.   Thank you, you made me laugh : )",False,True

What a prick. It's basic human decency not to assume someone is pregnant unless they've told you, for a whole myriad of reasons. But there's no way 10kg could even make you LOOK pregnant. What a tool. I hope your bf gave him a hard time for it, lol. And don't let some pinprick who thinks Lara Croft is an anatomical model stop you from finishing some beautiful carne asada next time!!",False,False

Nobody cares what you think, Kyle. Go sell that opinion on ebay and see how much it's worth.  Little bit late, but one of my favorite ways to fuck with people who blurt dumb shit is to just be silent and stare at them. Let them marinate in it.  You don't need to say anything. If he knows it's rude, he'll start tripping over his own shit + digging the hole deeper. And then everyone laughs at the fluster.  It's not foolproof, but when it works, it's poetry.",False,False
