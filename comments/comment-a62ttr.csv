My theory is that for non ED people, their hunger cues keep their weight at a ‚Äúset point‚Äù. So some people have a lower set point just because they don‚Äôt get hungry often and feel full quickly and therefore unintentionally eat less than average. And on the flip side, some people are hungry more often and take longer to feel full, which gives them a higher set point.   Wish I could phrase that better but thinking is too much effort right now.

I think people think we have a set point because it‚Äôs so easy to go back to the habits that got us there in the first place. It takes SOME sort of sacrifice to lose weight, we are all too familiar w/ that lol, it‚Äôs just that most people don‚Äôt have the willpower to sustain that sacrifice and turn it into a habit.

Making realistic long term changes to your diet and routine will get to/keep you at a certain weight. It‚Äôs a lot harder to stay at an underweight weight because most people‚Äôs bodies tell them to eat, depending on how underweight you are.   I usually float either right on the low point of healthy weight or just underweight because my natural eating patterns and the foods I tend to eat usually work out to be under my TDEE. Also at 50kg or 56kg my TDEE calculates to be only 100-200 calories different. So maintenance is practically the same, it‚Äôs just getting to the lower weight that is the hard part because of restricting. I hope that makes sense.",False,False

But isn't it a more obvious explanation that people have a lifetime of learned eating habits/beliefs/behaviors behind them and those are extremely hard to permanently change? People go on a diet, lose weight, then go back to how they've always eaten and gain the weight back again, it's not remotely surprising. If someone does permanently change their energy intake/needs, then they're not gong to go back to their previous 'set point'.  However, there probably are some physiological differences in how strongly people feel hunger, which would contribute to them finding it much harder to get by on fewer calories, so they're less likely to have a lower 'set point' weight. But they could still change it if they really wanted to.",False,False
