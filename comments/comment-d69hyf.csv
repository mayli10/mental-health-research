His “old old old” account makes me think that it was from a long time ago, long before he matured, long before he knew what he liked/wanted at this moment. Have your “tastes” changed? Do you find things attractive now that you didn’t earlier in life and visa versa?   He is with you for you, he is attracted to you physically and mentally. You don’t need to be the other girls, the fake photoshopped, angled, sucked in girls. You need to be you.  If he makes you feel any different, I ask you to remove yourself...  if it’s an insecurity in him, get out. If it’s insecurity in yourself, be gentle. You are a gem.",False,False
