I decided once to ""blend in"", but I couldn't have the carby drinks and I couldn't mix my drink with any juice so, you guessed it, I drank distilled vodka. Plain distilled vodka from a transparent glass. And I thought: that's it, I've reached the pinnacle of drinking. I have joined the higher^(TM) social circle. I have risen above the peasants. I'm a high class rich and stylish lady who's having fun with her friends and who doesn't give a shit about anything.   Then somebody asks me if I'm drinking distilled vodka without any juice or anything and I'm like: yea just vodka, and they're like: uhhhhh...? ok...?.   Thx for telling me that it's weird now I just never drink and just tell them that I tolerate poorly the alcohol and they're all leaving me alone and calorie free xx",False,False
