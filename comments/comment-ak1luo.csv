Just gotta try to remember that an actual professional with a normal brain diagnosed you based on laid out criteria. Their mind is working more rationally than yours, so logically they are far more likely to be right. I feel exactly the same as this but the real reason I got this diagnosis was to stress how much a problem it is. Don't rely on yourself to validate your diagnosis because you don't have an accurate sense of normal/sick. It's incredibly difficult but the thinking you aren't sick enough is an ED thought that needs to shut the fuck up.",False,False
