It's pretty hard to be deficient in calcium in America, considering how common cheese &amp; milk products are, but even if you are vegan there are [many things that give calcium](https://www.nhs.uk/live-well/eat-well/the-vegan-diet/#vegan-sources-of-calcium-and-vitamin-d). As for a vitamin D supplement alone, it won't help with your bone density if you aren't deficient in vitamin D,  but it can help in other ways, depending on age. [For elderly women, it decreased all-cause of mortality rate to take Vitamin D3 specifically](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21735411).  &amp;#x200B;  Taking Citracal \[or Vitamin D and calcium together from any company\] [increases the risk of kidney stones](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24414552) by about 17%. So I really don't suggest taking it unless you know you are deficient in both.",False,False

Estradiol itself has actually been shown to help suppress eating in many studies. Peri-menopause (transition to menopause) is actually where women gain the most weight, as estradiol production starts to plummet. One study showed that oral estradiol and a progestin (synthetic progesterone) reduced body weight, body fat, BMI, and waist-to-hip ratio significantly, when given during peri-menopause.    &amp;#x200B;  In mice there have been more precise studies to determine ""Why?"". One study showed that it was because it reduces the 'food reward behavior' of mice. Another showed that it reduced the negative effects of weight gain when deferred eating. Removal of sex hormones via ovariectomy (totally not ethical in humans) resulted in weight gain.    &amp;#x200B;  When I'd mentioned weight gain before, it was because that was used as a treatment for currently underweight anorexic people with lower bone density. The estradiol itself was not causing the weight gain.   &amp;#x200B;  [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28558993](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28558993)  [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10759058](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10759058)  [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26370625](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26370625)  [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25230326](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25230326)  [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28214679](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28214679)  [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/4066126](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/4066126)",False,False

I’ve had two bone density scans, one at 21 and one at 25. My most recent scans show I’m borderline for osteopenia. My BMI at the time I had both of them was probably around 15, maybe a little higher for the second one.   My endocrinologist pretty much said that osteopenia was made up by drug companies to sell more medication. He was not concerned at all about my results. He had been very very concerned prior to the results coming in (and aware of my ED history, concerned about my weight, etc).   Definitely follow your doctors recommendations, but osteopenia isn’t the end of the world. Try your best to do a little load baring exercise, like walking, to help maintain bone density.",False,False

The main reason anorexia effects bone density is through hypogonadism (lack of sex hormones).   &amp;#x200B;  Transdermal (patches) estradiol was shown to be effective at increasing bone density, and it was the primary choice for adolescents. Oral estradiol sometimes helped in some studies, but not in some others. Sadly, oral estradiol is just less efficient than transdermal (patch) or injection\*. In adults, some studies suggested the use of bisphosphonates as well as estradiol.   &amp;#x200B;  While most studies used small doses of pills or patches, one used ""pseudopregnancy levels"" of estradiol and progesterone. They had a 15% BMD increase in 3 months, increasing to 18% in 6 months. Compared to the previous studies for ""gain weight"" which took up to 16 months to be significant, sex hormones work way faster. I assume ""gain weight"" only helps because it helps you produce your own sex hormones again.  &amp;#x200B;  Unfortunately, you'd think that calcium supplements would help, but they regularly are shown not to. Your body doesn't have issues getting calcium, it has problems keeping it. Similarly, Vitamin D isn't useful either, unless you are deficient in vitamin D.  &amp;#x200B;  I'd suggest asking your doctor for a hormone panel blood test to see where you are at or use [privatemdlabs.com](https://privatemdlabs.com) if you are in the US and don't have insurance (\~60$) and talk to your doctor about using bisphosphonates or hormone therapy.   &amp;#x200B;  some of the sources:  [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21897220](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21897220)  [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24898127](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24898127)  [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16972186](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16972186)  [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24731664](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24731664)  [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7835827](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7835827)  [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27916839](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27916839)  [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26174589](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26174589)  [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29080644](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29080644)  [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24119980](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24119980)  \*I have read way more about this topic than any endocrinologist I've ever met",False,False
