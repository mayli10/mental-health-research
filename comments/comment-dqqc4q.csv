I'm glad you've found that OP.   I've told 3 people. Two of them I considered amazing friends. Watched them get married, covered their bills when they got robbed... I went through literal hell on their wedding day too. (Story is deep within my profile now). Well, now everyone knows, and the ridicule that followed was disturbing to say the least. It became a weapon to use against me, to mock me.  The 3rd person I've told? My other friends 15 year old daughter. I'm teaching her how to shoot guns and all about firearm safety. She's going through some insanely rough social pressure from her friends. Recently had her teeth knocked out from an accident her friend caused. The torment that followed socially made her into a target by all. One Snapchat of her popping off a mag from my 9mm instantly turned her into the most popular kid in school, now I'm letting her pick and choose which friends get to come shooting with us. Guess who suddenly has every friend loving her?   It's funny... I'm a 30 year old former United States Marine, two tour combat veteran. And my own 30-40 year old friends just won't stop trying to use this against me as a weapon. ""Oh he seems like a great guy, but he's fucked in the head. Apparently he doesn't eat and when he does he just pukes it up like a fucking teenage girl""... Meanwhile an actual teenage girl couldn't be more understanding and supportive of what's going on. On the way to the range? Let's get a dozen donuts... Mmmh maybe just the egg white snack wraps instead? It's little shit like that, that makes a fucking world of difference.   Totally deleting this in shame in about 20 minutes. Even on Reddit, this shit brings me fucking shame. So I just opt for the excuse of ""I'm here because I'm trying to learn to help someone very close to me"". Stigma is hard to break socially for me. So I've pretty much decided my life is just going to be all about helping people now, specifically kids going through rough times and mental illnesses. The only ones I feel safe telling, are the young. Because everyone else around me, honestly, will never be able to relate or help. Even my friend who is running around mocking me, was 10 years anorexic with two inpatient stays. I figured she'd be a great person to talk to. I heard her mention it, and it took me over a month to get the courage to mention mine and ask for help. It was brushed off as a ""oh that shit only hits you when you're young. Just stop doing it, it's that simple"" then she saw me eat an entire pizza one day and I knew the ridicule started when the response was ""well that's a waste of a perfectly good pizza!"" To her husband... You just know your name is on their lips behind closed doors with a comment like that. Sure enough, it was being told to everyone with an ear that would give it. People who don't even know me, now know.   But fuck em, right? Fuck em all. Because it's just me, and this struggle to pull my head out of my ass. And that's all that matters. People like my friends daughter, and her support, is all I need to get past this. Atleast you learn who is there for you, and who just uses you as a stage prop to fill in for a moment in their own lives.",False,False
