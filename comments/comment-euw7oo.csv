I add some cinnamon and vanilla to the the egg white/milk mixture and it comes out really good. I like using PB2 in place of syrup as well. It’s one of my favorite things to eat right now :)",False,False

Also, my recipe for the french toast: 2 egg whites, 2tbsp unsweetened almond milk, 1tbsp skinny syrup or other sweetener to your taste (I like the skinny syrup because it adds flavor as well), 1/4tsp cinnamon (optional). Mix all that together and dunk 2 slices of bread in it. (It's the perfect amount for 2 slices) at this point you can either cook it now or let it soak in the mixture overnight. (great for meal prep and soaking gives it a better texture imo)   Using 40 cal slices this comes out to 120 cal.",False,False

At only 70 cal for the vanilla bean halo top. Next level float? Add a shot of fireball. Brings it up to 141 cal but omg.. delicious.   Also love the egg white french toast. I use nature's own life wheat or honey wheat. It's 40 cal a slice.,False,False
