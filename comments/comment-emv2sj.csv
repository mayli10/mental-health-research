Veggie burger with oven baked fries/potato wedges?  I try to have some foods at home that taste unhealthy but aren't as bad, like Gardein fishless fillets or veggie sausages. It seems to make the cravings happen less often.",False,False

Yesterday I was craving it too but I tried to eat broccoli rice and sweet potato and ended up eating more than i normally would have bc it wouldnâ€™t hit the spot :( iâ€™m just worried about getting used to giving in to cravings.. I used to not even drink coke or chips and once i ate them it was hard to not eat them again ðŸ˜­  When I went grocery shopping yesterday I had a diet dr pepper in my cart the entire time and  managed to convince myself to put it back ðŸ˜­,False,True

I know that I'm risking a sad binge (food I don't want, possibly don't even like) when I try to ignore it. You'll have to decide if you'll feel okay after eating it. I'm generally fine if it's a decision I made calmly, with no stress or binge urges.  I like to get a whopper with cheese, onion rings, and a diet dr pepper. It might not be healthy, but sometimes it's just what I need.",False,False
