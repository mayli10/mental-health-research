I wish it was as easy for me.",False,False

I started binge drinking at 14, and stopped about two years ago, when I turned 22. It was so hard and painful to quit, but somehow it was so much easier than beating my eating disorder. I think it might be because even though it's hard, you can stop drinking. Like, you don't need alcohol to survive, so you can completely abstain. But with food, you need food to survive, and it's really impossible to avoid. But once I start eating, it's soooo fucking hard to stop",False,False

Alcohol was relatively painless to quit because I had the fact it's empty calories and sugar so it became something I found my ED was worth more than the relief of being cushioned from life by being pissed.  I was forced into benzo withdrawal because my doc threatened to stop my script.  I was abusing them and way, way above my prescribed daily dose.  (Still on 30mg a day, but tapered from on average 140mg a day.  Agreed, it's harsh).  Nicotine's a hard one to kick.  I stopped smoking cigarettes because I can't afford to buy it anymore, but vaping nicotine is a lot cheaper even though I crave a real smoke.  I think that the addiction to restricting/ED behaviours is so all consuming and beneficial to us (in a bad way but it becomes so comforting), that we don't want to let go of all the different parts that come with it.  Substances were good that they blocked out, or made easier, chaos in life whereas food ... don't know how to put this really ... it IS life.  Every second is about controlling food intake/hunger.  There are so many rituals that can't be broken so easily that dealing with just one of them, calorie counting for eg, is a small part of recovery.  It feel impossible to ever quit calorie counting when for so long all you've done is put calorific values to food that you can't forget that suchathing has X calories.  Things like how I eat (alone, in the same place, at the same time, with the same cutlery), the high of feeling in control (which is fake), the high of hunger, the high of initially eating after being so hungry, body checking, comparing my body shape to every other female on the planet, etc etc etc...it all becomes almost subconscious.  I still lapse with benzos occasionally and I still find myself thinking to myself, ""God, I really feel like getting pissed right now"".  I miss them both.  I felt the same when I was in remission from my ED.  It never left me.  Thing is, when I lapsed with recovery of my ED it happened full on.  Even if benzos fell from the sky and alcohol was sugar free I still know I wouldn't go back there because it made daily life more difficult to function in.  With anorexia I think I can function normally, but that's all lies.  I'm more alert, but it still controls me.  &amp;#x200B;  &amp;#x200B;  **tl;dr**  People underestimate the power of an eating disorder.  They're so complex it's not as straightforward to deal with as quitting substances.  Serious kudos for dealing with your other addictions.  Stick at it with trying to kick your ed.  It can be done. x",False,False

When I quit one habit another falls in its place. I used to pop benzos and smoke weed all day long every day all I did was binge eat without purging and black out I gained a lot as soon as I quit though inwas back to starving myself.,False,False

Iâ€™ve totally abstained from alcohol, benzos, and coke for over 3 1/2 years. ED is a much harder one for me to give up. I think itâ€™s largely because food is just EVERYWHERE and we need to eat it to live. Having to develop a healthy relationship w food is harder than just giving up a drug completely.",False,False

You can't give it up the same way you can with alcohol or drugs (not to suggest that giving those up is easy). We need it to survive and we can't be as black-and-white with it as with other substances. Hold in there!!!,False,False
