Something I tell myself (which helps with those invalidating thoughts) is this: *I'm diagnosed with AN.  I meet all criteria for this ED and I am sick. If I'm faking my illness, whose to say everyone else isn't? If this isnt anorexia, what the is?*  It's the nature of eating disorders to tell you it's not real, that is how people stay trapped for so long.  I believe in you",False,False

Your mind is so tightly attached to the disorder that giving it up is terrifying, so it works to convince you that you aren't sick so that you can continue to get sicker. Accepting treatment means you know on some level that the way you've been going about things is wrong, not that you aren't sick. You deserve treatment, you deserve recovery, and you deserve to live a full life.   Treatment will be hard, but so so so worth it. Push yourself to get better, *don't let your ED win*.",False,False
