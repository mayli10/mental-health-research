A few months ago though I finally reached out to my local ED clinic and I got accepted at an overweight bmi and i dont even have a diagnosis- i was just recommended to contact them by my nurse. The fear of rejection can be terrifying but these clinics are run by professionals who know that people with EDs dont always look a certain way ðŸ’•  (Im probably in a different country to you though so idk how your system works),False,False
