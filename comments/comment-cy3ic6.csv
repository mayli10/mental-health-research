Thanks for your comment man, it really made the world of difference to me and gave me the confidence to post an even more vulnerable picture that I never ever dreamed I'd do.    It's great that you're on your way - if you wanna chat more just send me a message :)   And good luck with those scales - don't spend too much!",False,False

I will probably never mention it again, just looked here out of curiousity as it's very much... In the past in so many ways. In so many ways not - body image is permanently fucked but I got loads of things to hate so try not to dwell on past problems...  But I remember the day I ditched the scales. Forever.
