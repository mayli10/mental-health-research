I honestly mean that! It gives me some hope that I can get past this 500 hump one day. I mentally have to tell myself this though and that‚Äôs hard. I would make meals for my ex, and it was such a wonderful happy feeling feeding him and taking care of him.

I usually burn around 200 from exercise (compulsion so I do it everyday).. so technically I eat around 800 a day.  I enjoy my coffee... a lot... so I have 3 cups a day with 1tbsp of yummy creamer so its like 120 of my cals for the day everyday üòÇ  The rest of the day I focus on protein and veg... I have a busy lifestyle in the evening when I get home from work because of kids so I usually just down a protein drink (160 cal yummy chocolate milkkkk) and I eat lunch which is whatever I want as long as its within my cals.  Idk im stuck in between deciding if I should lower my cals right now cause I really wanna just eat 600..üòî  ,False,False

I roast tons of veggies and I‚Äôm allowed to have as much as I want. It helps so I feel full but not heavy and I don‚Äôt ever feel regret (although if I feel too full or satisfied I freak out). I am a volume eater (although I still don‚Äôt eat a ton of food) and I have never been able to have suuuuper tiny portions of high calorie foods/junk foods. It just seems wasteful. I don‚Äôt eat pasta, rice, bread, sugar, dairy, flour, etc so that I can eat more and feel full. I have one calculated safe food ‚Äòfree‚Äô meal once every couple of weeks to help keep me sane/keep up relationships.   For breakfast I have a protein smoothie and vitamins  (Psyllium husks, water, strawberries, almond milk, beef gelatin, and nuzest protein powder)   With the vitamins it‚Äôs about 100 cals.   Lunch is always leftover dinner or I make cauliflower ‚Äòfried‚Äô rice/shiitake noodles to go with frozen potstickers or a lean protein.   My lunches usually hit about 200-300 cals.   Dinner is always a lean protein and two vegetables. I also cook for my boyfriend so food can‚Äôt be as bland and wacky as I would normally allow it to be. Usually I do trimmed chicken thighs or fish with huge trays of roasted veggies or a low calorie squash/sides.   Dinner usually hits between 300-400 cals depending on how much input my boyfriend has on what we eat (he can eat 3,400 a day and sometimes he wants things that drive up the calories so I‚Äôll cook a lot of separate food or make mini compromises)  ",False,False
