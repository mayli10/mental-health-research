And even if they somehow did see you name they read the write up as well and should respect that you would like to remain anonymous. It would make them seem like a terrible person to just go spreading rumors about peoples personal struggles. If they get articles submitted like this i assume its part of their job to respect the privacy of these writers its a part of journalism as well.,False,False
