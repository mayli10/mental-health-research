I fluctuate from 117-125 and I appear ""so skinny"" to some people. The most offensive thing I've been told is ""hey, eat!"". That's so disrespectful and they didn't even know about my ED. They wouldn't say to an OW girl ""hey, diet!"". It makes me so frustrated and sad honestly. If I'm satisfied with the way I look and not putting my health at risk I should be fine. I have to ignore those comments the best I can I know.",False,True

I have been working at my current job for about 1 year and I have been about 10 pounds underweight the entire time, yet no one comments. She asked me what I would do/say if the situation were reverse: If a colleague were visibly underweight, what would I say to them? When I thought about it that way, I realized that I would probably be worried about them, but I wouldn't ever say anything to them for fear of offending them or getting a negative reaction. Our society is so focused on weight, but when it gets to a certain point, no one knows whether to say something. People also have really screwed up ideas about what a ""healthy body"" looks like. I've gotten the rare compliment on my body, which obviously fuels my eating disorder, even though I know objectively that I'm underweight.   Most people in our society have no idea about what is normal in terms of eating, body weight, etc. and no one should ever be commenting on someone's weight/body size.  I would say try to ignore what anyone says about your weight/size because no one truly knows enough about you to really say anything to that effect. It's pretty much a lose-lose situation. If someone comments on you looking better, you feel like you have to lose weight. If someone says you look thin, you feel like you need to keep losing weight because you are never ""thin enough."" Eating disorders are a losing battle and people without eating disorders may think they understand them, but they are fatally flawed in their conceptions of what encompasses an eating disorder. While I was in treatment this summer, I wanted to take a picture of everyone that was there with me. The people there were everything to severely underweight all the way up to obese. Eating disorders don't discriminate, so don't let one offhand comment take you further down the rabbit hole of your eating disorder.",False,False
