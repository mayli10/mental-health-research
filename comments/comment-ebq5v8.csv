Ur body is afraid its gonna starve. Its trying to help u not die.   I know the lower i got the more i had to eat cuz there was literally nothing there for my body to burn. It felt like a binge but in retrospect i think i was just starving.   I relate so much to feeling so far away from ur body. I cycle thru restrict/fast and eating a lot....rn i dont even know what my body is.,False,False
