He is/was definitely in an eating disorder mind set. He ""gets"" what initially makes an ED sufferer feel so euphoric and excited and incredibly with the weight loss and the ""control,"" as he mentions.  He definitely has downplayed the actual amount of weight lost in each interview.   He specifically talks about how ""empowering"" it is and how it is ""exhausting"" at first but once you reach your ""target weight"" it becomes ""incredible"" and you feel energized and excited.  It is not as common to hear men openly speak out on EDs (although plenty of actors, singers, entertainers) have had them and spoken out.. just a few to name Billy Bob Thornton, Dennis Quaid, Zayn Malik, Kit Harington..  To hear Joaquin describe the feeling of how starving initially makes you feel good is very triggering. And with his g/f being so thin it makes me wonder if he will fall back into these patterns?  My exact thoughts OP. A lot of comments on YouTube were caught up in the ""clip"" Jimmy played that embarrassed Joaquin (which many now believe is a hoax and/or was staged to resemble the movie's events)...  However, all I could think was.  ""He definitely has an eating disorder."" He admitted to it in interviews as well.",False,False

He’s the most triggering public figure out there by far for me, tbh.",False,False

With others it always seemed like „just“ an extreme diet but not ED-ish.,False,True

I barely knew what anorexia was when I first got ill but that sense of control is addictive and the mindset follows from there. It was odd to hear him verbalise that so obviously,False,False

I feel like actors do unhealthy diets a lot for roles but it’s interesting to see that it comes with that ED mindset as well even though it’s so controlled for them. Like we know they do it with ED methods but he also thought like that.,False,True

I have to admit, it was really triggering. He's gained the weight back (or a lot of it) so I'm not sure. But his GF Rooney Mara is really thin- she strikes me as someone who restricts so who knows?",False,False
