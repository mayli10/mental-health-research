I have my own bathroom too which is nice. The hardest part for me is waiting for them to leave the common area so I can make weird low-cal food creations lol.   Honestly seeing how terribly they eat and the consequences (they have all gained weight this year) is really good motivation for me,False,False

I made up for it by being gone all the time.  During the week, I didn't eat breakfast and ""ate lunch at work."" ""Lunch"" consisted of a protein bar on occasion, or nothing.  My mom is always home for dinner, so I almost always eat with her. That's basically my OMAD. But when I lived with my dad, he had a lot of evening dinner meetings/went out with his fiancee, so I was off the hook for that most of the time.",False,False

They’ve never seemed too uncomfortable with it, and if anything they kind of make fun of me for it (we’re very comfortable with each other so it doesn’t bother me). Like one will want to order food and I’ll say I’m good and he’ll say “god I can’t wait for you to be recovered so we can order seamless again!”   I think it really depends on the kind of person you’re living with.

I get embarrassed that they probably notice how fast I go through my groceries due to my binge cycles though  With purging idk I try to do it at night and when no ones home. There's always one roommate home though w me, but she stays in her room so I try to stay as quiet as I can (idk I do though...)  I pass a lot of it off as haha stress eating, haha pmsing. Also I keep snack foods in my room so they won't notice how quickly I go through those. If I do eat w them like say a roommate cooks, I dnt get too big or too small a portion. Or i pass it off as ah I already ate (if i binged or if im restricting). My roommate says I barely eat or I eat like a bird (thts just bc im a cheap vegetarian tho) so I guess im hiding it well ?   This was unnecessarily detailed...",False,False

It's made my everyday living hell and I've relapsed so heard. Research has shown that people who live with another person who has an ED are more likely to develop EDs. This is commonly seen in family households, but it's also been proven in living situations such as college dorms.   I'm pleading with you, if you get a roommate, please seek help for the sake of yourself and the person you're living with. My roommate constantly talks about thinspo, weight loss, calories, and workout plans; it has severely mentally affected me, even my silence may not show it.",False,False
