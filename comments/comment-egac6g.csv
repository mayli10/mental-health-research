Especially after a few rough binge/high cal days. For ex: 1500-1200-1000-800 and so on to your desired number. In general for me, starting a fast is going to be really hard and end in a binge if I jump right down from high to low without a ramp down. Also, eating low carb leading up to a fast or a period of low restriction and getting enough fat(I know that's scary) and protein keeps my progress much more sustainable. Sorry if that doesn't really answer your question. Just wanted to share my experiences!",False,False

Like when I’m fasting I do fine until I have the slightest bit of sugar, then I’m ravenous. (I’m not a doctor please don’t come at me, lol just sharing my experience)",False,False
