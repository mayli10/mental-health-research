I started off with doing keto with my AN. Then, I was basically forced by my parents into recovery (eating more) and I ended up binging. It turned into BED for months on end, then EDNOS, and now I sort of have control over my eating, but am restricting. I'm afraid that if I just go with my natural hunger cues, I'll end up eating a ""binge-size"" meal and it will stress me out so that is why I'm continuing to restrict.  Scary as fuck to know that I can't be safe around too much food, as I'm sure you know.  I know it just feels so weird to have such an inconsistent appetite, but between meals, I sometimes brush teeth or chew gum or drink lots and lots of water. Maybe that will work for you (not sure if I'm allowed to give this kind of advice, but it's only meant for BEDers and not those with AN).",False,False
