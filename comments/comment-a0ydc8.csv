Though ofc it's impossible to tell exactly how much due to water weight fluctuations that would happen regardless. I've eaten way more than 3500 extra calories in a day... but after a certain point I think the body just doesn't absorb it the same way. I ain't a scientist though. ,False,False

Estimate how many you ate throughout the day, calculate your BMR and how much you burn on a normal day: (Calories consumed-calories burnt)/3500= x pounds of fat you gained. This isn't perfect but it'll bring you within an estimate.  &amp;#x200B;  example: I burn 1100-1200ish cals a day on a normal sedentary school day. If I binged and hit 4000 throughout the day it'd be 4000-1200= 2800/3500= 0.8 pounds of fat.",False,False

So assuming an ""average"" BED experience, one day of binging could only cause .46 lbs of weight gain maximum (assuming an average tdee of ~1,700).   Few people eat more than that: only 1 in 5 people who binge will consume 5,000 calories at a time and only 1 in 10 people will consume 6,000 calories in a single binge. Even at the highest end, which only describes 1/10 people with BED, a single binge could cause 1.2 lbs per day (again, assuming tdee of 1700).   For comparison, the person who holds the world record for fastest weight gain ate 10- 20,000 cals a day, and gained about 3-4 lbs a day. So I think we can assume that is the absolute upper limit of the amount it is humanly possible to gain, and that was on purpose, she was paid to eat on camera and was trying really hard to break the world record.   I hope that helps.",False,False
