She reminds me a lot of a girl who was in inpatient with me years ago. She also had super long black hair and around the same figure eugenia had in like 2015. She was so nice and kind to everyone you could talk to her about everything and she'd be so supportive, even if you're just rambling about your favorite hobby that she doesnt do she'd show genuine happiness for you. Watching the Shane docu made me think about her and I literally started crying I'm so proud of both her and eugenia for taking care of themselves, I'm so grateful to have such beautiful people in this world, inside and out",False,False
