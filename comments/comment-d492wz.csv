Feels like that to me too. But itâ€™s really actually not. Nobody wants you to lose weight. Not your family or friends or boyfriend. They just want you to be able to eat and be happy and love yourself. It can be hard to give ourselves that same permission though. Hugs.,False,False

I'm worried that he'll try and stop me from losing weight... which now that I say that, makes me think that I may be deeper in this than I thought. I really should open up with him. he knows I've been anorexic in the past. I don't want him to worry about me.",False,True

Is there a safe middle ground between the two? Can you set a hard limit for yourself? Like pick a healthy weight youâ€™d like to drop to, but commit to maintaining or eating normally once you get there?  If you canâ€™t balance it in a sustainable or healthy way, now might be a good time to ask for help or support. If you have a history with anorexia, anyone close to you should be happy to help stop you from falling down the rabbit hole.",False,False
