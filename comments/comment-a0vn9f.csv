Remember you need to feed your body otherwise it will start feeding off your muscles (including your heart). ",False,False

Its hell bc you give yourself an opportunity to overeat at each meal. For me, it's less mentally taxing to restrict than to measure all my foods and eat a varied diet, even though that's my goal.

I recommend you start there.  If I were you, I’d slowly increase my intake by 100-300 cals every few days and track your food in order to avoid binging and then a relapse.  Also to avoid any re-feeding stuff.  Try new foods one or two at a time to see how they make you feel.  For example, I tried beans one day and found out quickly that I couldn’t tolerate them.  But rice?  That was fine.    Be ready for hunger to kick in.  It’s going to be super annoying.  I’d suggest getting a lot of vegetable snacks to munch on when you’re hungry and maybe some lean proteins on hand.  Keep it high volume, low calorie.  Not to avoid weight gain, but to avoid binging and really freaking yourself out.    Proud of you!",False,False

Above all, please be kind to yourself and if possible try and take a massive step back, and view yourself from third person from the most compassionate lens possible. Give yourself permission to have many safe healthy foods. You are busy and active and will not be able to keep up your schedule and life if you aren’t meeting your own basic needs/showing yourself compassion ",False,False
