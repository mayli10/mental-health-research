I do her videos almost everyday and I've done nearly every one she's posted.  I've tried a lot of YouTube yogis, but am picky about their voices. The only other YouTube yogi I've liked so far is Lesley Fightmaster (yes, really her last name). Some of videos are little harder, so I don't do them as often, but I'm enjoying the variety.  Yoga has been so good for me. ",False,False
