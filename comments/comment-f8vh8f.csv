I think it is way more ethically motivated than anything else. I don't partake in fast fashion, try my best to support local and ethical business practices, etc. so it really bothers me that I feel like I can't be a real environmentalist because I can't be vegan. But I know that it isn't a healthy choice for me rn :( because everytime I cut something out I get hyper restrictive or hyper binge-purge cycle-y.",False,True

Also, maybe consider that right now might not necessarily the best time to switch to a plant based diet. Give it a try for sure, and if it's making things harder for your health, try to practice some self forgiveness and understand that while we should all try to be ethical and sustainable, you also have a responsibility to take care of your own health and make sure that you can survive your ethical views. Doesn't mean that it will never be possible, but it might not be the best choice for you today.",False,False

By going vegan it cut out egg whites, chicken and cottage cheese which was what made up the majority of my diet. Going vegan encouraged me to eat beans, rice, noodles even nuts and seeds. I'm not fully recovered but I eat a more varied and higher calorie diet so I now have energy. I focused on the animals and was able to get rid of a lot of guilt when eating cause I can believe I'm helping my body, the animals and the planet. Obviously for some people going vegan is only possible AFTER recovery because it can be detrimental for your mental health and therefore body. I'd really suggest adding in new foods and fun vegan alternatives as well as healthy foods so you are adding new groups while getting rid of others so you still have variety. Also you can totally take it slow. I find it way easier to change something by not being too strict and maybe starting by cutting down on animal products until they taper out?",False,False
