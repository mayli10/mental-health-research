There are days where I’ll allow myself to buy a packet of say Sour Patch Kids or M&amp;M’s but when I do I basically OMAD that shit (I gotta be extra careful on these days though because those things can be trigger foods for me)",False,False

I’ve found that having a planned meal with something sweet (tonight was Campbell Soup and some baked cinnamon apples for dessert!) helps curb my cravings.
