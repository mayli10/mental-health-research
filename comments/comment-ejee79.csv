I went full on binge over the holidays, which hasn't happened in quite a while. I'm attributing it to stress and now just trying to get back down to my normal 400-500 calorie days, not that this should be some type of achievement, but it totally is. As far as therapy goes, I wouldn't worry too much about being made to feel like a fraud. A good therapist should recognize that our relationship with food is what defines our illness, not our actual weight. Best of luck to you!",False,False
