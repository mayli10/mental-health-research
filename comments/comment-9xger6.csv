My BF, 6'4, seems convinced that his metabolism is slow and he can only lose weight with 2-4 hours of cardio 5+ times a week.   It's actually because he considers a 2000 cal jar of peanuts a snack, his breakfast will consist of something like 6 eggs, a whole steak, and an onion. He seriously eats like 6,000+ cals a day and he has no idea.   It's soooo easy to slim into binge mode when I hang out with him, it's awful.",False,False
