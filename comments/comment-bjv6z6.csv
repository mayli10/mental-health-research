But ‚Äúit‚Äôs different‚Äù because ‚Äúshe‚Äôs naturally very small and has a thin frame‚Äù. I called him out on that because no, she‚Äôs 5‚Äô9‚Äù, eats less than my toddler niece does, and works out 3 hours a day. I don‚Äôt know her life, but I assume she‚Äôs disordered. Idk how much she weighs but she‚Äôs extremely boney.   My sisters in law are also disordered af and having lived with both of them for periods of time I can say that for sure. They both have a BMI below 17, and eat next to nothing on a daily basis. Their nutrition is awful and both of them have severe health issues now that they‚Äôre nearing their 40‚Äôs. My brothers don‚Äôt seem to notice or care, and when I brought it up to one of them when his wife was having repeated episodes of fainting, he basically said ‚Äúok, but remember when you went into recovery for anorexia as a teenager and gained so much weight you were obese? I can‚Äôt have that happen with my wife, our marriage would be over.‚Äù   Anytime I point these things out though, people have some excuse as to why I‚Äôm different. My father has said ‚Äúyou have a bigger frame so you need to be bigger‚Äù and then said ‚Äúyour ribs should never be visible because your frame is small and if they‚Äôre visible you‚Äôve lost too much‚Äù....so just literally any bullshit to explain why he wants me fat.",False,False

It‚Äôs such a crock of shit to go on exercise subs and to see women being praised for their sub-25‚Äù (size 0) waists.
