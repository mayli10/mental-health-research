I want to be S W O L, people still make comments that are snide. Reddit has a slightly better community for it but outside Reddit, fucking never can talk about wanting toned shoulders without people gripping pearls about MUH FEMININITY  Lesson being: don't take it personally. There is no body type you can be or want that will garner support on Reddit quite like a 600 lb person dropping 10 lbs in a week because they lowered their intake from 7500cal to 6000.

It‚Äôs also super frustrating because I fail to see the difference between getting swole, and trying to get skinny (not emaciated). They‚Äôre both for ‚Äúvanity‚Äù reasons, and it should be fine.

It's amazing how rapidly the conversation shifts and the helpful advice withers because they think someone who is close to a ""healthy weight"" can't be struggling.   Like yeah thanks I yoyo 30 lbs but it keeps me within a healthy bmi range for my height , clearly my weight isn't an issue. Unless I was 20 lbs above the threshold.

Really the more you do it the easier it gets. Willpower and motivation are like muscles, the more you use them the stronger they get. Also no goddamn carbs because they ruin my life. God I love them but they make me hangry AF. Insulin and glycogen shitstorm. I just can‚Äôt eat carbs anymore period.

I can barely make day 3. Haha. Alternate day fasting seems really appealing too. Kudos to you on your willpower! I‚Äôm sorry life is so hectic right now, it‚Äôs really hard to do physical taxing shit like lifting when your brain just wants to relax. But it‚Äôs great that fasting is working for you.

It depends heavily on where I‚Äôm working that day though... I move offices a lot and some places lend better to fasting than others.   Also I‚Äôm interested in trying a carnivore diet but I‚Äôve got some veggies in the fridge I need to work through before I try that. I would like to start lifting weights again but since I moved in February my life had all but fallen apart. Also it‚Äôs hella hard and demotivating to try to lift while you‚Äôre restricting so heavily.   Aaaaaand last but not least I‚Äôm bulimic so that‚Äôs a last resort option if I fucked up real bad.

But in real life a lot of my friends who are actually pretty slim always ask me why I‚Äôm dieting or trying to lose weight or whatever. It makes me wonder if I have severe body dysmorphia but there is quantitative data and objective views to my body that would call those claims false. Also... this is the USA we‚Äôre used to overweight figures now.   I just say now it‚Äôs because I‚Äôve gained 25lbs since January. Which is true. But I don‚Äôt mention this was my original weight and I lost those 25 to begin with anyway. But also I‚Äôm at the top end of a healthy BMI anyway like ten pounds away from overweight. Ugh the struggle never ends. Starve for a few months and then binge for a few more. My goal now is to match what I was in January minus 15. Then minus 10 more probably.,False,False
