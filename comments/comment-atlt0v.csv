I actually get mad if I eat something satisfactory.. like if I want a donut I'll go out of my way and get gourmet vegan donuts from the bakery. Or expensive vegan cheese with fake deli slices. It's either an entire mouth experience or starvation, heh.  Anyway - check out Hot For Food! I'm always on their Instagram drooling at their recipes. If I ever plan on cooking something, it's usually one of their vegan dishes. Obviously not low calorie but fuck living on rice cakes every day when I can fast and then have seitan roast.",False,False

I also love making sushi with cauliflower rice and fresh veg and baked tofu.  or ramen with shirataki noodles or rice noodles and homemade miso broth and tons of veg like mushrooms, onions, shaved carrots, sliced green beans, edamame, and broccoli.  I don't know if you're looking for low-cal or just something you'll enjoy eating.  my husband doesn't really like Italian food, but I make pesto soup with kale, lentils and mushrooms that's pretty amazing, and I make tomato sauce from scratch that I put with baked eggplant and frozen veggie meatballs.  or I'll fry shaved b sprouts with garlic and mix it into pasta with a side salad that has olives and artichokes and roasted red peppers in it.  good luck!  try to enjoy the time cooking with him tonight :)",False,False

But to me, that means that you would prefer things that are reduced calorie, so there are a few tips for that.  Also you can up the body of a tomato sauce by adding puree veggies... bolognese usually has onions carrots and celery.  Also sometimes half zoodles mixed in with real pasta is good... but I never cook the zoodles first, the texture is better if you don't!  You can make a decent ""white"" sauce with nutritional yeast, pureed cauliflower, and garlic... ",False,False

Like I totally understand the ""worth it"" aspect... and unfortunately the nothing is worth it kind of thinking that goes along those lines.... but worth it is so wishy washy hahaha  Are you looking for reduced cal versions of your faves? Or like... the real deal, and you believe that it will be worth it?  Cos man... the possibilities are endless.  Here are some tips I have for you: While shiritaki noodles to me are better for asian inspired dishes, they work well as a no cal sub for pasta... and add some sauce and cheese and those aren't too bad.... and if it matters your fiance can have the real stuff!!! Fat free cottage cheese can be a good alternative to ricotta in stuffed or baked pasta dishes, but make sure to season it with some garlic and salt and pepper. Check the kcal of some of the things you think you could never eat. My boyfriend and I just started getting this frozen manicotti that is to die for and 3 full ones are 290 calories.... which means full fat, pasta, filled with cheese is less than 100kcals each... add some extra kcal for sauce and pair it with a big green salad and it is like real people food with less of the guilt! As an italian american... I would say cut calories from everything but the sauce, the sauce is everything... but you can cut kcals there too!  Consider a ""fresh sauce"" instead of one that is reduced for hours.  Use a lot of garlilc and fresh herbs for flavor! There are some frozen vegan meatballs out there that are pretty low kcal and a decent bang for your buck (or you could make some)",False,False
