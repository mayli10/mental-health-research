You got this!! You have a lot of tools now to go back to your preferred habits.   One transgression does not have to turn into a full-blown relapse. You made a mistake - all humans do, sometimes. Time to learn from it and so better in the future. ",False,False

You still succeeded those 28 days. The counter doesn’t reset at zero. Tomorrow will be day 29, and guess what? 28 of those 29 days you didn’t purge!
