I've had an ED since I was 10 but was in remission and wanted to lose weight the ""right"" way and all it did was send me on diet app obsessions and trying to get under that amount. So not their fault but i noticed I flared up again when I checked that sub every day constantly.",False,False

When I hit recovery, I had to unsubscribe from all the diet subs I was on. They definitely trigger me like it does you. Do yourself a favor and unsub for your own health.   My ED was from before my time on reddit, but my ED loves how Reddit feeds it. It gives an external voice to your feelings, and it strengthens the EDs resolve/hold on you.   In fact, I worry about me and this sub. I see a lot of encouraging ED behaviors here that I’m uncomfortable with, I feel like I’m playing with Fire in this sub.   I get people talking to me about my weight loss too, and it’s hard... and also being a guy with s ED is tough too, it’s a weird spot for us.   Hugs.",False,False

Reddit didn't give me an ED but it does help exacerbate it and i don't have the self-control to quit. I feel disordered habits are normalized (some of which I wouldn't even list here because people are so convinced it is healthy and i don't want to argue).
