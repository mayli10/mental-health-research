There are sooo many better ways to help you get through this I promise❤️ There is a reason why this is happening to you and everything will make sense soon, you will understand why you needed this and how it will help you grow. Sending so much love to you please don’t do anything to harm yourself. Reach out to those who love and care (including me!) it will make all the difference in a time like this. You need some extra love during this time baby don’t be afraid to ask for help",False,False
