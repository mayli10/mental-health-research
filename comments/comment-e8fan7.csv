My strategy is that I try to cause distortions in my digestive tract as much as possible so that it will second guess itself. I also try to eat things like raw garlic and hot sauce.,False,False

It *is* possible to be diagnosed as late as 41, just extremely unlikely.   Type 1 is technically an autoimmune disease where a virus (usually one that doesn't even make you outwardly sick) makes your immune system freak out and attack your pancreas, specifically the beta cells that produce insulin. Sorry if you already know this. There's nothing anyone can do to make themselves get an autoimmune disease. They just happen or they don't. Bodies are so weird.  I understand the desire to be thin at any cost, but wow I'm glad you're not going through what I am. I wouldn't wish it on anyone.",False,False

I watched some at the height of my anorexia and familiarized myself with this obscure ED. I wasn't working, just staying home and finding ways to avoid eating, watching anything about everything about food, EDs, etc. You all know how that goes.   Anyway, as I learned about diabulimia, I remember thinking how lovely it would be to eat anything and everything 24/7, never have to puke, and your body would just naturally pee out all the sugar, preventing you from gaining weight.   And since you're peeing out all the food energy, you're starving your body on a cellular level if you don't take insulin. Weird to think how you could binge eat constantly, never purge, and actually lose weight via cellular starvation. But that's what happens.  It's three or four years later, and I got diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes at an unusually late age. It used to be called juvenile diabetes, but not anymore because it's misleading. I was diagnosed at 25.   I'm now diabulimic. This isn't a ""careful what you wish for"" cautionary tale by any means, but let me just say EVERYTHING IN MY LIFE IS SO MUCH WORSE THAN BEFORE. I am dying so much faster than before and my quality of life has disintegrated in ways I didn't even know were possible.",False,False
