If there are any mental health perks like getting out of the house.. or the alternative is that you'll get into a bad headspace eating on your own, treat it case by case  I think people are very critical of themselves and each other. I'm self conscious because I think people are so judgmental and critical of calorie values in food or the type of food  Like they label a small amount of food a binge and crap on (self-dialogue, fat-phobic brainwashing from society) about it where as it's just a snack or something to tie you over, and you're recovering from an ED w/ out help  If you're trying to get into a better headspace, it could be like the opposite of what you need is going through everyone's heads. If society are too disordered and you're outnumbered it can feel like you'll never get into a better space yourself",False,False

The way I'm using my utensils, the amount of food I put into my mouth at once, how many chews before swallowing, whether the amount of water I'm drinking is normal and so on. Even before my ED eating food with people was scary and it has just gotten worse now.",False,False

I have to remind myself that nobody cares what I’m eating.,False,False
