I went up to 68kg recently and my mum won’t introduce me to any acquaintances or anyone at events we go to because she said she’s embarrassed by how much weight I’ve put on. She didn’t even want to introduce me to our new neighbours, FFS. And then when she did, she actually said to them “Please excuse her, she doesn’t usually look this big, she’s just put on weight. I’m so embarrassed I didn’t even want to introduce you to her right now!” Lol. Just lol.  And she keeps complaining about how long it’s taking me to lose weight because apparently “It happened overnight last time. So why can’t you just do it again?” But even when I was stick thin before, she still wasn’t happy, because apparently I was “too thin.”  I’m sorry your mum is making you feel like this. It’s not okay and I hope it gets better. If you want to talk then feel free to drop me a message, I know how cruel mums can be so hopefully I can offer some support. ♥️",False,False

But there is so much prejudice and those fuckers that justify bulling people ""because its for their own good and so they are healthy"" have no idea of medicine and that constant dieting is worse than a high constant weight.

It seems that you are going through a lot of stress in your life. I really appreciate your advice and I wish I knew what to say to make you feel better. I'm around seven kilograms overweight and with non-alcoholic fatty liver as well. I developed it when I lost weight too fast and it continued to get worse as I started binging and gaining back the weight plus more. It's the worst type of pain I've ever experienced, and I can't imagine having to deal with that on top of the responsibility of work and being a mom to two children. You're very strong for enduring that.",False,True

I mean I look at some larger women and think they're beautiful, so why do some people think of fat and instantly associate it with being inadequate, lazy and unhealthy?

There really is no shame in having a healthy weight.  If you're really binging (some people here call eating normally binging, you never know...) it's possible that your eating disorder just switched from anorexia nervosa to binge eating disorder. I don't know much about it, but there are subreddits for binge eating disorder, maybe they can assist you in getting better.  Only thing I know is that restricting often causes binges, it's probably best if you eat your tdee and not lower, at least for a while.  If you can't stop yourself from losing weight, please try to do it in a slow and healthy way.",False,False

Since then I've fluctuated but never got below or near where I was. Two kids and special needs later it's so hard. I'm killing myself. I'm depressed, exhausted, fatty liver not related to alcohol and just please I hope OP gets help. Unfortunately BED there aren't many resources to overcome it and even now therapists go oh you don't purge so then you're fine.... umm no?      You are still at a healthy weight.

I do agree with you that some parents put pressure on their kids a lot. My mom's friends brag to her about their daughters a lot. It's always something along the lines of ""She goes to gym 5 times a week and she has a gorgeous figure but you can't stop shoving food down your throat like a pig"" or ""Your friend gets As in every single class yet you can't even leave the bed"". It fucking sucks. Like the worst part about having depression is the fact that people expect you to act like you don't, and it's so fucking stupid.",False,True

Families are supposed to be supportive. Maybe she was misdirecting her anger at your general unproductiveness (by being home all day and playing games) so she ranted by saying mean things about your weight and food ): I know parents get frustrated especially at their adult aged children who still live at home (those that don’t have a job, are not going to college, just stays home and play their computer games so the parents are frustrated because their child basically has no future? If that makes. When the child should have a full time job and moved out by now, they’re mooching off of their financially well off parents and from the parent’s perspective, they are forced to take care of the grown up indefinitely since they can’t kick out their own child. In simpler terms ig it would be a NEET. Not that you are one OP but when I listen to parents gossiping it’s usually them shit talking their children. It’s usually raving about their child’s massive accomplishments in life whether that be academically or financially or shit talking those on the other end of the spectrum. Also depends on the culture. There’s a lot of pressure on children in specific cultures to “thrive” and ~be the best~ and that can burn a person out.
