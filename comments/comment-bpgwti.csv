But Iâ€™m just trying to fight the battle to at least maybe maintain at the UW/N border right now. Because Iâ€™ve been on this ride long enough to recognize that Iâ€™m in danger and be scared.",False,False

When I consider trying to gain some muscle and avoiding UW, I def feel like maybe Iâ€™ve been faking my ED all along. If I can just reverse my efforts and try to maintain a (low) normal BMI then maybe this was all just a regular diet all along.  Iâ€™m kind of used to this imposter syndrome mindset. It is definitely my ED brain trying to trick me into going further (risking my health further). But I would rather feel like a fake with my disordered ass than go UW again. I just wish I could improve my body image/self esteem/whatever so that I donâ€™t base it all on my weight and body checks. But here we are.  Iâ€™m playing it day by day right now. But I definitely understand the desire to become UW for validation. It does feel like an achievement to ED brain. But it is definitely a slippery slope.",False,False

Thatâ€™s really what keeps setting me back. Iâ€™ll up my calories for a day or two and freak out, and restrict again. The full feeling when I eat more also doesnâ€™t help. But Iâ€™m really trying to fight the urge to keep restricting at this point.  Itâ€™s definitely frustrating to constantly be fighting against thoughts you know arenâ€™t in your best interest.",False,False

I don't really *want* to gain muscle, but I see it as a bandaid because I *will* die from this if I don't stop. I've always started experiencing alarming physical consequences.  My ED says, ""come on, you're so close, why are you questioning me now of all times? You'd rather die thin than live fat and ugly anyway,"" but when I truly ask myself if I want to die, the answer is no. I also want a family one day. Even if I don't die now, I don't want my future children to have their mother die early because of something stupid she did when she was young. Or worse, I don't want to be left permanently infertile because of starvation.   Knowing how I reacted to a BMI of 19, I know I'll react the same to a BMI of 16. I know it won't end. I don't think I'm going to pull out until I do become fully underweight, just to say, ""after a decade, I finally fucking did it"", but I know it's a dangerous path to travel, and the fact that I would feel too much like a failure if I didn't ever get underweight is just telling on how fucked up I am. Failure is not recovering from my ED. Failure isn't not losing the fat I can pinch on my stomach and arms, or not ever seeing the scale dip under 85 pounds, but I don't see it that way.",False,False

Hell, it'd probably look good. But here I am UW because I did actually start gaining muscle, saw the scale go up, panicked and lost all the weight and more.",False,True

And I understand not being mentally prepared for the weight gain that comes with muscle gain.  My main rationale for gaining muscle right now is so that I can lose more fat without dropping to UW. I know there are other health benefits lol but I just know that dropping below normal weight with a goal of getting rid of the fat is really a tipping point to full on madness for me. Like... there is only one really bad end to the goal of â€˜get rid of all the fatâ€™. Iâ€™ve been UW before and it sucked. At least when my goal is centered on low side of normal BMI, I have something to keep me in check.  Right now, gaining muscle sounds like a cheat code to get as tiny as possible while staying normal weight. But itâ€™s definitely going to be a struggle to put into action.  So much stress would diminish if we could spot reduce fat. But I donâ€™t really think any of us are going to accidentally become too muscular lol that takes serious effort. But it is a fear that ED plays on for sure.",False,False

Gain muscle vs keep losing. I need to gain muscle and I'll be healthier and look better but it's not working with my irrational brain.,False,True

I don't think I'm mentally okay enough to gain muscle, but at the very least I want to start making an effort to *conserve* as much muscle as I possibly can.  I *know* most of us are aware about the whole loss of muscle phenomena, and most of us consciously reject the notion of getting bigger with muscles, but tbh, even if some of us don't want the fit girl look, I'm sure being a little more muscular would cut down on the body dysmorphia a least a little bit, because most of us find flabby stomachs more distressing than washboard stomachs. I also think a fair amount of us would be less adverse of being at a healthy weight during recovery if we had hourglass-type shapes. Not everyone of course, but a lot of us are trying to spot reduce certain areas along with getting smaller overall, and muscle mass might help with the spot reducing phenomena.",False,False

So itâ€™s no wonder I feel flabbier at lower weights now.  We should start an ED support group for people interested in at least trying to gain muscle. Itâ€™s really fucking me up right now, because my ED brain is screaming that fat loss is priority #1, but my rational brain realizes Iâ€™d be better off gaining muscle.",False,False

I'm trying to convince myself to increase my Calories and eat a little a little more protein to slow the weight loss down. I'm gonna kill myself so fast at my current weight  Also mad because I looked at a past body check photo of me at a 21 BMI, and I look like my muscles deflated, to the point where I might actually look worse now.",False,False

My highest BMI was like over 29. :') fucking sucks dude  I ignored warnings from everyone else. I thought I would be the different one and actually become satisfied at a 18.7 ish BMI, especially because I had BED. Body types I used to look at for thinspo are no longer thinspo for me anymore, because it's too achievable/close to my body weight now.  That being said, I do think I hate myself a little less than at my HW, even if that hatred has only gone down like less than 5% lol.  But another part does hate myself more because I'm at the minimum healthy weight but am still fat and ugly",False,False

Somehow it escapes my ED brain logic that the minimum healthy BMI would still allow some fat to remain. Even though the rest of the healthy BMI range allows some fat ðŸ¤ª  Iâ€™m trying to convince myself to try for muscle gain before more fat loss. But itâ€™s a struggle to not keep restricting hard.,False,False
