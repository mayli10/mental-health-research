Lost weight the last time I relapsed a few months ago, realized today I officially gained it all back. Because I am a fat piece of shit.     What's weird about my ED now, though, is I will decide to resrict and then any time I fuck it up I punish myself with more food. Like, when I got home I was gonna let myself eat one piece of pizza and a breadstick. But I ate the pizza and three breadsticks. So I forced myself to eat a doughnut too. What the fuck, brain? No wonder I can't lose weight. -_-",False,False
