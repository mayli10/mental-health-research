Not saying that you're wrong, but I'm constantly browsing menus and this is what I've picked up",False,False

Literally went out today and the steak was 330 while grilled chicken was 670. If you order a steak and veggies no one will bat an eye.,False,False

If you ask the waitress for options that don't have dairy, it's also generally far lower in calories (and easy to explain to parents, because you can just tell them that you think you're lactose intolerant and you're trying to see if non-dairy options make you feel better).   That being said, I'd go for:  * Maybe a salad, ask for toppings/dressings on the side, maybe ask for a protein that you're comfortable with so that it looks more like an entree if it's the type of restaurant that would do like, a garden salad w/ the list of proteins (chicken and shrimp are both pretty safe options) * Surprisingly, a plain hamburger can be a safe option. Because most people perceive hamburger portion sizes to be way too big, it's also really normal to cut a burger in half and say that you're going to save the rest for later, and just eat that half. Oftentimes a burger is much lower in calories than some of the salads that are loaded with toppings * A grilled chicken option, get it with a side salad or some vegetables, looks totally normal",False,False

There’s also soups and a lot of vegetarian meals that will come out as low cal :) good luck and enjoy your time with your parents,False,False
