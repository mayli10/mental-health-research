To be highly active, you’d have to do triathlons daily I guess lol. I’m male so I thought 1200 was enough calories per day.   I look back at that time and realize that I was more active than many athletes. I could do it all now but my bones and my heart is too weak.  What you said reminds me of my past. 25k steps a day was all that mattered, all I cared about was protecting my steps, walking as much as I could.  I know how much it burns to Not know what “active” means.  I wish the best to you, damn 25 years, you must be ancient lol, I just turned 18 and I have the vitals of an old woman XD (even now that I’m normal) Well, next month is a new Decade!
