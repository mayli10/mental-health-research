The fact that you’re having trouble losing weight is a testament to how well your body is working for you. Your body is designed to lose weight as a last resort in times of famine. If you can’t fast because you break down with extreme hunger, that’s normal! That’s why the vast majority of people who go on diets gain it all back + more. Your body tries to make sure you have enough fat to sustain you through the next famine so it makes you extra hungry after any kind of restricting. The only way to lose weight and keep it off, is through sustainable lifestyle changes.   The only way you can do that is to first make peace with you body as it is right now. It wasn’t until I accepted myself that I decided to nourish my body properly that I stopped binging. I was at my height at weight ever, but my weight wasn’t as much of a concern as my health was. I was cycling between fasting and binging. Driving myself absolutely crazy and not feeding my body the right things. When I told myself “calories don’t matter. I’m just going to consciously eat more vegetables and less simple carbs.” My Mom is a NP so I told her what I ate in a day to make sure I was getting the proper number of macros and variety. I also added meat back into my diet. Still had desert, just smaller portions. Honestly all the extra weight that I gained dropped without me feeling like I was even trying. There’s a set point in weight for everyone, and when you feed yourself properly and make sure not to restrict to avoid hyperphagia, you either lose or gain weight rapidly until you’re at the weight you’re “supposed” to be at. My mom was concerned at first bc I lost 30lbs in 2.5 months but we looked at what I was eating and I was getting enough calories, and I felt good, truly good; more energy, healthier hair and skin, better concentration. And although I’m still eating the same, I haven’t lost any more weight after that, so I guess I’m where I’m supposed to be and it feels good. Even when I slip up and binge emotionally, it doesn’t offset the progress that I made.   Please stop beating yourself up! See a medical professional and show them what you typically eat in a day. Ask what you can add or subtract to make healthier choices. Don’t deny yourself things; part of the addictive nature of binges is the thrill of indulging in “forbidden” and “bad” foods. You can do it! If you do it right, gaining control of your eating and weight feels effortless. Maybe because the key is to actually give up control and listen to what your body is telling you. Your body is an amazing thing, full of deep hidden wisdom on how to nourish yourself. I hope you find what you need to accept yourself and make good choices. If you feel like you’re struggling to stick with your health plan, it means you took too big of a step and need to find a way to make it sustainable. You are absolutely not dumb or lazy!!! Don’t break my heart talking about yourself that way.",False,False
