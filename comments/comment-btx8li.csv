I lost weight but i was also restricting to about 1200. Iâ€™ve never had too many skin problems so i didnâ€™t notice a super difference. I enjoyed it because it made fruit taste super sweet and i just felt healthier in general, but at the same time it was pretty much just an orthorexia stint and i was mentally quite ill the whole time.",False,False

I wouldnâ€™t deprive myself - for example, if I wanted a cookie and the cookie has 20g of sugar, I would just eat a little less than half.  I did notice improvements in my skin and especially with my energy levels. I overall just didnâ€™t feel as shitty and it seemed to help with losing weight and portion control.",False,False
