I saw one poster claiming to be a 6’1” woman who fits into petite xs. I think she thought petite just meant generally smaller, rather than clothing specifically made for shorter ladies (though this does have the effect of generally smaller clothes), and decided to make as dramatic a statement as possible.   In addition to this, a lot of clothing fit is based on bone structure/weight distribution more than it is pure weight. I’m short &amp; petite (for context, I have a 21.5 inch waist and I wear a 26D bra), so I do sometimes find it hard to fit into clothes “properly” even though I’m barely underweight. And honestly, this doesn’t even translate to me looking all that skinny, so it’s not as much of an achievement as it sounds.
