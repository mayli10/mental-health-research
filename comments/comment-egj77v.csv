I like to roast broccoli in the oven. I usually put the florets in a bowl with a little olive oil (you could use any type) and season with salt, pepper and garlic powder. I can’t remember the temp but I think it’s usually 400°(F) for around 25-30-ish min and flip half way through. I usually just keep an eye on them because the cooking temp per veg varies. I also do this with cut up sweet potatoes or butternut squash, but you could do it this way with any vegetable.",False,False
