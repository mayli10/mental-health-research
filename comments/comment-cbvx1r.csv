My waist is so large (idk if it’s large or I’m just large but I feel like it should be smaller!). I feel like I have such broad shoulders and big arms but my boy always tells me it’s just in my head... but it’s hard to believe. I’m underweight for the first time in my life and literally everyone who knows me thinks I looked skinnier before treatment and I know it’s because I work out now so I have such big arms. Omg I feel huge.,False,False

It's not body dysmorphia, I'm going off of photos where my face looks like a beach ball next to my friend's.

To paint a different picture, I carry my weight very well. Meaning, I tend to get way too fat and gain too much weight before I realize there is a problem. Just because my waist is proportionally smaller doesn’t mean I don’t look overweight or that I would look better than you if someone put us side to side. I think having an “ideal” fat distribution has made it harder for me to maintain a healthy weight because I convince myself “I still look fine” heavier even though it has caused me health problems. A good fat distribution for me is like a false prophet. Grass isn’t always greener on the other side.   Body recomp through exercise can help, or putting pictures of yourself now next to heavier times so you can visually see that your waist is smaller now even if it isn’t as small as you want it to get.",False,False
