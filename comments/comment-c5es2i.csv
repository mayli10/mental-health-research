I got the filling re-done which was fine, only the dentist found 14 new cavities. I'm obsessive about brushing and flossing each day, and I've never purged, but I wish more heavy restrictors were aware that nutritional deficiency can lead to tooth decay too, because I'm certain that's partially at fault for my teeth. I have to go in for at least two appointments this summer to get them all filled, on top of a cleaning which I'm doing this Thursday. If I wasn't on my parents' insurance, this would be a nightmare. Take care of your teeth, everyone!!",False,False
