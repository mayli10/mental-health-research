That being said, I do think that this sub will grow and become its own thing, there will be people that feel as strongly about this sub and the way it functions as we did/do about proed. Internet communities, especially ‚Äúcontroversial‚Äù ones (I.e. misunderstood in our case) are constantly ebbing and flowing. I‚Äôve been on so many different platforms over the years (ed MySpace, seriously ...) they are constantly changing, but ultimately the communities all serve to support and that is what‚Äôs important. With such a huge population we‚Äôll never all be in the same place, but I do think we can create safe spaces... ",False,False
