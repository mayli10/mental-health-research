I think the age and personal opinions of the therapist effects the diagnosis more than what you actually have is. Honestly, it's all bullshit and more or less the same. I'd just try and get them to delve deeper if they give you something that requires medication and not worry about a label since in 20 years all the information and names and treatments will probably morph anyway. Maybe just try to focus on areas of your life you're seriously struggling with and try not to focus so much on naming whatever is causing it.",False,False
