I buy microwaveable packets (350-400g), pierce it a bit and microwave for 6/7 mins.   It’s so versatile and love calorie, the creamy flavour can easily blend into a great soup (perhaps a bit of unsweetened soy milk), a shirataki sauce (I add some herbs and silken tofu), but it tastes incredible by itself with just a pinch of salt (steamed, raw is a bit odd).  Honestly I was always sure it’s high calorie because it’s so creamy and flavour full, but after looking up the calories for it I was shook! It’s truly a blessed food lol.",False,False

If you’re enjoying fruit and what bugs you is the notification, maybe the answer is getting rid of the notification.
