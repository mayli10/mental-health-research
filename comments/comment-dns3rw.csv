I don't know what it's like where you are but here big supermarkets will normally have a drop off point for them and take pretty much anything. I can't stand food waste and this is the only way of dealing with it that doesn't make me feel massively guilty/ wasteful. If it's something the food banks won't take I usually bring them into work and leave them in the canteen so either someone else will eat them or at least someone else will throw it out so I can pretend I didn't waste it.......,False,False

I store even a spoonful of leftover rice.  When I have food I don't want I take it to class with me, there's always someone hungry around.

If I know that the food is something I can't eat a small amount of and be satisfied (and assuming these packets are unopened), I:  * Put them in a place that is annoying for me to access, such as in the pantry (which we have to lock because of pets), the car boot, the shed/garage, or the freezer if it's a food that can be frozen. The mental barrier this puts between me and the food is usually enough for me to stop fixations when they're starting. Putting the food within several containers (e.g. within a bag that I tie shut inside another bag I tie shut in a locked cupboard, taped up so that I would have to cut it open, etc etc) (hooray for using executive dysfunction to my advantage!) * Ask someone to hide them for me, meaning I would have to ask them to get them for me if I wanted them, which is a shame barrier that will again help if my fixation has not gotten too bad (this only works if you know someone who understands the situation enough to hide food for you - an alternative, if you live with other people, is to put the food in a common area where you'll have to walk past others to access them) * Give the food away to a friend or loved one * If it's a food that is safe for them to eat, I will feed it to my neighbour's chickens, but this of course requires that you have access to omnivorous animals * If it's a food that I KNOW will trigger a bigger binge, and I KNOW that I'm not in a position to eat just a small amount and I KNOW that I will not stop fixating on them, then I am left with two choices: throw the food away, or eat it. Before I decide, I try and calm myself down so that I can make the decision rationally.   Usually, I eat something else first. Sometimes a food that is similar to what I'm craving works best (e.g. if I'm craving choc chip cookies, then I eat something sweet), sometimes the total opposite works best (e.g. I eat some pickles).    I make myself a cup of tea.   I tell myself something like, ""Okay, I've made the rational, non-binge decision to eat some of this food. But first, I'm going to wait 15/10/5 more minutes (whichever is least anxiety-inducing), and if I still want them after that time is passed, *then* I can eat them."" If I can, I repeat this a couple more times. Sometimes I'll find that after repeating this a couple more times, I've calmed my food-related anxiety enough that I am no longer compelled to eat them.   If I do still really want them, though, then I take what I think is a reasonable amount and I destroy the rest. (Personally, I can't keep open packets of binge-trigger food in the house because I know I will obsess over them in a way I won't obsess over sealed food.) If at any point I feel like I could stop eating then I try to listen to that and dispose of the rest, because eating past satiety is another binge trigger for me. * And of course sometimes I destroy the whole packet without eating any and sometimes I eat the entire packet, because binge eating is a symptom of broader issues and sometimes I just have to take the L because the alternative self-harm for whatever is triggering my binge eating might be worse than just eating a sleeve of cookies. * If I do end up binging, then I try really hard to focus on getting back to ""normal"" the next day rather than trying to overcompensate by fasting or low restricting (which just makes me binge more, doi).  Or you could give them to me bc those vegan oat cookies sound good!!! ðŸ‘€",False,False
