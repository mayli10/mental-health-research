I try not to ruminate too much on my remaining flaws because I canâ€™t afford to get more work done &amp; Iâ€™m afraid that Iâ€™ll end up with a botched surgery if I donâ€™t quit while Iâ€™m ahead... ðŸ˜¬ Instead of going under the knife again, Iâ€™ve spent a lot of time learning makeup techniques to camouflage the features I dislike and emphasize what I do like about myself.  Thereâ€™s an enormous (probably 6â€™ x 6â€™) full-length mirror in my basement and I tend to alternate between obsessively body checking hundreds of times a day or avoiding mirrors entirely, but when things are bad, I can barely bring myself to shower because I hate looking at my body.",False,False
