For example I've never liked very greasy/slimy/oily food. However, if my enjoyable junk food, treats and sweets start to gross me out, that's jut where my mind is with the ED, and trust me it doesn't tend to last long. My tastes change is all, and I won't prefer cerain things, but I'm not genuinely disgusted.   If I go out with friends and they get unhealthy food, I won't give a flip but I won't eat because a) I won't like it, or b) I'm purposely refusing because of my ED.",False,False

Whenever I go to a conventional grocery store to stock up on bottled water (gotta have Acqua Panna since it comes in glass bottles &amp; my husband wants us to avoid BPA), I’m struck by how 90% of the food is inedible. I don’t really regard it as real food, just preservative and sugar-laden chemical slop.   Commercials for fast food/junk make me angry ( and sometimes queasy - I have a lot of severe food intolerances due to a GI disorder &amp; I imagine how awful my stomach would feel if I ate gluten/dairy/trans fat, etc.) to the point where most of the time I’ll change the channel or at least hit the mute button, but sometimes I’ll make myself look at gross food to keep myself strong during my fasting window.",False,False

Omg, that's heaven.  Drop me off at a vacated Carl's Jr. for a binge and I'd probably say ""No thanks, today just became a fasting day"", but drop me off at a vacated bakery?
