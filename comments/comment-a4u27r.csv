Even though the urge to binge (or drink, use a drug, any other addictive behavior) feels urgent and so powerful, the feeling *will* pass if you don’t do the behavior. For most people the urge starts to subside after 10-20 min, but everyone’s different.  For example, I’ll break it down for how it might go for me:  1) I’m at home, feeling body conscious and generally crappy when I remember there’s granola in the kitchen. Shit. Now I want some granola. But I know if I get a handful, I’ll want a bowl. And milk. And it’ll turn into a huge binge. By this point I’m starting to feel overwhelmed. Like the binge is inevitable...  2) I remind myself that it’s not inevitable. Ive taken no action yet. I have a lot of sensations, tension, anxiety, and urgency, but I know urges aren’t permanent. So...  3) I put on my favorite tv show. I’m not going to even consider giving into the craving until I finish an episode (about 22 minutes). Over the next 10 minutes, my panic and urgency settles into something manageable. By the time the credits roll, things are worlds better.  Obviously, it’s a skill that you’ve got to practice as it’ll get easier in time. But that’ll be true with really anything. And the first time to successfully surf that binging urge, it feels amazing!    ",False,False

There are medications that really can help with it or underlying issues. I would also recommend not trying to diet/restrict for a while as that will help me feel less deprived and I will binge less. If you can identify some foods that trigger a binge that's great. For instance I couldn't eat Reese's cups for about 10 years, I still don't keep peanut butter in the house cause as soon as I eat those I won't stop eating.  Finally if you are craving a food, enjoy it guilt free instead of trying to replace it with a low cal often, which can trigger a binge (for me at least). For instance you want a Cajun Black &amp; Bleu burger from that place you love, enjoy it calmly at the restaurant instead of eating a veggie burger with skinny cow cheese on a skinny bun at home where you're more likely to binge. I hope that makes sense. Good luck! Sending good vibes your way.",False,False
