Doughnuts, burgers, oysters, bread, Thanksgiving buffet. Literally stuffed myself. I was horrified to come back and weigh myself but when I did I found Id lost 2lbs. We were walking around so much and staying out all day with no down time and it somehow reversed the food haha. Enjoy your vacation. You want to be able to look back and think how much you enjoyed it not how much weight you did or didnt gain.",False,False

So what I did is I had a salad with every meal (even at breakfast) because itâ€™s low cal and you can pack a plate full and no one will ask questions.  Take advantage of the abundance of fruit and veggies!!!  Knowing that I couldnâ€™t weigh myself made me eat less I found because I was so worried about not knowing my weight that Iâ€™d gain.  Also, I did SO much walking while on my vacation it helped ease my mind slightly.  Try to enjoy and relax on your vacation ðŸ’—",False,False
