I have, for the most part, found stability in my disorder. Unfortunately I have gained to an unhealthy weight again, but I don’t pass out in the shower anymore, and I no longer burst into an emotional meltdown if a friend asks me to dinner, and can even eat a full meal in public. It’s hard being tubby again, but it was much harder not living being skinny. I hope that for you too, soon 💕",False,False

I’ve been on both ends too. I was skinny then rly skinny and then to being Large and now drifting in the middle trying to get rid of my binge eating.  My doc doesn’t take me seriously bcos I’m chubby so yeah I completely understand.   Honestly it’s “everyone want they can’t have” situation when it comes to height. Like yeh u right I’d kill for your height being *almost* 5ft1 😭 You’re height is what every top model is around the world! So work it!!!   Thank you jpiggie, this really means a lot 🥺❤️",False,True

I’ve been on both sides of the scale, but more so bigger the majority of my life, so here’s my perspective on that. It’s insecurity-based on their part. Being fat not only hits you in the self esteem, but it affects how society treats you, as well. Having grown up fat, life was cruel. When I developed my restrictive ED and lost a severe amount of weight, it was like I was in a whole new world. People suddenly opened doors for me, old people smiled at me, everyone was generally nicer to me in every circumstance. But, before I lost tons of weight, my ED wasn’t even taken seriously by my therapist or doctor. But I’ve been where you have, too. I had the mind set that once I lost weight I would be happy and love the attention. After the first few compliments, it sent me into a self hatred hole. My self esteem didn’t get any better. I still find myself being like one of those people around you when dealing with height since I’m tall. I always think the short girls should be grateful they’re short because they can wear heels to their wedding and out dancing without being a tree,  they have more options with guys who aren’t the tallest but still taller than them, etc. Whereas some girls would kill to be my height just to be able to reach something on a top shelf.  Now circling back around, you should be taken seriously and have your issues be validated. And I’m sorry that they haven’t been. At the end of the day, it’s about us all having a bit more understanding of each other’s experiences in life and situations. Hoping those around you begin to understand a little bit more.",False,False
