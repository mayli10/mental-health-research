What's the point, if it has to happen? I'd rather just do it.   Wishing you the best of luck too! I hope recovery is smooth and you never have to do it again! ",False,True

You may as well try harder.   I often think of that when it comes to recovery. Itâ€™s going to be hard and hurt, Iâ€™m going to be anxious - why not face the fear head on and tackle it instead of dancing around it? Dancing around it doesnâ€™t solve anything and it still feels painful.   Be careful! Iâ€™m glad youâ€™re doing this under supervision. ",False,False

Better to rip the bandaid off so to speak. Though it may not be the healthiest for me as it does result in bingeing and overeating, and an eventual freakout about the weight I gained, but I guess I have to get used to it if I want to get better. I simply don't see how doing it gradually makes it any easier.   Anyway, I'm wishing you the best of luck! ",False,False

Just maybe sleep on it and decide tomorrow. We all make rash decisions sometimes when under stress so take care of yourself and amazing job on recovery x it'll take time and be a process but you can do this xx",False,False
