I had an ativan and some wine before bed last night and slept for 14 hours. I felt out of it this morning and decided today I'd binge. I binged on 4 chocolate bars and then purged, then a few hours later I did the same with a beer and a big bag of jalapeno Doritos. My nose and face feel totally full of mucus, jalapeno nacho dust, and hoppy IPA. Even though I feel gross, I still feel almost high from it. ",False,False
