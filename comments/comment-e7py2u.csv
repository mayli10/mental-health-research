Like LOGICALLY I CAN, like most people at social events where food is served... just grab a bit of the food, don‚Äôt second think it, socialize, maybe even not finish everything they put on their plate.

And I nursed those drinks for 3 hours. Didn't make an ass of myself üëç.  Wear the good dress and pace your drinks ‚ù§Ô∏è. It's hard but doable.",False,False
