I‚Äôm in grad school rn for counseling psych and we actually talked about this in one of my classes this semester. As a therapist their training isn‚Äôt in nutrition or exercise and it‚Äôs okay to ask about that stuff if it‚Äôs necessary to do a risk assessment, but honestly that‚Äôs not in her competence. I saw someone else mention filing a complaint and it might be worth, her giving specific diet advice can be so dangerous! Your state gov will have a licensing board and that‚Äôs where complaints would go if you decided to do that. If you can find a specialist it‚Äôs so much better, my last T didn‚Äôt know anything about eds but who I see now specializes in ed and body image and she‚Äôs so much better. We never talk about my specific eating habits or my numbers, we focus more on the underlying needs I fulfill with restricting and losing and stuff like that. It‚Äôs so much better than the last person I saw who would ask ‚Äúwhy don‚Äôt you want to eat?‚Äù all the time. Good luck!",False,False

I‚Äôm not quite sure where to report, but I‚Äôll look into it. I would hate it if other people got this kind of advice in therapy. Depending on the person, it could really do some damage.

A therapist usually has a degree in psychology, and is therefore no dietitian. So everything a therapist tells you about nutrition is his/her opinion and as good as ours her on reddit.  Screw that, their pinion is probably worse because we put research into our diets...  A therapist who isn't aware of the limits of his/her knowledge and ability can't be a good therapist.

That's super inappropriate for a mental health professional to start giving nutrition advice and telling someone with an ED to go on an intense diet. That's fucked up of her.,False,False

Paleo diet was physically healthy for me but it comes at the expense of social/emotional health if I'm truly strict about it. and social/emotional health is often even more important than optimizing the end range of physical health. therapists should know that better than anyone. especially when she's talking to people already prone to perfectionism.,False,False

I went to one for a while for my problems and her biggest suggestions were ‚Äúwake up early‚Äù and ‚Äúcreate a morning routine‚Äù  Meanwhile I have had waaaay more progress with my new one versus the old. Less chit chat about day to day life and more deeper dives into why I am the one way I am and how to self-soothe in better ways.   Lots and lots of worksheets, guided meditations and inner child work. It sounds hokey but I can‚Äôt tel you how many times I‚Äôve spent a large part of our session bawling and then having a breakthrough and then just going home emotionally exhausted. I now have to schedule sessions closer to the end of the day because I can‚Äôt go back to work or workout afterwards. I usually just curl up on the couch or in bed with tea and zone out or read, I‚Äôm so wiped.  I never understood people calling therapy work until this one.

I would maybe look for a new therapist if I were you. Giving you advice on what diets to follow is outside her competency and kinda unethical, especially the whole refined sugar thing.
