He had no right making comments on you or your appearance, and while it's possible to support someone in an inappropriate place if they stumble, that scenario does not sound right to me at all.  Now, fair enough, I'm hyper vigilant due to past trauma, but even objectively your concerns are entirely valid. Ways that you've been spoken to, about and treated have left you feeling awkward and violated, and you shouldn't dismiss that. It's entirely your choice where you take this, and I don't know how secure your relationship with your bf is (which affects how much you share with him). At the very least, if you feel confident it would be best to have a discussion with your bf about how uncomfortable you are with things that have been said, even without mentioning the physical contact. On the other hand, if you think you'd be supported by him, tell him about the rug incident and put plans in place with him to ensure you're not left alone with/near his dad in future. If you don't want to address it head on, that would be a better option and would still keep you safe.  Either way, you need to think about protecting yourself, and asking for help with that. You're valid, and worth respect; you're certainly worth more than some sleazy comments and non-consensual touching. Please take care of yourself and stay safe ♥️",False,False
