I'm proof of it lol. My lifts got stronger while at an extreme deficit. I would say though, if you find yourself sore everyday with no let up, or that it only gets worse, after the first couple weeks, up your protein or overall calories as much as you can stand to. Lifting is so good for you! The traditional weights, like squats, deadlifts, simulate things you do in real life and are very helpful",False,False

It won’t be as much as if you were at a surplus though.   Further, what you eat and when you eat it will play a big role in your muscle building. Eating starchy carbs before and after working out will increase how much muscle you gain/give you better body composition. Try to eat as many grams of protein as your weight in lbs (so like 130g protein for 130lbs body weight), and eat it spread out throughout the day. And preferably, don’t fast on your workout days, even if it’s like a half-day fast.",False,False
