You do deserve it! but maybe it would help in the moment to think that it is a shared experience?,False,False

You're absolutely right about giving someone else the opportunity to be excited about giving - it's one of my favourite things so why deprive someone else of it? I'm going to carry that thought over the next week and just try to enjoy the whole experience.",False,True

(That I am worthy of love. That I‚Äôm allowed to enjoy experiences.) My old ideas are super not working well for me, so I‚Äôm trying new ones :)   Another way to look at it might be that accepting a gift graciously is itself a form of giving. I mean, gift giving *can* be transactional, but it can also be a moment of connection - of saying ‚Äòyou matter to me‚Äô. Plus, think how much enjoyment gift giving brings you, even in advance of the actual present presentation! You‚Äôre giving someone else the possibility of that experience.   An experience that feels similar to me, and another place I realllly struggle is when people give a compliment - I‚Äôm working to just say ‚Äúthank you‚Äù and nothing more. No explanation or justification of why I don‚Äôt actually deserve a compliment, etc. Just eye contact, smile, ‚Äúthank you!‚Äù It‚Äôs so hard, and gives me that squirmy feeling, but surprisingly it also feels kinda amazing to let something good sink in.  I really hope you‚Äôll be able to let some good things sink in.",False,False

Yeah I'm dreading receiving gifts. And I know how I love to see people excited about getting gifts so I worry my reaction isn't adequate/grateful enough when really I'm just not a big reaction person,False,False
