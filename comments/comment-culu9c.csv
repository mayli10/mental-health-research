My son has something he really likes like carrot cake and he just stops when hes full. Its crazy.   I like to kind of credit myself for that as ive actively tried so hard not to pass on my food issues to them. I know part of my issues come from my dad beating me for not finishing my plate  I cant imagine being like that though. Like i would eat it because its there or not at all,no inbetween",False,False

At least, not a single one of my female friends has been wholly unconcerned about their weights, even if only minor dissatisfaction  One of my ex-bfs used to be obese and lost to BMI 22.4 or so, and he did talk about still having some urges, albeit manageable, to eat entire jars of peanut butter. But my last ex has stayed at BMI 19 his entire life with no awareness of calories other than what's listed on fast food menus (and he actually tries to maximize to save a bit more money). He mostly just feels full easily and on some weekends, doesn't eat until 4 pm because most days he'll have a late night snack at 12 am  My current SO used to lift heavy (like squatting 2× body weight) and all he did for gains was incorporate more chicken and broccoli, but no counting whatsoever. He also eats whatever he wants now and doesn't even want to think about food when full. No real concern over gaining 20 lbs from all the snacks I fed him (from BMI 23 to 25) and when I stopped giving them to him as often, he just went right back to his normal weight. It's not impossible,",False,False
