I feel that they're made more like men's socks than women's tbh. I know it's part of the style, but regular women's socks tend to be much thinner and with softer fabric. These ones are a slightly ribbed cotton and the opening has a very strong elastic in it. You would have to be dangerously underweight in order to wear them without any kind of bulging. I found when I was smaller that lifting them up in the back a bit could make them squeeze less for some reason, but they still weren't comfortable. I just sorta put fashion over comfort.",False,False
