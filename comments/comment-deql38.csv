He doesn't even have an ED but the switch to night shift was so hard on his body- he immediately came down with a stomach bug and a head cold, his mental health tanked, and between the weird hours and sickness he dropped like 10 pounds. It was miserable for him and his physical and mental health were totally trashed for like two weeks.  I say whether you're on nights or days, keep yourself to three evenly spaced meals a 'day' (waking period), take a multivitamin if you don't already, and pack the meals you eat with as much vitamins/nutrients as you can even if they're low-cal. We're talking spinach salads! We're talking OJ and scrambled eggs with bell peppers! We're talking fresh fruit! Sit down and figure out what foods you enjoy that are relatively non-perishable, what perishable foods make good building blocks (pre-washed spinach, for example, goes bad very quickly, but if you have salads for the first few days and then cook the rest into pasta/egg dishes and refrigerate any leftovers, that's better than letting it get slimy), and what meals you can make in large portions on your off-days and eat throughout the week when you're too tired to cook.
