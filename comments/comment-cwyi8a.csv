Knowing that a few close to me knew about it filled me with shame it was the most embarrassing secret ever. Since I “came out” it’s such a weight off my shoulders. I wish I’d come out sooner.,False,False

I miss being able to hide behaviors bc no one's looking for them. Now that people know I have an ED, they can use all the ED lingo with me and know I understand. Me don't like.  &gt;I hate people knowing and **i hate saying it.**  Especially this. Feels like a fuckin dirty word.",False,False

Like with those 2 people I just say ED related jokes (cause joke's on me) and they can't help but smile or leave a chuckle. With another person, they know about my self harm and when I accidentally cut myself, they make joke out of it. I don't think people take it seriously at this point. Me neither. I am ruining my body, going to school and working all at the same time. Multitasking on point",False,False

Now I don’t want to be honest with day treatment because I’m afraid they won’t help me either and will just refer me back to Res, where I didn’t quite get the help I needed either.",False,False
