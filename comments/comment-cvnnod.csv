As a kid I mixed TONS of normal chocolate milk powder with a tiny bit of milk and made ""chocolate sauce"" from it. Loved it. I also ate the powder without anything else...   A while ago I experimented with almond milk, sugar and cocoa powder (We don't have hershey's, I'm from Germany, but I always need it for baking things) or stevia/erythrit instead of sugar... but I could always taste the ""almond"" part of it.. even when it was just a tiny bit of milk. I also mixed almond milk and normal milk and didn't like it. I don't even know why since I don't mind almond  milk in my cereal...     But I have such a sweet tooth. On some days I just eat sweets all day long :/",False,True
