I plan on staying in academia as a lecturer. I'm already a tutor within the department. Some of my Philosophy PhD peers who started before me have since gone on to be civil servants or otherwise involved in politics. Some are now journalists and/or editors. A couple are economists or work in finance. One works for Google. The majority though, like myself, have stayed in academia or wish to stay in academia.",False,False

The cutoff point exists for a reason. (Same as the overweight one... been there, too)  Your athletic performance, mood, energy levels, etc, take a drastic dip if you push it much past that. Maintenance no longer helps much. Not to mention the godawful physiological hunger- I've spent more time binging back and forth from 17-19 than I've spent being at 18. ",False,False

I'm also underweight and actively restricting my calories. I find working on my PhD so much harder while underweight, and picking up choreography so, _so_ hard. I wish my brain functioned properly on fewer than maintenance calories. On the plus side, being lighter has made my jumps and leg raises higher, and my lines are looking more elegant.
