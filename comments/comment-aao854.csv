I actually do struggle with the odd involuntary feeling that's kind of mockingly mentioned here (negative feelings when I see fat people eating in public). I try to remind myself some people are very dependent on meal timing and a full work shift without food might not be ok for their blood sugar like it is for mine.  bodies are different etc etc. OMAD is my natural rhythm if I eat whenever I feel hungry so it's hard for me to visualize what it feels like to ""need"" to eat in the middle of a work shift.  so I know it doesn't make even a tiny bit of sense for me to feel weirded out by larger people eating in the work break room but I still do sometimes.",False,False

Like I didn't deserve to eat ""bad"" foods.   Now that I am at the lower end of ""healthy"" I don't mind it because (while I still believe I'm fat) I know other people perceive me as thin (because they tell me) and think ""HOW can she eat that?""

Just remember most everyone does not give two shits about what you are eating in public. The hate op expressed comes from jealousy, not disgust as it would if you flipped the post around as you did. While I feel hate is a strong word I am also extremely jealous and feel really down on myself when I see thin people eating things I know I shouldnt ever let myself eat again if I wanna be thin. But then again I also have an ed. Most people dont and dont think twice about what others are eating.   I'm also insecure about eating in public and wondering if people are disgusted by my fatness and judge what I'm eating.

I understand your frustration on this  double standard. There was a post a while back that was removed after a lot of users reported it to the mods. It was ""DAE fat shame others in public IN THEIR HEADS"" I felt it should have stayed up, but I'm not a mod.   So again, I'm still not sure what you are trying to get from this post. The mods removed the post I'm referencing because other users were reporting it.  The post you are retaliating against doesn't seem particularly hostile to me either. Maybe it didn't get reported by usuers, or maybe it wasn't reported on as much as posts referencing ""fat people"" I don't necessarily blame the mods for something that seems like a user base issue. This type of call out post usually just leads to more bickering than productive conversation.  I really do want us as a community to be able to express our intrusive thoughts with out ridicule. By that I mean, noone should encourage these types of negative thought patterns, but accept them as part of the dissorder and then maybe we can talk harm reduction. ",False,False

I didn't think the post from yesterday was from a place of ill or hurtful intentions, it seemed pretty clear to me that OP was aware of their unhealthy thought process. It was obvious to me that that that person person was trying to verbalize their intrusive and negative thoughts that they felt guilty of having.

Are you upset the original post was taken down? Or not taken down quickly enough? The mods are not on 24/7 and even then they usually only respond to things other users report. If they get enough reports on a controversial post they may choose to remove it. Like I said, I did not see this particular post, but I just really dont get this response.  If you want to open up a dialogue with the mods about the type of posts that are allowed/disallowed then great, but this seems very passive aggressive.",False,False
