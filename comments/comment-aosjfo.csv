(Fruit breakfast, cheese sandwich at lunch, meat starch dinner, diet soda snacks) and I would binge every night. Why? Because my body was starving for nutrition!   Do you find that you tend to not like foods and thats why you stick to what you do? Or is it a cost issue? Just not knowing how to cook? I'm just curious.   I love Aldi because they have great prices and lost of fresh produce. I look up recipes online, and I've been using skinnytaste.com for years. Sometimes I have to adjust her portions though because she is like 5' and I'm 5'7"" and my husband is 6'. Anyway.   The first thing I want to say about your nutrition is maybe try a higher protein breakfast. Greek yogurt, eggs/eggwhite, bacon, prosciutto etc. I would even play around with a snack between meals. So eat your breakfast then maybe eat that apple a couple hours later.   Then personally I like a veggie heavy lunch with a portion of meat. So a leafy salad, zucchini noodles, roasted cauliflower sweet potatoes brussle sprouts (use some oils to cook, start around a tsp and work from there or the spray cans work well) I sometimes add a whole grain or starch to my lunch. Then maybe another small snack, cucumber/carrots dipped in something (greek yogurt dressings are my favorite)   For dinner I eat a startch or whole grain, meat and veggies. If you follow the current US government ""my plate"" you want about half your plate to have veggies it, 1/4 your carb/startch/grain and 1/4 meat/protein. Then I usually have a ""dessert"" or ""treat"" type snack after dinner. Icecream(probably halo top for me but I do get real ice cream sometimes) or fiberone brownie, smart pop pop corn or anything I might have on my craving list, I just try to moderate that because if I go cold turkey on them I will binge.   I am a pretty big believer in a moderate/lower carb style diet. I'm sure your endo has good info about ratios of carbs for your meals. I use to work with a women who has type 1 diabetes and the endo always had great hand outs/recipes etc.   **Remember to eat a green thing everyday** -wise words of the liquor store attendant in Dazed &amp; Confused",False,False

Instead of just Apple for breakfast make a fruit salad, have banana and berries with it, or make a smoothie. Instead of ham and cheese sandwich why not try ham and cheese salad? Make a bed of mixed lettuce, grated carrot, cherry tomatoes and cucumber, maybe some peppers (or onions, if you like them) then put the ham and cheese shredded on top. Put a simple light olive/balsamic dressing on it. Meat and potatoes sounds fine for dinner but add some more veggies. Peas, broccoli, carrots etc. You don‚Äôt mention what type of meat it is, but i would think 50% of them (or more) should be white meat or fish.",False,False

But this will give you some more nutirents to help your health. I am not a dietician, I have an ED. Sticking to your general diet If I were in your situation i would do this:  Bfast- apple and (add another fruit, yogurt, and/or oatmeal)  Lunch- Ham, spinach, (add other condiments here), whole wheat wrap (some come with flax seeds and are full of nutrients) or whole wheat bread   Snack- diet soda   Dinner- meat, green veg, potatoe  I hope this helps a bit, a good rule of thumb is try to eat the rainbow, meaning different colored foods have different nutrients in them so the more colors you eat the more varied butrients you are getting üçìüççüçêüçáüçâüçä",False,False
