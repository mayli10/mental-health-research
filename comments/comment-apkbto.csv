I just know that I’m ashamed of my c/s behaviors, and I’ve been doing it for years, way before I even realized that it was what I was doing or that it had a name, and it’s hard to break the habit. My dietitian actually didn’t seem all that concerned with it, honestly. She was always more concerned with my other restrictive behaviors over it. I would be more concerned about the b/p in your case, but that’s just my 2 cents. ",False,False

I'm on a BIG ol' b/p kick right now and c/s has somewhat helped me wean off, but my therapist almost seems more concerned with my c/w than my b/p, so I'm curious. ",False,False

It turns into a gross habit and it’s addictive, and it makes it harder to lose weight because of insulin spikes. I’m literally so ashamed of my c/s habit and wish I could go back in time and not start. ",False,False
