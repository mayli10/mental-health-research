For the past week I've been eating like shit in an attempt to make restricting (and failing at doing so) until I'm no longer at a surplus ""enjoyable"". My appetite naturally landed my day at 1300 calories (I burn 2000 a day) today, and this is the first day I haven't maintained that 3,000 calorie surplus. Obviously eating like shit makes you feel like shit, so no surprise I've felt like hot garbage the entire past week. I finally weighed in today and faced the scale, though, because I'm determined to resume eating healthily, and was even considering forgiving the 3000 calorie surplus so that I'd be less triggered to eat garbage  To my surprise I actually lost weight-- only 1 lb, but still, it's a new lowest weight. And now I'm kind of scared and sad I've been treating my body like garbage for the past week by not eating right and giving it good fuel. I track my intake and log what I burn from running, but I don't take being at school all day/weightlifting into account because I don't really know how to track those and I'd rather underestimate than potentially overestimate. But it makes me equally nervous to think I'm not eating enough as it does to be at a surplus. I guess it's stressful because I just want things to work logically, calories in &amp; calories out, but I don't know how to account for every detail.  I don't want to continue to restrict until I catch up to the surplus because I don't want to deprive myself, but also, I want to ""overcome"" the math/surplus. But these two things aren't lining up and I don't know if it's ok. You know?",False,False

I’ve been paying for weekly sessions with a therapist to help myself get through the skin-crawling struggle of living in my body.   I’ve gained 13 pounds over two months and watched as my coworker has lost 15 over those same two months. Yesterday I had to show up for my family’s yearly pictures and look at the chubby person in those pictures wearing my clothes. Today I finally had to spend $125 to replace my favorite jeans in two sizes up because my thighs rubbed the inside seam open from the past few weeks of stuffing myself into them like too much sausage.  For two months I chose the prospect of food not consuming my every waking thought over being comfortable in my body. I decided that the tiredness, the mental anguish, the infuriating brain fog was not worth the body I want.   Today, I give up.   Sup, bitches. It’s relapse time. Love you all.

In summer camp at the age of fifteen, I met this girl. She was a year younger than me, and in a different program that was shorter than mine (2 weeks vs 8). Our groups went out on a 10 day mountaineering trip together.   This was an intense extreme sports camp for kids who were really keen. She was the only other girl I'd even seen in over a month, lol. I wasn't even really out to myself, but I'm sure it was a dead giveaway to the staff, when I had zero interest in the 10 new boys who were in that group with her, lol. All of us were fixated on her. You could just smell the hormones in the air. (Literally, after about 3 days out in the bush...)  She was athletic and gorgeous. I was portly (despite being fit enough to be there) and awkward enough to make Tina Belcher look smooth. Badly fitting clothes, frizzy hair, the whole deal. The first night, before we went out into the mountains, she sang for me and showed me her sketch book full of Lord of the Rings fan art, which outed me to myself once and for all.   Remembering my obvious attraction looking back hurts. It physically hurts, lol. Most of those boys were none too kind to me (easy target, as I was socially inept and meant to be in a leadership position of sorts), and they all 110% fucking knew. I stuttered extra around her. I always jumped to point it out if she said something clever or amusing.   As it happened, she had a rough time on that trip. She turned out to be the least fit of the bunch (even though she was a competitive triathlete- most of our companions were 17 year old male military cadets)  and was happy for the positive attention from me. She did plenty of things to encourage it, and while I was savvy enough to know what was up, and resented her a little at the time, I certainly don't resent her now. I'm sure that summer is ultimately as cring-ey a memory for her as it is for me, lol. She basically slept on top of me, and huddled up next to me when we were camped at too high an altitude for a fire, etc. The boys sniggered. I didn't care. She was kind to me, and sang like an angel, and it turned out that she also had a penchant for reciting poetry, which wasn't something anyone else there thought was cool at all, lol  She was also going to my high school that fall.   ...yeah. On to **part 2**  I want to preface this by saying that I don't in any way judge this woman now for anything that went down, and didn't judge her then. We were kids being kids. She handled things extremely well imo.   It was bad. It was so, so bad, lol. Sometimes I trailed after her and the million friends she immediately acquired. Sometimes I awkwardly kept my distance, but would try to start a conversation with her via facebook or across the hallway. Eventually I got to be too much of a self aware, stammering mess, and avoided her for three weeks, before outing myself to her (and the school) by shouting at her across a hallway and running away. (Fortunately, it was a very chill school, and I was not ostracized for my homosexuality; merely for my sheer, painful, nails down a chalkboard awkwardness)   She was very kind about it, bless her. Though obviously, she continued to keep me at arms length, as before. I knew that any vain hopes that things might be otherwise were just that, but it still stung when she got a boyfriend- even though he didn't go to the same school, lol. I punched a hole in my bedroom wall that I forgot about until I was moving out years later and taking down the poster that covered it. It was not the first hole I would ever put in drywall, but certainly the most eyeroll worthy.   **Happy ending**: at the end of high school, I got a girlfriend from a nearby school. Again, this was a really progressive school, so we were open about it, and all was fine and dandy. I was way more into her than I ever was into the girl I just told this story about.   **Less than happy ending**: About 11 months later, myself and said girlfriend ran into high-school-crush on the bus. We made small talk, and after my gf and I got off, I casually mentioned to her that that was the girl I'd made such an awkward fool of myself with.  To which my gf responded, ""geez, that's so fucking you; you always go way out of your league..."" with a tone of absolute disgust. (That was not a good relationship, and holy shit could I ever go on about it, but that's a 10k word tangent, easy...)  **Epilogue, six years later**: My younger sister had just moved away to the same University that High-School-Crush had gone to. In the same faculty, no less. This woman is still on some of my social media, and shows up in my feed now and again, being as much of a hardcore badass as I now also am ;) So I message her on facebook messenger, telling her about my sister and asking if she had any insider tips.   Even though the app hadn't been a thing when we were in high school, it still had our facebook DMs from that time on it. Because fuck me, I guess.   They're not *long* one- sided conversations. They're not *that* desperate. It could have been a lot worse. Nothing that came close to harassment or anything. But... just... like... oh god, ok, I'm late for where I gotta go today, and I need to drive so I can't have a breakfast beer to take the edge off the memory, so I'm just gonna leave it at that, lol. Thanks for letting me procrastinate on driving across the city to run a (non-ED motivated) 20k on my period (which just came back, to my great relief) in subzero weather XD",False,False
