I would religiously exercise in private. I found it difficult to even go for a walk for fear of someone seeing me and judging how unfit I was. I would spend hours doing workouts in my bedroom or climbing up and down the stairs when no one was home. I was underweight and objectively fit, but my Ed made me feel so ashamed about my body I couldn't handle the thought of anyone seeing me workout.   Now I go to the gym, I still feel very self conscious because I'm now on the larger end of the scale, but as of gotten older I'm able to look past my shame a bit more and just do the things I want/need to do.",False,False
