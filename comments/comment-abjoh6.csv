It means a lot to have other people who truly understand and get it. I like your idea about putting more effort into other areas.. like actually trying to do something with my hair or makeup etc üòÇ I‚Äôve started to do my nails every week and it sounds small but it helps me feel more out together in a way lol. May need to invest in some nice skin care or makeup for myself!,False,True

It's totally normal to gain a lot of weight in a short time span after a period of restriction. A lot of it is going to be water, the body retains it to help with the repair work that's going on. As for when your period is going to return, sometimes it can take months of maintaining a healthy BMI and proper nutrition to get it back. I've always gotten mine back within a few weeks but everyone is different.   As for body image, I feel ya, it's the most awful part of the process for me. It is said that it is the last thing to go back to ""normal"" (whatever that is) when recovering. What helps me is wearing my most comfortable clothes on shitty days, and also taking extra good care of my skin and hair. Spending some time on makeup (I don't often wear it when I'm deep in my ED) also makes me feel a bit better about myself. ",False,False

When I first went in recovery after my period stopped, it took about 2 months to get it back and I was constantly bloated and +6 kg and kept going up. After I got my period back (very irregular tho), all the bloat and weight normalised to 2-3 kg above my normal weight due to water/food.    What I learnt is - you did A LOT of damage to your body already and it needs to fix itself now. It has a lot of work to do, so ""collecting"" fat is not priority. ",False,False

The needing to buy new clothes can be especially hard.  I use the BMI metric to decide what a ‚Äòhealthy‚Äô zone is for me. I know some people don‚Äôt like BMI, but it works for me. If you decide your recovery weight overshot what you‚Äôre comfortable with at the present time you can slowly lose a few pounds while maintaining good nutrition. But you might also just need a little time to adjust to a slightly different body.  I‚Äôd also try to look at metrics of health beyond how your clothes fit. Can you be more active without feeling dizzy or exhausted? Is your heart rate more stable? Can you focus and remember things better?  Best of luck.",False,False
