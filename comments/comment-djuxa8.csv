Just be patient though, sometimes it can take days for the body to let go of that water and thatâ€™s totally normal. My last major binge was on Monday Iâ€™m still not back to baseline, and I donâ€™t expect to be for at least a few days.   Other things that can help speed the process up are taking a fibre supplement regularly, taking a diuretic, bromelain to speed up digestion, and a digestive enzyme. You can get all of those in health food stores or on Amazon.",False,False

My binges are definitely worst when I consume more bread and other high carb stuff than when I eat other kinds of food. So the best way to go back is to sweat it out and drink a bunch of water?,False,True

Keep in mind that for every gram of carbs you consume, your body holds on to four grams of water. That adds up super fast. Thatâ€™s why itâ€™s always a good idea to make sure youâ€™re staying hydrated and drinking lots of water and electrolytes while youâ€™re binging, as this will help the bloat pass more quickly.",False,False

My binges are always upwards of 20,000 kcal. Your body doesnâ€™t turn that into fat overnight, you can always undo the damage before it has a chance to stick around.",False,False

I think it might be a side effect of yo-yo-ing although I never had a major weight loss/gain in a short period of time so Iâ€™m a bit at loss here.,False,True

I try really hard to stay positive and I donâ€™t weight myself as much so that I donâ€™t trigger myself but my body changes a lot when I cheat. Iâ€™ll feel the extra fat rolls while doing my exercises in the morning and it freaks me out. Iâ€™ve started a journal so that I can write down how I feel during my binges so hopefully that will help me. Thanks for your comment, I really appreciate it!",False,True

I had never been told that the body fat doesnâ€™t change when you binge (unless itâ€™s more than 3500 of course). Itâ€™s somewhat comforting to hear.,False,True

You could schedule a DEXA scan, itâ€™s non-medical, super quick and easy, and it measures your body fat, muscle mass, bone density, lots of different stuff. Takes about twenty minutes.   The quickest and cheapest way is to order a callipers from Amazon or somewhere similar, it comes with instructions on how to use it, itâ€™s really easy, and very accurate if you do it correctly.   And yes, you can get a smart scale that measures everything a DEXA scan does, mine is called the Qardio scale but there are lots of different options. Itâ€™s very accurate and very sensitive to any changes, ie, if you go up a few grams of water weight it will tell you. Honestly mine improved my quality of life exponentially because now if the number on the scale goes up I donâ€™t have to torture myself about getting fat, like itâ€™s still not pleasant coming to terms with it, but knowing itâ€™s water weight or muscle gain is a massive relief. I really recommend getting one if your disorder is numbers-focussed like mine is.",False,False
