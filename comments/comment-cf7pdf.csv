My eyes don’t work right, none of my instincts about food are correct, and my brain is always trying to kill me. Makes me feel completely defective as a person.   Long story short, I feel you. I’m sorry you feel like this because it’s awful, but you’re not alone.",False,False

People don't realize how damaging things like that can be.  Once, someone told me you're fat once your stomach protrudes past your tits. Yeah, except I was like 12 and I've never had any real tit, so cue me constantly feeling way too fat because my stomach wasn't fucking concave. This is a bullshit measurement.  And yeah, it sucks to look in the mirror and see something different every time. I'm a little ways past my calorie-restricting days (I could no longer climb short flights of stairs without frequent breaks and decided to force myself to try to recover) but I still have that mirror bullshit in my head.  Honestly, if you ever need to rant, I'm here for you, even if you don't know me.",False,False
