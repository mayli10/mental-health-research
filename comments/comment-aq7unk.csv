I was hospitalized and out of school for a week. Only 2 friends knew of this.   By the time I returned to school people would whisper about me. Look at me then look away quickly when I noticed. Finally asked someone wth and was told that “your the girl that tried to kill herself right?”  I was devastated and embarrassed and yeah.
