I‚Äôd love to have some meat-free meals some days :)   This is not related but do you know how to make seitan without chickpeas? I have vital wheat gluten but most recipes online involve chickpeas which obviously increase the carb count and also don‚Äôt agree with my stomach at all!  ,False,True

Finally got sick of being bloated too. My skin suffered as well and of course I gained like 10lbs b y e. The hardest part of going back for me was just the cravings tbh.
