When I was in high school, I was super athletic (competitive swimmer) and a coach once told me to always do 2 things:   1.) First thing in the morning and last thing before bed, drink a full glass (16 oz) of water. (That alone is 50% of your daily water needs). I‚Äôd just chug it.  Idk that my stomach could handle that now, but it was quick and easy.   2.) Bring a water bottle (like a Nalgene or Hydroflask - 20+ ox) with you everywhere and make sure you finish it at least once throughout the day.   I should start that up again, but the full glass in the am/pm used to be an absolute essential part of my daily routine, and it really isn‚Äôt hard to do.    For me now, idk why I haven‚Äôt been able to commit to it again. And this post kinda felt like an aha moment for me a I really never consciously decided to avoid drinking water, but I totally do. And I have no idea why - it makes no sense at all, I‚Äôm sure we all know that water is 0 calories and will help shed and bloating or water weight, etc. There‚Äôs no logical reason to avoid water for weight-loss purposes, and yet, I‚Äôm pretty sure I don‚Äôt even drink 8oz per day at this point. Wtf! :(",False,False

I don't really like the TV static type of water like la croix. Clear American also sells that type as well in can form but the bottle version is the non TV static type.

Do you have a sort of routine to remind yourself to drink? I seem to drink water one day like it's going out of style and then some days I don't drink single thing for a day or 2 in a row. The only thing that gets me drinking water again is when I get cotton mouth from hell from not drinking for a day or 2. It's really frustrating cause I'm sure my dizziness would go down a little from standing up and stuff If I just properly drank.,False,False
