I tell me friends i can’t join them as I’m too poor and I’m an adult so I don’t have to join my fam on their vacations but I could go for free. But I would rather not. Someone was saying how they wished they had anorexia and I was thinking “firstly da fuk and secondly, really, you want the prospect of a vacation to stress u out so much that you don’t go ??”",False,False
