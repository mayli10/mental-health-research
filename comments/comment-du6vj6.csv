As for overweight people it is difficult to just “eat less”, it is also difficult for skinny people to “just eat more”. It is really difficult to gain healthy weight and maintaining it.",False,False

Yeah those one who do backhanded brags can fuck off, i thought you were talking about simply peeps who happen to be slim and don’t realize their eating habits/metabolism.  Yeah, i know, i’m not recovered myself but i’m aware of that, i do really notice those nasty ass toxic shit ED peeps can say, yeah i understand where this feeling is coming from, but you are still responsible for the things you say and do, like the crazy ED gals who put sugar in their friends drinks and shit to “fatten them up” absolute bollocks, mental illness is not an excuse to be a bad person or allow it to continue.   Oh yeah i get what you mean, trigger words are like bowling bowls shaking our marbles, hey, no hard feelings, i don’t mean to hurt you but i’d want to bring to your attention, you’re better than that. Don’t let your ED turn you into an unpleasant toxic person.",False,False

What I’m saying is the “naturally thin” girls tend to gloat about it while knowing that people feel fat next to them. They don’t actually hate being thin, it’s like a humble brag.  I know my ED gives me a toxic view of women’s bodies and I hate myself for it enough. I don’t need you to tell me that, I know I have unhealthy and distorted views but I can’t help it. I deal with a lot of guilt over it as it is.  I myself get called “thicc” and I fucking hate that word with a passion. I don’t want to have these curves on my body. I’d rather have zero boobs and thighs. This sub is not for recovered people only so don’t be shocked to see “nasty” venting threads like this here.",False,True

I would binge like crazy and gain maybe a pound or 2. I thought it would be like that forever, but at about 25 my metabolism hit. The fucking. Wall. It’s not the case for all women obvi but in my experience our metabolisms DO SLOW DOWN and it’s a fucking bummer. Naturally I started restricting like crazy bc that’s logical lmao. I have no idea the age range you’re referring to, but that’s my experience.  I remember women older than me being like “you’re not fat, enjoy this while you can” and I felt like (1) I’m a whale, you liar and simultaneously (2) uhh nah I’m gonna be able to do this forever. So none of that is super inspiring lol but idk maybe sheds some light on it!   Btw I know that feel all too well and I try to remind myself that idk what they do behind closed doors. Maybe they have an ED or something, idk. It helps me not be resentful af 😂",False,False

It’s a way of fitting in. Like when my coworker says “I wish I could lose weight!” I’m like haha yeah, I have the opposite problem!   But it’s a little true? I can’t gain weight no matter how hard I try, but it’s not because I have a fast metabolism, it’s because eating is nearly impossible for me at this point in my ED, not to mention I’m on two medications that make it even more difficult. I don’t mean to make anyone feel bad, it’s just really hard for me to gain any weight because I literally can’t eat.",False,False

I have stanards for myself, i’d like to be underweight and hate being overweight on MY body, yes i’m aware i should be more accepting of myself but aye, we all here have a disorder and body dysphoria.   The only standards i have for people’s body depends on their health, i don’t HATE but rather discourage a person from unhealthy weights, being obese is bad and fucks up your quality of life and health, being critically underweight is bad and fucks up your quality of life and health.   Being black and white is irrational, curvy peeps are beautiful, thin peeps are beauitful, unfit bods are beautiful, fit bodies are beautiful ect.  But the thing is, i don’t a curves on MY body, you get me? I don’t want a feminine figure cuz gender dysphoria and blah blah blah. My issues are my issues.
