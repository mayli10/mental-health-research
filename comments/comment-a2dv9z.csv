You are spying on him and going through his laptop instead of communicating with him.  Whether that's because you're afraid to, you think he'll lie, or you just don't want to, those are not healthy relationship behaviours.",False,False

We all need a private space that we can open up in. You both chose to soothe your fears by violating each other’s privacy. Unfortunately, in the long run this will drive you apart if you continue.  If you feel that you can’t trust your partner, talk to them about it. Practicing open communication about tough subjects will ultimately bring you closer.  Also, sexuality is an incredibly private topic. Your partner seems to be going through self-discovery and you were not invited to be a part of that exploration yet. We all need time to grow privately before sharing our discoveries with other people. Sometimes we even share our growth process with a bunch of strangers on the internet long before our closest loved ones know. ;)",False,False
