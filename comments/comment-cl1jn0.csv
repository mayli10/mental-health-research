The waiting list is just because of lack of NHS funding, I hope it’s a decent place though because I could really do with some decent help.",False,True

Along with moving out, you're going to have a big culture shock, and there's a lot of shit that can go wrong (or even right) at college that could destabilize your mental health.",False,False

Alone at home, total independence on groceries and total private bathroom. It is certainly enabling for bulimia. Wanna eat 2 pizzas a huge pint of ice cream and 5 cookie packages. Why the fuck not? You can purge in the privacy of your own home after. This is exactly what has happened to me and at some point I lived FOR b/p, doing that up to 10times a day. Now I am not saying this will definetly happen to you, but uni can be very stressful and triggering in itself if you compare yourself to others alot. I would advice you to get your mental and physical health taken care of. Education is not vital, your body and brain are. I also get that you could feel super eager to move out and have your independence, but all of that and more will be waiting for you once you are better. Lots of love and stay safe.",False,False
