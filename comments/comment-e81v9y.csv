Thank you for sharing all of that, but especially that particular line.  I always feel so out of control when binging but that makes so much sense and makes me feel so much better about it - like it's something that can be managed.",False,False

Sometimes a serious external intervention is needed. Checking myself into residential is the only thing that stopped it for me personally.    Here are some things I learned in res that can help, in case it's not viable for you to go yourself right now -- I know some of them are definitely more easily said than done, so you don't have to do all of them, I just hope you find some things in the list that you can do and find helpful.    * put away your scale and cover up all full body mirrors. you can go back to weighing yourself, bodychecking, etc after a bit, just don't do it the day/week after a binge, however long you can manage.      * forgive yourself for the binge:  say it out loud. ""I forgive myself. I am not a bad person. I am not disgusting. My body was just scared and trying to survive."" try not to shame yourself! on the other hand, don't minimize either -- you're allowed to be sad, angry, ashamed -- however you feel.     * don't fast. the best way to prevent a relapse into a binge cycle or phase is resuming as normal an eating schedule as you are capable of at the moment. in my experience, if you fast, you WILL binge       * think up some coping strategies for binge urges in advance:  will you go for a walk or drive with music? will you call a friend? would doing something with your hands, like collaging or knitting, work? I like to keep lemons in the freezer to take out and peel when I get anxious / binge-y feelings.    * try to only eat at a table, off a plate. if it wouldn't trigger you, set a timer when you sit down for 15-25 minutes, and don't let yourself get up from the table before the timer is up. this helps you practice mindfulness while you eat and can stop compulsive eating.    These may or may not work. It doesn't reflect badly on you if they don't. I know it's scary and awful and I know you're doing your best. Whether or not you binge, you deserve understanding, compassion, and love. I wish you only the best.",False,False
