My great aunt insinuated at our family reunion that I should enjoy my figure now because it wouldn't last and my dad couldn't understand why I was upset by it.

They're ignorant, unintelligent and have really fucked ideas about things.  They don't know your struggle and pain and sounds like they're too dim to ever understand it.  They don't know the damage your body's taking and if they actually knew, I'd hope they'd stop the comments (but some people are just plain old dickheads anyway).  &amp;#x200B;  Sorry for the language, but this has pissed me off as well.  I know comments like this stick.  I can remember things that were said to me years ago (from people with minds like your coworker).  It's difficult to shake them off, but you know how you feel.  You've seen your chest bones.  You're not healthy or happy.  Don't let ignorant people stop you getting better.  They don't deserve that whereas you deserve an ED free life.    &amp;#x200B;  Think of them as trolls.  Their own lives must be lacking and they're unhappy and passing comments they don't even mean make them feel better.  Anyone 10lbs underweight looks underweight.   Ugh...yeah this is why I want to live in a forest with the animals.  Humans can be really too stupid to have to share air with.  Don't lose that thought about recovery.

One fucking Reese's cup is not going to do anything to you, recovered or not, and I always say this regardless of what body type anyone has: it's NO ONE's business what anyone else is eating. At the end of the day, we all have our vices. Some people restrict, some binge, some smoke, some get high, some play video games for hours, watch TV for hours, whatever. What sucks is that food is more obvious to people around you, and for whatever reason, people seem to think that's the green light to criticize others.  Don't let judgmental assholes get in the way of your health. And if you're worried about gaining, I was ten pounds underweight and maintained healthily by watching my protein/veggie intake especially. All my bloodwork was great so my doctor didn't push for me to gain. So if you want to start there, start there. You don't have to do everything all at once. In fact, I don't think that's usually effective. You can just start with one change, and once you're used to it and comfortable, add another so you're not overwhelmed.",False,False

I think it’s the fact that some of them believe that women owe a desirable physical appearance to them. Obviously not every guy is like this, but some are. That, coupled with the fact that everyone has different concepts of “ideal” bodies, makes for impossible standards to live up to.   As for the woman, she was probably jealous/rationalizing her own body insecurities. It sounds like she used to be similar in size to you. The whole “you’ll gain weight” is probably just her own justification.   Either way, it’s really frustrating. I’m sorry you had to deal with that. ",False,False
