I have symptoms similar to those in Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, but I don't know if they'd be enough to get diagnosed. My patella dislocates often, I bruise extremely easily despite all blood tests being normal, and both my hands and all my fingers are hypermobile, but I don't have any other hypermobility. I wonder the same thing as you",False,True

I got diagnosed a couple years ago with it being related to Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome but I always wonder if EDs are related somehow to EDS or if the symptoms get worse with restricting.,False,False
