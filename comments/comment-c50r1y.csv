I doubt it will tho. Like you, I've never given my emotions enough space to just be. Sometimes my friends will ask why I'm not opening up about my feelings when sad things happen and I'm just like I'm not even opening up to myself.   Its like I've taken denial to the next level and it sucks. I hope we can both work through it!",False,True

Last week my therapist wanted me to take note of the times when negative emotions sneak up on me.... well, not to worry I didn't let it happen because I spent like all my free time b/p'ing then being exhausted and falling asleep.   I guess at the very least now I am more aware of this being a crappy delaying mechanism for coping. I've just been ignoring my emotions for so long that I am unsure how to even embrace them at this point.   I'm glad you were able to figure out the role binging has played in your life. I hope you can use this information to help you get to a better place:)",False,False

That’s honestly a huge step that you figured this out- it’s a hard realization to have, but it also can be so powerful in helping to change your behavior. So much good luck to you!",False,False
