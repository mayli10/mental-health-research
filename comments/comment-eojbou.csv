A while ago (years) I wanted to open up about all this ... i thought my best friend, who was suffering from depression, would understand. He said that he doesn't want to hear it. So I didn't talk about it anymore or further... But then he  needed help and I was there for him,  helped him listened. Then he asked me how I've been feeling  and that I can talk to him too, if I ever feel the need. Yeah I do feel the need, but I don't talk to him openly anymore. I just can't.",False,False

If they canâ€™t handle you opening up about what youâ€™re struggling with then they arenâ€™t worth being friends with. Instead of being there for you and listening to you he just was insanely rude and insensitive. I understand heâ€™s going through stuff himself but if you canâ€™t stop for a second and be there for a friend then you arenâ€™t a good person or friend. Even with everything youâ€™re feeling and going through you managed to be a good friend and be there for him when he was going through his stuff. The fact that he couldnâ€™t return the favor like a normal friend would tells me he was never a friend to begin with. People like that arenâ€™t worth holding on to but that is up to you.,False,False

I cut off a friend for talking about their weight loss/dieting too much because it was so triggering to me.  I could honestly picture myself saying the same thing during a panic attack if someone was triggering my ED really bad. idk. just something to think about.",False,False

It was such a slap in the face. And because this was when we were still in school, she went around and told everyone that we just ""drifted apart"". Some people are really rude, and some people just can't handle being faced with other people's emotions and problems. Anyway there are so many more friends out there (out here even!) for you. Think about it this way, he doesn't think you deserve his time, so don't give him any more of yours!",False,False

Iâ€™m so tired of people thinking that an ED is not a valid mental illness. My ED is just as real as my depression. The fact that you listened to and supported him in his mental health struggles but he couldnâ€™t reciprocate says enough about what kind of person he is. He sounds selfish   It takes a lot to open up to someone about something like an ED and no wonder, when people react like this. Let alone a friend. If he does reach out to apologize or reconnect, he needs to know how shitty his reaction and behavior was. If your friends canâ€™t support you in the good and bad, they arenâ€™t true friends.",False,False

But after a long time, I just missed him, so I called and we talked it out and became close again. Even if it takes time, you can almost always fix things later if you reach out.",False,False

You comforted him when he shared about your mental illness but he was unwilling to offer you the same support? Don't let this make you feel bad; he's not a great person. It's normal to feel upset, but don't let it make you think this has anything to do with you. This is on him; he's selfish.",False,False
