And if you tend to binge on surgary things you can add whatever sweetener of your choice and try different flavors.  Do you exercise? I binge a lot less when I exercise. It's a natural appetite suppressant with medical literature to back that up. Obviously it won't work for everyone. But get into Youtube workouts if you'd like.",False,False

And it can help you get in the routine of planning healthier and getting on track to make sure your eating enough but not too little either. Its mostly dependent on self control. Try to focus elsewhere when hungry. Start a hobby .. or 5.. eventually it gets better. Try to stay positive!,False,False
