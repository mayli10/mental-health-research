It’s another way for me to gain back control and comfort myself through compulsive behaviours. There are definitely other sources to my ED but it’s linked for sure,False,False

Oddly the OCD for the most part now has morphed into something more like pure-O (obsessions and intrusive thoughts without compulsions, though it's gotten better in recent years) so the ED is the most prominent outward manifestation of it.

Though I still struggle to say I have an eating disorder vs. just disordered eating (if that makes sense) – I feel like all of my thoughts and actions surrounding eating stem from my OCD.   I was diagnosed with OCD in early high school but I’ve had it for as long as I can remember. For me personally, there always seems to be an extra component of obsession paired with it. When I was younger it was my grades/school work and as I got older it became more about my looks.   My OCD is paired with anxiety and I get really anxious leaving the house sometimes. I have rituals to check everything: stove, locks, my curling wand, garage, etc.   During these rituals I really feel like I have no control. Being able to control what I eat is really therapeutic in an odd way. I think the ritual aspect also relates to have certain safe foods. There’s a specific way I need to make sure the doors are locked, as there are specific foods I know are okay for me to eat. Same with counting – I’m less concerned about specific numbers but more about what feels “right” and this relates to calories as well.   TLDR: Yes. ;)",False,False

I don't know how linked they are but I wouldn't be surprised at all. The fixation on numbers, obsessiveness with food, and desire for precision at the expense of my health... well, that sounds like both those diseases to me (and I'm not quite sure how to beat either of them). :(",False,False
