It's totally understandable and I want you to be kind to yourself if/when you slip up about this ❤️ I don't want you to feel guilty about some ED relapse behaviors on top of everything else. Dealing with the assault trauma is what will help reduce your desire to purge, the purging is just a symptom.",False,False

Your university likely has resources for sexual assaults including medical and counselors: I would recommend, if you feel comfortable, at least seeing one of the counselors so you can find out what your options may be with respect to getting relief on exams (if you want) as well as some acute support over the next few days. If you don't want/can't get help from the school, please reach out to a hot line or a local organization, I can do some of this research for you if you want to DM me your location. You have told people, presumably friends/family about this and I'm sure they want to support you ❤️ sometimes people don't know how, though, and this is something the counselor/hotline/organizations can provide: info for you on things you might need, info for your support people on how they can help.",False,False

Try to talk to a counselor or therapist as soon as you can. Remember that it’s not your or your body’s fault, it’s someone else’s evil ass decision. Stay strong, stay hydrated, and please talk to a professional as soon as you’re able!!",False,False

I know coming forward about the event is extremely uncomfortable and difficult, but if you can bring yourself to do so, it may give you some wiggle room with your finals. Sorry to hear that happened to you, nobody should ever have to go through something like that.",False,False
