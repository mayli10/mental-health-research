Definitely made by someone who watched a BBC special on early 2000s pro-ana internet culture and thought, wow! Now that's a concept!   5. [For The Love Of Nancy](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=wU2T7xf7AMk)  - ONLY because Tracey Gold was recovering from an ED so they had to film it backwards so she restored her weight by the time they shot the beginning. Kinda neat to watch. All of the characters are huge bitches.    6. Best Little Girl in the World - I honestly can't find a copy of this that is even watchable. It's really fuzzy because it was a made for TV special in the 70s so good luck.   7. [Hunger Point](https://vimeo.com/137683040)  - SO BAD. SOOO BAD. ABRUPT ENDING. NOTHING IS REALISTIC. THE CHARACTERS ARE AWFUL. ACTING IS AWFUL!!! But a character does die of an ED if I remember correctly? Anyway, I yelled at my screen when I finished it because it sucked.
