They assumed it was cause I do a lot of running, I mentioned the restriction too but I wasn't that underweight when I was in the ER so I don't think they really took it seriously. I will bring up with the cardiologist when I go in October and ask for regular check ups, they'll be fitting me with a heart rate monitor to wear for a few days too.",False,True

I'm going to a cardiologist at the start of October after I had to go to the ER a few weeks ago (they did an EKG on me there and said everything was fine but id be surprised if that were truly the case) so I guess I'll wait and see next month and mabye have regular check ups!,False,True

It probably won’t resolve if you remain underweight even if you’re eating more.  It’s theorized to be caused by a combination of low metabolic rate, structural changes in the heart (your body starts breaking down heart muscle for energy just like it breaks down muscle in other parts of your body when it runs out of fat), electrolyte abnormalities (affects conduction of the electrical stimulus that tells your heart to beat) and increased vagal tone. Presence of bradycardia in anorexia greatly increases your risk of sudden cardiac death. I suggest you see a physician to have your electrolytes checked and a 12-lead EKG to check on the status of your heart.",False,False
