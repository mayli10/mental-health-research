Coffee is great for appetite curbing - I drink mine with salt and ginger (I know gross but I think it's soothing). The salt negates the bitterness a little. You can add a teeny teaspoon of organic honey to make it more bearable too.  And ice cubes always help - especially now that summer's here.,False,False

Stimulants do tend to curb appetite. Just avoid adding fake sugar, tempting though it may be since for a lot of people artificial sweeteners just delay cravings, they don't abate them.   Also in general teas taste nice, and can feel calming.",False,False
