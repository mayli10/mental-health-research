You shouldn't bother, especially if you have a heart condition.",False,False

That being said, my intake till then was trash. Not a lot, but what I did eat was trash. Takeout, candy, processed junk, soda, ect. Just stuff that your body shouldn't have too much of. I pooped like 4 times a day for a few days before I went back to normal. Just felt like laxatives but that are more intense. If I wasn't already used to laxatives I would think that my butt had broken lolol  Make sure to stay hydrated, u will be shitting out water. I haven't used them since but I lost like 6 pounds in excess waste that my fucked up bowel system couldn't get rid of until then.",False,False

You never need to cleanse your intestines (or any other internal organ for that matter) they will remove part/all of your gut flora and make you sick! The only valid reasons for an enema would be if you’re really constipated or preparing for anorectal surgery.,False,False

They sell mag. citrate at CVS which is what they use for colon preps for surgeries which would do the same thing. Also, with tachycardia I wouldnt recommend it because dehydration could make it worse.",False,False
