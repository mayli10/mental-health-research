But all of you guys really make me feel like I am not a freak. also, it's making me feel like maybe I should go to a support group irl to maybe get so friends that would really understand and that I could vent to and vice versa. I have only been here four days and I feel that it's just really cathartic to laugh at the memes and feel touched by the harsh stories and inspired by the recoveries.",False,True

I love this sub because everytime someone say they feel happier, it makes me so giddy. I love it when people are in better places because it's just so hard to live with those shitty feelings.

It did make me laugh. It was like something out of bridesmaids.   In penance I'll share my own humiliating story.   Its superbowl sunday. My sophomore year of college. My roommate and I were friends, but by this point in the year, she didn't like me anymore. So she goes out with friends, leaving me alone, with a BIG superbowl party going on in the dorm basement.   I go down, binge the FUCK out of cupcakes, candy, chips, ice cream, EVERYTHING. thank god it's dark, because I went back to that table SO many times. My stomach hurts, distended. I go and puke in the communal bathroom down the hall. Someone knocks but I'm not done, so I ignore.   Go back for more. Stumble back up 4 sets of stairs to my room, and somehow decide to pile more food down my throat. Is it physically possible? Who knows.   So this year, I have a suite mate who'd an exchange student from Hong Kong. She doesn't get bathroom etiquette.   I turn on the shower and get in. As soon as I start getting rid of everything, I hear a knock at the door.   ""Can I come in? Wash my hands?""  ""Sure.""  I wait in awkward stillness as puke pools around my fee, and she washes her hands. Finally, she leaves. I go back to business.   Then the drain clogs. Party crudites, all sorts. Awful. Puke is swirling around my ankles. The water is rising.  In a panic I shut off the shower, wrap in a towel and try to deploy the shower. Nothing is working. Hot water, snake, plunger.  Then a knock.   ""You finished? I need to shower. Tomorrow will be monday.""  I panic. There is still CLEARLY puke and the smell of backed up drain.  Without waiting for an answer she comes in. I'm crouched over the drain, trying to clear it, wrapped only in a towel.   We lock eyes.   ""The shower is broken?""  Silently, I nod.   ""I will just wash up in the sink.""  And she does it.   I'm standing there, naked, helpless, trying to hide the puke while appearing to work on the drain, awkwardly laughing about bad university plumbing. 45 minutes later, she towels off her face and legs after shaving in her pjs, then disappears back into her room.   As if right on cue, a minute or two after the door closes, the drain suddenly gurgles, burps, then, miraculously, clears.   It's almost funny that immediately, I got back in the shower to finish.   After all, can't go to bed with a full stomach, right?",False,False
