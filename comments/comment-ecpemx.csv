It's in a really loud place like a busy restaurant or if everyone on the table is talking/there's loud music playing in the background. 2. I'm with my bff who has the exact same rules to eating as mine (minimal chewing sounds, always keep mouth shut).  Any other situation where I'll have to listen to people eating sounds is TORTURE, they have no fucking manners, it's ridiculous. I met my childhood best friends after almost a year of being a recluse and was SHOCKED at how disgusted I was at one of my friends, I won't get into details cause I will sound even more like a dick. But yeah, eating with other people is hard.",False,False

My mom chewing gum in the car (she never puts music on), and my dad's old man sounds. Lemme just tell you about this thing that he does.
