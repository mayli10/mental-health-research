Stop now before you start doing irreversible damage to your teeth. Ultimately purging will lead to bigger binges since you’ll think you can undo them and you’ll gain weight anyway. If you do purge again please do not brush your teeth or use listerine immediately. Rinse your mouth out with water and baking soda to reduce the acidity in your mouth. Bulimics who start as teens tend to have much worse dental health because they don’t practice harm reduction and have to do things in secret (like purge in a bucket). But at the very very least buy some baking soda and sneak rinse when you’re done. You only get one set of adult teeth in your life.,False,False
