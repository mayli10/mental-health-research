Even if I‚Äôm on a great date or having so much fun with friends I can never let go and fully enjoy it because I‚Äôm thinking about what I‚Äôm eating or if I‚Äôm going to go home and binge etc. the only time I sort of stop thinking about it is when I‚Äôm with friends and staying at a house with them and therefore know I can‚Äôt binge and purge that night.
