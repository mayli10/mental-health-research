You have to find something you love more than bulimia. I’m an artist, and found that I didn’t have the energy or time to create when I was stuck in a cycle. It seriously doesn’t matter what the ‘thing’ is, it just has to be remotely more interesting than vomiting.  Also, I found that the cycle happens because you eat, then you throw up, then you eat again because you’re hungry again. So might as well eat it the first time, right?  Eat a low cal HEALTHY nutritious food like watermelon, that fills you up but has like no calories. Once you get used to not throwing up- switch to higher calorie healthy foods at lower portion sizes throughout the day. It’ll happen almost naturally. Also, it only takes like one day to stop the cycle. I started a timer on an app after I kept my first meal, and made myself reset it If I purged. I found I didn’t want to reset it, and ultimately fell in love with regaining my life.",False,False
