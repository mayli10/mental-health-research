I had little self confidence at the time and I was 125 at 5’4 and 17. Felt like I could get fat so I worked hard to stay skinny.   Eventually blew up to 180lbs after breaking up with my boyfriend. Was flirting with a guy who was vocal about hating fat people. I got weighed the next month and absolutely died when I found out I was obese. I was so embarrassed that I was crushing on someone so shallow this entire time.   Got into a deep depression and came to the conclusion that everyone thinks being fat is bad. That why all the mistreatment and bad stuff that happened to me was because I was fat. So I wanted to be skinny enough that nobody would make fun of or bully me for being fat.   TLDR anxiety,False,False
