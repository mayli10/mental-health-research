That amount of calories at one time isnâ€™t capable of making much of a dent. Repetition would be another story.   Iâ€™m not trying to encourage your behavior in any way, but a two day fast would give you what you want probably. Be weary with fasting and binging, as it is not difficult to fall into a habitual pattern of extremes. Iâ€™ve been the victim of it.  Just be careful, no matter what you choose to do. Take care of yourself.",False,False
