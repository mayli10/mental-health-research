The bad news is that you will feel pretty hot and uncomfortable when trying to sleep but the good part is that you can easily lose it in just a few days. Please do not fall into an restrict-binge cycle (it never helps!)  Please drink enough water and remember to sleep on time. Walking, exercising and sweating it out helps tons! Remember the bad feelings will be temporary, stay safe and hope you the best! :)",False,False

I'm sure you can relate to this -- logically I know that I can't have gained even 3 pounds of pure fat from this, but the number just freaks me out, plus I feel just so out of control from the binging",False,True

I understand that might still seem heartbreaking... but I promise that the 13 pounds isnt ‚Äúfat.‚Äù It is water retention, offset scales, undigested food, etc.   I‚Äôm saying this from a place of knowing this feeling, sadness, hatred... but also hope that you know that you are worthy, beautiful, and it‚Äôs all going to be ok.",False,False
