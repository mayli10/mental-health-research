I'm supposed to be telling my parents everything about my eating disorder but I haven't told them that I liquid fasted today and will be water/coffee fasting until my grandpa takes me out to dinner tomorrow. I'm just so, so overwhelmed with life and I was only 3 days into recovery so it's kinda like... I was just fighting all the urges for 3 days and then gave in like I always do. Although I've never liquid fasted before. Worried about tomorrow because I'm hypoglycemic but I cant bring myself to drink slimfast shakes AND go out to dinner. Already freaking out about that enough",False,False
