Everything came out about me at a physical (7 lb weight loss in two weeks, severe self harm, severe depression) and all they payed attention to after was my self harm. Never once was my weight addressed. It felt like it didn't even count even though I was the same as you mentioned. I have no clue how people can be so oblivious.",False,True

When I was a normal weight teen I would tell my therapists and psychiatrist how much I struggled with my weight and eating, and I realize now they never seemed to concerned. I've even weighed myself in front of the psychiatrist and she was like ""you're fine, lets talk about the Depression."" Made me feel like shit. I know she was focusing on the most prevalent issues, but damn...look at me now 7 years later with a full blown eating disorder.",False,False

Even someone clueless about eating disorders should know better than to say something like that. Like, ""sorry Becky, I wasn't sick enough to meet your standards, because, you know, the DSM-5 is just absolute shit written by clueless old dudes, but your opinion on what defines a low weight is what truly matters.""  Like, how are you even supposed to respond when someone says something like that? I hope you gave her a blank stare and she squirmed and felt awkward.",False,False
