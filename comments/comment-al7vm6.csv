Starving myself triggered another shingles outbreak this past fall. That was probably my 6th one? The nerve pain gets worse with anxiety so it’s pretty constant right now. Edibles help, but they make me hungry so I don’t like to use them. ",False,False

Foods are triggers, mostly sugary foods. Food triggers are pertty individual though. I also have issues if my electrolytes are off or if I'm dehydrated or over hydrated. It isn't great for me to go too long between meals so I tend to lean toward small meals through the day when restricting. I also take magnesium and Bsomething under the advice of my neurologist and because other prescriptions for prevention came with too many side effects for myself.",False,False

Mine seem to be triggered by sinus issues, weather, hormones, and stress. My ED doesn’t really have an impact on the migraines, but the migraines are beginning to have an impact on my ED as I’m now trying an elimination diet to hopefully improve my sinus issues which will in turn hopefully improve my migraines. And just like that, the list of foods I can eat has been drastically reduced. ",False,False
