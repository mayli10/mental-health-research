Please don’t do it... suicide is never the answer. 4 failed attempts taught me that. I can relate so much to how you feel but there’s always a way forwards and things will always get better.  You can escape the pain, you just can’t give up. I’m here for you along with everyone else in this community. We all care for you even if it doesn’t feel like it. You should look toward getting professional help but just talking to us about it will make it a bit easier for you.",False,False

You aren't alone, and believe me a lot of us understand.  You're in terrible pain right now.  And you aren't alone, we've got you.  I've been feeling the same.  What I did was went to my doctor.  It sounds terrifying but it really can help, they're there to support you.  If it's possible please try and get to a doctor.",False,False

Have you considered getting professional help about depression? I could've written this post a year ago. It's insane what therapy and antidepressants have done to me - in the best way possible.,False,False
