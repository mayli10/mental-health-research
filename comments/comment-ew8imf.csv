I cant keep using the ""I get obsessive on a diet"" excuse anymore bc no one cares. . .I even had a psychiatrist basically tell me if counting calories works for me to lose weight I should do that. My family just thinks I'm bad at dieting. I think maybe I like to label myself as having an ed to continue to be like this and absolve myself of all responsibility. Its all my fault I'm fat. I cant blame anyone but me.   I wonder at what point I'm just sticking my head in the sand and using excuses to be so huge. I need to lose weight at any cost and I'm just too lazy to do it. I lack discipline and self control and I feel like a failure and I'm so ashamed I let myself get like this. I'm an embarrassment to my family.",False,False

After he was aggressively trying to force me to be weighed, I said ""my weight has been the same for months"". So he looks in the chart and goes ""oh so you weight x."" I wanted to punch him. He was like the scale dictator!   Plus even blind weights are reported on any printed after visit summary or chart notes that are then given to a patient.   Weight is NOT a vital sign! There are very few situations where frequent weighing is relevant. Malnutrition, CHF, renal failure, active chemotherapy or cancer treatment, tube feedings or meds that cause pronounced loss/gain. But these are all things that can STILL be done at the discretion and recommendation of the MD after the visit and/or discussed with the patient as part of a care plan.   I don't need a f*cking weight to see a physical therapist or my psychiatrist every few weeks. Itw just feeding into weight paranoia, side discrimination, fatism, and the myth that weight is a hyper-critical facet of general health.",False,True

I think I'm actually going to make some little business cards to give the MA at the beginning just explaining that I decline weighing until I have seen the MD.,False,True

I'm over 200lbs. I cried. I should weigh 130 tops. This isn't the first time this happened with a doctor either.   You'll probably have to continue to fight it and refuse every time.,False,False
