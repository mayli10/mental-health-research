(And I don’t mean like “relapse” by restricting for a week or a month, only to binge... but like, hardcore. This has only happened to me twice in my life so far since developing full-blown anorexia for the first time.)  It’s like there’s a switch that gets flipped in my brain. Like something just snaps. I can be doing fine in recovery, albeit miserable about my weight, maybe feeling stuck in a ”binge”/overeating cycle, but I get up to BMI 19 and suddenly from one day to the next everything shifts. It’s kind of scary.",False,False

I was terrified of gaining weight but also I felt so hopeless and like I'd never lose again so I kept binging....  Then once i hit a certain point (prob when my brain stops working logically tbh) my whole thought process changes and its like.  Okay, this is where you're at, it's scary but eating more literally wont fix it, and somehow it becomes more of a long term mindset? Like when I'm binging it's like oH nO I havent lost 10 pounds OvErNiGhT guess I'm a FAILURE so may as well eat but when im restricting it's like, okay, you had x amount, it's still less than you need, so even tho the scale hasn't moved you're still in a deficit, you're good, itll come off eventually.   Abd then it gets to a point where I'm legit afraid to have my gummy vitamins because god forbid I have anything extra. And then I'm going to the gym, and fasting, terrified to have two things a day instead of one, terrified of fruit, sugar, protein, literally anything so. Yeah I dont understand how my mindset can shift so fast but it does.",False,False

Seeing the number on the scale fall gives me this high and I just want to see it go down even more, and faster. If I gain weight I tend to feel hopeless.
