But when you’re backed up and in pain, it’s a lot easier to make a better choice in the tea aisle, than the laxative aisle where you just want to go for *MAXIMUM STRENGTH RESULTS IN 30 SECONDS RIP YOUR BUTTHOLE* hahaha",False,False

I would only take OTC laxatives if it was a dire situation...constipation can be hellishly uncomfortable but laxatives can cause a world of pain and fuck up your whole day.  Also, you don't want to become dependent on laxatives.  It's better to do everything you can to prevent it in the future.  Also don't go crazy on the fiber, especially at first, because stuff like psyllium husk can actually constipate you.  You gotta work your way up to a good dose.  Laxative tea works too, just don't drink too much (like seriously don't, put one bag back) and don't rely on it regularly.",False,False

When I went inpatient, I hadn’t eaten anything solid for nine days... it was another eleven days before I pooped. That last day was hell.

It’s about $4-$5 at the grocery store. Much better than harsh stimulant laxatives. Let it steep at least 10 minutes, drink it, and also drink at least 2L of water over the following couple hours, and 4-8hrs later you should be moving right along.
