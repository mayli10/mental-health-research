Your parents want you to get something from all the sacrifice and effort you have to make.   Also if your child doesn't achieve much it means you didn't make any sacrifice or effort. It invalidates your whole life and everything you had to endure. It's as if you didn't put up with anything.   You have to justify being alive with sacrifice and effort and giving up what you want and doing what you don't want to. Girls have to be thin in addition to show the world you can justify being alive.  Now you know the secret of high suicide rates. When you no longer want to make effort you can no longer live. ,False,False

My mom, at best, does not like mentally ill people. At worst, she thinks they don't deserve to be called people. To her, it's their fault for being fucked up, and this would never happen to anyone in her immediate circles, because we're all normal and good. It makes me break down when I'm at my lowest because I get reminded of the way my mom demeans these hypothetical people who could very well be me. I'm very fortunate to have insurance and be on my family's plan, but I also know that I can't seek out therapy even if I want to (unless I pay out of pocket) because then my parents would find out.  She masks her desire for me to be thin and pretty with things like ""you need to look after your health"" and ""exercise more"" and ""why don't you just spend an hour walking to this location instead of driving"". But then she sends me videos of thin Chinese girls with that conventionally pretty Asian face doing home workouts and then I know exactly what she wants.  I'm so sorry that you're in this situation. You deserve a relationship with your parents that includes mutual understanding and respect. I hope your school's counseling is beneficial for you, and that you can get the help you want soon.",False,False

It’s why everyone here is super obsessed with beauty, clothes, luxury brands, etc. People are raised to be hyper focused on how they appear to others because that’s extremely important in our society, and I predict ~30% of women in developed areas of East Asian countries have EDs with the remaining borderline because of how deeply ingrained these ideals are.

Some people in your life will only want to hear about your successes, and dont want to hear about or help you with your struggles. Unfortunately, sometimes the people we want to listen and be there the most are the latter.  Its important to know the difference between who wants to listen and who doesn't, and try to only open up and seek help from those who care enough to give you the time. Maybe you have a best friend, an aunt, or even us here on reddit. If other relatives/friends dont care to listen, then dont give them your time telling them.  I had a similar reaction when I tried to open up to my parents about bulimia as well... Mom said a lot of the things yours did, made it about herself, called me names, etc. That was the last straw, I just dont tell my parents anything other than how school is going, how my friends and bf are (if they ask), and only tell them what they ask. Of course I'm ""secretive"" because of this, but you have to be ok with that.  I wish you the best of luck with this situation, develop a forgiving, yet ""fuck you"" attitude, and id also suggest posting this to r/raisedbynarcissists.  ❤",False,False

My parents are from China, and my mom is extremely rigid on what she thinks is a good weight. From when I was a little kid, she’s always been criticizing my weight, appearance, etc. She’d tell me to exercise more, eat less, lose weight; she’d tell me what was too fat (BMI 20+), what was acceptable (18-19), and what was beautiful(16-18). When I developed BED and later bulimia, she constantly criticized me for being weak and for my lack of self control. She always told be that I’m just trying to get attention and that if I truly wanted to be skinny, I’d just starve. I never, ever felt like my ED was good enough for her. To her, it was just a weakness of character, not a mental illness. I was a disgusting, shameful embarrassment. She believes therapists are scammers and a waste of time— and people who go to therapists are worthless, crazy people who are too far to help. She blames my EDs on my friends, not realizing that I’m friends with them because I have an ED, not the other way around. And every, every day, I always try to restrict so I feel like I’m “successful” and “valid” to her.   Sorry about the word wall, but I truly understand. It’s so frustrating and difficult to live with, and once you start saying that they might’ve been the cause, they grow defensive and blame it on everything but them. But man, it’s not worth it. They might never acknowledge your ED, and that’s shitty but it’s not your fault. Don’t harm yourself even further for an opinion that’s not worth it. You’re valuable, you can do this. Continue to go to those counseling services, and once you can, try to get help. I believe in you man.",False,False

Parents should not respond this way when their children are struggling. It doesn’t mean you are a bad person or a bad kid, it just means that your parents culture and upbringing prevents them from being able to support you the way you need. I really think you should go see a psychiatrist. You need support right now, at least to help feel less alone. Yes it might make your mother upset, but it seems like no matter what you do it isn’t good enough for her anyway, so you might as well take care of yourself and have her be upset then not take care of yourself and her still being upset.

Grinding your character to the ground and shredding you to pieces till you will never speak again is a cure and solution in the old way of thinking, and because it has to start with repentance she will just try harder to shame you into silence and repentance requires silence so... as long as you talk about it she'll try to beat you down.
