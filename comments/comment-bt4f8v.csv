People assume fat=lazy, and so if you’ve cut them off in traffic, said something that’s offended them, accidentally stared at them too long, done anything at all, they’ll use your obesity against you and assume you’re also lazy and slovenly.   It’s just an easy way to excuse yourself for hating someone.   (I mean this all in a totally unbiased way. I’ve never experienced prejudice because of my weight. This isn’t a popular opinion but I do think being biased about weight is ok and that obesity shouldn’t be considered normal. People who say something against being overweight are just counter balancing those who say obesity is healthy)",False,False

I am the same way with people who are sickly thin, because for me, it doesn't matter which end of that spectrum you are at. If you're unable to admit that your lifestyle is unhealthy, despite clear warning signs, I will be annoyed with you. It's not because I'm blaming you, it's because denying what's happening to you is unhealthy in itself. I am total btch for saying this, but that's how it is for me.  Staying healthy no matter your weight is important. Fat, skinny, whatever.",False,False
