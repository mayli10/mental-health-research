A lot of my friends from rehab liked those “destroy this journal” art project books, maybe try one of those if writing is too stressful.",False,False

Maybe writing down all the things I want to tell him will be a relieve. Thank you a lot :),False,True

I feel very sorry for you that you had to go through this.  It is really hard especially because I feel like I should have showed him more love especially during adolescent. But you are so right! Living in the past just makes it worse and all we can do is move forward.,False,True

I tried to write a journal but I'm the type of person who tries to repress these thoughts and feelings. I guess that's why I find it really difficult to write Journals but maybe I should try harder.,False,True

His last words to any of us were the next morning, ""make sure you tell _lapetitepapillion_ that I love her and I hope she has a good day"". Watching him slowly die in the hospital after what happened that day only cemented the fact that I think how I treated him will be the number one regret I have for the rest of my life.   My point is though, that it really, really, sucks. I'm so, so, so sorry. Something that might help you- think about who your dad was, ""did he love you?"", ""did he care about you?"". Think about if he would have forgiven this, or whether he would have thought that you hate him for the rest of his life. The first one, if he loved you, is much more likely. If he was still alive would you both have moved past this one event? Most probably. If he's watching over you or whatever you believe I'm sure that he's only thinking about how much he loves you. At the time, I'm sure he understood that you were going through a rough time. We're more obvious to people than we think, especially if the person watching you is someone who loves you. You obviously care about him very much, I'm sure he thought the world of you and understood that you regret it.   We can't change the past, but I guess we can just try to move forward trying to do what would make our dads proud, despite our mistakes before.  Again, I'm so sorry for your loss, it's hell on Earth. You didn't deserve it, no one does. And it's not. Your. Fault.",False,False

I’ve definitely been snippy and harsh to people who didn’t do anything wrong because I was so angry with myself about my intake that day. At the peaks of my ED I was a completely different person to who I’ve always been. I was cold and jaded and the smallest of things would send me spiraling.  It’s not an excuse, but it’s important to acknowledge that it is part of this mental illness.  We all have things we wish we never said - after someone’s gone, our minds flood with every last memory and how we could have handled things differently. These memories are often amplified retellings of the events - the guilt can drive a slightly raised voice to be remembered as full out screaming. It’s a normal stage of the grieving process, and in my experience has been one of the hardest stages to get through.   What helped me was writing in a journal and just getting the thoughts out of my head and into a book I could close and put away. I probably wrote the same apology 10 times over. But what I found was that putting it on paper was a release and over time I slowly came to cope with everything.   It’s not easy. And it does take time. I wish I had better advice, but it’s one of those things the only way out is through. I kind of rambled here, but I hope this was at least semi helpful to you.",False,False

Those feelings are so tough, but I think almost everyone regrets what they said or didn't say to those now gone.  If it's up your alley, I strongly suggest writing a letter to your dad.  When you're happy with it, you can read it out loud, to him.  This will be really fucking hard and you'll probably cry a lot but I promise it will be good for you.  And in the meantime, try to relive some of the good memories and know that those were so much more important than any of the bad ones.",False,False
