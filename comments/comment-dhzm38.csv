For ED vibes: Crockpot (""she don't finish dinner and her expression never changes / don't shake hands with the lonely kids 'cause I hear that shit's contagious"") and Horseshoe Crab (""I learned that hunger is a symptom / of adopting bad behavior / I bit my tongue last night / woke up with blood on my pillow / I woke up thirsty"")   Anything on the Antlers album Hospice, especially Two (""no one paid attention when you just stopped eating / eighty-seven pounds and this all bears repeating"") and Sylvia (already mentioned ITT)  Still Ill by The Smiths (""Does the body rule the mind / Or does the mind rule the body? / I don't know"")  Body by Mother Mother (""I've grown tired of this body / Cumbersome and heavy body / Fall apart without me, body"")  Sounds like something by Daughter might belong on a playlist like this, though I can't think of any fantastically obvious ED lines. And maybe ""Anthems for a Seventeen Year Old Girl"" by Broken Social Scene. ""Maps"" by the Front Bottoms, for something more energetic.  And I listen to a lot of Pink Floyd's ""Comfortably Numb"" when I'm spaced out fasting and trying to convince myself that it's """"""""good for me""""""",False,False
