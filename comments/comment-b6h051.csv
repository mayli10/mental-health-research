I'd be learning how to eat mindfully. So perhaps I'm projecting. I'm sure there's lots of others who don't see the value in it, but for especially people who are trying to learn how to eat normally, there's a market. There's a massive market of overweight people who want to lose weight as well, and I think they could be a target audience as well.
