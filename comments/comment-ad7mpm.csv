Its worse when you go through periods of ""recovery"". When I lived in my hometown I was average and lost weight. When I went to college I was athletic and got fattttt and now, that Im settled in a new city I feel like anyone who knows me here just assumes ""fat with no self control because obvi I look it.

That's my silver lining for winter because I can hide my body. And I sometimes don't feel like I qualify as a woman either but for a different reason. It's fucked up that we feel ineligible as women if we might at one point of our history be an (relatively) (not tryna speak for you) unattractive woman. I don't think men have that pressure in the same way.,False,True

I was basically only eating salad with lettuce and turkey and a few vegetables when I was hungry and light exercise. When I got to 172 I was pregnant and just ignored any feelings or thoughts I had about my weight (hardest thing I've ever done in my life tbh I purged once  during my pregnancy and am not proud of it I had  a really difficult time keeping binge eating under control but refused to engage in any behaviors that could have hurt my daughter except from the one time I gave in) after she was born I was at 183 lbs and went back to eating nothing but a salad with some veggies and no dressing and a baked potato with vinegar every day with a few b/ps inbetween but it was mostly out of necessity and not recreation . I fasted maybe 1-3 times a week too. ",False,False
