We are about the same height and I generally am sitting around 115 going down to 107 or so when I am restricting. I follow the same pattern of starving and then ""messing it up"" and binging. I think talking to a therapist has really helped me - if nothing else, with just not hating myself each time i fall back into the same patterns. I wont lie and say that I beat the ED, but I am really working to make myself better and not need to go through this forever and ever. It really is taking over my life and I just want to be a functional person again, not constantly thinking about food, not always worried that I ate too much.  I think that maybe you also use food as a coping tool? I think going to therapy and working through these things slowly will help. I'm really sorry that you are going through this. I am going through the same sort of thing and I know how terrible it is. If you need someone to talk to, please message me.",False,False

You are enough and worthy right this moment, and nothing will ever change that. Most of all, you are allowed to see yourself as an amazing, unique individual and show compassion towards yourself- flaws and all. I know things are awful and dark right now, but I care about you and I'm always here if you want to talk things through&lt;3 sending you hugs and loveüíõ",False,False

I'm barely 5' and don't know what eating ""normally"" means. I usually restrict for like a week and give in to binge, the whole idea of eating a solid three meals a day baffles me and it confuses me so much when people react to others saying they haven't eaten breakfast, because to me that's normal. Eating intuitively leads to me binging and I have no self control. Restricting makes me feel clean, and fresh, and tidy, and ""healthy"". I haven't ever purged because I guess there's still some reason left inside me, but I have SHed before, and with scissors too. I compare myself to everyone and everything, and I cannot find a solid reason for me to be valid. To me, my eating disorder is not valid. I'm not sick enough. I've never been underweight. There is nothing worth diagnosing me with because I'm a fake attention seeker.   &amp;#x200B;  Everything you've written is so relatable, and I wish I could offer you advice but I have nothing to say. If it makes you feel better, you are not alone, and you deserve so much happiness. Message me if you ever want to chat, I'm here for you.",False,False
