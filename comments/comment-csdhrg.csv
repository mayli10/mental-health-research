I think she just feels pressure as a social media influencer and on top of that she's a fitness YouTuber/blogger. There's probably a ton of pressure to look like a Lululemon or gymshark fitness model. While her SW was completely fine and healthy, especially since a decent amount of it was muscle mass, I also think she knows her body best and if she feels her best at 125 let her get to that weight again. It's not an unhealthy weight and she's losing the weight healthily.",False,False
