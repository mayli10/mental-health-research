I don't know how severe but they tell me that they have food problems too. I think the amount of stress like you said makes eating disorders super common amongst college students, especially wrestlers. I'm definitely gonna get in touch with a school counselor, thank you :D",False,True

The fact that you recognize you have a problem and want to change it speaks volumes‚Äîit‚Äôs not easy developing a healthy relationship with food, especially when as a guy everyone dismisses the possibility you‚Äôre struggling, but you‚Äôre incredibly articulate and seem to have really good insight on yourself. EDs are actually frighteningly common in wrestling, so you aren‚Äôt alone at all there, either.   Is there anyone you can talk to at your college mental health wise? Most schools have fully or mostly subsidized services there, and if you aren‚Äôt comfortable talking about it with people you know, that could help. I hope things get better for you, though. It‚Äôs so, so rough dealing with this shit and the pervasive sense of shame it brings with it.",False,False

Good on you for recognizing it as  a source of distress. A lot of men internalize it or act like its normal when its clearly an illness, the fact youre at least self aware enough to reach out is important. I feel like gym culture disguises a *lot* of disordered habits as just being super athletic, but realistically a lot of the requirements for that shit are for shows and photoshoots and completely unsustainable in a normal life.         Im so sorry you got sucked in to this, i cant speak for you, but for myself i dipped in and out of it throughout my life and it was heavily triggered by external shit that made me feel weirdly comforted by calorie counting and like my deprived-self was somehow a better person, even though it was physically and mentally taxing.

My eating disorder also began in college but it was detached from an organized sport. I think it‚Äôs just a hard time overall and this can really trigger things. You‚Äôre living alone, were doing a sport, going to school, and also figuring out who you‚Äôre going to be in life. I think that‚Äôs a lot of stress on your plate and your emotional support system might be smaller than you were used to (possibly). I mean for me, living alone was horrible emotionally! I didn‚Äôt realize how lonely I was until I had someone living with me again later.   I wish you the best üíï I think the school counselors could be a good place to talk because they‚Äôll be trained in understanding eating disorders.

Can you bring this up to a school counselor? Tell them how you‚Äôre feeling, what you‚Äôre experiencing? It sounds awful. The obsession with food is really what gets to me.
