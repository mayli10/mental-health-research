Even without a lot of money, you can plan a memorial - maybe in the spring, because public parks will be warm then and free - plant a tree for her somewhere, pass around a food or drink she liked (sorry I know, ED forum and all) and share stories.   When my grandfather passed away it so so so so hard (he had dementia and we had lost so much time with him, decades, because his ex wife wouldn‚Äôt let him see us). I sang his favorite song, and we had so many photos of him arranged on display boards.   I don‚Äôt know your spirituality (or even my own) but after that, I felt more at peace. Went for a walk at night, the wind came up, and somehow, I just felt... HIM. There with me. My grandfather.   I wish for the days to come to bring you less heartache üíï",False,False

You are an incredibly fierce and protective person and I‚Äôm in awe of how wonderfully you love your Grandmother.   I agree with the other person, it‚Äôs never too late to put an obituary in the paper remembering her, to hold a service of your own, to even just sit and ‚Äútalk‚Äù to her.",False,False

Ex dad didn‚Äôt tell me. I sent her a Christmas present and she DIED before she got it. He lied and sent me out photos as if she got it. She died September 9th, 2018. I found out she died December 5th, 2019.   I want him to rot in prison, in hell. I‚Äôll do anything to get any sort of punishment for letting his mother DIE. She had a stroke. My ex father did NOTHING but let her suffer.  My father is a nurse. She let my grandmother, the only woman who on my fathers side who loved me died. I had all my letters, photos, phone callls valued.  All of my cards were displayed on her mantle.  I‚Äôm an idiot who didn‚Äôt visit her before he died. Because I believed my father that she was sick and couldn‚Äôt take visitors. I will do anything. ANYTHING. To avenge her death. I‚Äôm sorry that I didn‚Äôt know she died over a year ago. If I knew the day she died, I‚Äôd be at her funeral. He hid it from all us children, so that we couldn‚Äôt contest the will from the year that she died. My grandmother paid for her funeral. But my ex father took the money from her funeral, and used it towards a new car. Like he did for the past 22 years I‚Äôve been born. He doesn‚Äôt care about his mother.   I‚Äôll do anything to give her the funeral she deserved and paid for. Fuck you, Stacey. She is NOT some ‚Äúrandom old relative‚Äù like you claim.   I may not have spoken to her personally. I LOVE her. She has proven many times, that she loves me. Saving all my cards since we got separated. I did anything to see her; once I could drive.   But? By the time I could drive, she was dead. I could‚Äôve saved her. My sweet, poor,  confused alzhimers grandmother.  I just wanted to talk to her one more time. Show her my love one more time. Leona Mary Pryse, I will do ANYTHING to give you a funeral.   I love you.",False,True

She would always rag on me for eating so little. I‚Äôm 100% sure she has her own weight insecurities. She invited me to Christmas dinner with her family. Mine is out of the country, and I‚Äôm NC with extended family. Nice offer but I‚Äôm not in the mood to be made fun of for eating nothing.   So I‚Äôm not overreacting? I hate how I let those words get to me. I stayed up all night anxious, wondering maybe I am overreacting. Horrible nausea. I have this weekend off to relax.
