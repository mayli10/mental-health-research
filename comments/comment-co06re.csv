Pasta, bread, sandwiches, Mac and cheese, pizza, basically anything I’ve restricted for the past few months. When my ed flaired up in March I was hard core and at a hard boil egg, 1/4 of an avo, and progresso light soup every day. After about a month I lightened up and added some fruit. Now I’m better and eat salads, steamed veggies and have cheat days and heavy binge days. I’ve also learned how to make things that taste “good” that are low cal.",False,False

I eat everything. My binges are getting bigger and bigger and more and more out of control. It's always carbs and sugar, because those foods give me that ""food high"" that I look for. Bread, biscuits, pasta, chocolate, whatever I can find in my house until I run out of food and/or I'm in physical pain and I can't take it anymore. I can't cook when I'm binging because I get impatient and lazy, so bread and stuff are the easiest food I can get. I try to NOT buy binge food because it's a waste of money. I just want to eat, idc about quality.",False,False
