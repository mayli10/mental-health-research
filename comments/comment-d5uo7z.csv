It tends to chill my anxiety out a bit, if anything. My body chemistry works well with stimulants like Wellbutrin, though. Also helps a tad with my ADHD.   Worth trying out again if you want a change. Don’t have to commit to it if it doesn’t work out! There’s a fuckton of antidepressant options out there.",False,False

I’m on Paxil and lamotrigine, but was thinking of switching the Paxil to something else as I suspect it has contributed somewhat to my significant weight gain. Does the Wellbutrin give you anxiety all all/make you snappy at people in combo with the lamotrigine? I tried Wellbutrin for awhile and it made me snap at people really bad at work.",False,False

Definitely killed *any* want for food or appetite. The one thing I didn’t like, personally, was food still tasted good (the mood stabilizer and anti depressant I’m on now both kill my appetite AND makes food taste like diet).   That and it might just be a “me” issue; but I built up a tolerance to it *fast*. I was already on the max dosage a year into using it. Also it was $80 even with insurance. Also I couldn’t sleep worth a shit.   All in all, results may vary. It was alright for me. I personally ended up finding something better.",False,False

The only thing that makes me eat now is when I try not to keel over/moments of recovery inspiration. I take it with Prozac and some other stuff that also kills the appetite, and I have to say it does a GREAT job. Especially with caffeine. Mostly you just don’t have feelings of hunger which makes you stop thinking about food altogether.",False,False
