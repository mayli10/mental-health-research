Good day to you too.",False,False

I know different people have different journeys, as I said I didn't really know how else to word it. I don't think my comment comes across as harmful and Im not really sure why you are trying to teach my things I already know just because I worded my comment in a way that you didn't like. For some people with eating disorders, reaching their goal weight may be all the wanted and their eating disorder could just go away completely. Everyone is different. I made a comment based on my own experience to try to positively influence OP and you just replied condescendingly trying to mansplain eating disorders to me. If you really want to be helpful you should just be encouraging to everyone being positive and speaking to their own experience instead of just trying to tell me what an eating disorder is or should be. Again, I can recognize it was poorly worded but I think the message came across and it doesn't really justify your degrading tone towards me. Good day.",False,False

I‚Äôm glad that reaching your GW helped you adopt healthier behaviors, but for a lot of people it can set lower GWs or fuel an accidental binge.   I know we‚Äôre in an ED sub, but they are often mean (even if well-intentioned people) who will make comments, which is why I made my comment but also gave the benefit of the doubt.",False,False
