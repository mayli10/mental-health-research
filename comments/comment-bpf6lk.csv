There's a website called getdrunknotfat.com, and Everclear, which is like 99% alcohol, is the best bang for your buck. I mix it with Sparkling ICE.      321 calories in 50ml which sounds like a fuckton, but 50ml gets me pretty trashed. 25ml is usually enough to get the job done if I've been fasting.      Be careful with that shit though, it's easy to overdo it.",False,False

Agree that vodka with diet soda or soda water and a squeeze of lemon is the best choice. Anything premixed, liqueurs, and beers are all loaded with sugar.",False,False

Mix that with calorie free seltzer or diet soda. And as far as “getting the job done” that’s going to depend on how much you drink already and how inebriated you want to get. I can’t handle more than three drinks in a night and I don’t like being drunk in general.   Keep in mind that when you go to bars a standard shot is 1 &amp; 1/2 ounces.,False,False
