My goal of eating less/losing weight (to be healthy) is one they wanna discourage in the restrictive kids, which sometimes comes at the cost of knocking my goals a little.",False,False

If that makes sense? If I‚Äôm doing well they‚Äôre like ‚ÄúOkay cool.‚Äù But if I‚Äôm sad because I‚Äôm going through a rough time I feel like they coddle me almost. Makes it very tempting to relapse because I‚Äôm not held accountable.,False,False

I went about three years without a therapist in the middle of my journey, but have been seeing someone weekly since December 2018 to help me navigate long term goals and deal with stress without relapsing  I have absolutely had relapses, like I said, but nothing as drastic as when I was in the thick of it.",False,True
