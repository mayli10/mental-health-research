They are no less worried about my health despite getting my period back- they’ve told me quite a few anorexic patients get theirs back randomly too and this doesn’t make their (mine, or yours) illness fake. Losing it for any amount of time is still quite the marker for lots of damage going on, this doesn’t make you a “fake” 💞",False,False
