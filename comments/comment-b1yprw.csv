Definitely gotta try them! When I first went vegetarian Yves burgers and ground round was all you could get in my town pretty much so it's definitely a super nostalgic flavour for me in the Beyond Burger era üíù",False,False

Id also season it with stuff like garlic powder, dill, sage, A&amp;W seasoning, ect. Theres a few others I would use regularly. Sometimes artificial bacon bits as well for some crunch.      My Gma apparently used to have her own restaurant but Im not surprised that its not around still because her cooking is pretty fucking bad, and her food handling skills are **ATROCIOUS.** Like filling the sink with water (was it washed properly first? Probably not), taking a giant hunk of meat, *removing the protective plastic, and putting the raw frozen meat directly into the water to defrost.* Like theres so many red flags there I don‚Äôt even know where to start. Theres certain family members that get physically sick after *literally* everytime they eat her food.      She also *under cooks* all of her meat (pink chicken and such), uses *WAY* to much salt, and shes a hoarder of expired food. I once went through her cupboards and threw out all of the food that was expired or just about to expire. I had 4ish giant garbage bags after and threw out probably over half the food. She also used to bitch at me about bugs if I left a dish in my room over night cause I was to tired/forgot about it till morning. Ive never found bugs in my room though. She stopped doing/saying that after I pointed out how there were dead bugs in her cupboards cause she hadn‚Äôt cleaned them out in over a decade. She literally had food in there that expired over a decade ago, and she still has spices from the 90s that taste moldy cause she thinks they‚Äôre still fine even though spices don‚Äôt last that long. And ‚Äúcanned mollusks‚Äù in the cupboard that expired in 2011? Why the fuck would someone eat unrefrigerated seafood that expired that many years ago? (This was like late 2018 btw.)      As for my Gpa, hes diabetic, so Gma tends to make very bland and boring food because she already knows how his insulin levels should react to it. They also have a collection of Diet Pepsi pretty much 24/7. There are studies that say that it makes your food taste better (because it blocks your taste buds or whatever, Im one of the people this affects btw so its a lie), so it could be that they don‚Äôt even realize how bad the food actually tastes. They think Im crazy for using so many spices and creating fancy dishes that turn out amazing 90% of the time. They‚Äôre scared of ***FlAvOuR***      I also don‚Äôt eat beef, pork, majority of fish, and dark meat bird. They‚Äôre meat and carb lovers, so its weird for them that most meat makes me physically sick, and that my body doesn‚Äôt like carbs.      Btw, Yves has a website where you can check out what kinda ‚Äúmeats‚Äù they have. Theres burgers (chicken/beef), hotdogs, sandwich meat (chick/ham/turkey), falafel, broccoli bites, and more!",False,False

I was living with my grandparents and almost every time Id be making food they would come in and laugh/giggle at it and it would make me want to immediately throw it away but then they would probably yell at me for wasting food (especially food that they bought specifically for me) so Id have to sit there and force down this food hat I no longer want and have no appetite to eat. Thank fucking god for Diet Pepsi and how it increases my appetite and makes me more hungry or else I wouldn‚Äôt be able to get it down.      I would make dishes like, get some frozen carrots, broccoli, and some peppers (like the red/green/yellow/orange kind) cause I would have mixed bags of them. Just fry them up with a little bit of butter.   Id also get some Yves brand vegan ‚Äúchicken‚Äù burgers (I *HIGHLY* recommend Yves if you like meat but it upsets your stomach because these are vegan and actually taste like meat to me. The ‚Äúbeef‚Äù burgers even have grill lines on them) and cut up the burger patty really small.   Id also make some scrambled eggs as well.      Throw it all together in a bowl with some parmesan or shredded mozza and **bam.** A yummy treat that I *actually* feel comfortable eating so that Im not starving myself.
