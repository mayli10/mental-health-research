I know what that feels like but maybe you can try to shift some gears in your brain and try to restrict some of the exercise to maybe a) make it more enjoyable and something to look forward to, b) make goals for strength or grow ur butt or something lol idk but theres ways around it i promise. I stopped mainly because i found purging to just be easier and i started to have longer restricting cycles but this could be good for you if you shifted your exercise to something goal-focused other than just for ED purposes.",False,False

And now I'm getting constant overuse injuries and I feel so frustrated that my body isn't doing what I tell it to without complaining ðŸ˜­",False,False

I've gotten so obsessed with working out that I will literally do anything to be at the gym. It's the only thing I care about and it's getting out of hand. This June I missed an entire session of exams just because I was too busy working out and every free time I had, instead of studying, I spent it just fantasizing about working out. Holy shit. No wonder I get upset when people ask me how uni is going now lmao.   Anyway I'm lifting 6x a week for at least 2 hours in the evening and do 40 minutes of cardio beforehand in the morning. I don't do it as ""punishment"" though, more so because I truly and genuinely love working out. I can feel it taking a toll on my body as I've been feeling lightheaded and don't have the energy to lift my usual weights so I binge and ruin my deficit at the end of the week which sucks. It would be really great if I could actually lose the fat so my muscles could finally come to light. And because I have to study lol. I hope I get my shit together REAL soon, ugh.",False,False
