It took me some time before I lost the weight. Iâ€™d say just try and eat healthy and if youâ€™ve got a meal plan make the best of it to eat nutritious things instead of stuff thatâ€™s easy and accessible,False,False

Then hit a binge phase but also started lifting at the same time and all the weight I put on was muscle weight so I went down in size. Then through a binge/restrict phase that left me like 2 lbs lighter. Rn I'm going through a lot of shit and it's so rough my therapist and friends are all, ""at least eat 1 real meal a day and we'll let you keep restricting otherwise""   Anyways. If you have the strength for it, you should contact your campus mental health professionals. College will be really stressful either way, but if you can go out to eat with friends, and eat like a ""normal eater,"" your weight will stay steady and you'll have a lot more fun, trust me",False,False

Around 15 pounds in I kept telling myself I would start restricting but I just couldn't and now I'm here ðŸ˜˜ to be fair, if I hadn't gained I would be dead for sure but it still makes me sad",False,False
