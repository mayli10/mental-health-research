I’m damn near 30 goddamn years old and my family does this to me too. I call my husband before I get In n Out so he can “order me” to eat it. My mom picks my entree when we eat out and I’m not allowed to order a cocktail unless I eat most of my meal. It’s infantilizing, yes, but it’s what works to get me to eat. And I’m at a point that my pride is less important to me than my ability to stay alive for my loved ones.   It’s sweet that your mom and your brother try to make you comfortable with your eating idiosyncrasies around other people. None of us are perfect but it’s genuinely heartwarming when our families try to be nice about it.",False,False
