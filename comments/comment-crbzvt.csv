And being voluntary meant I got more say over my treatment and could work with my team. It was helpful- but the real work starts when you get home. I did 4 months of day program after being inpatient which was a helpful step down.,False,False

My team made it clear that it was either go voluntarily or be made to go.,False,False

It definitely kickstarted what helped, which was the residential center I went to after. Inpatient (at least in the US) doesn’t do much other than medical stabilization!",False,False

At that point I was just fed up of being afraid of food and it taking up all of my thoughts 24/7. I wanted permission to eat, and being inpatient where you’re “forced” to eat gave me that permission and relief of finally being allowed to relinquish control. I’m glad I did it; it was hard but relieving and what I needed.",False,False
