Telling your parents was the right first step! I hope they take you seriously. At 15 you can really damage your body, hormone levels, and growth development. Early intervention while you're young and early into this can really help you prevent this from turning into a life-long issue. You would really benefit from a therapist that specializes in eating disorders.",False,False
