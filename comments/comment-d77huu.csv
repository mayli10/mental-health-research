I have an Apple Watch that monitors my heart and what happens is that first my rate will shoot up into the 200s (no matter what I’m doing at the time) and then slow way down to the 40s. Eventually it goes back to my normal range in the 60s. I told my doctor about this and showed him my Apple Watch data and he determined that while it wasn’t exactly normal, it wasn’t anything especially dangerous right now, but he’s keeping an eye on it.   It can be scary while it’s happening, but just focus on your breathing and don’t panic, and it will pass pretty quickly.",False,False

However, considering your condition, you should definitely go see your doctor and have them give you a portable EKG machine to wear for 24 hours.",False,False
