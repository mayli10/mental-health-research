As an ex dancer I was constantly aware of my weight even when I was really young, grade three and four etc. Ive never been involved in any communities such as this one.. but I've basically become aware over time that I don't really wish to recover, i mean, I want to be healthy, but I definetly need to be thin to be happy.   I just need some outside support or atleast information because I really can't talk to other people about this.   Also I was wondering how common eating disorders are.. I feel like so many of my close friends have one.   &amp;#x200B;  should I put up pictures?""  &amp;#x200B;  I left out her HW, CW, and LW that she listed because I don't want anyone to get triggered.

Azealia seems to start it by body shaming grimes for being too skinny 1st. She said ""you don't even have bone marrow, or a decent pair of lips"". The grimes calls her fat, but she continues ""[you also don't have] hips, ass, or tits, and you smell like a roll of nickels, you look like a little boy, you're not enough of a woman""   Now like I said this is one google search without knowing anything about this, so maybe there is other stuff I am missing, but my take is this is two people just being assholes to each other. The body shaming happened both ways. Of course 2 wrongs don't make a right, but I kinda sympathize with grimes more, as it seems the other girl started the body shaming first.   One last time I haven't followed this at all, so If I am wrong then please don't be mad at me.
