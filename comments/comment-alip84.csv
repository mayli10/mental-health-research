And yes my history with calorie counting goes back to a time before Myfitnesspal.... back during the iPod Touch days....  They have a free version but I did pay the premium since I've been using it for years and figured it was worth the investment.,False,False

What I do is set my metabolism so low, even though I hadnâ€™t eaten anything yet, when I log something it tells me that I went over that amount of calories. I do that because I feel like if I see 36 calories left or something my brainâ€™s gonna start thinking itâ€™s allowed to eat. It also shows you your weekâ€™s total calorie consumption value and how many macros, nutrients, and fiber you took. I find it really calming when I overeat one day but my week average is still below maintenance. It helps you focus on the bigger picture. ",False,False
