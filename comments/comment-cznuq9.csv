I feel like my whole focus is food and eating and when I can eat my next snack. It's all I can think about. But I think I've always felt this way. It's just when I was younger I'd binge eat a lot more.,False,True

Also, if you're experiencing just... total lack of fulfillment, that's a sign that something is up. Like, when a low cal dieter eats 1200 calories and loses a moderate amount of weight, they feel pride and get to a point where they're satisfied. I know that for me, I never feel good enough so I'm always trying to eat less and lose more and more, to the point where I feel like hell. I never feel fulfilled. A lot of people dont necessarily recognize that they had an eating disorder either, so a lot of people on low cal subs may have undiagnosed EDs. Personally I didn't realize that I have an ED till i was inpatient",False,False
