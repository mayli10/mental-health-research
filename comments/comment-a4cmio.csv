For example Mila Kunis was supposedly at a BMI of 16.2 in Black Swan. But tbh, I don't think she looked that thin at all. Don't get me wrong, she was very thin in that one - in fact that's one of my main thinspos - but she did not look BMI 16 thin to me.  Same for Cara Delevingne. Read somewhere her weight is 52kg at a height of 1.73 metres, which would put her at a BMI of around 17. And she never looked *that* thin to me. More like between 18 and 19 perhaps.  Then again, maybe my perception is way off. Personally I might just look thinner than I am, as people usually start asking me if I'm eating enough when I'm around 20. ",False,False

If I had to guess I would assume that most celeb women are underweight or very close to that category. The camera adds 10-20lbs and hollywood is brutal.
