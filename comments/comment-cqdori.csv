Depending on where you are, I find muji undies in the smallest size comparable to a girls 12 (which is usually slightly loose on me). I also really like aerie XXS - but that’s only sold online and in some styles.",False,False

I'm about to say fuck thongs and go back to string bikini/bikini styles. Partially because I'm old, and partially because I'm getting damn tired of spending like $30 for 10 (during their huge sale) at arie because they're the only damn place I can find my size.

I am scared of going clothes shopping because I don't want to be aware of what size I am. Last time I wet to target, I felt really good about the fact that even the smallest sizes were a bit big on me. I feel uncomfortable, however, shopping in the kids section. I feel like if I were to gain out of being able to fit teen/kids clothes it will trigger me immensely- even though, rationally, I know I shouldn't  be striving to not fit into normal adult clothing.  &amp;#x200B;  If you feel good, that's all that matters though! Target is really good for people with body image issues because they're very 'body positive' thus making ""skinny girls"" feel even skinnier haha.
