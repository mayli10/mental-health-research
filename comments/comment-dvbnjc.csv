So I have always learned to be patient with people. If they’re being negative towards you at all it’s their own issue to deal with. They don’t know if maybe you could have an allergy or something of that sort. Or just possibly say that at checkout if you feel the need.  Good Luck, I always have this feeling but it’s been getting better knowing it’s their issue not mine.",False,False
