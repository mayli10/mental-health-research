I'm a recovering addict with an ED too, I understand how hard it is.  One thing I will say, and hopefully I word this okay, is that I HIGHLY doubt anyone in an NA meeting (I'm assuming you're going to NA, sorry if I'm wrong) would be judging someone in early recovery for snacking on a few cookies! It's so, so common for recovering addicts to gain weight in early recovery just because they're actually eating again instead of being high on their drug of choice all day. It's so normal for addicts to have fucked up hunger cues in early recovery, just like it is for ED recovery. I mean, the only reason I started losing weight instead of the other way around in my addiction recovery is because my addiction was vodka and valium, lol.   I don't say this to imply that you have gained weight or would look like you've gained weight, I'm sure you haven't/don't. Just that there's no shame in eating the food at meetings. It's there for a reason!",False,False
