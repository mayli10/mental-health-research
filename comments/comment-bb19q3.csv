Especially if the criticism leaves room for people without EDs to profit from mukbangs, but condemns people with EDs for doing the same thing. It's not like #1 can't end up with health issues from mukbang down the road too, and it grants undue privilege to the people who hide their EDs most successfully.  I kinda feel the same way about clearly underweight models too. It's one thing if they're a restrictively-disordered fitness guru who's advertising their disordered habits to unsuspecting people - that's fucking disgusting - or if other people encourage them to hurt themselves for showbiz. But if they're just trying to be a model while having an ED...are people with EDs not allowed to be models now, by that logic? Or do they just have to hide it well enough to pass under the radar?  Nobody seems to pretend that mukbang is healthy and we should all binge-eat. If they did, I'd feel so much grosser about disordered Mukbang rockstars.",False,False

One girl is quite slim and beautiful and does these videos for a while, gains quite a bit of weight, documents the gain, then crash diets to loose it, then starts the cycle again.
