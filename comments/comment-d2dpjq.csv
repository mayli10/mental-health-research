I tried to eat an actually lunch and I‚Äôm gunna try to eat a real dinner today to see if I won‚Äôt binge all night but I did walk/jog about 6mi like I normally do and I still feel like the working out won‚Äôt make a difference. Also just eating my lunch (egg whites, vegan sausage, low cal toast with spinach and tomato) was so fucking weird. Like oh okay you‚Äôre full like a normal human? You should keep going until you feel sick!!! There‚Äôs no middle ground anymore.  When I wasn‚Äôt relapsing I would eat comfortable and work out but still had a gut so I‚Äôm just in the mind set that I have to be below maintenance no matter what to feel good. Basically I cant get it out of my head that extreme restriction is the only way to be skinny even if it‚Äôs basically killing you.",False,False

Over the weekend I ate like 1800-2400 calories every day, didn't exercise much, and tried to just eat. It actually kind of triggered my body going ""oh fuck yeah, food"" and on Monday I ate far more than I intended to, even. I had to work to stop myself from eating more all the way up until I went to bed.  Every single one of those few days was miserable. I felt over-full, fat, nauseated, and undeserving. And somehow, STILL hungry, as if I'd opened a great pit in my stomach.  I'm back on my bullshit now and I've got a big deficit going for me so far today. I've got hunger gnawing at my stomach, all I can think about is food.....and I still feel so much better than I did over the past few days when I was eating enough.",False,False
