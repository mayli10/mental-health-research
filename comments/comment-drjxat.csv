I know it sounds stupid and it doesn’t always work. But sometimes I get a moment between the forceful fists of food going into my mouth where I’m like... huh... this sucks. And I take that moment and I make myself just sit and stop eating. And I feel SUPER unsatisfied and unhappy because I just want to eat. But I let myself feel that way, and I accept it. I accept feeling that unsatisfied feeling. It doesn’t feel good. I then occupy myself with something complex, like a game or work. Half an hour to an hour later, I realize the binge feelings are gone.   That takes practice, of course. I didn’t come to this conclusion right away, it’s taken years, and no it doesn’t always work. Sometimes the binge urges are too strong to sit with. But please give this a try, even a little practice will help your brain along.",False,False
