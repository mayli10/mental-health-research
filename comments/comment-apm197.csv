I work overtime a lot too to get out of eating dinner with my boyfriend.   I try to eat veggies when I do eat. Our bodies really need them since we deny ourselves so many nutrients. ",False,True

Like I'm at work 8-5 mon-fri. It's easy not to eat when there's no food around.   But on the weekends I'm in hog heaven. No schedule. More social opportunities for food/situations I can't get out of. I hit the gym on the weekends and that always ramps up my appetite.   Been trying to get better about this. It's hard when I'm around friends or family. Not too long ago I said no to pizza when a friend offered and redirected us to Subway. One bread plate for another.... But at least I got a veggie in. ,False,False

On weekdays I barley eat any food. This is because I‚Äôm at school and I didn‚Äôt bring anything for me to eat so I literally have no access to food. On the weekends I go sicko mode in the pantry and eat all the good food (aka junk food) I understand the struggle of letting go of yourself on the weekend ,False,False
