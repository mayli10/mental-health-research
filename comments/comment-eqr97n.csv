For me, if possible, getting out of the environment is a big help. I'll go for a walk, run an errand, drive around for a little bit... The combination of distraction and not being Stuck At Home With All The Food Taunting Me usually makes me forget about binging. Or at least realize that it's not worth feeling like shit afterwards",False,False

When you feel an urge to binge, sit down with a piece of paper, and say. I am going to put this off. And every five, ten, or fifteen minutes (Try them out, see what works for you) rate your urge and write down a coping skill that you will try until the next check in. Keep doing this until you either no longer feel the urge, or until it overwhelms and you give in. If you give it enough time, the urge will pass. Every minute you put between yourself and eating disorder behaviors is a victory.  And then there's the long-term struggle of how to stop binging, and that's a lot harder, and takes a long time, might require a therapist. But here's a few tips, as someone else who hasn't stopped, and who's in treatment, but who is really, really trying to stop:  * When you wake up the day after the binge, get up, try to forgive yourself, and eat  breakfast. And then around 11:00, eat a snack. And then around 12:30, eat lunch. Around 3:30, another snack. Around 6:00, eat dinner. Around 8:30, have another snack. Strive for balance, and eating enough. A biological cause for binging is restriction. Even if you aren't severely restricting, saying ""I'm not allowed to have donuts ever, because I love them, but they don't love me, and I can't have them because xyz"" makes it really likely that you will binge on donuts.  * After a binge, track backwards what it did for you. What situation were you in that made you vulnerable to binging. Were you tired, sick, hungry, thirsty, angry? What situation triggered the binge urge? What feelings did you have? What actions did you take? Did you isolate, did you go buy food, did you skip a meal? And then, what consequences does it have for you? Clearly it impacts your self worth. In the moment, you might feel pain. What benefits does it have for you? Did it relieve stress? Did it comfort you after an argument? How can you get those benefits without binging? That question is the hard one to answer, and the one that you have to answer to permanently stop binging. This takes a lot of experimentation, it takes a lot of effort, and whatever it is, it's not as easy to achieve without binging, because if it was, you would be doing that instead. * Practice self-care every day. Learn what you love about yourself, your life, your family, your potential future, and remind yourself of that even when you've lapsed.  These are my best tips for you. I want to wish you the best luck, and I'm sorry that these are more ""What's involved in recovery"" and less ""Here's the easy fix.""",False,False

This helps me a lot, and then when I do want to binge Iâ€™m a little bit more full now. Warm liquids like broth and hot tea help a lot, diet soda too!!",False,False
