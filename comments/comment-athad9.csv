You don’t want to and you don’t have to, even if you said you would. Please don’t do it because you feel like you have to make him happy, because he isn’t important. He DEFINITELY isn’t more important than your wellbeing. Seriously, in the grand scheme of your life, do those three people really matter? They don’t, so please don’t force yourself to join in. Like I guarantee you’ll just feel worse about yourself. It’s not worth it. Always put yourself first.

I totally get where you're coming from with low self esteem, but having a foursome with people who aren't seeing you as a 10/10 doesn't mean you aren't a 10/10 - it means those are the wrong people for you to be having sex with. Sex like this isn't at all what you're worth, and going through with it isn't some justification that you deserve less than other girls do: it's self-sabotage. I'm pretty sure that if a friend of yours or anyone else on this subreddit was describing what you have here you would tell her not to go through with it.

You probably know this, but in case you don't, he is being abusive.  You are being manipulated into letting him (and others) cross the boundaries you NEED to be healthy and that is not okay. It is not okay for anyone to do that.   I'm an old lady by the sub's average, so please understand I'm coming from a place of having spent my late twenties enthralled by a similar asshole.  No dick is worth it.  He's not going to change and he certainly won't feel bad for hurting you. That's not on the table.   What is on the table is finding the place where you say no.  He'll bitch and moan and whine and insult you for daring to be anything but his pliable sex object.  He'll keep trying to manipulate you to get what he wants.  He doesn't care about you, he cares about what he can make you do.  Please understand- you do not deserve to be mistreated like this. This is abuse.  Please say no.  For you.  Ideally I'd say cut him out of your life completely, but that's a big step and I understand if you're not there yet. It took me five tries and the only reason the last one stuck is he put me in the hospital.    You are not a 7.  You're a rare and lovely Feather.
