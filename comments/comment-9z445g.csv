And I am way too broke to feast on quest bars haha, I'll prolly figure something else out though. Thank you a lot, hopefully it'll help. I really appreciate this.",False,True

If it isn’t a trigger for you, maybe you could help him prepare the meals? That way you can spend time together and be involved in thanksgiving in a way that doesn’t involve eating the food. Then on the side, you can prepare your safe foods and whenever he eats his food, you can eat yours. You could also just like feast on quest bars lol",False,False
