I thought I liked guys cause they had six packs and nice arms and defined jaws. I thought I liked girls cause they had tiny wastes and long thin legs and perky breasts.   The truth is I’m not remotely attracted to anything. I just want to look at them and draw them and sculpt them and be them. I want to admire the way their clothes hang off their figures. I’m enthralled by how beautiful the human body can be, and I’m devastated that I’ll never be that beautiful.   How stupid.",False,False
