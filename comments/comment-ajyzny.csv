Over time we kinda grabbed food from each others 'menus' and meals ended up being a blend of both so we started naturally eating the same things. Problem is we both like when they prepare the parts they are good at and I do the parts I'm good at for an overall better meal, and no one wants to be responsible for cooking the whole thing and fucking part of it up. It is also a good way for me to keep my intake up because it is harder to fudge the numbers of what I'm eating if they are eating the same thing because I want them to be eating enough. It's more of a practicality/time saving thing than a hangout time, usually the hangouts around food prep are only if one person is doing something and the other's just keeping company ",False,True

When I moved in with my first boyfriend I found food was a huge issue because of his diet - but I didn't have the financial means to eat separately so I had to put up with it. I also felt like that would be weird and idk not really 'relationship-y' which seems silly now but can seem like a big deal at the time.   Now, my boyfriend and I mostly eat separately. He has CF so he needs to eat way more food than me and fatty, salty foods too and honestly even without ED issues I couldn't eat like that so we naturally just eat separately. It doesn't feel weird at all but we are both kind of loners - you can always prepare separate food and eat together if you like.  If you make sure there's some overlap in the groceries it's not really that expensive but I am a cheap eater (AUD$50 for my groceries a week usually). You will probably also have to make simpler/easier food if you're like me and get tired of cooking all the time which you will be doing if you're preparing food separately.  Are you literally cooking together? If you're doing that as a hanging out thing definitely stop because it doesn't sound like a fun time for anyone at this point, but if it's just so you both feel like you're helping you could also just take turns making dinner. The other person doesn't have to be involved in the dinner making process at all and can just clean after if they need to help.",False,False
