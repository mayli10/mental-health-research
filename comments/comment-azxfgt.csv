Say what kinda things she says that bothers you, and why it bothers/triggers you.      Tell her about the certain things she does that are/can be disordered, and maybe let her know how she could get help.      Let her know that you deeply care for her, and want to be there for her, but that the things she says to you affect you negatively and upset you.      Im a strong believer that theres a difference between eating disorders and disordered eating, but if she has some disordered eating she could easily fall into an eating disorder and should be getting some professional help. A doctor, psychiatrist, nutritionist, ect. Someone that will help her lose weight in a healthy way and not fall farther into disordered eating.",False,False

I’m like so certain she is developing/has disordered thoughts but I don’t want her to feel like I mistrust her when she tells me she does not, because there’s a chance she isn’t. That’s why I’m so diligent in trying to make her aware that ‘it’s not normal to think like that’. I can definitely talk to her and support her if she is struggling, that doesn’t trigger me. I think I should tell her that part too when I tell her I dislike the way she talks about eds to me. Thank you, it’s a little validating to read this. I was afraid a lot of people would try to call her a bad person or say she was a toxic friend. The way you explained a (possible) reason for what she does though I think fits my feelings perfectly",False,True

She might be in denial. Honestly, when I was young and headed down the rabbit hole, I kinda joked similarly. It could very well be her way of trying to sort out what the hell is even going on. And by talking to you, who has openly admitted and talked about having an ED, it is possible she is doing that because she WANTS some kind of reaction. She may even possibly be confused and scared and want the comfort of talking about this stuff with someone who gets it.   HOWEVER. You do need to firmly tell her, next time she brings it up, that it isn't okay. Tell her that it makes you feel like shit and is really triggering for you, and that if she is really engaging in these mindsets and behaviors, she is speeding down a road she really doesn't want to go down, and one that you can't go down with her.   What she is doing and saying isn't okay, but I'm not going to just assume the worst and assume that she is just looking for attention by pretending to be developing an ED or anything like that. So my best guess would be to say she must be struggling and confused.   She said she is isn't developing an ED, but that is what a lot of us say when openly confronted about it.   Bottom line is that you need to take care of yourself though. If she is struggling with her inner demons, it is good to be there for her if you can, sure, but it isn't your responsibility by any means. Your responsibility is yourself. I know you're worried about saying something to her, but it doesn't have to be a huge confrontation. Just be firm and clear, and emphasize that it hurts you and sets you back mentally to hear her talk about those things and that it also makes you a little worried about her.  ",False,False
