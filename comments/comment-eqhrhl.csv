I'd wager it's a really common experience! When I was at my HW I felt estranged from my body, and I beat myself up over our sex life plummeting. It takes two though, and it really took being able to have a good conversation about why we weren't connecting in that way for things to start to get better. It seems like you are trying your hardest to keep that spark alive, and it's in no way your fault that your husband isn't communicating with you- regardless of your weight or what you look like. We really benefitted from using the sex and intimacy conversation from the book ""Eight Dates"" by the Gottmans. I'm so sorry you're going through this- I know that poor/no sex is one of my biggest triggers of insecurity and self-loathing, and I hope that things get better without you having to hurt yourself to get there. (if this comment does more harm than good lmk and I will take it down immediately!!)",False,False
