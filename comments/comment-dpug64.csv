I definitely need to watch what I eat. It just sucks knowing that avoiding certain foods (due to the fear of nausea) can often result in restricting.   I was doing so, so well... But after my relapse it's been a struggle to get back to where I was. I'll get there soon enough though, I hope.",False,True
