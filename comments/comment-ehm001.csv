When you lose weight, you have less mass to carry around and therefore less energy is required to a) move around and b) maintain that mass since now it is gone.   If you dip below a certain body fat percentage (12-15% for females, 5-9% in males/weight/be in a severe calorie deficit leading to substantial weight loss even if you’re overweight or a normal weight) you may: lose your period to conserve calories, produce less sex hormones (both genders, btw), not have enough metabolic reactions (which produce heat in the body) + too little body fat to maintain temperature homeostasis (aka you get cold/stay cold/can get lowkey hypothermia)    With rapid weight loss (more than the 1-2lbs/week rule) usually comes somewhat faster rates of muscle breakdown than slow, sustained weight loss leading to lower BMR since skeletal muscle mass is highly metabolically active - so if you have less of it, you burn less calories.    So TL;DR  - Yes it’s real but it’s not portrayed correctly very often  - It’s basically a term for adaptive thermogenesis  - Adaptive meaning that if you regained the lost weight + muscle, your BMR would return to baseline - your metabolism is never ‘broken’ it just adapts.  - If you restrict calories some days and binge other days and over a week it balances out to be maintenance - your BMR won’t really be affected. This is the message that’s wrongly portrayed - that BMR responds to everything *but* the mass and composition of your body.  - if it didn’t exist, I’d be dead in the first year I started restricting, 6 years ago. If my BMR stayed 1500 and I was only eating 500 for a year straight (which I did), I’d weigh about 3kg at the end of 2012. It doesn’t work like that. It’s very useful at keeping humans alive. Also, people would get overweight much faster if their bodies didn’t adapt to burn more calories when we gain weight/overeat. It also doesn’t make sense that a bigger body would burn *less* than a smaller one - save for a select few medical conditions/medications.   - I’ll repeat. **You can’t break you metabolism. It. Just. Adapts.**",False,False

Also, when you stop restricting your metabolism actually jumps up trying to repair your body, it doesn't make you gain a bunch of weight.",False,False
