It's part of the discussion, and yeah I'm surprised that the fandom hails her as an ""unproblematic queen"" because she's had a problematic image and has even posted stuff like pictures of animal abuse and women covered in bruises and shit in the past. But lately she's soo much better and sweet to fans and she does seem happier and (again, dare I say) healthier but if one of her goals is to be suuuper skinny again idk :( kinda sad but I do get it",False,True

But wow I didn't know about all this other stuff. Her relationship with food definitely isn't normal. Her views on many things seem warped and I wouldn't necessarily pay attention to everything she says   also sidenote, as much as I love her music, she comes across as so pretentious and like she feels above others in some of these older interviews and stuff. Like ""individualizing myself from western culture""... girl please. But from more recent things I've seen it seems like she dropped that not-like-other-girls attitude and she comes across as much more genuine nowadays.",False,False

Literally just seeing that interview in 2016 after being recovered for 6 years",False,True

I don't see anything on her profile  Not to invade her privacy, but I also always sensed some disordered eating vibes from her. in this video she talks about a very restrictive diet that she followed/ follows? [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXlK8R83u44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXlK8R83u44) It's quite old, so her views may have changed, but that diet sounds very restrictive. What especially worries me is the line ""it is a rather extreme diet, but I end to do things in an extreme way and so I think it's way better that I'm on this side""  but I really hope she is doing well. She is one of my favorite artists and I love her music.",False,False
