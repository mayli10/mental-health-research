I'm just saying that you should probably get screened for it after your glancing blow with a cardiac event.  Shotgunning caffeine is pretty bad.

Of course, enough caffeine could probably give you a cardiac event of some sort, even if you're fit as the warriors of Mongolia and have completely clean arteries, but you'd really need to overdrive it - snorting several grams of the stuff, for example, or IVing it.  It's funny you should mention lipoprotein (misnomered ""cholesterol"" because lipoproteins carry cholesterol).

Don't apologise, this post is a discussion so ask away 😊  The Drs think heavy caffeine use was a contribution, I had about 2/3 monsters a day at my worst.

As far as warning signs months prior, no I did not.

Palpitations vary, sometimes it almost feels like the flutters you get with nerves, for others it's like they have a drum kit in their chest! What you have sounds similar sensation wise to palpitations, I'm not a Dr but I'd recommend intaking your caffeine slower (palpitations can happen if you consume too much too soon).
