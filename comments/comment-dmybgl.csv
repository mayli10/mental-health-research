I never really talked to her, but everyone around me made fun of her. She just took it all. Looking back, I realize she may have had an eating disorder. I hope she’s doing okay now, and I’m disgusted at how she was treated.",False,False

But that time, I was walking around town so I wouldn't eat lunch before my classes started again, and at the time was being threatened by my friends to eat or they would force me to go inpatient. I never would have thought I would be in a similar position as well, this really really sucks, and I still think about her a lot. I hope she's okay, and I hope you and this girl are okay as well :(.",False,False
