I think your bmr itself must be above 1500, since that's what mine is. So, if the numbers you've calculated are correct, you're most likely still at a deficit if your sedentary tdee is ~1800! Plus, exercising and TEF must have burnt some of those calories. Even if you underestimated them, it was just *one day* and you can always do better tomorrow. Good luck ðŸ’“",False,False
