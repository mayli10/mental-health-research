Also though if you're at maintenance for two weeks but are coming from years or something of weird eating patterns, it might take a bit to re-situate a hormonal cycle.  My (not a doctor, also disordered) opinion would be if you're not feelin a calorie surplus, change up your diet, get with some omega 3s and healthy carbs, chill out on cardio if you do a lot and see where that takes you.",False,False

I've been trying to recover (on my own) actually, so I'd rather be gaining than loosing at this point. I've been at maintenance for a couple weeks, so do you think that is enough? Or do I need to gain?",False,True

But I'd say yeah, you might wanna up your intake a little, it can't hurt (if we're being Totally Rational People).",False,False
