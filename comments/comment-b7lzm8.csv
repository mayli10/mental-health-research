I ended up binging for a couple of weeks (~intuitive~) and then my appetite dwindled so turns out I was back to &lt;1000kcal/day unintentionally (~yesss so intuitive~).   But I justified it because y'know, *that's what I was meant to be doing?* I was just listening to my body like I was told to do.  ¯\_(ツ)_/¯",False,False

After you adjust to that you can start to listen to your body and switch to intuitive eating ",False,False

I’ve been switching medications a lot in the past year though and a lot of them increase or decrease appetite, so I sometimes had to make a conscious effort to eat more or less than my body wanted me to in order to maintain my weight, but before that, I found it pretty easy to eat intuitively once I got into the habit of eating a healthy balanced diet with adequate calories.

When I was in treatment, intuitive eating was the eventual goal, but first we had to follow a meal plan for several months so our bodies got used to the amount of food we should be eating. You’re not doing it wrong, it’s just probably not the best plan for you right now. ",False,False

If listening to your body makes you eat massive amounts of food, that's what your body wants to do. It means your body finds the weight you're at currently to be dangerous for long-term survival and wants you to gain weight now that food is available.  You can try still counting calories but eating a little bit over your TDEE for a month or so to see if your hunger cues normalize. You basically have to show your body that food is available so it can calm down and not be in a panic to shovel in all the food it can find instantly.",False,False
