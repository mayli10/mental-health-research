I was actually scrolling through this sub and trying to find any posts that relates to my anxiety right now and this was it 100%. I ate a bag of sunchips today at work in front of coworkers and I cannot stop thinking about how they were probably looking at me and thinking how disgusting I am when I eat. I even felt ashamed when someone commented on the chips. I wanted to take it all back and felt instant regret doing it. I hated it. And now I feel like I have to start all over. O restrict so much and at most I eat 500 cals a day but plateaued between the same 5lbs always. It's awful. I don't know what to do anymore. I feel like I'm in too deep. And I'm even afraid to go to my fitness classes in fear of passing out. I ever feel like passing out when I'm just walking around my apartment or stand up from my chair at work. And it's crazy because I can't talk about it or feel like I can't because I'm not crazy thin for someone who starves themselves and I'm not overweight either. I'm average. So it looks like I'm just normal and can't even get thinner starving but also can't get help with it either. I feel awful always. It's such a source of anxiety and I hate it so much.,False,False
