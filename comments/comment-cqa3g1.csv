When I get rude comments and people are rude to me, I try thinking about how sad of a person they must be to lash out at others like that. That and unfortunately some people are just assholes and although I can't control what others say and do to me I can try and control how I respond (easier said than done I know). I think ""if i keep dwelling over this, then they win and ive let them control me. I'm gonna try and be the bigger person and let this roll off my shoulder"" if that makes sense. It baffles me how people go out of their way and put effort into ruining others days, when they could just keep their mouths shut or instead choose to say something nice. Just know that you're not alone and you have support here.",False,False

They want to make sure you know they have power over you, and they'll either demean you by making sexual comments or insults - whichever they think will be more effective in making you feel lower than them. And they assume, for most girls over a size 0, their weight will be a sore spot. So it doesn't matter what you actually weigh, really; whether they yell ""hey fatty"" or ""hey sexy"" is often arbitrary.  Congratulations on losing 17kg! That is NO easy feat and I'm sure you look amazing. The sad reality is that people can't tell just by looking whether a stranger has gained or lost weight, they only see them as they appear right at that moment (which is why fatshaming doesn't work to ""encourage"" weight loss because you never know if the person you're talking to is already losing weight), so not everyone will understand that you are ALREADY doing amazing things. As for moving on... Really, what kind of subhuman even yells at another person from a moving car? Think of them like a slug you stepped on two weeks ago. Gross at the time, sure, but ultimately completely insignificant (and, coincidentally, spineless).",False,False

You have come so far and are continuing to get healthy for yourself and doing it in a responsible wave that takes anton of strength to do.

I would be upset for weeks afterwards. I was huge and I knew it, I didnt need strangers telling me. Now I've lost 63.5 kg and I havent gotten called fat in a long time. I know which sub I'm in, but try to remember that as long as it's going down, you'll eventually be where you want. I had a lot of teary nights growing up, but now they seem so far away. 17kg is great, be proud and keep going. Hope things get better for you, sending all the internet hugs I can.

Just know that everything is  fleeting and weight can be changed/molded unlike other aspects of your appearance. I know how it feels to put everything on your body/food- the anxiety that coincides with it. Just forget about their words and eat healthy/work out. Do it for yourself, not for others. As long as you know what you're doing and can feel good about your progress, don't let anyone make you doubt yourself.  &amp;#x200B;  I developed my ED years ago when my exes brother kept calling me fat, and to this day, I can't stop thinking about it. He's apologized, etc. but words hurt and it'll stick with you for a lifetime. Use it as motivation and dont beat yourself up when you feel out of control or like you've failed. Life is long, nothing is permanent and you ARE in control of your weight.",False,False
