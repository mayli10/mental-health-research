Not like as a ""submission of power"" or anything sexual, but i have no will, at all.  Now that I'm trying to explain what i want, basically, i want a friend so I'll have motivation/incentive to be functional.   I realize now I'm probably clinically depressed. What do?   Getting ""help"" is such a weird thing to even consider. Like, why would i do that. I don't see how ""getting help"" would help. I never got help for my eating disorder or my anxiety because at the end of the day i know it's just about doing my best to manage my afflictions and i don't need someone to tell me that or give me advice on how to. Because ""managing"" doesn't factor in that i lack the will to even want to.  When i say friend i guess i just mean i literally want company. Isn't that a given though when someone says they want a friend? Why am i even clarifying lol  Yes I'm lonely as fuck but also I'm scared of people.  Loneliness makes you not want to take care of yourself. I still shower every day and go where I have to go because i know i can do that much. But it's tempting to just not, and see what happens, i guess.  I hate writing this out because i know i sound like a self-involved edgelord wallowing in my own misery. I promise i'm chill.   I really light up when I'm around others. I like laughing and smiling and i like being outside and i love the sun and if there's no sun out i love the fresh air.

I’ve honestly never felt so alone in my life but I don’t have the motivation to do anything about it. Not to be cliché but food is the only control I have right now. My self esteem is pretty much 0% and its making me isolate myself. I want to do nice things for myself but I won’t let myself. Want my nails done? My hair? New clothes?

I know you're probably just venting and don't need obvious solutions but I'll list some anyways....  You should try joining the discord for this sub, or discord for some other subs.  It can be nice to have a group of people to talk to and you can even voice with people.  Do you play any video games?  I feel like most of my friendships are online with people I've met gaming and it's not quite the same if you can't hug them, but they are still real friendships.  Do you have a job? I think that's where 90% of people make new friends in adulthood.  If you're busy with school, maybe you could find a job or volunteer position that's only a few hours like one day a week.  Also, if it's in your budget, you could try getting a massage like once every 4-6 weeks.  It's kind of amazing what 30 minutes of human touch can do for your psyche if you're not getting it regularly, not to mention how amazing you'll feel afterwards.  If it's something you want to try and can afford right now, look into going to an actual licensed massage therapist and not a cheap spa with unlicensed people.  A real massage is soooo much more beneficial and enjoyable compared to a girl walking on your back for 10 minutes and doing some weird Swedish massage shit while she chats with another masseuse.",False,False

Recently, though, I’ve been more recurrently in a grey area where it’s been easier to be myself, make friends, hang out with people. I think it may be because I’ve completely given up on the idea of depending on human interaction/intimacy for my happiness.

Despite everything, I’m still always on the edge of a panic attack about something or someone. I’ve fluctuated between almost obese to almost underweight and my satisfaction levels have been about the same.
