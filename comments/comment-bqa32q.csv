If I would have had this gene technically I wouldn’t have eaten as much as a child. So I probably wouldn’t have been overweight. So my parents probably wouldn’t have obsessed over my weight. If they wouldn’t have done that I probably wouldn’t have binged as much for control and other reasons. So technically I actually might not have BED if I would have had that gene.
