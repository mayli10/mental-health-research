I'm nearly 26 and still an undergraduate. I've failed/dropped out multiple times and had to take significant breaks due to all of my mental health shit. I'm sure it must have been super difficult to have the stress of your A levels hanging over your head; I'm American so basically just had to carry on through university and not pass anything, though I did transfer schools because being my old one would trigger my mental health issues and the application period was quite a lot to deal with. Eventually I did get into my dream school, a much more prestigious/renowned one than my previous school, but tbh right now it doesn't feel like an accomplishment to be here when I'm struggling to get through classes and feeling as I did when I dropped out those other times ðŸ™ƒ",False,False
