I literally pick him breakfast, lunch &amp; snacks. Text him during the day to check on him and making sure he’s eating. I make dinner for him &amp; usually give him bigger portions hoping he will eat.   He doesn’t judge me when I binge like crazy bc I breastfeed so he always blames it on that but honestly maybe I just love eating?!? I eat when I’m not hungry &amp; he’s like “it’s bc of breastfeeding” like actually it’s bc I hate myself and am filling a depressive void but sure.  Thank god for breastfeeding tho bc i eat a lot (like 2400 calories is my LOW goal so I can not gain/ maybe lose to stay around 97-98 @ 5’7). But that’s hard w breastfeeding 2 kids bc I’m starving and miserable if I eat less than that. I can’t imagine eating less when they quit breastfeeding. I’m terrified I might just end up fat. The self control it takes to obly eat this much is unreal ",False,False

You also know in the back of their heads they’re thinking the good we’re complaining about barely seems like a snack to them or something. ,False,True

My SO sometimes tells me “it’s ok, you were just hungry” when I rant to him about how much I just ate &amp; sometimes I actually wasn’t hungry I just really wanted to eat 😹😹",False,False
