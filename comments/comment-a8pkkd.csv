I can‚Äôt believe people would be upset about you waking or biking of all things.   I‚Äôve been drinking it consistently since college so about ten years. And there has been variation in that time too where I would drink more/mostly water and it had never made a difference weight wise.

I totally get the fear but hopefully that eases your mind a little. ,False,False
