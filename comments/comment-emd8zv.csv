As someone who's struggled with an ED for years, I'd seriously suggest you talk to a therapist about your concerns. Trust me, you don't want to wait until you're stuck in a spiral of constant misery and feel like you need it. We are all our worst critics, its so easy to see all your flaws even when you do something right.   The fact that you're aware that ways you are thinking is unhealthy is good! Body image issues are hard and I think its great that you want to go forward in a healthy way. I would try to think about things you do that you enjoy and feel good about doing and accomplishing (do you like a particular sport, or an art class, or hiking, or a workout class with friends)? Find more things that make you feel confident and happy. Also, its ok to be easy on yourself (something I try to remind myself a lot) and a lot of things you feel like you ""should"" do/be/weigh...ect  are holding yourself to unrealistic or extremely high standards.   I don't have much else in the way of advice (thats not omg love urself ur beautiful no matter what bc I know that doesn't work lol) but Im glad you reached out! Walking the line between low self confidence and bad body image and EDs is no fun for anyone (and something that won't magically go away once you hit a certain weight), and your feelings are real and valid. Also if you ever need to vent or anything feel free to PM me!",False,False
