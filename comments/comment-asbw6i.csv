My ADHD was misdiagnosis and they fucked up 4 years of my childhood and that lack of hunger and other complications were one of the triggers for my ED. Turns out I have and always had generalized anxiety, I have had panic attacks since 3-4y.o. and to diagnose ADHD you must discard any other mental or physical condition. Ritalin is a really heavy drug and has strong side effects. If you haven't yet ask your psychiatrist about that. ",False,False

If you ever feel insecure about being able to see more of her ribs or something, just keep in mind that some people ribs stick out more naturally. For example, mine are naturally compressed a bit. When I went to physical therapy, they couldnt find a difference between the bottom of my ribs and the top of my abs. So my ribs will probably not be visible unless I am extremely underweight. I hope that if you have any feelings of insecurity about that, it helps to make you feel a bit better.  Good luck on recovery, we're all proud of you!!!",False,False
