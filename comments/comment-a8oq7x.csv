But looking at your stats youâ€™re a teenager so Iâ€™m assuming your friends are too, sheâ€™s probably genuinely concerned for you and doesnâ€™t how to handle the situation bc you know, sheâ€™s a teenager with not that much life experience. Iâ€™d give her the benefit of the doubt just bc sheâ€™s probably trying to be nice but it still sucks that you had to go through that ",False,False

Like you said, they were only doing it because they were worried abpit you, but people don't understand the emotional stress that eating puts on us all.   Side note, I lost the right to order pizza for my friend group anymore because I always order a meat lovers (am vegetarian so I have a reason to refuse eating the pizza then) and now they only order cheese or vegetable.ðŸ˜ª",False,False

They might keep an eye on you, which is scary enough, but I doubt anyone will try to feed you all the time - I imagine everyone else felt awkward about it too. Does that make you feel any better? And you were triggered to b/p by that incident, doesn't mean you have to keep doing it. ",False,False
