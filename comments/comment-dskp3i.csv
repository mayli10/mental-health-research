Like, I'll go from hating myself for months at a time and thinking of myself as the worst person in the world to thinking ""why am I hurting myself like this? I need to stop!"" It's super powerful in that way. I think it can be helpful in small doses, but work needs to be done outside of it as well. You can't count on being high for the rest of your life.  However, when I was a usual baby-stoner, I binged while high many times and I ultimately cut way way back on smoking because I was turning into a lifeless boring blob.",False,False

Yes, weed can be helpful in recoveryâ€” however, donâ€™t forget that in some individuals over time it can work as a depressant as well, much like alcohol, so you may end up feeling MORE depressed down the line even if you donâ€™t now. Unfortunately you have to actually suffer that unfortunate side effect to realize if itâ€™s a problem. Luckily, though, weed is nonaddictive, and it doesnâ€™t react badly with most individuals, only some. Best of luck to you in recovery :)",False,False
