Hopefully we’re just overreacting and our behaviors aren’t actually going to have a harmful effect on those we care about. Try to stay positive ✨,False,True

I was already so anxious about the actual calories that I failed to realize that... it’s normal for people to want to eat healthily and it doesn’t always mean they’re developing a disorder. Just goes to show how much all of this has clouded my judgment. Well wishes to you ✨",False,True

The thing is he’s super fit, active and 6’4. I wanted to slap him and say EAT THE GODDAMN TORTILLA YOU DESERVE IT. I understand your pain. It sucks when the disorder starts leaking onto the people around you.",False,False

He was slightly overweight and has problems losing weight so he told me he started seeing me as inspiration and copying what I was doing. I felt so so horrible and guilty.   I'm so sorry ur going through this! If he's dead set on calorie counting, help him do it healthily. Lots of people count calories with a healthy mindset so don't worry too much. Make sure he has healthy goals and is eating enough and make him feel attractive at every size! &lt;3 it will be okay I'm sure &lt;33",False,False

It’s important for me to remember that many people are nutrition-conscious, tracking calories, or even dieting without being disordered. It’s good for me to be aware of how my verbalization of disordered thoughts can impact others, but it’s also important I accurately assess the limits of my part in things - I need to remember where I end and the world begins. If he does choose to become more aware of nutrition, I hope it will be something you and your bf navigate in ways that are healthy for the both of you &lt;3",False,False
