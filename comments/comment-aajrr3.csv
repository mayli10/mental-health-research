She said it only mattered if I was trying to get pregnant. I come from a medical family - most of my aunties and sister and her friends, plus my mother in law and sister in law are all highly qualified nurses. All of them said its not a problem. I mentioned the risk of osteo and they said that since the tests showed I was still ovulating (just not shedding my womb lining), I was fine. They acted like it was no big deal.  My mother in law had osteo and it was nothing to do with her periods. ",False,False

For me it seems to go on for a few days longer than it would if I still had regular periods. But it's absolutely a thingüòÇ Even had light cramps.",False,True

I recently posted in another sub after Googling the hell out of this, asking if it was possible to experience PMS symptoms (both emotional and physiological) without any evidence of an actual period...  DEAR GOD, the hunger. The bloating. The feeling of being an irritable, exhausted, bottomless pit. The sudden intensity of carbohydrate cravings and headaches.   How long has it been since your last period? Mine was in July and I feel like the more time passes, the less confident I am in my ability to estimate or predict when it ""should"" be happening, theoretically. However, my symptoms did line up with my usual schedule (and abated as would be expected, thank God), so I'm feeling pretty vindicated.  Seriously, thank you for confirming that this is a thing.",False,False

My doctor was chill about it as well, probably since I'm not visibly underweight.  I'm hoping for my hormones to adjust to the new weight, so I'll probably try maintaining for longer.",False,True

I got checked out- I was still ovulating but my progesterone was too low to have a bleed. All the other symptoms were there though.  Dr said that not having periods was completely fine, with no health issues. She says that ovulating and bleeding every month was fairly new in history due to better nutrition and that even now not every woman has a period every month.  I gained 7lbs and got my period back. Planning on losing again though. ",False,False
