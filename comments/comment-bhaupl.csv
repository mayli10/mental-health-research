People with colorful hair, pffft, obviously they're full of confidence, right? Ha! I may not have great sleight of hand but I do have some accidental social trickery.   I bet you'll look fantastic with a foresty, earthy green! Take an afternoon and just do it! Call it ""self care"" day and give any mean thoughts a huge middle finger. You're worth it.",False,False

I used to dye my hair green and I really miss it, it makes you feel very cute and total elf vibes, you should do it! Hopefully in a few years I'm at a place in my career where I can just work remotely and dye my hair again.  Only annoying thing is the staining, I don't miss that but it's worth it.",False,False

I feel like dyed hair is a stereotype against fat people and that if I do it I'll be buying into that stereotype and people will just see me as a fatty trying to distract from their fatness but then I'm like ... EVERYTHING is a stereotype against fat people lol. And if it isn't a legit one then my brain will make it one. If I go out looking frumpy then that makes me feel like a 'bad fatty', if I go out with a beat face but all warm neutrals it makes me feel like a 'bad fatty', if I go for an alt style in any form like dyed hair it makes me feel like a 'bad fatty'. So if I'm going to feel stuff like this no matter what I may as well do the one I *like*, right?  You should dye your hair!! For starters, you aren't going to look like any of those things, especially a tomato (hard relate lol), you're going to look amazing, and it's going to make you FEEL good, too, which you deserve.  And FWIW I dyed my hair green at my highest weight and I got nothing but sincere compliments, and looking back it looked genuinely good. Do it!!",False,False

I used to be afraid of people staring but you're right, it just doesn't matter after some time. I've found that it kind of helps to instill some false confidence? I've had people comment, ""You're brave, I would NEVER be able to pull that off!"" Yeah, well, I'd never describe myself as a confident person but here I am, weirdo with colorful hair.   One of the weird side-effects that came from it is that I get less comments from older men. They don't get pushy with the ""Your eyes are so beautiful"" or ""You should smile, sweetheart."" I really do think it's the hair.   I waited so long to do anything fun with my hair because I felt I was too fat to deserve nice things. I still think that way sometimes (and I'm still fat), but now I have purple hair. I think you'll look great with green hair, OP. Are you wanting a magical dark forest green, or a whimsical pastel lime?",False,False

When I was in school I always wanted to have some blue strands or blue bangs... and two and a half years ago I did it. I bleached my hair at the bottom and dipdyed my hair blue and after a few months I dyed the rest of it black and blue, and then blue and pink, or blue and purple and darkblue at the roots and lighter blue the rest of my hair... and I love it.   At first you will think that everyone is staring at you because of your hair, and two years later, people are still staring, but you won't care anymore...    Since I have my blue hair I feel somehow way better about myself... I don't know why because I still have zero self-confidence when it comes to my face or weight or body or intelligence or whatever.
