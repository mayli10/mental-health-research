I am gonna try to take it one step at a time. I called one of my brothers, and maybe tomorrow if I feel up to it then I’ll call one of my friends. It’s been a really hard day, never mind the last few days entirely. Today just really hit me like a brick, but this message as well as the others have been very uplifting, and I needed to hear it. I am honestly really thankful for the people in this sub (as cheesy as that sounds). It feels really good to be able to talk about this",False,True

The last part really got me. I feel like I’ve denied myself being able to be vocal about what he has done that hurts me. Also, my ex also cheated on me early (10 months) in the relationship. He would deny, deny, deny. And he would lie, like crazy to cover up. He would lie to cover up another lie. I have really good memory, so when I would ask him about it (not angry or interrogation style) he would get so angry &amp; tell me that it was none of my business. Then he would eventually admit to it but he would tell me that I made him lie. Or that I drove him to it. I should have ended it then,...but he made me feel like I was the crazy obsessive girlfriend when I wasn’t.   Anyway, thank you. I know these responses seem really small but they honestly have been really helpful. I feel like I was able to get how I feel off my chest.",False,True

I ended up calling my older brother who I hadn’t spoken to in over a year because of him. I thought he would be angry at me but he wasn’t. I can’t say the same for the rest of my family since it’s been a lot longer with them...as for my friends it might take a bit too...I wish I had never listened to him in the first place. You’re right he was isolating me...but it’s like, he convinced me a different reason for each person. My mom died when I was young, and my dad wasn’t in my life at all. So the rest of my family and my friends were kinda all I had. He constantly would tell me that all of them were terrible influences on me, and that I shouldn’t want then &amp; that he was all I should need. I know I should have seen it when he said it but it all happened gradually over time and he just knew how to manipulate me you know?  thank you for the book suggestion...I just an audible account so I will see if that book is there. Thank you so much",False,True

I know you feel poor now and I am so sorry for that. You can rebuild with your former friendships if those are genuine and meant to be. I am also a formerly abused person and it all is going to get better love. You love YOU right now. Do call your friends and family. Im so proud of you. Here for you if you want to chat!!,False,False

My stomach has had this weird feeling in it since the break up and it hasn’t gone away yet. It’s starting to make me feel sick... He was so bad for me and toxic but I still sobbed in my bed for hours and hours till I had no tears left to cry.,False,False

I was with an abusive rapist for two years and then he dumped me after I confronted him with the photo/text proof of him cheating on me with one of my close friends. Despite all the horrible shit that went on between us it really hurt at the time. I spiraled hard into my lowest weight ever, worst time w self harm, and beginnings of drug abuse. It was a bad time. But lemme tell u gyal I wish I knew then what I knew now. Honestly the drugs and self harm and anorexia probably always would’ve been a thing eventually but being sad over him for longer than 10 seconds was a huge mistake. He was a fuckboy to say the least and he’s far beneath my level. I might hate myself but I don’t fuck w cockroaches. You should feel that way too. You’re allowed to have your own problems and struggles but they’re yours, not his. He doesn’t own your life and you’re better than him. Try to fake it til you make it, if you can’t believe that just yet. ❤️",False,False

Please call your friends and family. They will be happy to have you back, I promise. If you had a good relationship with them prior, I’m sure they’ll be understanding to your situation.   The situation you described was abuse. Your boyfriend was abusive and it’s very very hard to leave a relationship like that. I’m proud of you for being able to hang up on him. Right now though you need supportive people around you. He isolated you on purpose — it’s so that you don’t have a safety net and it becomes that much harder to leave him. When you’re alone, you’ll be so tempted to return to the relationship. I would suggest you read Why Does He Do That? By Lundy Bancroft. It’s about male pattern violence/domestic abuse and arms you with the knowledge to see through an abusive person’s bullshit. Stay strong and take care of yourself.",False,False

My abusive ex boyfriend and I dated for almost 2 years and finally broke up for good a few days ago. They cycle of breaking up and getting back together over and over again have left me physically and emotionally exhausted.   All I want to do is lay in bed and do nothing all day. I feel so defeated. At least we can feel this way together,False,False
