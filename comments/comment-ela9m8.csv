I try to make sure that there isn’t anything I would be comfortable binging at home and just mostly make it that if I had to I’d probably have to expend a lot of effort. It doesn’t work all the time but it helps to just make it more difficult for you to act on a binge urge. I have a safe food that I rarely binge on (eggs lol, bc you have to cook them and they’re placed on the egg rack? so it’s very obvious if I’ve eaten just one) and I try to put that in my meals to make me more comfortable and less likely to binge more afterwards. I hope this helps but either way, hang in there!",False,False
