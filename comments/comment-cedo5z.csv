From 7th grade I would restrict on and off because before I hit a growth spurt I thought I was chubby. I just hadn't grown into my body shape yet so all excess weight was at my tum, even tho I was still underweight. I thought I was high average at best.  My mom has said multiple times that if she didnt have an anorexic roommate in college, she would have developed an eating disorder. She overexercisized and has struggled with body dysmorphia. But worse, she was always eating diet food. Even when she got back to her pre-child weight (she had 5 kids) she'd still be dieting to try to lose more weight than before. And, she would make so many comments on how old ""friends"" gained so much weight, and make lots of bitchy comments about my friends parents being big, xyz. I love my mom but genetics-wise, I got the genes for a predisposition to an ED, and was raised in an environment that was food obsessed and weight obsessed, where excess fat= bad persob",False,False

My mom raised me to eat healthy choices, but she did also buy me the occasional McDonald's and let me eat not so good stuff for b-day parties or other special events. I'm Hispanic so we mainly eat rice and beans, which is very good for you! However, my mom does have a tendency to pile a mountain of whatever she cooks on my plate and has a different view of what is fat or skinny. At 5'1, I was at 125 and she thought I needed to stop losing weight whereas that's a bit chubby in my eyes and likely the eyes of others. I see it as a cultural thing but idk.",False,False

My dad just always made comments about how much food I was consuming making it seem like I was eating too much. I was never a big girl but I also wasn't pixie skinny. All of their negativity definitely impacted my relationship with food from a very early age. I'd hide food in my room in weird places. I started binging and purging at a ridiculously young age until I found out about laxatives(which my mom always had a lot of for whatever reason)so I started taking excessive amounts of laxatives and hiding them in this weird teddy bear pillow thing I had.     Their attitudes about weight and food absolutely had something to do with my Ed's but I'd never put the blame wholy on them. There were other things and people that led to my problems more so and I own that I did this to myself mostly. After they found out about the laxatives and binging and purging I started really restricting and started to see actual results which just made everything worse and now I'm stuck in this weird perpetual cycle of restricting and binging but I don't purge anymore because I partially ruptured my esophagus doing that when I was like 13 years old. And I hate the way laxatives make me feel.     So yes. My parents did play a part in my disorders but no I don't hold it against them too much.",False,False

She becomes obsessed with different diets, and restricts what she can eat to insane amounts, and then binges. Like, she'll spend months where she'll only eat green vegetables. Then she'll spend months only eating during 1 hour a day. Then she'll try fasting for week. In between all this, she'll spend an afternoon binging on whatever junk food she can find. She has all these weird food rules that she used to force me to follow. For example, I didn't try chips until I was 12. She also constantly praised me for being underweight growing up, and would get mad at me for ""eating too much"", even if I was eating a normal amount. I used to binge whenever she left the house, even for a minute, because I was so hungry and didn't want her judgements. My mom's whole family is either obese or fasts for days at a time to keep their weight down. My dad is overweight, and so is everyone in his family. I never even had a chance to have a normal relationship with food.  Don't misinterpret this though, I love my mom.

In my opinion that seems extreme.  My parents both don't eat very much at all.

Once we had a roommate who my mom always said had ""such a fat ass"". Which I felt was especially fucking rude, because my mom was 50 and she was putting down the like, 21 year old girl. Like, come on, really? Is this making you feel better? @_@  So yeah I'm pretty sure that influenced me. As a kid I was always thin, and my ED didn't really develop until I'd moved out of the house, so I don't think it was 100% the cause. And honestly she never once commented on *my* own weight. I think she might've been jealous of me, but she didn't voice that, and in my teenage years I wasn't cognizant of it.   But I definitely grew up with the idea that being fat is basically a sin and makes you a Bad Person.

I think maybe she wanted to make sure I didn't feel that way or something? it ended up having the opposite effect though  the first time my mum told me i needed to lose some weight was right after i finished fifth grade (I was 11), when my BMI was in the lower half of normal. I never had a problem with food/weight until then, and i'd pretty much call that moment a huge catalyst in my journey to developing an ED. i love my mum, she's a really sweet and supportive person, but she's made a lot of comments like this over the years that have 1) led me to be really insecure about anyone commenting on/looking at my body, and 2) caused food issues ever since.  I remember for YEARS as i was growing up (and going through a huge growth spurt) i'd binge on all sorts of foods and then i'd lie about it because i felt insecure after what my mum had said. she still makes all sorts of comments that make me feel so awful. like she'll eat a TINY portion of dinner and then be like ""oh my goodness I ate so much I'm so full wow I should've had less for dinner"" when I'd served myself more food than she had; it's always things like this, it always feels like a guilt trip. i didn't even realize i was dealing with binge eating disorder until she told me again that i was fat and need to lose weight (and I knew I did! but i felt really shamed and cornered because she talks down to me when talking about my weight, like i'm incapable of losing weight), i ended up developing anorexia",False,False
