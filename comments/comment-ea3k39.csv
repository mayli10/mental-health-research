From what you’ve written your mum sounds like she cares and is there for you to be healthy. Let her know you may have fudged the numbers out of nervousness over the situation, but that you’re trying. If it’ll help some, maybe have a nice satisfying meal and a good glass of water before you go to weigh in if there’s no way around it and you’re very panicked. This is kind of messed up so YMMV, but if you eat something that’s more on the sodium-rich side you’ll retain more water and maybe it’ll ease your mind a little more to know the results will be more likely to tip in your favor. Take care :)",False,False
