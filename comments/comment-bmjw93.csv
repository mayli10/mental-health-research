I seem to forget that the weight will even out eventually. I *want* to be healthy, feel healthy, have healthy hair, skin, etc. I think i'm getting there.

BUT I totally know where you're coming from.  Dysmorphia exaggerates everything 1000 times greater.  Your weight distribution will even itself out but it takes time (not too long).  Please stick with this.  You don't know how amazing it is to get to the point you're at, but hopefully (and I'm really wishing hard for this) you'll realise this one day.  Even if it doesn't feel like a victory, it is.  You're on a downer because of the negative thoughts which are inevitable.  You're doing great x",False,False
