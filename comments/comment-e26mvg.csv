Maybe consider making some actual proper veggies as a meal though, even if they're just frozen ones (maybe even throw in some rice or couscous if you're feeling brave). Not only does it taste a lot better, it's similarly low calorie and it takes time, so your mindfullness may just kick in half way through and you still won't have to worry about calories",False,False
