It’s hard because I’m definitely not used to advocating for myself so this is all very new. I haven’t really thought about her wanting me to achieve full recovery. I’m doing it today ! I appreciate it!,False,True

A really good therapist...seems like they would support full recovery, no matter what that looks like as far as changing therapists. I also second asking for a referral. I had to ask for a referral for someone more specialized with a previous therapist (not due to ED stuff but he was very supportive regardless; he just wanted me to recover from all of it regardless).   It can be very anxiety-provoking to ask for what you need. Something that I’ve learned along the way of life is that my life is more important than a minor inconvenience to someone else. Your therapist is there to help you. If they can’t help, so be it. But if you stay with them and relapse hard, it’s a lose-lose situation. I guess what I’m trying to say is that your life matters and your recovery matters. I hope you find the strength to do whatever is right for you, OP. Best wishes.",False,False

She won’t be mad at you for seeking more specialized care. I wish the best for you- breaking up with therapists is hard especially if you’ve been with them long term. I am proud of you for what you’re doing.,False,False

She’s honestly trying, but none of her advice is helping. I’m way too far gone for advice that is way too general. I need personalized care if that makes sense.",False,True

If you do break up with your therapist I would suggest you be as open and honest as you can. Perhaps something along the lines of “Hey when we first started my therapy I was in recovery from my eating disorder. I’ve relapsed and feel as though I may be able to get help with someone more focused on eating disorder recovery.” You could likely ask for some referrals to someone more specialized.   Regardless this sucks; however, your therapist will understand. Promise.",False,False
