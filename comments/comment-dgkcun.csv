My boyfriend found out Iâ€™d never had a fucking pizza roll and called me while I was out exercising with the dog to tell me he brought me home a present. I get home and there are two bags of pizza rolls in the fridge and a fucking Twix on my purse. I love him. Dearly. Itâ€™s so fucking thoughtful. But Jesus ðŸ˜‚ Luckily 6 pizza rolls are 220 calories so I can like... just have a few and pretend to hate them.,False,False
