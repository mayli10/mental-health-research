What if my mom makes something unexpected and high calories? I would get so stressed out trying to allocate my calories and right now I'm at the point where idgaf anymore if I don't get my veggies and fruits in as long as I ate 1200 calories and below, I'm good",False,True

I wasn‚Äôt binging and purging often enough to be considered bulimic as I was only doing this once or twice a week and I wasn‚Äôt even close enough to underweight to be diagnosed with anorexia.   I got ‚Äúbetter‚Äù but relapsed last year with worse restriction and just as much binging and purging. Still ednos because I‚Äôm not underweight or restricting hard enough to be considered anorexic and not binging and purging enough to be considered bulimic,    Still ruining my life tho",False,False

Probably anorexic subtype binge now, or binge eating disorder aided by exercise addiction thanks to my work.  There's also the problem that I grew up without learning how to eat properly so I don't really know how to plan meals.  All I want is chocolate or cookies a lot of the time.  One day I'll have to fight this urges and retrain my mind into eating healthier because right now, I cry every time I'm off work incase my eating habits make me fat.",False,False

I purge via vomiting and exercise. I am hyper focused on calories and intake. Ngl i let myself eat up to maintenance but freak out if I go over.
