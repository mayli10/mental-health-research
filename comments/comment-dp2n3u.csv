Maybe you’re underestimating or not counting liquid calories or something. Maybe your metabolism has adjusted to this eating pattern . Our bodies are too fucking smart. If they think that’s all the food they’re gonna get they will plan to only use up that much. But I hope things get better for you soon regardless of your weight.,False,False
