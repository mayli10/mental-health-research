I felt pretty good at my old number but a little extra energy certainly wouldn't be bad. I definitely have a few ""starvation mode"" symptoms... kinda hoping my period doesn't come back though.",False,True

Purging had fucked up my body bigtime and I needed those extra calories to heal my digestive system. Some bits of your body won't heal properly unless you have good nutrition. Or they might take ages to heal. Like there's a lot of misconception around it, but starvation mode is *technically* real, it's just not what a lot of people think. People who restrict a lot get brittle hair / papery skin, and your body needs energy to fix that as well. You'll also have more energy and be unconsciously more physically active as you won't be as lethargic.",False,False
