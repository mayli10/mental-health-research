The sodium you can get from regular table salt, potassium you can get in the grocery store sold as no-salt or lite-salt and it's right with the regular salt.  Magnesium you can get in the pharmacy, get liquid magnesium citrate or a capsule of any magnesium supplement that ends in ""-ate"".  I use this recipe for an electrolyte drink:  2L water 1 tsp table salt 1 tsp potassium  1 Tbsp magnesium citrate  If you're not interested in making your own, or if you're out and about and start feeling bad, you can also just buy zero-cal electrolyte drinks like gatorade zero.",False,False

Sodium and potassium for sure, magnesium if you're still having problems.  You run out of electrolytes really fast, so weight doesn't have much of an impact on how soon these symptoms set in.",False,False
