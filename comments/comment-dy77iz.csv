I'm weak I take laxitivies if I eat over my personal calorie limit. I feel like a whale and am uncomfortable in my skin I weigh myself so often I feel like something is missing from my routine if I'm not near a scale. I weigh my food   My dr sent a referral to an ED clinic for me.  BUT when I told my s/o about all this they wanted the ""proof"" that I was sick enough for an ED clinic. So now I'm questioning everything. After being on this reddit and do oil ng research everything is pointing to slowly killing myself but I still questions if I'm sick.",False,False
