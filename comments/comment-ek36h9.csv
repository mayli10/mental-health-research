Honestly I’m 21 right now, and my parents are now encouraging me to eat because I’m on the lower end of a healthy BMI/they’re aware of my eating disorder/etc., but...  I was overweight as a child. They stopped after a year or two but even so, when I was in elementary school they would put me on all these diets, even almost signed me up for Weight Watchers, told me about how my grandmother was fat and it embarrassed my mom and she didn’t want the same for me, yada yada... Even then, those two years or so have stuck with me for forever, and I don’t doubt they’ve played a role in me developing an ED much later on in life. It’s scarring.  I feel for you. Nobody should have to be talked to like that by their parents. It hurts, and even the tiniest bit can do more damage than they’ll ever know.",False,False
