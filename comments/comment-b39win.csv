Since I started journaling it helped me so much. A lot of negative feelings can result in a binge even if you’re full. Accepting those negative feelings and wanting to get away from it help. Negative emotions create a negative cycle. Writing it down and putting it out there in words really help, but it’s important that you don’t shit on yourself. Basically don’t write things like “I hate myself” ...etc. Again negative emotions create a negative cycles.   I hope this makes sense, I’m just trying to help with what worked with me. I haven’t binged in over two months and I heavily binging before. Let me know if you try it or not. ",False,False
