Had to be careful and even minimize water, as unhealthy as that is. Just long enough to break the habit/need.  Stopped cold-turkey. It was so rough, that I kept trying to purge the empty stomach. Literal nothing. Just so the itch/craving would fade out. I'm lucky I didn't seriously hurt myself.  It was some pathetic shit, and I never want to go back to that. My eating habits are still pretty questionable, but almost anything's better than that was. I was not here for a fun time, and likely neither for a long time.",False,False
