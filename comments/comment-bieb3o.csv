Lots of people used to share little things they'd achieved or done and they felt like they couldn't share it with anyone else.  Self-care Saturday? Somewhere to post things we're doing that might help others if they're struggling? Idk,False,True

Prompts help a lot of people break the ice.  I think the recipe threads were actually really helpful though because safe foods are always better than no food. People tended to look at those threads as ""wow this is encouraging people to eat 140 calories for lunch instead of 400!"" but in reality for a lot of people they were ""this is encouraging people to eat 140 calories for lunch instead of 0."" Which is always better. But I also understand the mods here not wanting to do that in case it veers too close to looking like ""promoting"" eating disorders, regardless of its actual effects.",False,False

The issue with many of the specific theme ones as you mentioned is that they’re a bit more pro-y than we can allow. Way to go Wednesday IIRC had quite a lot of people updating about their stats and people congratulating them on losing which is kinda a no go for us. At the same time we obviously aren’t going to push recovery on people so it’d be a bit hard to make a way to go thread but only allow recovery themed comments.   Anyways, thoughts, suggestions, everything is appreciated!",False,False

I know we have the daily discussion thread but ngl I don't use it because I just don't know what to post there! If we had specific threads I think it would help a lot of people.",False,True

Some of the old ones were definitely encouraging competition/fishing for positive feedback on thinness, which is like crack for EDs. As much as I miss them I'm also glad the daily meal threads are gone too for the same reason.  I think daily or weekly threads would be really good if they weren't focused on EDs at all. If they were just a place to talk about our every day lives like you said, in a safe place where we can talk about how EDs impact our lives if we want to.",False,False

Idk I just personally remember finding those really triggering at times, and I think threads like those were probably part of why proED got banned. :(   I would definitely like to see the more general threads back though! I think it’s good to have places to put general chit chat convos, especially since EDs can be socially isolating.",False,False
