I don’t think it’s silly or insecure, it’s simply how you feel, and it definitely seems like this is a conversation that is necessary, for your own mental wellbeing. Stay strong and u got this ❤️",False,False

I think the bigger worry is how he’s going to react, will he push it off? will he apologize? If he gets angry is that a red enough flag for you to leave?  Be kind to yourself. You deserve a lot.",False,False

And now every time I sit down I'm like...checking for creases in my stomach lol. Yay for a new body-checking behavior /s  I know everyone has there preferences but I guess I would just prefer if they weren't weight-related. But that's kind of an unfair demand.  How do you think I should approach it?,False,True

I was thinking maybe something like, ""So I feel kind of uncomfortable when you comment on other peoples' bodies in a negative way. It's hard for me to not compare my body to others, and it's really easy for my brain to linger on things like that.""  Idk I guess I just don't want to seem silly and insecure about it, because that's how I feel lol. Thank you for your advice :)",False,True
