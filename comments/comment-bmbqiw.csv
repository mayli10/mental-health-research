At least junk food binges are bouts hatred, but healthy binges are a bit confusing? Especially because they usually only happen if you've been restricting for a while.  You have no idea how much I fucking want salmon with steamed veggies though. I'm so fucking hungry.  The sad part? I've had a shit ton of slip ups recently with binges and b/p's on sugary ass shit food.  The worst part is bingeing on a bunch of sugar but still starving because you never eat the healthy food ðŸ˜¢",False,False

It is a natural and normal reaction to restriction. Don't hate yourself for your body just doing what it does best - keeping you alive &lt;3   Would you be angry with yourself if you had to go to the bathroom, and so you did, and then a couple minutes later you had to go again (or thought you did - lololol real talk I literally do this all the time)? Probably not. Hunger (physical AND mental) is your body telling you that it needs food, just like you know when you have to take a piss.   I find that analogy useful so thought I'd share it.",False,False
