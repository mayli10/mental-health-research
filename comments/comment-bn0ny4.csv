I have a friend who weighs about 30 pounds more than me and I always felt like she was way thinner. She does have more muscle that is true, but I noticed the other day when I borrowed a shirt of hers it was much looser on me. And I have also noticed when we have sat by each other that her arms and legs actually are much bigger than mine.   Dysmorphia is weird. I’m not sure how the brain can be so deceiving sometimes. Can make me question my general sanity :/",False,False

When you starve yourself, you lose muscle as well as fat so even though you weigh less, you still look flabby. Muscle definition is what makes people looks healthy and thin. Getting into right exercise regime was key to my recovery. I weigh more than than my LW, but I actually look way thinner than I did. More muscle on your body also means your metabolism is faster and you can eat more with fewer consequences. Now when I see the scale go up, I’m pumped bc it means I got more muscle. Body dysmorphia makes it hard to see most of the time still, but I’ll have moments where I’ll catch my reflection and be like “who is that hot thin lady?” And be completely flabbergasted when I realize that I am that skinny lady. Ofc five seconds later the feeling passes but I try to remember those moments when I look in the mirror and hate what I see.",False,False

I worked out a lot, gained weight, despaired, tried to lose w restricting and would go down but not as low, I'd decide to go back to the gym, gain more, restrict but not lose enough.... Over and over. Today I am the same weight as my HW, but I look the same (and in some areas better!) Than my LW! I still want to lose but my recent revelation about this is helping me continue work out and diet less extremely on this restrict phase. *It's all about muscle!*  I even have a LW/CW comparison photo I can show you if you're interested (MASSIVE TW THO)",False,False
