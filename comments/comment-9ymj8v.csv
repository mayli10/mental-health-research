I think 80% of this sub (and the old one) are wannarexics who think EDs are some kind of game they like to play for the drama of it all. ,False,False

Having serious posts buried by memes isn't great. I think we need more clear and defined rules about what we can post without getting the subreddit banned (unless they've been posted and I've missed them?) before it's done though, so people don't start flooding with the sort of stuff that got r/proed banned in the first place.",False,False

It makes me feel like I‚Äôm not alone, and there are other people struggling. I don‚Äôt want to be ‚Äúfixed‚Äù or ‚Äúbetter‚Äù; I just want someone else to be like ‚Äúhaha, me too‚Äù. So I don‚Äôt feel like I‚Äôm the only one scared to death of gaining weight and feeling like I‚Äôm some sort of freak for counting all my calories, and hating myself after every meal. ",False,False

I might just go executive decision and ban the memes. **Let me know though if you disagree with this change!**  I‚Äôm hesitant to do that however since I‚Äôm really not the make decisions mod so much as the tech side. Like tonight I plan on making the flair bot system so stay tuned.,False,False
