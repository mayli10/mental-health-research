I don't know any restaurant in this country that would serve a meal big enough to satisfy one of my binges so either Canada have huge portions compared to us, or my binges are much bigger than maybe you guessed. Also this could just be me but I still drink a load of soft drinks even when I binge.  It's a shame RedBull is so expensive because I hate the taste of that sickly sweet acid that is Monster Zero (I may have insulted this entire community, pls forgive me)",False,False

Same would get me a big meal from a resturant that would go for 2-3 meals. But yeah otherwise food is freaking expensive,False,False

I feel genuinely less anxious during restriction because of how much money I save, the countless diet cokes don't nearly measure to how expensive food is :(",False,False
