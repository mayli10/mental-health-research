I promise that I'll be supplementing electrolytes the entire time so I don't mess with my body's homeostasis too much. I'm also slightly overweight, so even if I stay the course and have an optimistic rate of weight loss, I'll still end up on the lower-mid end of a normal BMI. And of course, I'll stop if anything concerning happens.  You're the sweetest. May the new year bring us good luck!",False,False

Well I do hope you'll take care, and keep it as safe as you can. Sounds very challenging and a bit scary tbh but I can't say I don't understand. I'll wish you all the best for everything :"") Don't push yourself too hard and we'll be here if you need a listening ear ðŸ’“",False,True

I'm going to take it a week at a time because I've never gone past 4, but I saw the challenge on r/fasting and my disordered brain went, ""Oh, this is a way to take control of your life! Maybe you'll be happy once you're unrecognizable. :D""",False,False
