I already know I’m gonna be living in them. But they also had like a baggier version if that’s more your jam!",False,False

But from my knowledge of women's clothing, Land's End is decent, esp on sale. If you don't mind/can fit into boys' clothing, Brooks Bros is somewhat better quality at the same price point (when shopping in the children's section). LL Bean is another option, although their cuts are stodgier than Land's End. (If anyone has better sources, speak up! Corduroy is allegedly ~back~, but I'm still not seeing many decent options about for items bought new, esp bottoms.)",False,False

The black gives the illusion of longer, slimmer legs and the compression holds everything in... they’re truly magical leggings. They’re a bit pricey (but worth every penny IMO), so I’ve found more pairs secondhand on Poshmark. I also really like Athleta for a cheaper alternative; I have a pair with faux leather panels and those + an oversized sweater that reveals a little bit of collarbone is my go-to fall/winter outfit.",False,False

They cinch you in at the waist so you feel super secure, but the sweater hides any, ahem, “sins”. Also the aesthetic of tight-on-the-bottom, chunky-on-the-top is timeless imo, and it works in casual and smart-casual settings.   You can get really good, reasonably priced ones from Hollister and American Eagle.",False,False
