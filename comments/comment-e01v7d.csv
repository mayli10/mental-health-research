I’m pretty competitive with my best friend. We have gone back and forth on who is hotter in our lives (known her since we were 5, similar body types and heights and personal styles) and right now she is the hotter one. She goes to the gym every day and sees a trainer and eats super healthy vegan homemade dishes every day. I hate gyms and only like cooking really aggressively high calorie stuff and baking. I used to be a 00/0 and she was a 0/2. Now she’s a size 4/6 and I’m a size 8/10 (was a 12, I’m on my way back to 0). She gained weight first and has been trying to loose the weight for like 5 years now but can’t seem to bust below a size 4. I have lost 20 lbs in two months and we are both starting to get superficially judgey with each other as I get closer and closer to her size again. Stuff like, “ugh I haven’t dropped weight in a week,” “well it’s probably all that beer you shouldn’t have drank at the camping trip.” Or, “wow you look really skinny, “yeah I think it’s the cardio I’ve been doing when you won’t go to the gym with me.” It’s crazy. We both have verbally recognized it and are like, “this is stupid as fuck.” But also I kinda like it because it’s motivating. Like, my first goal is to get skinnier than her. Then I want to be a 0 again.",False,False

With other people I care more about their body language than their looks and like, I always see beauty in them.
