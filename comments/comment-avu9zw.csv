She’s not eaten a calorie since 1997”  Probably not wonderful that my skinny ass felt incredibly validated 🤷🏻‍♀️",False,False

It helps that my ED didn't develop til I was away at college so its been relatively easy to hide, plus I've stayed in a normal weight range. So yea she has no clue and the rare time she makes jokes like that it bugs the hell outta me.",False,False

And I told her I’d go with her but I won’t get anything (I’m fasting and also... burgers are like a calorie bomb). And then she says all mocking “ou don’t you know burgers don’t fit into my daily macros”.   She doesn’t know I have food issues so I get it but it was kinda funny... like no your right a burger definitely doesn’t fit into zero calories.   Also I’m scared now because I’m fasting until Saturday night so I can drink with my friends but now their talking about ordering pizza.... no! Why! Why can’t we all just eat celery and drink sparkling water. ,False,False

And a different time she said something along the lines of ""go throw up now so you can eat more."" Both were joking (but like tf kinda joke is that ????) and she has no idea about how I really am but like oof those hurt a little. ",False,False
