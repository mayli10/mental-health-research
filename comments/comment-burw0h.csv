Please tell me you don't do computer, smartphone, or tablet most often. Because the symptoms you've are related to excessive use of screen. If so, invest in a pair of anti blue light blocking glasses because they:  * Relieve headaches * Reduce eyestrain and fatigue * Avoid blurry and dry eyes * Improve sleep * Reduce stress  Yes, anti blue light glasses do these things. I've been using them for a couple months now. It couldn't be better.      PS - I'm launching my own anti blue light computer glasses brand in a week. If you're interested, I'd be happy to offer you a 50% OFF with free shipping. Our glasses are tested for quality and the type of plastic used is within safe limits. That said, you'll be good! Here's the link to subscribe and I'll email you once we're open.   **bit.ly/2Qp9rci**      Hope it helps!",False,False

I ate normally in the days immediately following, but restricted for months afterwards and my eyes healed fine - although I am not underweight and perhaps did not restrict as intensely as you did.  Sorry that you are going through this and I hope everything works out. ðŸ’—",False,False

Given that youâ€™ve previously had surgery, itâ€™s important that you see your ophthalmologist, or at least an optometrist or primary care physician to make sure it isnâ€™t anything serious",False,False

A, C &amp; E, lutein, co-Q10, omegas) and my eyes healed ok. Theyâ€™ve deteriorated a little over the years (18 years now since I had it done, gone from -0.25 to -1.75) but not as bad as before (oosh like -6 or something!) I notice my vision is blurrier when my diet is lacking, but it seems to be somewhat reversible and improves again once I start eating better. Like I said though the prescription has worsened over the years, but that could just be normal atrophy and/or aging . Hope everything goes well for you, keep up with recovery as well as you can and consider the supplements (careful not to OD on them though, especially vitamin A which can damage your eyes in OD. Watch out for if you take more than one supplement that youâ€™re not double-dosing) good luck",False,False
