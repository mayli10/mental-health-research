I know that wrestlers develop eating disorders. I saw guys spitting during school as a way to get rid of water weight. I remember doing that in 5th grade as I was losing weight...seriously I was scared of gaining weight from swallowing saliva.,False,False

Maybe he's insecure about his muscle development, or maybe he just genuinely feels overweight. Either way, maybe you could give him some pointers to work out healthfully, get stronger, and nourish himself",False,False

This is legit my biggest nightmare, for my little brother to take the same path as I am taking right now.   I'm not sure if my advice is worth anything, but I would *definitely* NOT wait for myself to get better while he's possibly getting worse. Don't get me wrong, you SHOULD!! get better as soon as you possibly can manage, but I feel like your brother shouldn't wait. Please, sit him down and have a good, honest, open talk. No secrets, no taboo topics. Tell him everything. Every bad side, every terrible thing your ED has made you feel. Don't be harsh with him, don't ""forbid"" him anything. Just be honest and empathetic. Make it clear that it's in his absolute best interest to not go down this route. Show him you noticed his stuggle. He'll surely appreciate feeling less alone, especially if your parents act the way they do.  Please, both you and your brother, stay safe, and take care. Hugs ♥",False,False
