I stick to under 1000cals and less than 20g carbs. I usually have lots of problems with binging but i only binged once so far and i still lost 100g the day after so. Im also not as hungry as i usually am, might be cause i get to eat fatty stuff(which i love).",False,False

I would eat &lt;20g Net Carbs a day and try to keep under 1200 calories. Most days, I could really only maintain a max of 900-1000 cals a day since I got so full off of meats and veggies.   Positives:   * It really helped me not binge because I literally couldn't even eat a small serving of chips/cookies. So I never would have it around.  * There were plenty of keto-friendly options at restaurants. Pizza places often had wings, you can order burgers without buns, *salads*... etc. * It allows you to actually have oils/butter etc since you have so much excess calories to spend in replacement of carbs. * It's actually a ""socially acceptable"" way to diet since it's so popular now. Which means when people offer you sweets/snacks/food you will always have a reason to say no since most treats have carbs. * There are a lot of ""sugar-free"" products that can fix your sweet tooth. Sugar-free maple syrup became a staple when I was craving sweets.   Downsides:  * It can get expensive since many cheap foods are high in carbs. * I couldn't really eat any fruit. * Very few snack options that I didn't personally hate. * There were days where I really missed some of my favorite foods and would do really stupid shit to try to find alternatives like make bread out of egg whites. * It can be hard to find products in stores so you end up just buying the same low-carb tortillas and meals. * By the end I became too obsessive with my meals (but that might be my personality/ED)  * I went on it because I heard you lose weight faster than regular calorie counting. I lost weight just as much as the normal calorie-counting route. (Ex: eating &lt;1200 cals with carbs or without carbs both made me lose a steady 2 lbs/ week). When I realized this, I was even less motivated to maintain it.   I quit because I was going on a trip to Europe and was like ""oh there's carbs there and I wanna eat authentic food so I might as well just quit"". (surprise, I gained my weight back after quitting keto and not sticking to a healthy diet afterwards).   I've been easing back into it now and I'm considering just living this way as a lifestyle choice if it really does prevent me from binges.",False,False
