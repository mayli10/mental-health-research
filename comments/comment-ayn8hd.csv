It's hard to read the things we feel and much of it can be scary, but it makes the picture of symptoms so much clearer when you can reflect back on things like that.",False,False

I have journals full of writings and I tried to digitize them and they actually scared me with how disgusting and awful they are and it scares me I feel like I should be heavily medicated when that side of me kind of takes over. I might just have to digitize and send to a therapist but thank you so much!!!! ,False,True

Act like they're all about someone else and determine what you'd say if you were an outside observer. Try to identify and analyze things. For me, it's been helpful to journal and go back and read past entries. Writing things out always helps me see the picture more clearly.   For instance, I have dissociative episodes where I disconnect almost entirely. Everything feels fuzzy and my body feels numb but also shakes with anxiety, I can't speak or react. These episodes are scary for me. Once I had written about them a few times, it became clear that I was experiencing dissociation. I was finally able to label my behavior and express that to someone else.   Maybe start with writing out individual symptoms you experience and then group together symptoms that might indicate an illness (i.e. fatigue, lack of enjoyment in things, sadness, numbness, might all point towards depression, so you could group those things together).

If I can be okay with the worst thing possible, then it goes to stand that I'll be alright with whatever happens, even if it doesn't feel like it.  Seems to me like the worst thing that can happen is that you get a therapist who's blatantly cruel. It'd be terrible, but all you'd have to do is immediately walk out and find someone else.  Does that make getting help seem more doable, at all? Hope so.",False,False

I went to a psychiatric office last week for my first appointment there and I was extremely nervous. I sort of ""detached"" emotionally and spoke in plain, medical terms about what was going on with me. I'm not saying it was easy, but it did prevent me from panicking. I acted like I was evaluating someone else basically. ",False,False
