I believe a great option would be kinda eating enough calories to mantain your weight but start lifting weights so you can build more muscle... and therefore you won’t get fat just muscle?... Sorry i don’t know what to say... But whatever you do, (even if you decide to fast) just start working in your self love, that’s the only way you’ll stop wanting to loose weight. Of course it won’t be an easy journey but it will be totally worth it. ",False,False

(no shade at all to anyone who weighs less than 100lbs or wants to, it just mentally feels upsetting to me bc it’s associated in my mind w childhood and i’m already somewhat of an infantilized person in the world, same reason i don’t shave my body hair and again no offense to anyone who does)",False,False

Both times I was able to switch to a maintenance diet as long as I developed a crippling lifting/exercise habit (like multiple hours a day every day of the week). I was able to keep the food down as long as I knew if I ate too much it would just go to muscle instead of fat. I didn’t eat for gains, just maintenance. I ended up basically getting super lean muscle everywhere and maintaining my weight fine. Eventually both time this collapsed and I regained weight and had to turn back to the regular ED.  Currently approaching that ultimate goal weight once again and will probably hit it next month. I have no idea how to handle it this time.",False,False

Nothing would improve by me losing more weight from here. But that doesn't stop my ED from making up all kinds of excuses to continue throwing up and starving myself.  Lately I've been feeling like the effort I put into maintaining my current weight is somehow going to waste because some people are naturally this weight. I know it's a weird and toxic way to think, but it feels unfair that some people don't have to even think about what they're eating and just naturally be the weight I am currently.  So if I'm going to have to put effort into making sure I'm not gaining by counting calories, I might as well lose more weight to show for the effort I'm putting in. I guess it's the direct equivalent to a BMI 50 person thinking ""Even if I lose 100 pounds I'll still be obese, might as well make the most of this and just keep eating whatever instead of putting in effort to change"".",False,False
