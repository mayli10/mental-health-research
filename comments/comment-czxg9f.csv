As I lifted up my shirt to put on deodorant, she said ‚ÄúI love that you have a tummy now! It looks so good on you,‚Äù implying that my flat stomach from restricting in high school was GONE and I had become fatter. We both struggled with EDs and I thought she would‚Äôve known better, but people make mistakes. I don‚Äôt blame her, but it‚Äôs been *4 years* and I‚Äôve never forgotten that comment. I obsess over something that happened when I was still very much a teenager. Thanks, lizard brain.",False,False
