On a side note I feel like a lot of people don‚Äôt usually think about actual measurements and go by visuals, like body shape to notice if someone‚Äôs waist is small (like women who are overweight or normal weight but curvy get noticed more often for having small waists even if their actual waist size is measured in the normal-overweight range)  (TW personal measurements) as for me I don‚Äôt really think about other ppl‚Äôs measurements unless I wanna know if I could look the same üëÄ but I have a 24‚Äù waist, getting closer to 23‚Äù, and I would k i l l for a 20‚Äù waist lol",False,False

People *in general* will probably think the small size measurements are small waist sizes. What *we* think is going to be subjective. By clothing sizes I have quite a small waist but I don‚Äôt see it as that small.,False,False
