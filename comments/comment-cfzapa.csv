Over 50kg is considered fat no matter what your height is (there are a lot of people who push back on this as rediculous though) and there is a lot less taboo about discussing weight gain. If you gain weight, your friends, family, c-workers will point it out and tell you to diet. Also clothes for larger people basically don;t exist. If you are big you either have to go to a large clothing store which is like....old lady clothes a lot of the time, or buy online. Also a lot of group activities are really active. Hiking and cycling is really big.  Also the promotion of really wild, restrictive crash diets is rampant. The cup diet (a portion control thing that is so easily abused) was a big one while I was there.  Obesity is on the rise though, mostly due to the introduction of western foods. Korean junk food def exists but usually they are served in really small portions.",False,False

Many parents force their children at an early age to lose weight because being fat is seen as ‚Äúnot taking care of yourself‚Äù and parents feel shameful when people look/think of them like that. Some parents call their kids fat at a young age and prevent them from indulging in snacks kids are supposed to enjoy. Fad diets and diet pills are also in, but I think they were even more prevalent before when I was younger.  Some people I know are just really skinny, despite drinking milk tea (idk if they have it in other countries. It‚Äôs the tea with milk and 384772 g sugar!) everyday and eating junk.  I think it also has to do with portion sizes. I haven‚Äôt been outside of Asia, but I read about people saying portion sizes here are so small.   It varies per person, but my mom is so skinny. She said when she was younger, she had a 23 inch waist, and basically a perfect body. Shes around 5‚Äô2 and 1/2 The most she weighed was around 48. She ate whatever she wanted to, especially beef and pork because those were her favorites. But after giving birth, she said she also dieted and went through fad diets that caused her to go to the hospital due to disordered eating habits. Now she, she‚Äôs like 53 and practices intuitive eating and her weight floats at 50-51kg.   I think the reason why people here are skinny is simply because everyone wants to be like everyone. People want to be as skinny as everyone else. This is just my opinion as an Asian, I‚Äôm not sure about what others think  Have a great day to you!",False,True

I'm Asian myself but when I get told I'm thin I tell myself it's only because they aren't comparing me to anyone.  &amp;#x200B;  Being at the mall is worse because EVERYONE IS SO STICK THIN.
