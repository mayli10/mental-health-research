It fills my stomach up so it‚Äôs harder to throw back drinks, and it allows the drink I just had absorb. It‚Äôs made me realize I only ever want a 3rd or 4th drink because I couldn‚Äôt feel the one I just had yet.   Added bonus: virtually no hangovers ",False,False

I drink every day. Sometimes 1 drink. Sometimes 4 drinks.  I just had to accept that my calories would be a bit higher if I was going to drink.  I try to vary my intake and eat healthy ‚Äúreal‚Äù food. No halo top, no shirataki noodles. Lots of vegetables and lean or plant protein. I cook my own meals, for the most part.  Recovery (drinking or ED wise) is not an option for me right now. So I believe in harm reduction.  However, if you want to quit drinking, AA is free. Most cities every several meetings a day, multiple times a day. Might have to try a few to find the right group.  You don‚Äôt have to share until you want to. If you never want to, that‚Äôs ok too. Sometimes it‚Äôs enough to know you‚Äôre not alone.",False,False
