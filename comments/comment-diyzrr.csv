Sometimes we backslide, fumble, or relapse into the same unhealthy cycles - but what we don't always see is how much progress we've truly made in the interim. You're too close to it.   &amp;#x200B;  Imagine your coping skills, social skills, understanding of healthy behaviors, etc: that's all represented as a painting. You've been working for years on a brilliant picture of your steps to self improvement, but right now you've got your nose to the canvas and can only see the blurry dots of what you've made. It's still there. It's still yours. You can always keep adding to it, improving.   It's a sick irony that the moment you need it most, it's the hardest to see. But I promise, you \*have\* made progress, and you \*will\* continue to make progress. And I'm so proud of you for sharing how you're feeling.",False,False
