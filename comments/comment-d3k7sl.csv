Lost the a bit more than when I did it for 5/6 days, so it wasn't really worth feeling that terrible for. I was also working 16 hours a week in very physical job, and I noticed I got significantly weaker, to the point it took way too much effort just to climb the stairs.  I don't recommend going so long, especially if you start feeling negative effects, which for me were dizziness, fatigue, brain fog and weakness. But I also wasn't replenishing any lost electrolytes, so make sure you do, particularly magnesium and potassium.",False,False
