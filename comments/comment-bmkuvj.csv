If I had her eating patterns I’d roll around within two weeks lol. And guess what, she hates her body cause no curves, she wants a thicc ass and boobs. And here I am staring at her collar bones and skinny legs",False,False

I do consult nutrition labels when I buy things but I don't have a set daily limit and don't juggle numbers or track.   [Tw: numbers] bounce around 103-110 at 5'5   However I do work as a cook so I'm very good at eyeballing portion sizes.   When I try to count I get frustrated with myself because I can't keep up with it and I usually end up in a far worse place then going without.,False,False

I find i eat less generally because i’m in more of a ‘eat as little as possible’ mindset, rather than figuring out the absolute most food i can eat and stay under my calorie allowance. but YMMV, hope that helps!",False,False
