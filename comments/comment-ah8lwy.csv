I didn't even realize this was the case for me at the time. I thought I just wanted to be thin and pretty. but looking back, I can see that puberty TERRIFIED me and the accompanying weight gain was what made me feel unacceptable. it was never about being thin. it was about being small.",False,False

If I am in control of anything it's purely a side effect. I wouldn't call my eating disorder something I control though, because it's a compulsion. I would never intentionally take control of any situation. Social passivity is the only card in my deck.  &gt; It would seem more like you are socially phobic and self destructive to avoid your fears of abandonment   Oh hell yeah, but I've got other ways of avoiding my fear of abandonment and social phobia. Not much healthier than my ED but definitely separate. It really is just that I can't handle myself and I need everyone to know that. People are so much more inclined to be helpful toward you when you look critically ill. Its what I always miss most once I gain weight and why I always lose it again.
