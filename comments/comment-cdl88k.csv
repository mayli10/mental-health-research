You're struggling, so of course it's not great. However, it's really good that you're making an effort still to not succumb to it completely- it's so much harder to control this behaviour than it is to just give in. What I'm saying is- you may be relapsing and you may feel guilt over it, but I still see you being so responsible and caring even in the face of the trouble.   Stay strong. You're amazing. Hugs to you and your little one. ðŸ’—",False,False

I prevented from downright fasting, but have been obsessively weighing again and restricting to under 1000 calories, if not less again. So I know itâ€™s not as bad as it could be, but I know the rabbit hole of ED triggers and habits coming through.",False,True

It must be super hard :( I completely understand that urge to try to control at least *something*, and I can't judge or tell you what to do, but for the sake of you, your child, and at the very end your father too, please take care of yourself. It's gonna be super hard, I know. But please, stay strong. Things won't be bad forever. All we can do is just tough it out until it's easier again.  That said, if there's *anything*- anything at all! we can do to help, please don't hesitate to ask. You're so brave and strong dealing with all that, Im so proud of you. You're amazing. ðŸ’•",False,False
