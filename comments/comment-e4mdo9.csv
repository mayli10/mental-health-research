All the meat alternatives in my house rn are mediocre at best bc if I keep the better ones I will just eat 1500 cals in one sitting * Plant cheeses especially this ONE persian feta knockoff, it's just a fat/salt delivery system into my body and I cannot let myself anywhere NEAR it or I will just eat it one slice at a time * Dark chocolate digestives, BIG time * Pasta. If there is any in the house and I have some then I know I'm gonna go back and make at least another bowlful * Pizza is also a big one for me, if we're ordering pizza then I am eating every single slice I am allocated in one sitting because if I eat less I WILL have an anxiety attack * Garlic bread for the same reason, I keep telling myself I can have just one slice and it's always so painful trying to stop * Chinese sweet red bean or mung bean cakes, idk what they're actually called if they have a specific name, nobody can seem to tell me (other than ""red bean cake"") but it's just a chunk of sweet red bean/mung bean paste wrapped in flaky pastry. I've seen them called moon cakes but they don't look like moon cakes to me; maybe they're a different variety? Anyway. [These things](https://i.ebayimg.com/images/g/AEwAAOSwCypWoQtV/s-l640.jpg). They come in sleeves of 4-5 and I think they're probably like... 400-500 cals EACH and if I have access to one. I will eat them all. In one sitting. They are SO good, the ratio of filling to pastry is straight up Dangerous * Peanut butter :/ * Tbh anything that you put in front of me that isn't already portioned out into a single serving, e.g. chips, ice cream, etc. I will keep picking at it even if I don't want it any more like I don't even realise I'm doing it  Also slightly different but: foods I would only be satisfied eating in binge quantities so even if they wouldn't CAUSE a binge I still can't eat them any more:  * Bread * Cereal * Juice",False,False
