I know he'd hate that thats how I feel about him liking collarbones because he's innocent too. he just likes the look of them. but now I don't feel hot without them showing wah",False,False

My stomach is the focal point of my disordered habits. He's struggling with his own weight at the moment and it felt like he's fetishizing my thinner body. I didn't know what to do in the moment so I didn't say anything and then talked about it in therapy later. I don't want to take any more baths together.,False,False
