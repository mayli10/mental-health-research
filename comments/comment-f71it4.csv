I started letting my husband in on my binge days (like not even calling them cheat days, they are straight up binging and I know it, he knows it, we all know it.) I swear to god having someone there with you somehow just takes the sexiness and of eating until you *have* to purge. Having him there just helps me enjoy the food for what it is, and actually eat it like a normal person? It's so crazy!!!",False,False

It really does help to have someone there with you on your binge/cheat days like you said. For me, I always felt like it helped bring me back down to earth and also, talking about our feelings?
