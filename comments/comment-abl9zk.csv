E you're not fat, you're a good shape,  sexualising compliments typically from males attempting to hook in, it leads me to not be as disciplined and occasionally feel okay about myself and justifies eating?  Then I look in the mirror or feel how jiggly I am and remember that people lie.   I've noticed with the compliments from men in particular these are harmful in the sense they make me feel dirty/ bad about myself. Im not sexy and it feels I get these comments bc they think I'm easy / someone they can realistically get with due to not actually being really in shape / attractive. Girls who are actually really fit and attractive tend to intimidate men thus they tend to not even try.   Last thing is I've had both my long term relationships turn into just fwbs type things. I'm mainly friends with males and both my best friends have had instances where they asked about sex.  It feels really shit because I feel like with my relationships I'm not good enough to properly commit to.  I try to be really loyal and I'm a hopeless romantic but obviously regardless there's more attractive girls out there and so I'm nice for the meanwhile but if anyone better comes along then they want that option.   So yeah. Meanspo goes both ways idk I either give up and binge or fast for a while out of shame. ",False,False

I was friends with a guy for a while (it was just platonic) who was so blunt and truthful all the time, I kinda loved it. I felt like I could actually believe him, because he was so harsh. He'd say stuff like ""if you lost like, 20lbs, stop eating so much ice cream, you'd be a total 9/10"".   Sleezy behavior? Absolutely. His personality was really awful.    But you bet your ass it was amazing to hear from an objectively hot guy that I was only 20lbs away from being a total bombshell. ",False,False

I am very insecure about people lying just to appease me, and insults and criticisms in general... relieve those anxieties  I never understood meanspo until I read this. I absolutely get it now. It's the same relief I feel when someone is horrid to me and makes me feel like shit about myself. Like, finally! Someone is doing me a solid and keeping me in touch with reality! Thank you for not enabling my loser behaviour!",False,False
