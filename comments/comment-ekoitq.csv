You're right I don't want to go back to the point where food and wanting to be skinny is all I think everyday. Thank you so so much again I needed that,False,True

It might be good to set up a sort of support network incase things do start to slip, but that is not saying that they will. Just a sort of safety net to have. Besides that, just remeber how much progress you have made since you were 12-14 and how harsh the lifestyle actually was like back then. It is completely natural to have self doubts or romanticize about the past, but that is just you ED trying to put its foot in the door and let itself back in. I am sorry you are struggling with ED thoughts right now and of you want to talk, I am willing to listen!",False,False
