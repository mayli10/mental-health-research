I was found to have severe osteopenia at age 28, and that was some scary news because I'm already living with pretty bad idiopathic adolescent scoliosis (I'm only 30 now and I really can't afford my spine to get even worse over time). I'm on massive supplements of calcium + vit D, plus trying to keep up with weight-bearing exercise. The amenorrhea's a more recent development, so if my new doctor says I do need further intervention, I will take the pill no questions asked.  Here are some of the studies I found. I do this with any medication I'm prescribed, not to fight with my doctors but to bring up questions and feel like more of an active participant in my own health. It just sounds like there's not an incredibly firm consensus:  [2004](https://academic.oup.com/jcem/article/89/9/4364/2844411): ""OCs in female athletes have primarily beneficial effects on body composition without adverse effects on physical performance. OC treatment significantly increased BMD, particularly in those with low BMD at baseline, and **could therefore be recommended to prevent bone loss in athletes with long-standing amenorrhea and estrogen deficiency**."" ‚Äî This study also found oral contraceptives to produce ""significant increases in weight and fat mass"" in amenorrheic athletes, which is of course the exact reason I have always been wary of birth control in the first place! Note that the authors discuss amenorrhea among athletes as tied to estrogen deficiency.  [2006](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2491937/): ""There is limited \[as opposed to ""good"" or ""fair""\] evidence supporting a positive effect of OCs on BMD in anorexic premenopausal women. \[...\] This evidence may not be helpful in deciding treatment for women with the female athlete triad though, as **anorexics are quite distinct in their hormonal condition** and state of activity. \[...\] Women with clinical eating disorders are more sedentary than women with the female athlete triad syndrome, and **oestrogen deficiency appears to play less of a role, and IGF‚ÄêI deficiency more of a role,** **in decreased BMD in women with clinical eating disorders** than in those with the syndrome."" ‚Äî If IFG-I deficiency plays a larger role than estrogen in anorexic amenorrhea, then does that 2004 study showing positive results in athletes even apply to anorexia?  [2008](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3278909/): ""Many different therapeutic options have been studied for treating bone disease in patients with AN and they have variable results. Estrogen replacement with oral contraceptive pills makes empiric sense in these hypogonadal women; however, there is a lack of evidence that exogenous estrogen is truly beneficial.""  [2012](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3435916/): ""Because of inconclusive data regarding OCPs, research has recently shifted toward finding other ways of delivering estrogen replacement that may be more effective in improving bone density.""  [2012](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5501329/): ""Because of the crucial role of estrogen in bone physiology, several trials have attempted to treat women with AN with estrogen, usually in the form of the combined oral contraceptive pill. Results have been largely unsatisfactory."" ‚Äî This one makes clear that it's really complicated...  [2013](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23682675): ""Women with anorexia nervosa should not be treated with estrogen or birth control pills in a bone-sparing effect."" ‚Äî This is only an abstract. Strong words, though.    ",False,True

I left the appt feeling very confused, but a bit of Google research looking into the actual studies on this topic seem to indicate that exogenous estrogen is not an effective way to protect against bone loss.
