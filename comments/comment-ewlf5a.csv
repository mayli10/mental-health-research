I just think it's important to use proper terminology in situations like these because there's a lot of stigma surrounding polyamory and misattributation of what constitutes polyamory can certainly add to that.,False,False

Still cute-leaning, but unmistakably masculine. Twunks will still have low body fat like twinks and hunks both typically do, but their muscle tone will be somewhere in the middle. They're usually shorter than average, but that's not a hard requirement like it is for twinks. They will usually take really good care of their skin, but they won't have that perfect baby-smooth, pore-free look that twinks have. They're more likely than twinks to be a switch, but still lean bottom. The average power bottom is a twunk.",False,False

Or I met a lot of people misusing the term in my time. Wouldn't surprise me. It has been about 4 years since I got out and away from non-monogamy so I am no longer up on the terminology. Again I didn't mean any offense and I do apologize.,False,False

Polyamory usn't synonymous with non-momogamy. It's a kind of non-monogamy, but not all non-momogamy is polyamory. Like how all thumbs are fingers but not fingers are thumbs. If they were poly they would be looking to actually date you, not just hook up with you.",False,False

Your biology literally works against you there. A proper twink has a slim and feminine frame, perfect skin, and little to no body hair. Testosterone makes all of those nearly unattainable. I'm a trans girl with all of those features, but I stopped growing at 13 and I don't think I could have passed as a twink before estrogen. I really feel like passing as a girl is easier than passing as a twink because you at least get your hormones to support you instead of fighting against you. You can't take hormones and not get all of the other effects a twink wouldn't want though. Maybe that's why twunks are becoming more prominent.",False,False

Whoever has the strength to lift the heavy object should lift it. This is such a bullshit attitude. People can be very stuck in their ways. Masculinity, being a man, that is ALL subjective. Aunt Sheena should fuck off. 2. See the end of number one. This should jump off a cliff along with ""there are starving children"". Unless there are ways to ship them this crust off my hot pocket fuck off it. 3. Just be comfortable. Though it would be so amazing to be able to dictate your own body hair. That would save so much waxing money lol. I watched my Uncle go through so many many ""iterations"" of himself in the gay community before he finally said ""fuck this"" and did what he wanted. Love that man to death. 4. Sure and the sky is purple. Another attitude that is harmful beyond belief.  5. Most of this is empty platitude that people spout to be ""helpful"" but no real thought goes into it. They mean well but its just not very validating. Yeah the poly thing is just so damn creepy sometimes. Yes, you do deserve love and jewelry! But you also gotta be vocal about what you want. Whole ass mood though.",False,False
