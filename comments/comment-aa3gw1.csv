Right now I feel out of control. I feel heavy both literally and metaphorically, even though my weight hasn't changed much. It feels like when I don't restrict I get lost in a hazy fog. I'm not as motivated as I was when this all began, yet I want to be underweight just as much, if not more. When I do restrict, it feels like I'm up at 5am; inhaling the clear, cold air.   I know it will be easier not to eat when I go back to school, and it will be harder to eat as well. You see, my girlfriend knows about my eating disorder but has been off school for a few weeks. When she's not here I have to pretend I'm ok, or else the others will start noticing too. She will be back at school now, and I know that if someone knows about my eating disorder I find it harder to eat in front of them. It's like I don't have to hide that part of me around her because she knows now. There will be panic attacks, there will be tantrums and fights but I am determined not to eat. I can't wait to go back because of this. Despite all the stress facing me at school at least I can have more control again.   Sometimes when I talk about my ED I feel like I'm reading from a textbook, but this sort of stuff is written in textbooks because it's true. Again, sorry for the ramble that turned into.

Yes, moderation in all things, and I empathize with victims of body dysphoria and other potentially lethal complications of EDs. I would wish all those maladies upon nobody.
