That being said I have a family history of high blood pressure so I try to stay away from salt. At first everything will taste flavorless and boring if your palate is used to that flavour, but in a few weeks things will start tasting better. Here is what I've tried: -I cook most of my meals myself so I control how much salt I add to it. Fresh food contains less sodium that pre made meals. -There are light versions of store-bought food reduced in salt, also low sodium table salt.  -Using spices and condiments to add flavour to food instead of just adding salt has been useful to me. For example I add provenzal (garlic and parsley) to my rice now instead. -When condimenting foods with salt, sprinkle a little little bit of coarse salt at the end, instead of using it to cook the food. You will taste it without using as much. Also the little crunch is nice. Try to quit using thin salt.",False,False
