I know it's not very popular but I grew up drinking the regular stuff so I prefer the taste. I've been just taking a lot of Vitamin B complex supplements though, it's cheaper than buying an energy drink all the time.

It's by Coca-Cola, but idk if it's available anywhere else - I can only find mentions of it in the Philippines. It's technically an energy drink bu they call it a ""supersoda"" for legal reasons I think (something to do with Coca Cola owning a stake in Monster so they have a non-competing clause). Gah, but it's zero cal/zero sugar and I love it.",False,False
