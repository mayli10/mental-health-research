I find because thats what I crave so bad, having a chocolate bar satisfies me more that an entire meal. so when I was young (12-13) (was also 5'6 at this age, I think from memory I weighed around 40kg) my day would consist of a bowl of sugary cereal (\~300), a chocolate bar or a cookie from the cafeteria (\~200) for lunch and for dinner id generally have sometimes a small serve of whatever my mum made(\~300-500), but always some more candy(\~200). I was honestly probably averaging 1000 calories max, even when I wasn't trying, as it doesn't take much sugar to satisfy me, and when I would just let myself eat whatever I didn't think about food. I also did a lot of sport in school, so my metabolism was always going, and I don't ever remember feeling unwell or weak or anything.   &amp;#x200B;  Which sucks now as I'm absolutely terrified of sugar from watching too many documentaries about how bad it is for you, so I'm always always craving and I'm never satisfied by vegetables and weird health food. fml",False,False

This is common in my family and they don’t even try to eat healthy food or workout. This was actually me for the first 19 years of my life too but I was more into health. It only stopped when I got on loads of psych meds that made me hungry 24/7 and I gained a bunch and couldn’t trust my body anymore. I’m not even on meds anymore and I can’t mentally trust myself to “just eat” even though I’d probably be a low healthy BMI if I were able to.,False,False

Then, slowly reintroduce food, and try and maintain. I think that's true tbh, right?",False,False

I didnt struggle with disordered eating as a kid but I was #thin and honestly, due to my undiagnosed depression I wouldn't be able to make myself breakfast or lunch before school and would basically only eat after school because of that. I was fucking hungry and would mooch food whenever I could, but basically that limited my calories without me even trying. I would eat junk but I was basically intermittent fasting unintentionally   A lot of people are picky eaters, and even though they might eat junk it's not enough junk to cause them to gain weight. They dont have the urge to binge like other people so they are like finished after their portion and then dont eat more idk this part seems like a mystery",False,False
