I think it affects some and not others. The only bad reactions I’ve had are my boobs got HUGE and very sensitive for a few weeks after starting depoprovera, but that went away. I hate having cycles and the only one that I had cycles with was the copper IUD and the cramps were so bad I had it removed after 9ish months. Also is twisted in my body and almost perforated my uterus, but that’s apparently rare- not sure of exact percentages on it.",False,False
