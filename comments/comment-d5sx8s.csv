Try eating sweet fruit when you want sugary things, and reducing your sugar intake then your palate will adjust to less sweet things. If you arent bothered about sweeteners, try low sugar chocolate etc.",False,False

And I know this sounds like a cliche, or like something only someone *mildly* addicted to sugar would say, but it's true: if you manage to quit for ~2 weeks, your palate WILL begin to change.   For me, the key was the WFPB diet, which has altered my palate in ways I would never have believed. I can't even imagine eating a slice of cake or a whole scoop of ice cream; it would be overwhelming. Apples taste candy-sweet. It's amazing.  However: it did take me 12-14 days to stop craving sugar, and those days were pretty hellish. I cried at one point. I was positive I would go back to sugar, as I always had before. But the WFPB diet was what pushed me over the top. In previous quitting attempts, I was always just displacing my sugar needs onto empty carbs instead. The WFPB diet wouldn't let me do that. It forced me to retrain my appetite in a more complete way.   I can't recommend a plant-based diet highly enough, both for quitting sugar and for overall well-being. I hate sounding like an evangelist, but WFPB really did a lot for me!",False,False
