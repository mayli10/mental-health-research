I don't want her to think that what she's doing is inherently wrong, dangerous or shameful. I'll try to support her the best I can, and hopefully I'm just overreacting. Thank you üòò",False,True

Influence her in some way? I don't know. I really like the idea of telling her that I can help with whatever she needs without getting our parents involved though. Maybe I'll start with that and keep everything vague, without discussing eating habits and shit. Thank you for the advice ‚ù§Ô∏è",False,True

For now, I would stay back until/if you start to notice other subtle signs that go unnoticed by people without EDs. If she doesn't know you have an ED then she wouldn't be so vigilant about hiding it from you if she does develop one, and that's when you can step in. Because before that point, it's possible she will never develop one. In the meantime I'd continue to positively talk to her about it and pepper in information about how apps like that aren't necessarily 100% reliable and are just a guideline, not a bible.",False,False
