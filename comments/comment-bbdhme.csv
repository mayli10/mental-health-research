From what I've heard in therapy, I think ""normal eating"" is not in and of itself this rigid, constant thing. It's flexible, it's social, it can be emotional.

Being someone who never thinks about food or calories, but magically eats exactly enough to maintain their weight without ever stepping on a scale? I know I would love to be that person, but it's not realistic. I will never be able to go back to a version of me who doesn't know about calories. And I think there isn't a person who doesn't experience weight gain, cravings or insecurities about their body. So many people are overweight. They might not have an eating disorder, but they also don't magically eat all the right things.  I will be happy when I can eat in the presence of other without discomfort, when I don't experience guilt over the food I eat and when I won't freak out if I gain one pound. But I don't think I will ever just be able to intuitively eat exactly what I need to maintain. And I think very very few people can.",False,False

Evidently I never truly did, as I‚Äôm back here again almost 25 years after initial diagnosis. Maybe it‚Äôs possible if it‚Äôs done properly early on, but from what I‚Äôve read and from my own observations I think it‚Äôs largely genetic, and if the environmental factors have influenced gene expression and neural networks have strengthened, i don‚Äôt think full normality is possible, especially at 35+ years old when brain plasticity is not what it once was. I‚Äôll aim for it anyway though and hope I land sort of close to it üôÉ",False,False

It might not mean we will get to a place where food is never ever an issue and we magically know the perfect amount of food and eat exactly that, not to much or too little, not too unhealthy or too healthy, every damn day. Especially those of us for whom counting or policing certain nutrients is a habit of many years.  I hesitate to share because I've struggled with wondering whether I'm disordered ""enough"" to share my input here, I was never too severely underweight or treated inpatient. But through outpatient therapy, support from friends, and a lot of trial and error/relapses, I recovered in my late teens. I stayed recovered (as in, I could eat fear foods with little distress, binged occasionally but didn't hate myself for it, and maintained weight) for almost 4 years. Now I'm struggling a bit again, but it's not as bad as before. I don't know what the future holds, and I don't know if I'll ever be ""normal"" around food but I do know that life is NOT the utter hell it was five years ago. And aside from the past month, I'd call that recovery I guess. I believe it's almost always possible to improve, whether or not complete 100% recovery is a realistic goal.",False,False
