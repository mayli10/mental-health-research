I'm gonna assume that means like a cup and a half...  Lentils are 57cals for 1/4 cup Assuming theres a decent amount of potato, figure like 75cals for half a potato in chunks. If its little bits here and there, knock that down to 50.  Depends on the stock mostly. Creamy stuff is high cal, if it's a broth add like 25cal.",False,False
