This then irritates your full oesophagus and it can then feel like chest pains. I have had this exact same issue and panicked it was heart problems. Its scary! If your ECG came back all ok then i would almost guarantee it to be an irritated oesophagus and the pain is then radiating across your chest  If you can do it.. Try not purge for a good few days and let your throat heal and i reckon your chest pains will dissapear  ,False,False

Spreading chest pain is usually not a good sign, but if your tests came back normal I wouldn't worry too much. You might have a pinched nerve or gastro issues due to the purging and it's mimicking angina pain. I'd lay off any stimulants and don't exert yourself for a while. You might wanna try some peppermint tea to relax as well. And of course go back if it gets worse or doesn't go away.",False,False
