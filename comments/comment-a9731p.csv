It’s also why I have trouble not cleaning my plate—e.g. at a restaurant, unless there’s enough left to take home, I need to eat it all or I feel horrible and wasteful. ",False,False

We had to sit at the dinner table til we finished ALL our food, or uh. found a creative way to get rid of it. such as hiding it under the couch. 4 year old me got in a lot of trouble for that one.  It's followed me throughout my life. It's so, so hard for me to throw away food. I've gotten to the point where, if I can, if I don't finish food I bought for binging, I'll try to see if I can find a friend who wants it. Obviously I can't always do that, but it helps a TON with the guilt, because someone is eating it. That may not help all the time, but also if possible you could see if you can save the food and get it to a friend at another time? There's always someone who will want or need it.  I'm sorry you're having to deal with this, it's a wretched feeling.",False,False
