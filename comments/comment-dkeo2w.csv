I'm in the same boat.. I've had to quit every job because the 'faking' being a normal functional person drove me to exhaustion and suicide attempts each time. I don't know what to do either. Can you afford therapy? It might help, might not, but it's something to try at least. It might give you some connection, someone to talk to. Someone constant and unchanging to see regularly while you figure out who you are, and how to stay connected to who you are. It's easy to lose yourself. I didn't know other people felt this exact way.. ive never heard anyone say it like you have, and it feels rough.       Childhood trauma is also a thing that seems to cause a lot of this type of thinking/behaviour, at least for me, as far as I can make out. It struck me how similar this is to me right now. Thank you for posting, I feel kinda less alone, hearing it. Even though it fucking sucks that you're feeling similarly.",False,False
