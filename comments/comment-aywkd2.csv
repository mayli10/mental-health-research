Then post what you've posted here as the caption. Unfortunately people on the internet are always going to be rude and critical of others, especially others like you who are successful through social media. I'm sorry people are being shitheads to you though. I'm sure your body looks great and if you were happy with your body before they started commenting then try to remember that. Random internet strangers don't matter. Also I've clicked on some of the profiles of people who comment rude things and it's usually either a really empty account or verrrryy much a throwing stones in glass houses situation :|",False,False

I‚Äôm a fashion/lifestyle ‚Äúinfluencer‚Äù (I feel weird saying that but I guess that‚Äôs my genre) with about 40k as well.

I'm not an influencer but I once had an Instagram account. Although I wasn't a famous person, it still affected my mental health tremendously and I notice I always feel shitty about how I looked like and kept comparing myself to other people on it.  You deal with that as well as people pointing it out which is so hard. :(  Please keep in mind that those who bring you down like that have issues themselves and NOT you. I had idiots who point my recovery out IRL like it's a bad thing and I distance myself from them.  I have recovered and I gained 10 kilos. It was so hard at first, but keeping myself away from negative BS has gradually made me love myself more even though a year ago, I would have freaked tf out with my current weight and appearance. Now I'm happier even though I am a bit curvy. I exercise and do activities to make myself feel good and to not lose weight or whatever.  It's gonna be so hard but it's so worth it. You don't have to please people who wouldn't give a crap about you if you're gone one day.   Also, recovery has also made me be more open about my struggle with an eating disorder. I feel that being vulnerable and taking about it open up doors to better paths.",False,False
