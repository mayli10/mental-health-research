And I hope the clinic thinks this way too, and that I’ll be working with other disorders instead. To be fear, i don’t really know if i would classify myself as having an ed (according to the dsm/icd). I just know I’ve lost a lot of weight recently, and that my relationship with food has become a bit.. weird, and I got into psychology to help, not to make things worse.",False,True

Knowing that this is how I feel, I wouldn't want to work with ED patients. If I was a patient and saw my Psychologist at the BMI I want to maintain, I would nope the fuck out and ask to be seen by someone else. It can be a huge trigger, or just unsettling/uncomfortable when someone is trying to encourage you to get help for your ED. In the back of their minds, a patient might think ""well, YOU get to look like x,yz, why can't I?"".",False,False

You will make an amazing ED therapist once you beat this because you’ll really understand, but until then it’s not fair to you or the client.",False,False

I mean no offense but I mean no one on here is qualified to help one another because we are in a state of mental illness. that's just a fact.  I'd say you need to avoid helping anyone with an ED. sorry but the risk of influence is not something you wanna fuck with.   the problem isn't that you're underweight its that you're still trapped in the disorder,False,False

Probably preoccupied the whole time and wondering if you have an ED. But I feel like non-ED clients would be ok? I dunno. I’m sorry if that was rude or something.",False,False
