I count every calorie and weigh everything I eat to make sure I won‚Äôt gain weight. Around April when I was at the lowest weight I‚Äôve been since since probably like 4th grade I barely had any energy to do anything.. it was so much effort just to push them in the cart at the store which is why I‚Äôm ok with the 5 lbs weight gain even if I don‚Äôt like it. But I am still exhausted   I think not focusing on weight is the best idea anyway. Weight can fluctuate so much and no one should really be so obsessed about the number on a scale (I am too so I don‚Äôt mean that in a judgemental way.. just that life is so much bigger than that).,False,True

I know personally that it's rare for me to have the energy to do much of anything. I can't imagine how you keep up with two toddlers without eating. But I guess moms have superpowers. You must still be exhausted though.  I might get better again when I finally become healthy again, but I might just focus on nutrition ignoring weight because gaining weight didn't help me feel any better last time. And it seems that as long as I get all of my vitamins that I don't have to worry about the hardest symptoms I experienced last time I lost weight.",False,False

My fianc√© was really pushing for it bc I looked sick and I could barely function. But now with holidays coming up I‚Äôm trippin again bc I feel like I need to lose those lbs so if I gain it during all of the holiday festivities I‚Äôll be back where I am now which I am at least comfortable with   I think if I had more time to work out I‚Äôd be more open to gaining weight bc at least it‚Äôd be muscle but it‚Äôs hard to find time with 2 toddlers.

But itnwasn't as bad as I expected. It just didn't help me the way I expected either. Tue more difference between a healthy weight and your current weight the scarier or harder it can be. Like, if I had to gain 25 lbs I'm not sure if I would have been able to accept that before I tried to recover. That probably would have been too stressful of an idea.",False,False

I always ate whatever and whenever I wanted but now between my fianc√© and toddlers, I have to eat or cook at certain times so I‚Äôm not always eating what and when I want.

I‚Äôve mostly dropped the weighing myself obsessively part but oh boy do I care about the number. I‚Äôve realized the number is going to be the same whether I weigh myself ten times in one morning or once every week or 2 so I‚Äôve stopped doing it.

TW for the part about relapse:  the reason this phase of my life ended was that, after maintaining a healthy weight without ED behaviors for a long time, i started dating my now husband and for the first few months of our relationship we baked a lot of sweets together and i got a little chubby. i don't know exactly how much i weighed but it scared me and i decided to try to lose weight healthily, by counting calories again but eating a healthy intake, not a tiny one. this worked for about a year and i quickly lost the extra weight and maintained again, but unfortunately it triggered me a bit and i had a brief relapse this year. so that's why i'm on this subreddit.   i am now back to eating a healthy amount but i'm still not ready to let go of calorie counting again. it's a difficult balance.

I didn‚Äôt count cals because I genuinely just wanted to enjoy my food and look after my body/mind. I don‚Äôt think the ED thoughts ever really go away but you get much better at dealing with them. For example when I would think something disordered instead of focusing on it I‚Äôd just be like nah fuck off and get on with my day. I also found that I intuitively ate a healthy amount of calories for my body after the initial hunger phase was over so I didn‚Äôt have much weight gain. I miss those days.,False,False
