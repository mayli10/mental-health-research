I once binged while watching two of my favorite movies but given that a theme in both movies is getting revenge on men, it kind of felt right to binge...like, fuck you patriarchy for making me feel bad about eating, Iâ€™m going to enjoy my food and this movie.  I think I only felt that way because those movies were so particular though. I binged last weekend while watching a movie that I didnâ€™t especially like and now Iâ€™m just going to associate that movie with regret lol so I get your perspective too",False,False

Shows, movies, or books that I watch/read while binging. There is one book that I'm currently halfway through (have read before tho) that I probably won't finish anytime soon since I'm trying not to binge atm",False,False
