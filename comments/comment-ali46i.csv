Sometimes in a restriction or fasting mode I can write or play music but eventually I completely convince myself I'm shit at everything and just sit around the house with no motivation for anything. If I don't distract myself with b/p I start thinking of how terrible and awful I am and telling myself this or that person is fed up with me and everyone hates me and b/ping just silences all the thoughts I don't want to sit with. ,False,False

Iâ€™ve tried many times to tell my therapist that I b/p because Iâ€™m bored, and she wonâ€™t have a bar of it lmao. Turns out I canâ€™t stomach sitting with how shit I feel, so b/p to fill time where I otherwise might have to ~~~confront my emotions :o ",False,False

I was working at a job that was just so existentially, deeply, insufferably pointless and soul-sucking, and I think I just wanted to self-destruct. I ended up in these daily cycles of restriction and b/p-ing just to create some meaning in self-afflicted adversity or some shit. Iâ€™m in a different job now that feels more meaningful but is actually legit stressful, so I end up restricting to soothe my anxiety. Itâ€™s a very different form of ED now that I think about it, though ultimately not much better ",False,False

I don't have anything else to fill my time with, because I'm so nervous about starting something new or doing something else and failing.",False,False
