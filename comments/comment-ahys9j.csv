Or he mostly drinks water! If he has juice he thinks it’s too sweet and waters it down. Doesn’t like anything fried. Realllyyy enjoys working out because it puts him in a good mood! He’s also a server so walking all the time. He just has a skinny lifestyle! Haha but naturally and not on purpose.,False,False

I feel pathetic about it but I can't date anyone who doesn't weigh more than me. I was dating a girl who was 8 inches shorter than me and i STILL felt the need to be smaller than her.
