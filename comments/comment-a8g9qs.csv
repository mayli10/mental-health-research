In the bathroom, I noticed there was a little air gap in the behind, between my lower back and my pants.  Such a shame because I bought these on sale earlier this year when I was 110.    I'm 4 ft 9 for reference.  I'm at a 23.2 BMI, still squishy, but I'll get to 86 one day!  Before I graduate high school!",False,True

I had a small win this morning - I was 48.5kg. That's just under 107. I haven't weighed myself in a couple of weeks and thought is would be in the 50s so I am fine with that (I'm 5'7). Tbh my clothes are falling off me. Oh well it's a good excuse to buy new ones! ,False,False
