Then I wanted to lose more. It was scary enough that it motivated me to recover. I get that most people don't have the same experience though. And, really, that didn't last. I almost wish I hadn't because recently I saw a doctor for problems I've been having with abdominal pain and despite being underweight again he used my weight as justification or not treating me. I'm around &gt;!110 lbs!&lt; now and he said that if I were around 100 lbs he would be more concerned. It didn't seem to matter that I was at a healthy weight just a month ago and that his point regarding my weight was about rapid weight loss. I told him that I was losing weight quickly and that it had taken me ages to get back up to a healthy weight and that I lost it because I got really sick very suddenly, but it didn't seem to matter.   So, my point is that I definitely understand how conflicting this can be. Part of me wants to lose another 1-1.5 points of BMI, but my reasoning is that I want to be healthy. Except I know that that's not healthy. Back when I was around that weight I still felt like I wasn't thin enough and it was pretty messed up because I knew objectively speaking that I was very thin. It made no sense to me why I would want to lose even more, but at the time the idea of being &gt;!90 lbs!&lt; was pretty enticing. Feeling that way after reaching my second goal weight was kind of the wakeup call to tell me that this would never stop until I eventually starved to death though. I know that a big part of why my ED started was to take control of something in my life, so in that moment it became clear that I wasn't in control. Idk if hearing that helps in any way. I think losing more weight would be a bad idea though.",False,False
