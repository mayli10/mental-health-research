I have this thing in my head where I think literally anybody else is better than me because they are not me. I suppose growing up with a stepmother who made sure I knew my flaws and shortcoming at every waking opportunity and a mother who would constantly scream at me for my food choices from half way across the world even at a “healthy” weight didn’t help.   I have a friend in my dorm who’s apparently “fat” in the belly but all I can focus on is her beautiful legs that end in these dainty ankles that are just so feminine and tiny. It’s to the point where I can’t get drunk around her without just zooming at her perfect legs and knowing that no matter what weight I am, I will always be this short dumpy fat lump.",False,True
