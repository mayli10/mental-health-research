Getting enough to actually kill you suddenly, like after a single meal, is impossible but what is pretty easy to get are neurological symptoms which will probably shorten lifespan and certainly affect quality of life.  Some types of fish have very high levels of mercury although, say, 1 part per million does not sound like a lot, consider this: someone is a sushi fanatic and eats in a week 1 kilo of fish -- very plausible and they do this for a year. Each kilo has about 1 milligram of mercury (and this is a very toxic form, methyl mercury) so at the end of the year they have ingested about 50 mg or a twentieth of a gram which is a visible amount and there are many drugs where 10 mg is a therapeutic dose and there are many poisons that this much would kill you.   I suspect that if someone ingested 50 mg of methyl mercury \*all at once\* they would develop severe neurological symptoms within days and maybe die although doing it gradually gives the body a chance to excrete some of the mercury.  TL;DR: Yes, high-mercury fish has made some famous people sick.",False,False
