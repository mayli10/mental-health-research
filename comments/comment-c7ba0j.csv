My girlfriend *loves* the sims and it seems like all her male characters are always in great shape and very attractive, then I look at myself and just think ""oh okay"". Once she kinda gave me shit for creating a female Sim with unrealistic body standards and I was so close to calling her out but I didn't. I love her and I know she doesn't mean anything by it but it still hurts.",False,False

I was playing Assassin’s Creed the other day, climbing buildings and sprinting and swimming, and thinking how many calories I could burn if that was me irl  Also games with in-depth character creation trigger me? I always spend hours meticulously sculpting the most beautiful and skinniest character I can and thinking that I wish I could do that with my own body",False,False
