You can pretty much make any sort of soup in it. Broth is also super easy to make with it -- just add veggies and bones and water and cook under pressure for ~30-60 min (depending on how much you're making and how much flavor you want to develop).  It's also great for hot pot. Just plug it in and sit it on the table, fill it with broth, and hit ""saute."" It'll heat it to a rolling boil and then you can dip veggies/thinly sliced meat to cook.  /r/instantpot and the various IP facebook groups have many more recipe ideas.",False,False

You can even use frozen breasts. Just pour in about a cup of broth (or even water), add whatever seasonings you like, and cook on high pressure for 10-12 minutes.
