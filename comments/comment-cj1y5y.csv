I'm not normally a hard ass, but I had to learn to be. Same with him. It's such a tough city to live in but there are no jobs where we came from. We moved here on a prayer that we'd make a life for ourselves, so we've never had it easy and we get the short end of the stick all the time. We are thinking about moving soon and the only reason we haven't yet is because we don't have the means to. We lost our car because we couldn't afford the payments (which were stupid high and, TLDR, was the only choice at the moment) and haven't been able to save enough to move, so we're currently just toughing it out. I could have a gun, but I know I can't afford it. So I have a much more lethal and brutal weapon: a Louisville slugger with nails. It's for emergencies because we had a break in before in our basement. We scared them off by pretending to have a gun, threatening them with death, also calling the police out loud. We've had issues with thieves handful of times now, they always worked in groups of 3+. It all does get exhausting but you can't relax.",False,False

It really fucking sucks when you can't even feel safe in your own home, in your own street. it really wears you down, after a while. Feeling unsafe is incredibly exhausting. I'm glad you're being cautious though, and you and your boyfriend sound like a pair of tough cookies :) Even though antagonising them miiiight not be a good idea, but then I've made the 'asshole convention' comment to dangerous people at inadvisable times too so i get it haha.  I had a similar experience with an abandoned house on my street that was obviously being used as a meth lab and the police did nothing about it either, despite the fact that it routinely caught on fire/explosions/chemical smells and the people who went in and out of there were out of their freaking minds. It might be a good idea to install cameras around your property if you have the means to do so. is it legal for you to have pepper spray on your person where you are?",False,False

He had some people we've never seen before roll up, we asked if they needed help because they looked lost, and this guy straight up freaked out in the middle of the street. He got out of his car and threatened my bf and said, ""you don't know who/what you're messing with! Get back in your house!"" Which my bf then asked is there was an asshole convention in town today. The guy across the way said some very concerning things, along with something like ""I've got him (referred to bf) sorted out"" and was yelling for that car to get out of here. I was watching from the front door. They both looked and acted tweaked out. We called the FBI because there is an abandoned house next door that this guy is at 24/7 even though he lives in the house next door. We hear a lot of construction going on but never see any repairs. This guy is coming and going at weird hours of the night. One night after this incident he packed up some things from that house in a truck and we never saw that truck again. There's now a blue car there that was never there before. Something fucky is going on. We're being cautious with this situation because the authorities obviously aren't doing a thing about it despite having the entire block witness this guy and the stranger flip out in the middle of the street and threaten us.",False,True

I appreciate everyone's well-wishing very much. It's honestly warmed my heart to see the response this got from people who were concerned. ðŸ’• thank you for sticking by to make sure.  As for the messages coming around to me about the numbers and the signs, I don't personally have this happen to me. ðŸ™‚ I have a couple of very close people in my life who just have things come to them. I can't really explain it too well because it doesn't happen to me. Look, I wouldn't take anyone else seriously if I haven't seen these things come to fruition in real life. With my own eyes. They tell me the things they've seen and it *happens*. I've had professional help before and I've been checked out by professionals. I can swear to everyone here I have nothing with psychosis or anything of that sort. I swear to God this happens. I am depressive with an ED, some times I have mood swings, but that's really it. I try not to really talk about this sort of stuff because not everyone is going to believe me, which I can totally understand, but I would find it very cringe-worthy if I were to lie about this. I'm 23 and I would expect from 12/13 year old me to make up a campfire story. I won't go on this for too long I swear. I just wanted to give a bit more details about this and have the post be on record in case something did happen here. Honestly, I'm a bit worried because if nothing happened here then that means some one else close to us is in trouble.. I won't waste anyone else's time with my rambling lol I appreciate anyone who stuck it out until here, though. Thank you everyone again for being here and checking in on me. I am very grateful. ðŸ’• have a wonderful day and please take care.",False,True

Your description is very vague and it's hard to tell what's going on here, but if there's someone unstable threatening your family, that sounds like a matter for the police.   If you're receiving odd messages from number patterns and the like, though, then you may be having a psychotic experience, and I would advise you to seek medical care. (I say this as someone who's experienced psychosis.)  Whatever's going on, I hope you have irl support to help you out and that you're not alone tonight. Please update us when you can!",False,False
