I'm pretty early in my recovery, but doing well overall. I'm still preoccupied with food on occasion and am still horribly afraid of getting fat.  I've been super anxious lately so I've been using this as my main source of coping. I still love to read about weight loss and diets and nutrition.",False,False

I used to be a regular on proed but then somehow I was kinda able to get past it myself.. But it's been at the back of my mind ever since. For some fucked up reason I miss struggling with disordered eating. I posted here recently about how I want to go vegan so I can deliberately trigger a relapse (don't judge me lol I'm kinda messed up) , haven't done that yet but I lurk here in the meantime hahaha",False,False

I like to say I’m either in a half-asses recovery, or the healthiest relapse ever. I enjoy food every day, I’m not afraid of it. I’m living binge free and purge free. I have a significant amount of weight to lose to be in a healthy BMI range so the high restricting that I do isn’t all that troubling in my case. I eat a lot protein, take my vitamins, workout every day, and don’t do shit that’s going to damage my organs.   I’m definitely not living “normally” but I’m not going to try to when I’ve still got a lot weight to lose. I’m just trying to not do anymore damage. Living in a way that’s not actively damaging my body is my definition of recovery I guess, and in terms of that I’m doing pretty well.   I like this sub, because everyone’s honest! I still struggle with the mental side of things even if my behaviors are drastically different than they’ve been in the past. ",False,False
