Those comments are really inappropriate, his concern should be for your health and well-being. It seems like he lacks good judgment and is kinda clueless about things. My point being, please look out for yourself first!  I know it sucks to get your period again - last time I got mine, I just cried and blamed myself. Nowadays I fear that I might get it again, though I know it would be for the better. Anyway, it's not totally predicatable and does not signify a threshold of infinite fatness, it's more like having a break from all the self-harm, which is not that bad right?",False,False
