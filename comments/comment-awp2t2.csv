I lost mine for 6 months. Tests showed I was still ovulating. My progesterone was low. It rises a d then drops. The drop causes the period. Mine didn't get high enough to drop, hence no bleed.   The doctor said it wasn't a problem. There was no health concern. ",False,False

It's also possible that your body just hasn't fully recovered yet form being underweight. Personally I've been trying to gain weight lately and I think I might have had one day of PMS symptoms, but it's hard to know for sure if that's what it was because I'm trans so I only get the hormonal stuff and none of the uterus stuff. My lowest weight was probably a 16 BMI though and it's not like I was underweight for 5 years or something. Maybe 2 years at most.",False,False

I was at BMI 13.5 for roughly six years in total from age 15 to 23, and though I was on BCP i would forget to take it sometimes and as I didn’t get pregnant I kind of assumed I was probably infertile anyway. Then one day, two years into recovery I got those pink lines, I was utterly shocked. I’ve been pregnant six times since then. Perhaps I’m one of the lucky ones, my sister struggled with ED for years and has been unable to get pregnant, she maintained a very low weight for much longer than I did though and she purged (mine has always been pure restrict) I don’t know if that has anything to do with it. Obviously I think we all know that EDs increase the risk of infertility by a lot, and you might want to use it as motivation for recovery but I want to let you know that there is hope after ED.
