It didnâ€™t affect her grades, she didnâ€™t have to take extra time to graduate. Youâ€™re gonna be okay and you need help now",False,False

In high school I would have been abjectly horrified if anyone had suggested pushing back my college graduation or delaying aspects of my career by a year. Iâ€™m not sure I would have listened, but I truly should have tried to listen and reflect. Instead I just kept pushing myself at breakneck speed, trying to hold it together and telling myself the next thing would finally make things ok within myself. The next job, degree, award, domicile, wardrobe, relationship...it never worked. I imploded in spectacular fashion and my life of achievement became a life of hospitals and psych wards. My career that I worked so hard for, the career that I couldnâ€™t push back even 6 months, has been on hiatus for four years now.   Itâ€™s so hard to have perspective when society is pushing things on us - telling us we need to do this or be that in order to have a worthwhile life, selling the idea that if we arrange our outside life a certain way weâ€™ll finally feel the way we want inside when thatâ€™s actually totally bas-akward. OP, I hope youâ€™ll take whatever time you need to heal what is going on on the inside. To reach a place where you feel at peace in your body and safe in your mind. If you can do that while still working toward HS graduation, cool beans. But if you need more time or a period of more intensive support, that is absolutely ok. Weâ€™re all running our own race in our own time and this is your one wild and precious life &lt;3",False,False

I know itâ€™s not what you want to hear, but I promise you that going to college while actively using behaviors and already not being in a good spot is not the move. Iâ€™m speaking from experience when I say this, prioritize your physical and mental wellbeing over college, if not for your sake, then for the sake of your gpa. I tried to avoid getting help and just carried on with my ed for a while at the beginning of my time in college, and Iâ€™m *still* trying to fix what I did to my gpa and transcripts.  I know going to college straight out of high school is something thatâ€™s pushed on us as students from a pretty early age, but I promise you that itâ€™s not the end of the world if you have to take a second to get yourself in a place where youâ€™re stable and able to be fully present. college with an ed is the most miserable, stressful thing. personally, I wasnâ€™t able to function as a student like,, at all and my grades definitely showed it. now that Iâ€™m more removed from my ed I can actually like,, function in class and itâ€™s a whole different experience. I wish I would have taken some time off when I needed to get myself together because my ed college for me in the beginning, and now itâ€™s taken way longer for me to get my degree than it should have.   take what I say as you will, but thatâ€™s just what I wish somebody would have told me at the beginning of my time in college. please just take care of yourself my dude.",False,False
