I think that is exactly what he meant, youâ€™re right. He said both of our weights are below normal. I donâ€™t weigh myself so I can still disagree in my head, but he definitely is pretty underweight (which looks really good on him, I hate to say).   He talks about me regaining health.   It makes me want to want to recover.   Maybe we can both take the little good voices of theirs to substitute for our own bad ones in our heads.",False,True

Thank you.  For me and him, I think he is stunning, gorgeous. And he thinks he is not at all - I know he doesnâ€™t like the way he looks. This makes my heart literally ache, I get butterflies when I see him and I cannot fathom his perspective.   So perhaps.... perhaps we are not good judges of ourselves. ðŸ’•",False,True

He weighs what I wish I weigh, he is thin but not unhealthy thin. And he can eat and eat like a mad man. It drives me nuts, if we go out to eat, I purge. Or I restrict all day long to make sure thatâ€™s all I eat. He has spent time and time again reassuring me he doesnâ€™t want me to be rail thin, that he likes my curves and belly. As much as I hate them I just want to be thinner all around and keep those things(besides the belly lol) I guess. Itâ€™s hard since itâ€™s almost like their weight was gifted to them! But you got this. Iâ€™m sure you look perfect and if anything, he mightâ€™ve just meant to say he wants you healthier even if he worded it wrong!",False,False

Me being just a bit shorter than him but almost 10 kg heavier, when I first pursued him I felt that there was this rule that he wouldn't see me standing and see me as a potential girlfriend unless i'd weigh less than him.   When we got together at some point and I eventually expressed my issues with my body compared to his weight, he frantically told me that he finds himself much too underweight and that he is the problem to this weight gap, not me. That i'm perfect, and he himself is far from it, and that he really wouldn't want me to be thin. That he's not attracted to low-end-bmi or underweight  girls because he finds they're too fragile.   Part of this triggers the fuck out of me because clearly that means i'm a big ol' hefty sturdy treetrunk woman, and not elegant and delicate like i'd wish to be, but...  He really loves me, he's extremely attracted to me the way I am, and I love him just the way he is and wouldn't want him to change. To be able to catch a glimpse of myself through his eyes helps me to love myself as well. If he's happy, so am I.  ... But then I see emma stone in lalaland and I remember I'm disgusting. (o:   Anyway, if anything some advice from me would be to try and step into your SO's shoes and empathize with his feelings towards you. It helps me feel better about myself through his feelings. It helps me to relax and not worry, because he doesn't worry. I actively try not to reject or resist his positive feelings about me. It's not easy, but fighting to allow the love in works. (it's really hard.)",False,False
