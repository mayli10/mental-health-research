It’s not pleasant to go through that and I have no idea why my dumb ass thought it would be worth it for the appetite suppression. ,False,False

But yeah same, I can totally stop this whenever I like! Go us.",False,False

At first it was only after a binge as a way to force myself to stop, but now I even find myself using them after a ""normal"" day of eating. Any total over 1000 cals runs the risk of me caving; especially if I have eaten something ""bad"" like cake or chocolate. It's not a good place to be and I'm sorry that you are struggling with it too. ",False,False

I promised myself I'd never ever make myself throw up, but I did. Luckily I ruined my gag reflex by scratching the back of my throat with a fingernail so I guess it worked out anyway. But I also said I'd never c/s and I start this week!!!! Ugh.",False,False

It just helps me forget about the binge sooner but I know it doesn't actually help me reach my goal.  I'm sorry you're dealing with this side of EDs too ",False,True

EC stacks and lax after a binge all the way. The weird part is that i never use lax on a daily basis but only after a binge so in a weird twisted way I use that as a motivation not to binge cause ik how bad laxatives are ,False,False
