My therapist and I generally communicate via text for scheduling but I haven‚Äôt texted her yet because I don‚Äôt want to come off all What About Bob so early in the morning. But I appreciate you checking in about that because I 100% woke up like ‚Äúnever mind I‚Äôll just *not* get better or deal with my feelings‚Äù even though I was all motivated last night. Ugh. I‚Äôm waiting until 9am because that‚Äôs normal business hours.   &gt;	It‚Äòs so impressive that you‚Äôre so in touch with your feelings and triggers  I come from an abusive home. My dad would gaslight and invalidate me just to pretend I was perfect because my younger sibling is his autistic disappointment. I wasn‚Äôt allowed to not be perfect because Dad needed at least ONE good kid I guess. So I had to find validation within myself. I‚Äôm pretty good at knowing my mind, I‚Äôd say, although that doesn‚Äôt stop me from being just as self-destructive. I just don‚Äôt bullshit myself about it. ",False,True

You are so strong, you absolutely deserve recovery and you do need it. Your health is so important and you are so valuable. It‚Äòs so impressive that you‚Äôre so in touch with your feelings and triggers and it is so normal to want to run the fuck away from digging through it all. You‚Äôre being so brave, honestly.

She suggested I try overeater‚Äôs anonymous (I guess they also accept restrictive eaters too) but I looked it up and people showing off their ‚Äú3 years sober‚Äù chips freaked me right out. I don‚Äôt want to have to go to a meeting where my participation is predicated upon stopping my disordered behavior. I don‚Äôt feel ready for ‚Äúsobriety‚Äù in the OA context.   I don‚Äôt feel ready to recover. I‚Äôm not even underweight, even though I know if I don‚Äôt change my behavior that will eventually happen. How can I need recovery when I‚Äôm Not Sick Enough^TM ,you know? The whole Eugenia Cooney saga has actually been kind of bad for me because I look at her and conclude that I‚Äôm not that skinny yet so I must not be skinny at all. I‚Äôm not emaciated like she is so I‚Äôm not actually sick enough to recover.   My ED is totally an addiction though, because I 100% rationalize that I‚Äôll recover once I‚Äôm stick skinny and beautiful and won‚Äôt have to gain any weight back but somehow my brain will be fixed. I‚Äôm going to reschedule tomorrow because clearly I‚Äôm not okay. I don‚Äôt even know how to want to be okay.   Thank you for responding. ",False,True

I became terrified and cancelled my next appointment and never went back. I would say reschedule your appointment with your therapist because I regret doing what I did, and if you do I would tell your therapist where you stand and that miniscule tiny little puny baby steps would have to be the way to go if you want to continue. The counselor I talked to tried to emphasize that it doesn't all have to go away immediately, but I still panicked thinking I'm not ready but now I don't think anyone can be truly ""ready"" to recover when it actually comes down to changing your behavior. Sorry this is just what I think but whatever you do I hope everything works out for you.",False,False
