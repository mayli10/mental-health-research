Stir in 1 egg white, 1/3 of a mashed banana, 2 tbs quick oats, 1.5 tbs flour, .5 tsp baking soda, and a bit of almond milk to get a good consistency. Cook slowly on low/medium with a lid on.   Topping: mix together 2 tbs plain yogurt with 3/4 tsp maple syrup and a handful of crushed blueberries. Spread on top of pancakes.   Comes out to 215 cal.

It looks like throw up and as a bulimic, it used to ‘trigger’ me, I guess. Then my friend made me one with brown sugar and a little bit of butter, And it tasted so goooooddd. It’s like I’m eating baby food which I associated as safe food yet it’s tasty and filling.  Now I eat it every morning (recovery stage of ED) but I eat it plain with a pinch of sugar free sweetener because of the calories. I just eat half of what I make and it 80 calories lasts me til lunch or even dinner.  Fucking love oatmeal",False,False

I use almost the same recipe to make hot oatmeal that I do to make “pancakes” (as in the low cal ED monster food kind). My oatmeal recipe journey has been so complicated tho cause oats are high key becoming a fear food cause they’re not that low cal. So like a few years ago it would just be 1/3 cup oats and water, then add milk and sugar at the end. Now it’s only 2 tablespoons oats and the rest is chia, flax, hemp, egg white, almond milk, and mashed banana and then for the pancakes I just also add 2 tbs of flour and some baking soda.   The hack here is that there’s so many ingredients that my parents think I’m whipping up some fancy high cal gourmet breakfast when it’s literally the same calories as an apple and a banana....",False,False
