It's so easy to vent to someone and then all they respond with is something along the lines of oh its fine, nothing will happen to you or everyone eats snacks! It feels nice to be congratulated on something on which I thought was a failure. I'm trying hard to allow snacks without the feelings of immense guilt but I know I'll get there eventually.",False,True

I absolutely understand how you feel and everything, however. It is not easy to drop the black-and-white mentality.  By the sound of it, your week sounds like it has been quite good, so congratulations and keep up the EXCELLENT work! Treating yourself to a snack at the end of a week like this is completely fine, so don't be upset.  Be well and enjoy the rest of your weekend!",False,False
