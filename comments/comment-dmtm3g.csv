I’m currently someone who drinks, get this, like a normal human. But I didn’t get there overnight and honestly it was seeing my drinking buddies either growing up OR failing hardcore to realise where I personally was at. It sucked arse to ‘drop’ some of my ‘best friends’, but when you realise what you have in common is alcohol you start to realise how shallow the friendship is. My past drinking buddies I’m still close with are my netball friends, my dnd friends, my hiking or birdwatching friends.... the people who have stuck around are people who had more in common than alcohol.",False,False

I have faced this exact thing with my own friends except I quit smoking. Honestly? They were fucking arseholes bout it. They basically wanted to trick me into being a smoker again. The reality is you getting your shit together forces them to confront the worst parts of themselves and admit that it isn’t okay. People aren’t ready for that. Keep being you. God damn message ME if you need. Your true friends will come around and look after you- the others have their own issues and WHO DOESN’T.  In my limited experience it gets better and you can find out who supports you in the long run. Being a better you shouldn’t negate your friendships but for most of us, it totally does short term. My best advice is; be you, be proud, work through your own shit. The weeds will get there in time and the flowers? They are there forever man.",False,False

They need to be supportive and understand that alcohol leads to addiction and it's a POSITIVE choice to not drink it.   If you speak to any of them one on one do you think they'll be more understanding? Maybe reach out to one of them that you can trust and have a proper heart-to-heart and then see if that can lead to more understanding from them all.   I don't drink anymore (except in mental health crisis which is just destructive behaviour that I always regret). It's tough because it stops me wanting to go to things but I have actually started focusing on different priorities now. I have fewer friends but the ones I do have are great.   I hope it works out for you. You are worth listening to and totally right, strong and deserving of not being poisoned by alcohol",False,False

By you not drinking can make them feel bad about their own choices.  I'm in my 30s and _still_ have friends who act like this. The best way to deal with it? Don't hang out with them. Going to a bar crawl is not that fun if you're not drinking, especially if people are going to really point it out.",False,False
