First it's very important to drink while you eat, especially if you eat food with a high sodium level. Otherwise you might fuck your kidneys.   Second, for your question, it depends. Items staying longer in the stomach can be either good or bad. When items stay longer in the stomach, that usually means the digestion takes longer. That means you won't feel hungry for a very long time. Items that stay for a shorter time in the stomach will just trigger hunger cues a bit earlier than others. I won't mention that digestion also uses calories as your body is heating up, as it's very very low.   Items that stay for a shorter time in the stomach are sometimes triggering a longer intestine digestion if they have high fiber. Like fruits in general. They will stay a longer time in your intestines. Fibre are important for your body as well. So digestion should be quite long in fact, but depending on the items, they won't all stay for long in the same place. On average, your digestion takes something like 6h and then food stays for a while in your large intestine.   Quicker processing is usually for fast food and sugar-rich items. So longer digestion is usually triggered by better food intakes.
