I went out to a work lunch yesterday.  We're a small team, we all work from home, and we meet up every couple of months for lunch, so there were 5 of us at the table.  I inhaled my entire plate except for the gross kale salad before anyone else was even half done, then sat there self-consciously while everyone else continued eating.",False,False

But remember that you are not them, and they are not you. Everyone has different needs and it is totally okay to respond to them. If you're still hungry and will finish your plate, then do it ! It's fine.  I can assure you that they are not paying attention to it and they certainly do not think that it's weird or whatever. I know how hard it can be, though. I feel the same when I get a second serving of something, or when I'm hungry when others aren't. Try to enjoy your meal, after all, you're eating out, you're with people....everything is alright :)",False,False
