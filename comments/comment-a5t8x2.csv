People think a 5'10"" person like myself needs 3000-4000 calories a day. I never see it the other way around... except in ED communities. People can be ignorant though.  &gt; 2) just wants to be supportive but said the wrong thing  This seems likely. OP mentioned frequently ""whining"" (in quotes because OPs words, not mine). The husband knows you're struggling with weight loss and is trying to give you the courage to continue,  3) also has some degree of disordered thinking  Maybe? If so, match made.",False,False
