It also helped me get over lots of fear foods :) I still kinda use it as an excuse, but i'm in it for the ethics and the environmental reasons as much as the health ones",False,False

I‚Äôm always worried about protein and those are my go-to‚Äôs.  Asian grocery stores has a lot of vegan options for cheap. I get all my tofu and seitan ‚Äúfake meat‚Äù from there and add it to instant ramen cups with some extra miso broth or mushroom broth, and like a cup of frozen veg mix. Giant meal with protein, veggies, and some noodles. They even have healthier air fried ramen packets.  When I go all out and make a bowl of ramen like this it‚Äôs usually ~500 cals but I do OMAD plus maybe some fruit for snacks.  If I have the money I get tofurkey deli slices, vegan cheese, carb smart 647 bread, mustard, lettuce, Tom, and it‚Äôs a fucking bomb ass sandwich.",False,False
