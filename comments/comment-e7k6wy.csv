I had showered, done my makeup, and dried/styled my hair and my weight was actually the exact same. Which makes me feel better, I always wanna weigh myself first thing before anything else so if I ever somehow forget at least I know now it really doesnt make a difference if I get ready first",False,True

I was more thinking if it took say 10 to 20 mins and doing my little experiment,False,False

(it takes me 1.5 hours to put on my clown makeup)  EDIT: typo,False,False

While it may seem scary, you can have the comfort of knowing that you have ED ""in your back pocket"" to mitigate the effects of putting on the makeup (or eating food X, etc) if you feel like the results from putting in the makeup (or eating food X, etc) made you heavier, etc.  Hope that makes sense and helps!",False,False
