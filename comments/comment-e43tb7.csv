They were able to cater for this, it was just problems with the kitchen that caused me the most grief (e.g., giving me normal pasta, a meal that was like 90% onion). They also worked with me in terms of wanting to stay vegan- I wasn't allowed, but they compromised and I only had egg and yoghurt on my meal plan.",False,False

It’s about finding a good quality inpatient,False,False

When I discussed this with my therapist -- in a context of ""so, what would happen"" sort of deal -- she told me that since it was document in my medical records, whatever treatment team I saw would honor it.   So if you skip it for legit medical reasons, and not just ""gluten is bad you can't make me eat it"", they're a lot more understanding.",False,False
