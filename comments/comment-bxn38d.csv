So we went to Clean Juice and got a spinach + kale + apple + cucumber juice + activated charcoal. So that’s my breakfast along with a ton of water. Hope that’s safer.,False,True

I felt hesitant about recommending this originally, and **this is not medical advice**, but there are pills for water retention like Diurex.
