I am aware of how she views her body &amp; I'm up to date with her life situation (at least as much as she's willing to share). Oh, and she's already been seeing a therapist for the past few months. But the thing is, I feel like there's more that I should do, there's more I should be able to do to help her. There probably isn't, and I'm probably really helpless to do beyond what we've mentioned, but I just can't seem to accept it... :(",False,True

Inform her of the health consequences of that activity. Find out how she views her body. Find out what's going on in her personal life. If she seems like she is approaching ED territory, reccomend that she go to a counselor.",False,False
