That doesn’t sound right... like obviously yeah I bruise very easily, I have pressure sores on my arse, my hair falls out and I definitely feel unwell after I purge like I’m about to faint and racing pulse, cold and tired all the time etc.   Actually that’s quite a lot of things... I supposed I’m just used to it? I guess I probably just don’t notice it all so much any more, I think I’ve just forgotten what healthy feels like because it’s been such a while",False,False

But my “normal” weight from before I was restricting was already low (BMI 18.5-19).  I think maybe it has to do more with extreme loss plus undereating versus the actual scale weight itself?,False,False

No, not necessarily. I do think it is how most people who are trying to starve off weight feel, though.   Like I said above, I hate to say this for fear that someone will take it as encouragement, but if I'm eating at maintenance I feel basically normal. I know I'm lucky this way. I do attribute it partly to eating a nutritionally balanced diet even though I'm not eating much.   However, my comfort is maybe a bit of a curse, in terms of mental health. If I felt constantly awful it'd be much harder to live with this disorder, and much easier to tell myself that it's unhealthy to be underweight. (Which I know. I just don't care, bc I'm dumb.)",False,False

I hate to say that, because I don't want to encourage people to assume they'll be fine, too. But if I'm eating at maintenance, I feel normal. I do have orthostatic hypotension, and my temperature regulation isn't good - it's hard to get warm once I've been chilled. Sitting for long periods of time is unpleasant, and sleeping on my side is uncomfortable when my knees touch. But that's about it.  But even if I'm low restricting, I wouldn't say I feel like death. I do have to be really careful about standing up, and definitely feel weak and kinda shaky. I cannot exercise unless I eat right before I do. My reaction time is also slowed to the point where I don't feel safe driving. But all told it's not that terrible, and mentally, I'm clear headed.   At some lower weights, though, there's a point where even my body can't handle my idiocy, and if I restrict I start actually collapsing and having disrupted vision and shit.",False,False

I’ve spent over a year maintaining there and doing really well in my classes. I think it’s not so much about your BMI but the rate at which it’s changing (if that makes any sense).

It was horrible. Just like you said, aches, constantly cold, almost fainting every time I stood up. I managed to stay just under the overweight line on coffee and Ritalin, stuck in an endless binge/starve cycle. The weight that comes with recovery absolutely sucks, I know. But it’s so worth it. I can stand at work all day without extreme fatigue. I’m not nauseous all the time. I don’t shake as bad. My meds actually work. I understand if you’re not ready yet but making the effort to recover makes a huge difference. Itll get better, you’re not going to feel like this forever",False,False

BMI 16) weight as opposed to getting a lower weight, meaning that you've had to have a calorie deficit to get there. Like if someone has been BMI 18.5 pretty much always, if they are normal height or on the taller side and exercise, they could get away with eating 2000+ calories a day, which (assuming a healthy diet) contains a whole lot more micro- and macronutrients than the diet of someone who eats 800 calories a day to get to a low weight.    Of course people are different, but looking at my 60- and 70-year old skinny af relatives still running and skiing around and they don't seem to suffer from their weights.

I mean, I think part of it is definitely your intake. Heavy restriction for a long time isn't good for you. So it's possible that you may feel better if you were to eat more. However I think weight sort of has to do with it either; like if you were maintaining a weight too low for your body it wouldn't be healthy no matter what you ate.  In my experience I have been underweight for a long time &gt;!5 feet, 72-73 lbs!&lt; currently and I'm planning on gaining a bit for health. I feel better than I did when I was restricting but I still feel more tired than I did before my eating disorder. Even at a maintenance or gaining intake. I don't think my body is constantly achy, but I'm not as able to physically exert myself as much as before. I do a video workout every day but that's it. However I do feel colder more easily. I don't fast but I probably couldn't do one right now. I don't think I mentally feel insane.  I guess different people will exhibit different symptoms. I think I am functional but not as functional as I was before.",False,False

It's not uncommon among models. I really get how a lot of people can think that models really can't be healthy with how thin they are, but some websites have stats for them and they're usually not so far below average and typically they have a body shape that helps them look thinner at a normal weight. I'm not a model personally, but I'm at a healthy weight now and have a 23"" waist despite having small breasts, so when I see models who are really thin it kinda puts it into perspective. When I was underweight I didn't think it would be possible, but I weigh more now and basically look the same as I did before, so I guess other people could be the same.",False,False

I mean maybe because they're so tall they are at a higher weight even when underweight that it makes it easier? And their limbs are so long it probably makes them look skinnier than they are.  Having food-related health issues must make recovery so much harder! Im glad you've found a weight you can feel comfortable at and I hope you can find some balance.,False,True

Not only that, but a lot of models have large breasts which helps them look thinner at a healthy weight. It is possible to have a ""model's body"" at a healthy weight with small boobs though. But the way models maintain a flat stomach or whatever literally involves dehydrating themselves and undereating before shoots. Then they get photoshopped anyway.  But yeah being underweight is exhausting and unhealthy. Even when I first became underweight and was managing okay it was tough. Over time it just got worse and worse. I feel much better now that I'm at a healthy weight again. I think I'm around the same BMI as you though. I just barely managed to get back to a healthy weight and I struggle a lot with eating for physical health reasons. Even when I do eat my body doesn't always process the food right, so I could still lose weight if I'm not careful. It's a lot of work to balance not overeating and not undereating to avoid being sick, so I'll probably stay at this weight. This weight is fine for me though.",False,False
