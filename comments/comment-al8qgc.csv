I love drinking and partying with friends. What has been working for me is to plan for being drunk and hungry. There are a few things I know I can have a couple of from the local fast food places and I try to budget accordingly. Doritos locos tacos are like 180 cal from taco bell, also any taco ""fresco"" style is under 200 cal. There are a ton of ""flavored fruit water"" alcoholic bevs in cans, too- truly or white claws are 100 cal and low carb. There are ways to drink AND eat and not go overboard I swear! This biggest hurdle for me is not giving in to the ""fuck it"" mindset while drunk, where all your planning and good  go out the window. ",False,False
