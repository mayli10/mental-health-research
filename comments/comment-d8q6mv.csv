I don't want to gain weight anyway, but if they suggest that I'm going to feel really insulted. I hate when people treat me differently or less than just because I'm autistic. I want a diagnosis because it'd be validating to see whether they actually think I have an ED after years of disordered eating, and because it'd help my not fit for work claim (though being an autistic person who barely showers and never leaves the house bc of depression and anxiety should be enough on it's own, really). I guess I wouldn't mind yearly monitoring, and it'd be interesting to see how my bones, heart etc. are doing because I'm curious and worry sometimes. I just hope they respect that because I'm an adult and I'm not life-threatening thin they have no right to force things on me, especially just because I'm autistic.",False,True

My blood work was surprisingly ok, I had an iron deficiency and some other slightly abnormal levels, but nothing that was super worrying.    The plain truth is just that some doctors *are* arrogant and dismissive.  I'm sorry you had a crappy one.  I've had a couple of dismissive doctors in the past as well and it's demoralizing.  My current GP is wonderful, though, a young guy with a lot of compassion who makes me feel very comfortable (as much as possible anyway)",False,False

Is that why they delayed diagnosing you? I suspect my bloods would be fine, since I don't restrict too low (or even restrict at all at the moment), and I get a lot of vitamin mineral supplementation. I'd need an official diagnosis. If they refuse to diagnose me with anything, anorexia, depression or anxiety, I'll just tell them I'm never going back, lmao. The only reason I've been avoiding them for years is because last time I saw a GP they were dismissive af about my depression and anxiety.",False,True

Mine did, unofficially after one visit, and officially once my blood panels came back.  It would be pretty unusual for them to refuse to diagnose you and insist that you see a specialist.",False,False

I mean I don't see why me describing my relationship with food and considering my BMI they wouldn't just diagnose me there and then. I don't know who 'my' GP is. I haven't been to any doctor in years. I avoid them like the plague.",False,True

They'll talk to you a bit about your thoughts and behaviours and you'll get a requisition for some blood and urine tests, and they'll discuss a treatment plan or options that you have going forward.  You can't be forced into treatment unless the doctor has reason to believe that you are an *imminent* threat to yourself or another person.",False,False
