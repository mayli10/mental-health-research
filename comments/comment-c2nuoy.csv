And I WANTED to lose it (due to gender dysphoria). In the end I went on continuous birth control.  In light of this, I'm convinced amenorrhea is more to do with nutrition than BMI. Even at my lowest weight, I displayed few tell-tale signs other than subtle Beau's ridges, and a touch of lanugo - and I think that's bc I've usually eaten a balanced diet even if I'm eating very little of it.",False,False
