She'd openly criticize anyone in sight for any little thing, meanwhile she was a mess. I was that exact same way for a long time and it ruined my life, same reason I had an ED to begin with. It started by making a conscious effort to use empathy, and eventually after how many years it became permanent. I'm not perfect but I think I'm a more pleasant person than I was before. It def starts with effort and obviously, being able to see that behaviour and own up to it is the first and most important step. I love this post",False,False

Sometimes I'll see a girl in a crop top and all I can think about is how they're *almost perfect* if only that had a little less belly fat. It makes me feel so disgusted with myself. In truth I wish I had the kind of confidence that they have. Projecting my insecurities is definitely something I need to work on. Not that I would ever say something so cruel out loud, I just need to stop thinking like that.",False,False
