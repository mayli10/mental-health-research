For me, I see the fat kid that desperately wanted to please her parents and kids around her, while being called a “ham sandwich” (lmao I did look like one though)  A decade later and so many lost pounds, I still see a ghost of that kid in the mirror. It’s telling me to lose more just to not crawl back into this people-pleasing behavior. And oh boy am I disappointing her every day.",False,False

I don't see myself as 'fat' per se but I see extra meat on my bones that I can work at removing (and likely will). I know I'm at the lowest I've been in a long time but I can't actually take the changes I see in my body seriously. I've been referred to as thin three times this past week and I just can't seem to see it.",False,False

Even the same mirror, 5 minutes apart.  There are days when I think “hey I look good!” and there are days where I’m actually nauseated by how horrifyingly ugly I am, days where I literally don’t even look like a human and more like a disfigured clay sculpture. Most days are somewhere in between- something or other is ugly and distorted, and I hate it, but it’s not going to ruin my day.  I kind of feel like I have face blindness, but only towards myself and for my entire body. I have not a fucking clue what I really look like because it’s seemingly always changing.",False,False

A great way to describe it.   I recently watched a documentary on body dysmorphia. A psychiatrist had his patience draw a self-portrait to show the difference in how she perceived herself vs. reality. I did the same and showed it to my SO who assured me I look absolutely nothing like my drawing. It was super eye-opening and crazy how differently we really see ourselves.",False,False
