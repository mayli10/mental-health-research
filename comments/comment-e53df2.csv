I'm not sure how much I'd want to share about my personal expreinence though, I thought this would be more along the lines of trying answer peoples questions/concerns in large posts that would be answered based mostly on my expreiences and learning a fair bit about the experiences of others. I know it can be helpful to share personal experience, but I'm not the most open person and don't want to be triggering. Altough when talking about EDs it's hard to avoid triggering someone.",False,True

Your experience sounds very familiar to my first go-round with my ED when it initially developed... basically ate very little and occasionally would eat like 3 milk-and-cereal bars, which felt like bingeing (I didn't have a word for it then). I didn't purge after that at all. I guess I'm just interested in more of your story.",False,False
