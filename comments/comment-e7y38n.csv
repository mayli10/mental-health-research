And truth is I don’t think there is a healthy thing to say about my eating habits. It’s so touchy and In my opinion a personal relationship. I believe any comments on eating habits will trigger something in my head about it. I’ve told him that too. But he’s not gonna just not say anything and I don’t blame him. I guess neither of us know how to deal with it.,False,True

He seems like he’d be open to learning",False,False
