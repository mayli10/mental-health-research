I looked around and it seemed like MPA but just talking about models at first. Then I looked up one of my favorite models... They said she “got fat” after she gained MAYBE 5 lb (she still looks beautiful and really thin???). Also, you have to submit pictures to become a member? What???",False,False

Basically there are people on there who have VIP status and they can say anything they want and everyone who ""picks a fight"" with them gets either ganged-up on or even straight out banned. Also, most of the forums were dead most of the time, which was partly due to the fact that 80 percent of the time someone (who wasn't a VIP) opened a thread, there would be someone jumping down their throat about how there was ""already a thread about [slightly related thing]"" or how the thread was generally unnecessary.  I think the person running the site is someone else now though, so there is a possibility that it'll get better? I was thinking about reapplying but given how tedious the process seems to be now, I think I probably won't after all.",False,False
