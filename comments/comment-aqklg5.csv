I struggle so much to compete but I end up eating more.   Recently I've been able to eat less without skipping meals and I'm not counting. I think I'm eating less then my brain thinks I'm eating. I always feel guilty when I'm trying to lose and go much over 1000 cals. Then I binge. Normally I'd just purge and continue to lose but since fall I've cut way down on purging. Previously I was counting my days purge free but that made me obsessive and put so much pressure on me that I'd end up relapsing. My original disorder was BED at 11 and I'm 31 now (then switched to atypical anorexia at 14, binging and restricting and occasional over exercising for years, then full blown purging bulimia about 2 years ago).   I dont have any experience in having a partner but I always struggled when my mom was on a diet (and she always wanted me to join her). I would eat out of spite. Does your partner know about your ED? I would reccomend stopping the weigh ins and measurements. They can do whatever but should keep it private from you. ",False,False
