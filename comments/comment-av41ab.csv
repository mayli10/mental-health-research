I find that eating before my workout tends to give me less energy, and if I work out fasted in the AM, I have all the energy in the world.  I‚Äôve heard the opposite for some people though!

If the sound of that interests you, you can PM me. If not, the best advice I can give is to just force yourself to eat a pre-workout snack like a CLIF bar or a Quest bar. If you cant get yourself to eat bigger meals, that will be your best bet. Then, while working out, try not to think of it as a way to calories but to build a better body. Like even if you know it's to burn calories, lie to yourself, and try to do a long, low intensity workout over a short, all out workout. I find the best results when I do the former, but the latter is good if you do something like sprints, to build up heart health. But you shouldnt do that if you restrict to the level you do",False,False

I was still restrictive and physically inactive on top of that so I think I lost a disturbing amount of muscle mass hhhhhhhh  When i am myself, my diet is really balanced and on the healthier side, mostly veg and protein. Theres always room for improvement especially since whole grains and plant based fats like nuts and avocados are unreasonably scary to me most days. (But cookies chocolate and white rice is ok?? Idk brain)  Generally I keep my caloric limit to 1025kcal tops, but 780 and below is where I feel most content and what I aim for on normal, regular days. I do have a rule where if someone close to me offers me food and it's under 250kcal then I absolutely have to accept it and eat some of it if not all of it, which is why my sweet spot of &lt;800 is bumped up a lot of the time.  I think I eat more than an adequate amount tbh, I feel really satisfied with what I eat and I don't really get hungry  (Im lying my hunger cues are probably just fucked lmao) but obviously I'm not eating enough because I'm so physically tired all the time, it's just hard to force yourself to eat more if your tummy doesn't feel hungry :/    this was a long ass response sorry I'm so neurotic ugh  TLDR: &lt;1025kcal daily ",False,True

Usually I don't have to force myself because it feels natural. I feel off if I don't workout and skipping one day throws me off balance but sometimes when I overdid my cardio and or my muscles are too tight I'm like fuck this. When I feel like that I try to make a new playlist and I force myself to do 30 mins of HIIT and at least 30 of pilates. That hour easily goes to 2 because an hour of a workout isn't enough for me at this point so I usually just stack until I feel like I got a good enough workout and that's it.,False,False
