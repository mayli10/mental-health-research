I feel like she definitely is promoting anorexia. “Why eat real food when you can eat fake food for less calories uwu!” Like because real cookies taste better than disgusting shit like oat fiber mixed with sugar alcohols...and living your life and being happy is more important than restriction and pain. It really annoys me knowing how an ED ruined my life that she feels fine giving out tips that encourage ED behaviors or “help” people who already are struggling. Idk man it’s pretty fucked up.,False,False

They seemed pretty clearly pro ana, supporting ""looking skeletal"" and preferring a thin body (note: underweight) but denying an eating disorder and acting like their restriction and habits were normal. Not really a fan of that kind of person. Pretty fucked up.  But I found a lot of use from their recipes and I do hope that they're okay. Restriction can be really hard on the body (hence why eating disorders are disorders).",False,False

For her own privacy I suppose. While it pains me to think I wont see her videos again, if this is the case and she's deleted it to keep her privacy secure, I'm happy she's being cautious.",False,False
