I randomly binged three days in a row out of nowhere. I've literally never binged uncontrollably before, even when I was obese. I did the math with MFP and FitBit, and I'm up a net of 2.5-ish lbs. I'm pulling out now before things get crazy.",False,False

I tried to eat in a surplus when I was weight lifting regularly and just couldn't do it.

Seriously, I can relate. I've always loved food even though I wish I didn't.   When my ED was bad, I restricted for a year straight without any binges. Didnt have access to a scale until one day my mum decided to buy one just to weigh me and let me tell you, I was shocked after calculating my bmi. I was scared for my life so I started to up my intake to at least try to eat at maintenance.  Obviously, that led to me binging for about 2 weeks straight, roughly 4000-5000 cals each day and I quickly gained 2 kgs and I hated it.  Oddly, I loved the euphoria I had after a binge, more than the euphoria I feel during a fast.  Ever since then, I've been planning my fasts to get to my lw and then binge to about 3 kgs above that and then restrict back to my lw and honestly, I don't know how to feel about this except wishing I was one of those who doesn't obsess over how foods taste lol?",False,False
