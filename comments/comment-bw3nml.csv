He told me his problems and I told him mine. It went easier than I expected it to, but he also has problems with his mental health so that's why he was so understanding.  Ever since then I felt relieved. If he were to leave me because of that, then I guess it was for the best. But he didn't and it made me feel more secure about the relationship.  No lies anymore.",False,True

I have a severe fear of abandonment too, especially with all this crap I’m doing and it’s hard for me to be there in the way I want to be because I’m always fiending after food and being insecure and crying all the time and I’m scared that’ll drive him away but he reassures me every time that it’s never gonna happen when I get scared he’ll leave me. I’m not sure if it’s because I’m his first or what and maybe that’s why he loves me, cuz I ain’t that great, lol. But either way I’m greatful and consider myself to be the luckiest woman in the world to have him. It feels pretty great and im glad he’s there for you, we are so lucky :))))",False,False
