There are a couple of people who know of my ED, and to whom I try to be as candid as I can. But it always feel like they never truly believe that I have an ED. I can tell them I weigh myself multiple times a day using two different scales, and that I freaked out about my weight one day and had to immediately film bodycheck to make sure my thighs haven't ballooned up. And all they can say is ""Just focus on being healthy,"" ""How about you start weight lifting and eat healthier?""   Sometimes I feel like I'm losing weight just to prove people wrong. I want them to see that I can look as sick as I feel inside. Which is horrible because these are the people I love dearly.",False,False

Well mine is I don't want or like my body because of sexual assault and want to punish myself. PTSD causes real bad bd and i go through patterns of weight loss and gain. Well one chick didn't like that and said i couldn't struggle with anorexia because i didn't want to be skinny but i do and she couldnt just understand that starving it is apart of the process and wouldn't listen.  Luckily the gc all stood up for me and understood me but it was just real messed up.,False,False

I think people do it to each other a lot. I don't understand how it makes it easier for some people to be told nothing is wrong with them and they're fine when they're not and they need help. It's just the way people go about it, it's a bit childish  They don't want to look at it. It's uncomfortable. They have to look at themselves and the choices they've made for themselves and how they treat people. It's a form of censorship. Invalidation is the other extreme to being skinny-shamed constantly. In both cases they can be thin with eating disorders or without.   I think some people have experienced more thin-shaming along with their eating disorders where as others are invalidated all the time. The former are hypersensitive to thin shaming and they have PTSD. Invalidation isn't a solution. You can have PTSD from being invalidated as well  Two wrongs don't make a right. You shouldn't play God with people's mental health. I think a lot of people do. Putting everything into the ""general comments"" category as just a coincidence/habit versus using ""general comments"" to be manipulative. Are people really that blank and daft?   No one shows initiative anymore- they just copy each other and hope for the best. I think the carelessness about our impact on each other's mental health has emerged from positive thinking culture and the fact that it was really empty and superficial to begin with- and maybe people were too obsessed with other types of growth  There are stereotypes for people who are just making general comments, like they're older or whatever. But if they've gotten themselves into a state and it's obvious it does look like they might be manipulative or they've been manipulated and bullied into being wind-up toys and they're not well either",False,False

And that even opening up to someone isn't always going to lead to that either, because the truth is that they expect eating disordered people to look and act a very specific way.
