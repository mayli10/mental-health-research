Damn that really struck a chord with me personally. Though this probably does nothing for you, I am genuinely sorry that you’re feeling this way. I have those same thoughts very often since I cycle between using my ED as a coping method and as a form of self-harm almost daily (though I’m sure all of us do that to some degree). Drinking only made things worse but yeah, it sure is hard to stop. I wish I could help you in that area but all my methods are super self-destructive. I’m only where I am now because I swapped out alcohol for a less “acceptable” drug. I’m also lucky that I managed to fuck up my tolerance so bad that I can’t even indulge in that anymore either. I still get the urge to start drinking again though, sometimes on a weekly basis... Anyways I just want you to know that you’re not alone in this and I’m here if you need someone to talk to.",False,False

Do you write anywhere else? Also, see it as a token from a former heavy, daily consumer of hard liquor (currently 79 days dry).   Regarding the punishing yourself by being sober thing... you know, I can see why you might think this now, and it's something I say to my therapist a lot ever since quitting the bottle. But if I'm honest with myself I gotta admit I was publishing myself much more with the drinking, as eventually, the amounts of booze which I had to consume to feel a buzz (rather than go blackout drunk, which was always the worst) were causing me to sleepless nights, constant dry mouth and a pounding headache, and an even bigger hole in my pocket. That's true punishment.  Granted, I still have a big benzo problem right now I am not willing to fully address, but still.  About the nightmares: yes, yes and yes. Every single night. Both ""emotional"" nightmares and gory, violent ones. I'm sure you've read alcohol does nothing to make it better (benzos neither, and yet I'm still there).  You are not alone in this.   You're also not alone in seeing the stupid little trail mix as the biggest transgression in the world. That's the ED brain for you, as well as the one that tells you to drink, that tells you you are lesser than, that gives you nightmare fuel. But it's the only brain you're ever gonna have, and there are others in this universe who feel just like you do.  Please PM me if you wanna talk. I'd love to.",False,False
