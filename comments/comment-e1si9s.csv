Please message me if you need to talk or vent.  The motivation to live may be lacking, but you gotta fight it. You’re too strong to let these negative emotions win. Fuck that. There’s still cool reasons to stay alive, even if life kinda sucks right now. What about all the coffee shops you haven’t been to? There’s so many beaches you haven’t seen yet. The new holiday candles that are dropping, don’t forget those. The feel of cozy socks and blankets, the warmth of clean sheets straight from the dryer.  Stick around for awhile and experience these things, don’t give up just yet.",False,False
