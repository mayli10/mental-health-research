A long distance guy acted super into me for awhile and then we Skyped and everything. He acted like we would have a relationship. I was super reserved with expectations because I had been hurt in a previous relationship, but I was really excited. He said he was visiting his father for the day. Then he did not talk to me all day and next thing I knew he said he was getting back with an old girlfriend. Then he blocked my number and on Skype. It was painful but ended up being for the best because I got in a healthier relationship after. I feel the hurt all over again just reading your post, one of the worst feelings. Sending good thoughts your way and hope you are kind to yourself.",False,False
