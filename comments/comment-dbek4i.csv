The problem was also only stomach aches in people with a very rare GI disease.  2nd: Laxatives do not help with weight loss. You still digest the food, it just comes out of you faster. Laxatives can cause a lot of problems and they dehydrate you which itself can cause even more problems. They're not good for you.  3rd: Ginger might be helpful. Celestial Teas makes a nice ginger and turmeric tea (turmeric is in the ginger family so it helps too) with a bit of cinnamon to improve the taste. I've seen similar teas from other companies, but this one is just three ingredients so I trust it more. If it weren't for the cinnamon it would be entirely ginger tea. Most teas that contain ginger also have a lot of other stuff which means that a single serving of tea has less ginger than this one does. If you can't find this tea (I bought a couple boxes at a Bulk Barn near my mom's house, but I know that  not all Bulk Barns sell it) I would recommend just getting ginger Gravol instead. I think the tea is better, but ginger Gravol is pretty good too.",False,False

If I were you I wouldn’t worry too much about cancer or metabolism stuff from Diet Coke though. But before I started drinking Diet Coke I had really nice teeth and now they’re yellow and I have a cavity so :/ juice and water are better for you anyway. Nutrients and stuff lol,False,False

I'll steer clear of them.  I do like tea and also coffee. I've never tried peppermint tea but I like both of those things so I'll give it a shot. Thanks for the advice!",False,True

Personally I believe aspartame is way better than sugar which most juices are loaded with. Nothing beats water though. May be worth checking out the Mio or other brand water flavor droppers,False,False
