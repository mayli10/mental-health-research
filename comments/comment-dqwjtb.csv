I also read that more than 8L per day is when it can start to be a problem.  I don't remember where I got this info from, it's just something that's stuck in my head. Through personal experience, I haven't had any issues with 4L, or even 6L but haven't often gone more than 6L. I suppose it weather and activity level would also play into this.",False,False
