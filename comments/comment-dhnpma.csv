I do kind of feel better after drinking it. My gut is throwing a fit, but I'm at least not in pain anymore. Not being pain also reduced the stress I was feeling which helps too. I thought it was a weird suggestion at first, but while I was drinking it I did think about how baking soda would probably be good to use as a rinse after throwing up.",False,False

I can imagine your enamel may be a little stronger after brushing if you use a good toothpaste. The effect will probably be minimal though. I also imagine it would have the same net effect as if you brushed a little while after purging. I can't imagine that it actually helps.,False,False
