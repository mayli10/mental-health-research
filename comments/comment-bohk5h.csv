I mean I go on the fasting sub and it‚Äôs taught me some really good harm reduction tips and just generally how to successfully fast. But it definitely normalises not eating.  Tbh the extreme dieting/weight loss like OMAD and fasting seems like a really unsustainable way to lose weight. 16:8 IF yeah I get it because I‚Äôm not an eat in the morning person anyway. But only eating one meal a day or going days not eating at all is not a realistic lifestyle change to healthy sustainable weight loss.  I get that these people are usually overweight and have excess energy stored as a result so it‚Äôs different for them but yeah it does cut a little deep when we‚Äôre all doing the exact same thing and our sub gets banned but theirs is no problem at all.,False,False

I think the thing I despise about that sub is their arrogance. They have this impression that they are superior because they deny themselves food.
