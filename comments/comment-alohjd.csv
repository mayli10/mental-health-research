For birthdays, I get that cake and ice cream are usual, but I’ve always taken it into consideration that it’s THEIR day. So I always say things like “I’d love to help you celebrate! Is there anything you’d like me to make for you?”. Repeat this across the board for any sort of celebrations or gifts. I don’t give what I think would be awesome to receive, I give based on what I know they’d love; and if I don’t know- I ask. I feel like today’s gifting culture is so selfish. You’re expected to like being given things that you don’t actually like. People expect to be basically worshipped for even having given something in the first place.

My ex best friend was bulimic and his mother and friends would push him to eat all the time because he was getting frail.

Most people do not have EDs and are not on diets, and a hot chocolate is relatively high calorie so someone preparing the drink wouldn’t even consider that the person ordering it is limiting calories.  99% of people ordering hot chocolate *would be* choosing not to get the extras just because of cost.    I’ve had this happen more than once.  I love low calorie frozen drinks, but some people who prepare the drinks add whipped cream and swirls because they think it’s a nice gesture that they’re giving something (relatively) costly to me for free.  I’ve never once complained and think that would be so rude to do when someone’s putting their job on the line to be kind.

And I guess it's more the comments than you haha. I have a pretty similar feeling tho. Like I love receiving food gifts and cooking for people but I'm also terrified because i know I'll either binge them or c/s, but I'm super fascinated with food and flavor outside of my ED and I really appreciate the cultural significance of it. And it gets tiring to see other people with EDs act like appreciating food is gross and gluttonous.  It's not; it's a unifying force of humanity and crosses all cultures.

I find it a lil weird that OP is surprised by this fact (not the adding of whipped cream because I feel like that was an oversight by the barista since it could have been a health issue... like she ordered oat milk bro) but it's like... you're the one drinking cocoa for comfort.

There's obvious hints of lactose intolerance there. Whenever I order an almond milk drink from Starbucks, they always make a point to ask about whip or no whip. Adding whip to your drink anyway, especially after specifically ordering it without, is just strange in general - not to mention, kinda a dickish thing to do.  Thinking that you just didn't want to pay for whip is also very strange to me. But that may just be because my local Starbucks don't charge extra for whip. At least, they don't reduce price if I get my drink without whip. It may be different at your university coffee shop.",False,False

I think you're right to be upset, but I also think that in my experience- most if not all people that have done this (I used to work in a cafe so I would see the people doing this at work and talk to them about their intentions-- and obviously say something if they were altering a drink) are genuinely doing this because they think it is sweet. It's weird to see people do this because I forget that it's actually a normal gesture, at least where I come from, to show affection or gratefulness or just ""nice-ness"" as giving someone a little extra, a smile, or a little doodle on their container if its a to go thing or a reciept, or yes a cookie or an extra timbit or wtv. You can for sure chalk this up to people not thinking that someone else might feel different, and you are completely entitled to feeling upset (again I would too) but I have a really hard time seeing this as ""rude"" necessarily. I once got a single timbit and a very specific and clearly low calorie drink option (sort of nitpickingly so) from a Tim's and the dude that served me and I were flirty and he gave me three instead of 1 and I had a little private cry because I bit a second one after my first before throwing them out.
