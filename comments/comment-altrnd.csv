I found myself throwing a puke bag in the alley dumpster when everyone went to bed. My cat followed and meowed loud as hell.. definitely embarrassing and stressful being afraid your cat will rat you out. You’re doing great, and if your therapist and husband know then I salute you for being brave enough to let them know. ",False,False

Just the other day I smuggled a carrier bag full of puke out of my student dorm to the outside bins because I didn’t want it to stink up our communal kitchen. There’s a lot of pressure as we become “proper adults” to have our lives together, but honestly I really don’t think anyone does. Please don’t be too hard on yourself.   Also I’m no expert but I’m almost certain it’s not illegal to dump puke in a public trash can, and it would be absurd for them to track anyone down over that. I’m sure when I was a kid and I got car sick my parents would dump the evidence into the nearest public bin. Our minds can really run away with us sometimes, it’s tough when that happens. Take a deep breath, maybe have a glass of water to ground yourself. That sometimes helps me.   Tomorrow is a new day, please try and stay safe!",False,False

I go out of my way to ensure that he has a positive relationship with himself, his body, and food. There are no foods that are off limits, all foods are good, food aversions are okay, he doesn’t have to finish his plate if he is legitimately full or not feeling well. If he’s hungry 10 minutes later, a snack is totally fine. I don’t force or deny food and I don’t restrict what he can or can’t have, but I make sure he’s getting the nutrients he needs. Sometimes he will say something if I’m not eating, he will offer me food, to make food, or a bite or something, etc. It depends on how loud my eating disorder is being on how I react, but I try to emphasize a positive relationship with all of that around him.

Which is usually when I work out, or b/p if that’s happening. (I do other things, this is just the “ed stuff”) I usually don’t eat once they are home, occasionally I’ll have a small portion of dinner or I’ll make myself something. We all eat different dinners, so it’s not too odd if I’m not eating (my husband knows).   Other than that, I’m not too sure what you mean.",False,False

Not much else to say, but I’ve done “questionable” things many, many times myself. I’m also married (what a wreck, thanks ed) and I have a young (5 year old) kid myself.
