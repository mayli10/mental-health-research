Makes sense though. And I don't feel right naming her but on Tuesday is the three month anniversary and I'm getting a tattoo of the tiniest little red heart near my inner hipbone so I can always remember I loved something, even if she barely existed ❤️",False,True

This is gonna be the big thing that sets me on the right path again. I've actually been eating really well since and I know I'd feel worse and more depressed if I was engaging in ED behaviours,False,True

If you need to shoulder some responsibility for this to heal, that’s fine, but there is no reason to think your ED is what made this happen. Yes, EDs put people at higher risk of miscarriages and pregnancy/birth complications, but miscarriage risk is actually more correlated with bulimia (whereas birth complications are more common with restrictive EDs). I know it’s weird to think about, but the human body is actually quite resilient in the face of limited food supply, especially (and I really hope this doesn’t trigger you) if you’re not already extremely thin with zero “support reserves” of fat. We kind of evolved to weather bouts of famine, which is why babies go on being born in times of war and widespread hunger. If anything, it’s the mothers who are often most affected by starvation in pregnancy, because the body prioritizes your developing passenger.  The reality is that miscarriage is common, and we usually don’t even know why it happens (or the cause is multifactorial). Please don’t blame yourself. It’s fine to empower yourself to say, “I won’t restrict the next time I’m pregnant,” or even, “this ED shit ends now,” but in all likelihood this is NOT your fault. It’s just nature (or God).   I’m so sorry you went through that. Have you mourned at all? Would it help to name her? Make a memorial bracelet? Plant a hardy little tree or succulent for her?",False,False

Try not to beat yourself up, and instead focus on making he future better.  Sending love❤️you will be a wonderful mother some day.  Good luck with recovery.",False,False
