I‚Äôve always had it and it‚Äôs hellish, but I do find that it‚Äôs a bit better when I‚Äôm eating normally or too much and gets way, way worse when I‚Äôm restricting. I‚Äôm sorry üò¢. Headphones and/or earplugs are the only things that have saved some of my relationships. ",False,False

Meals are fine because I'm eating too, and somehow that makes it okay, but god help me if they start eating chips or nuts when I'm around. My heart is elevated just thinking about it.

I try to be open with him about eating stuff but the noise KILLS me. My own chewing doesn‚Äôt but anyone else‚Äôs? It doesn‚Äôt happen every time we eat either. Like selective annoyance.   I don‚Äôt recall this being an issue for, like, the first ten years of my ED either. It‚Äôs just come out of no where when I feel back into it after a few years in recovery.   Also when I was a kid my mom had beautiful nails, but I‚Äôd want to vomit if she itched her scalp. It felt like the sound was taking over me.",False,True

I find that mine is worse when I'm restricting but it's always present. Mouth noises are a huge trigger for me; I have to leave the room if someone is chewing or if my dog is licking himself, and can't stand movie scenes that show kissing.

I‚Äôll snap at even my mom, who I love when I can hear it. I get agitated and disgusted and feel sick. I was never sure if it related to my ed though, or if it was just misophonia.
