Thanks for the tips. There are a few I haven’t been trying so long will incorporate. The prunes freak me out from the sugar but I’m going to push through it lol. God, this sucks. It is just so damn uncomfortable. And I don’t really want to tell my doctor about it because she will just think I’m abusing them to lose weight, and that isn’t even the case.",False,True

Sometimes I go two weeks between shits and it’s miserable. Here’s what I do. Try the old standards first- black coffee, prunes, a heating pad, etc. If that doesn’t work for a couple days I’ll try a single dose of the mildest laxative I can. After two days of that I break out the big guns. I guess enemas are an option but I’m too grossed out to try them.",False,False
