And yes  I think my ED is also concurrent with and symptomatic of other mental health things I'm dealing with, so it makes a lot of sense that recovering from both is a somewhat simultaneous process. I feel like I often only work on one of them at a time (e.g. I'll stop paying attention to how little I'm eating and such but I'll take more time to meditate and deal with anxiety; I'll be really anxious but I'll remind myself to eat something because at least then I won't be spiralling on 2 fronts, that sort of thing).",False,True

And for me my ED thoughts are barely noticeable but I guess I’m the worst I’ve ever been behaviour wise ? It’s like a paradox honestly...  What I am really really trying to do is change little things in my “autopilot ed mode” to try and make the first steps towards maybe not a full recovery but at least managing it better. I eat almost exactly the same thing every day but recently I’ve been trying to at least change it slightly, by having a different food for breakfast for example, just to try and stop me feeling like I’m just a robot doing the same thing over and over. This forces me to think about it a bit more and it’s a chance to reflect on how my ED responds, and rationalise the situation.   Sometimes I just need to be reminded that I do have a choice in what I do and I can fight the behaviours. Life doesn’t have to be the same cycle of wake up, weigh myself, go to school/work, eat, sleep. If I can make each day slightly different then I become more used to the idea of doing things that I actually want to do, rather than what the ED wants.  Idk if that made any sense or if I’m just rambling haha, but I think my ED developed partly to cope with depression/other mental health shit so part of getting better with that is ED “recovery” and vice versa.",False,False

We had a national holiday last weekend, and I ate out three meals with friends.  I haven't felt the feeling of fulness in years. It was super uncomfortable. I usually mask eating out by eating just one meal a day. Seeing my friends eat through a whole day made me realize just how normalized my ED had become.",False,False

Is it a sign we are doing better or is it a sign it's getting worse or out of control? I'm trying so hard to get out of the ED mindset and it is helping but I haven't actually stopped any of the behaviors. Obviously success is not a straightforward path but like...what do?,False,True
