I kinda starve myself for attention when I’m feeling extremely depressed.I don’t wanna tell anyone about my mental health issues, but I want someone to worry about me, and my friends and family start making a big fuss of me when I look too skinny",False,False

My motivation for that was a combination of aesthetic and self-harm, since in a way my BED was just self-harm, too. So I think if society didn't hate fat people so much I wouldn't have swapped to restricting, but on the other hand, I would still have an ED.  Although maybe if society didn't stigmatize weight at all then I wouldn't have formed the behavioural patterns that led to secret eating and BED in the first place because foods wouldn't be stigmatized. Certain foods wouldn't have been restricted from me (to the extent that they were) and I might not have felt the need to hoard and eat them whenever I could, not knowing the next time I'd be able to.",False,False

I've had self destructive tendencies for a long time and I used to self harm. I stopped a year ago, but then when things became stressful, I had no efficient coping mechanism. For some reason, my brain decided that skipping meals was the way to go. My disordered eating is just a replacement for my self harm, because losing weight is infinitely more accepted (even admired) than having a suspicious amount or wounds or scars. I'm still hoping to find a better alternative..",False,False

While the thin ideal makes it harder to recover, my eating disorder seems to stem from overcontrol, perfectionism, and a need for safety.",False,False

My ED is a way of making myself as physically helpless as I am mentally/emotionally helpless. I need an excuse to be as useless as I am and being emaciated grants me that. I can blame my stupidity on brain fog, I can blame my laziness on physical limitations, and so on, and so forth. I'm basically hiding my inadequacies behind the physical symptoms of my ED.",False,False

Although societal pressures play a role in my body image issues, I know the core of my ED lies elsewhere. It’s like I want to evaporate or just be so small I’m unnoticeable, like a shadow. My ed also has a lot to do with my sexual assaults and not wanting to be or look womanly or grow up. I just want control and to slowly slip away into the background without anyone noticing.",False,False

Since my goal isn't really to be sexy to others. I don't want to look a certain way because I want others to like me; it's like I want *me* to like me. For me I think my ED developed as a coping mechanism for me to feel more disciplined or something. It's not at all related to wanting others to find me attractive.,False,False
empn6xl,t3_bljrh8,t3_bljrh8,eriwhi,1,2019-05-07 00:05:14,/r/EDAnonymous/comments/bljrh8/if_thinness_wasnt_what_was_socially/empn6xl/,I know what you mean. My friends are constantly talking about working out not to get thin but to get a big butt or whatever. I cannot relate to that AT ALL even if that’s the new beauty standard. I love being skinny. I love having ribs and bony hipbones and sharp elbows. Even at times when I’ve been severely underweight and wasn’t at all attractive I still loved it. It’s not about being beautiful. I like feeling small.,False,False

On one hand my ED manifests as me as a way to feel like I have control. When my ED is at it's worst it's because I need the stability of knowing I can at least accomplish one thing- eating to a specific number. And when I don't there's the satisfaction of punishing myself which is kind of a release of frustration about my other shortcomings. It's also a bit of a form of self harm, I guess. Boss got upset? You don't deserve to eat. Don't do as good on an exam? You don't deserve to eat. Hurt your S/O's feelings? You get the pattern. There's something so comforting in the numbers and the counting too, it takes up so. much. mental. headspace. that it gives me something to distract myself with whenever I'm in a rough patch in life.   On the other hand I was bullied a lot for my weight when I was younger. I was a chubby kid until the first inklings of my eating disorder developed during puberty. I did athletics all throughout high school and changed clothes in lockerrooms with girls with defined abs and teeny tiny cross-country runners. I was constantly surrounded by bodies I perceived as better than mine. We were weighed every other week and gaining any significant weight meant the coaches pulled you aside and berated you.   And yet in the other-other hand, maybe it is a majority genetic predisposition. My brothers and I(despite not explicity stating it) have periods of disordered eating. We have all weight cycled through underweight to obese BMIs back-and-forth a few times. But they also all played college football and uses to tell me about being brutally punished for being over or under their target weight during team weigh-ins. So we all have that in common.   So definitive answer: maybe?",False,False
