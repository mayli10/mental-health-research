Besides, you're not going to be young and beautiful forever. Eventually you'll get wrinkles and sagging skin and grey hair, and your husband will lose interest.

I am currently a stay at home mom and I love it! I was the type of woman who always put my career first but that all changed with having kids. I absolutely love being at home with them all day everyday. BUT the things I don't like are cleaning, cooking, and waking up at 4am to feed the baby. And all my husband really wants in return is for me to stay a normal weight and be sexy.....you don't realize how much this wears on you until you live it. I mean I know he loves me but it almost seems conditional. He definitely had to work at being attracted to me when I was pregnant. I finally lost all the baby weight but at a cost, hence the ED.

My mom had exactly the life you are describing. She was miserable and she became an alcoholic. She gained a bit of weight and my dad stopped viewing her as attractive and essentially stopped having sex with her after she had kids. My mom was a very beautiful woman when she met my dad and married him. Slowly over time, she let herself go because she felt unattractive to my dad. She lived a lonely existence. When they announced the separation when I was 16, it took years to separate the assets. My dad gave her the house (worth over 2 million) and paid her monthly. She still gets cheques from my dad today and the divorce was finalized 6 years ago. My dad got the apartment buildings and the vacation home. Watching my mom deteriorate over time really fucked me up. My mom was a pretty housewife who didn‚Äôt have her own money or her own purpose. She gave up her job after having kids. I don‚Äôt know if it would‚Äôve saved my parents marriage if she had done something meaningful with her life or not because they had intimacy issues after she had children. Lack of intimacy played a large part. The fact that my father expected her to remain a trophy wife also played a part because eventually she started to gain weight. She never ballooned up and she always looked quite thin but by the end, once the divorce was announced, I‚Äôll always remember her having a tummy. Her face was bloated from the alcohol and bottles of wine she‚Äôd drink every night. She really did lose her looks. She looked like a movie star when she married my dad.   So as much as I desire to live a plush life as a housewife, I‚Äôll never forget what happened to my mother. I can‚Äôt let that happen to me, ever.   My goal is to marry a rich man who can invest in my dreams to own an event planning company, or a company that specializes in interior design. I don‚Äôt want to sit around while he‚Äôs at work, I want to be a boss, but I want him to invest in my ideas.    ",False,False

Maybe it had to do with incompatibility in our personalities but I got to the point of where I felt too isolated, even though I'm not particularly social. It was moreso pining for a more adventurous life in my case. I got everything I wanted, however I didn't value what I had, not having to work for it.   Nowadays I work a physical job with shit pay, and got some other money-making gigs on the side. In some ways I'm happier (especially since I'm independent by nature) and in others not so much; I feel I need to seek viable alternatives because I can not keep wasting my life working like this.
