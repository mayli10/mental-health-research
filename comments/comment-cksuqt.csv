I’m about 5’9” and while I def see the advantages of being tall (I can eat more and not gain, and if I do gain it’s not noticeable), all I ever focus on are the “disadvantages”. Takes longer to lose weight, and (IMO) if you don’t have a teeny tiny waist then you just feel like a behemoth. Sure the proportions are better but that only applies if you’re model thin to begin with. At least short girls will never look intimidating and massive...or at least that’s the narrative my messed up ed brain believes.  I just want to be able to let my bf pick me up with out squirming and telling him to put me down because all I can think of is the 25lb+ difference between me and his ex.",False,False
