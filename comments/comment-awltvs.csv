I was so fucking desperate that I paid $5.99 for a mini box of cereal. And then I threw it out thinking I would stop the binge, but then I only went out and bought more food.   Beats my more extravagant binges. I use to go to the mall and have a ‚Äúfood tour,‚Äù but I had to cut that off real quick.   Generally, I find that I ‚Äútap out‚Äù more quickly with higher protein foods. They‚Äôre not necessarily cheaper, but the lower volume may be a bit easier on your stomach. ",False,False
