It's the actual exercise that burns calories and the fact that muscle is more compact per pound,False,False

I have always felt this about myself- like I have to starve myself to look just normal thin even if I am underweight!  But I felt the same even at my lowest bmi (12). I really thought my legs were fatter than all my friends. It‚Äôs only looking back I can see I was really skeletal so distorted perception is definitely a thing. You are probably thinner than you feel you look.  I think body fat percentage also makes a difference. I‚Äôve never exercised properly and I am definitely skinny fat because I have no muscle!!,False,False
