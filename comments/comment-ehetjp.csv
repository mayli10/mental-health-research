And did you deal with extreme hunger?  And if you don’t mind my asking, was it a significant amount of weight you had to gain?   I’m afraid I’d just keep gaining and gaining if I shot back up to maintenance - even with exercise. (1,500-1,800.) (But maybe that’s only if you do the standard 2,000+ recovery amount, right?)  I want to build muscle instead of putting on just fat.",False,True

It felt like I was dying and I got extremely suicidal, crying almost daily. I would recommend to gain just a little bit of weight and maintain it. I'm at an bmi of 18, eat at maintenance 1,500-1700 and have been like this for weeks now. I feel so much better. I feel so fucking good. You are still really skinny but don't feel like shit. I actually still lose weight even tho I eat so much calories so I have to eat a lot once a week to maintain.",False,False
