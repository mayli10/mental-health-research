Whether you realize it or not, the relationship sounded toxic. Not in an abusive way, just in that, like you said, you had no idea what your partner was dealing with. It sounds like the support was very one sided and your issues are currently too difficult to deal with to allow you to be in a healthy relationship. I'm not saying this to make you feel bad, I just think that if you dont hear what may be the truth, you could make that same mistake. I'd say you need to really work on yourself. It may be a while before you get to a place where you can be in a healthy relationship, but it's definitely worth it.  I hope you can find someone, maybe a parent or teacher you can trust, to help you through this.  Good luck",False,False
