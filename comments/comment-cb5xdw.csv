I know the anxiety those comments and attention can fuel and it sucks. I read your initial post and agreed 150%. I am a binger/restricter. That sub is *literally* what helped me complete NINETY HOURS of not eating. It spun my ED up so badly and I spent the next two and a half months unable to stop eating for more than an hour at a time. At one point I was laying in bed, halfway through my fast and pretty stoned, and started having regretful feelings, like my mind was warning me to be careful. It knew what was coming.   I thought your post was really valuable and if I had seen a warning like that, it would have helped me. I was already predisposed to ED and that sub framed starving myself as a form of self-care and health improvement. It made it so much easier for me to dive deeper into the really toxic feelings I was having towards food and turn that energy into what was essentially self harm through starvation. I had always binged but it brought out a really nasty, powerful drive to not eat in me.",False,False

It's kind of nice to go through and comment to the people who seem a bit ignorant and providing them with some info. The amount of people who are saying ""I use fasting because xyz and its healthy but I agree with you"" but xyz is something like ""I want to make up for breaking the fast early"" or ""I am totally addicted to carbs so I'm trying to ***control*** my eating"" is kinda staggering and sad",False,False

You said it so much better than I could. I made a post on there last week too calling out unhealthy and disordered behavior and the spread of misinformation on that post, and it blew up with people getting angry and super defensive. Fasting can be helpful for some people with certain medical conditions under the supervision of a doctor, but so many people on there don't fall under that category and just encourage people to push through what is obviously pretty dangerous side effects.",False,False

I did see a few posts deflecting on your own ED as a way to illegitimize your viewpoint. I also saw some people commenting that the extreme fasting is okay because the people were already obese or overweight (lol wtf...do people think those with anorexia start off emaciated?) Both of those things made me upset and I got a bit carried away with downvotes haha but at the same time there was a lot of positive feedback and others agreeing with you.
