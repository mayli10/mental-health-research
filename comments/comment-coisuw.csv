I have denied food so often from them that they don't offer it anymore so no more anxiety for me.,False,False

If it is at their house then its the same method lol. For the crabby part I have no advice because I am also crabby 24/7 and don't know how to fix it!! I hate being mean to people when its not their fault.,False,False
