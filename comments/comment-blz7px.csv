I guess since it’s called relapse prevention program they will probably help you craft your own individualized relapse prevention plan. Having that many weeks will be good since your triggers and responses to them can change as you progress with recovery. It also takes time, trial and error with seeing what coping skills work best for you and which to leave out of your plan to have yourself best set up to succeed. Will you have the same therapist that you had in the day program or change to a different one? If you have more appointments in the first four weeks, you might work at coming up with an initial relapse prevention plan with many options during that time. During the months that reduce to 1x a week, you’ll practice the plan, go over what works and doesn’t, and fine tune it. Your program will run differently...I’m just giving the idea of the process. Best of luck!",False,False

They actually have a relapse prevention program after the day hospital, where you get 18 weeks of individual therapy (2x per week for the first month, then 1x per week after that).",False,True

It did get better for me. It will get better for you, too. Stick with it and keep advocating for your needs. You know your experience best. They aren’t inside your head or body and never met you before you walked into the clinic. Recovery is really hard and up and down. Later in your program, ask for help making a relapse prevention plan before reducing the amount of support you have. It can really help increase your success as you return to being more independent. It’s also a helpful tool after treatment is over when you have triggers and hard days to have a plan.",False,False

I had an appointment with the nurse practitioner today, to go over bloodwork and such, but she wants me to basically go back to my family physician for ongoing medical related stuff. I don't know if they'll allow me to take medication for that (I asked my navigator about even taking gravol to help with the nausea and she was hesitant about me taking medications).  But a co-patient told me that if I go to the doctor and they prescribe medications or write a note about my condition (IBS), they HAVE to accomodate for me, they can't go against the doctor.   &amp;#x200B;  I'm really sorry you had to go through that. I'm glad the medication worked for you!   &amp;#x200B;  I'll definitely add you on peach! My username is the same as my reddit username too.  I hope the assessment for treatment goes well and that you'll be able to get in soon :)",False,True

(It sounds childish, I know, but honestly this program is testing the limits of my mental and emotional health and I'm a mess).  Thank you though! About to post an update :)",False,True

I hope you can see a medical doctor soon. You could need medication to ease the symptoms during early recovery. I don’t know about IBS specifically. When I was in treatment for bulimia, I had some problems with my esophagus and other GI stuff. The first meals involuntarily came up when I got up from the table. The team sent me out for consultation. I had already had testing before I got to treatment. I was prescribed a medication regime of 3 different things (Nexium, Carafate, and Reglan). Nexium was 2x a day, reglan was 3x a day before meals I think, and carafate was 4x a day around meals and if I had snack or bed. It helped heal my esophagus, increase my body’s ability to process the food and the carafate helped my body keep the food down. There was another med I had for nausea prn that I took when I was active in my ed. I’ve tried both zofran and phenergan.   Good luck! I have Peach, too if you want to connect there. It’s the same username I have here. I am on a waiting list for treatment. My assessment is next Thursday.",False,False

Yeah that excuse made me fume. Like sorry Karen, I’m not doing this on purpose. I don’t know if I can eat in a separate place as part of the treatment is dining together and I’m at a supervised table until I graduate to the unsupervised table.
