It was a combination of the confidence, the *I give zero fucks* attitude, the fearlessness-- all of it made me absolutely effervescent as a 17 year old. Everyone wanted me, everyone wanted to be me, and I wanted to die. I was living every moment so fully and feeling every emotion so strongly, and it's something that I will never be able to recreate. But you want to know my most poignant memory from that time?      I was 19, it was 4 am, I had just come home from a raging party. I had bought myself flowers because my date - some guy who gave me cocaine *shrug* -- hadn't cared enough to. I had scattered the flowers in my bathtub, I was laying there with my make up on and my hair done up and my favorite song playing and I was outright sobbing because of how lonely it all was. I just wanted someone to understand me, to listen, to be my friend. I didnt have friends in those days; I had sex partners, drug dealers, and users. And the inside of my head always sounded like [this](https://youtu.be/IyDeOQy3Lqc). It wasn't fun, and I dont miss that at all.     Congratulations on your new life!!
