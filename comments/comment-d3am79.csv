Fr tho, I'm sorry that happened. It's a shame that she cant look in the mirror and realize that everyone probably sees her as a deadbeat loser with no redeeming qualities.   Shes skinny?

Your ""friend"" looks down on you. With a friend like that, who needs enemies?  Make a list of things she's contributed to your happiness. Make a second list of ways she's undermined your happiness. Compare the lists.  And tbh if she's willing to openly insult your body, I'd insult her sore spots right back and see if she can take what she dishes out. Is that healthy? No, but it might make your frenemy think twice about dragging you down.  Don't ruin your recovery just to spite a bully. Living well and happily will make her more upset than anything else. She's thinner - so? Do you see them handing out a prize for that?  Follow your dreams, as cheesy as it sounds, and watch her stew in the consequences of her life choices. Maybe she'd have something going for her if she were a bit nicer and kinder.",False,False

I know EDs can be competitive but that’s not how you should ever treat someone you care about. It might be a good idea to distance yourself from her. And maybe she’s not, but I think you’re doing really great and I’m proud of you!",False,False
