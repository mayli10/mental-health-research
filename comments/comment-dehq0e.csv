The point of all this is to wake up your appetite and force you to confront the feelings that it brings up to abstain from binging on the whole cake combined with the guilt of having eaten one slice. Which is obviously very difficult hence why it's mostly only done with supervision of a treatment team.",False,False

Do you eat what it says on the package? I grew up thinking that one portion means the whole package regardless of its size, so anything less feels like depriving myself. I decided to fight the urge to binge, but I'd rather keep abstaining from junk food altogether, because a small portion would just wake up my appetite :(",False,True

The urge to binge has now decreased, and I think I had it because my mood was the worst I've felt in a long time for a couple of days. I'm glad I didn't give in and binge.",False,True

But you don’t need to eat them all in one go. Those foods will be available to you for the rest of your life now that you are not restricting. You can have them today, tomorrow, next week, whenever. There is no foods off limits anymore. Try to get into that mindset and the fixation on those specific foods will go away. I’m weight restoring right now and I eat lots of nutritious foods as well as lots of treats. Strive for balance and eat what you crave.",False,False

The body needs amino acids, minerals, vitamins, and WATER (or micronutrients) to repair and replace tissues. Think of micronutrients as the  tools your body needs, the calories are just the fuel.  This is the basis of our problems in the market economy food system. We have lots of access to calorie dense but nutritionally void foods. These high sugar foods packed full of processed grains (grains striped of all the nutritious parts) give our bodies lots of fuel but few nutrients to actually do the repair work our bodies need. This says nothing of bodies which are still growing and also need ""extra' building blocks.  The junk food path may lead to weight gain from empty calories but will not do much good for your body in terms of growth or damage repair.  THAT SAID...  There is something to be said for having enough energy, especially when healing. Also to listening to your body and letting yourself have that candy if you enjoy it. I think there is likely a good middle ground here in which you can both focus on nutrient dense foods and eat things you like ONLY because you like them. Maybe after all this abuse you deserve to eat something only because you enjoy it and for no other reason?  EDs are about using food to cope in unhealthy ways. Changing the way you use the food (ie binging instead of restricting) could really just reinforce the same lousy relationship you already have with food.  Also, what do I know!? I'm still sick lol  Good luck. I wish you well and can totally relate.",False,False

I had orthorexia 6 years ago and I was told by my doc I had to gain weight or she'd diagnose me with anorexia because my weight was so low. So I said fuck it and started binging on all the foods I restricted myself with. I'd tell myself I'll stop when I get to a healthy weight. But I wasn't able to stop after I started binging and just developed another ED on the other extreme end, and it's taken me years to finally lose the weight and get healthy again. Do it the right way gal, please take care of yourself :)",False,False

As someone who has had their fair share of binges, I feel its quite self destructive. I use it as a form of self harm in a way.   I 100% think you should eat all of those things and enjoy them and savour them, but maybe do it mindfully instead of a race to get as many calories in as possible. Take the time to enjoy each of them and don't ""binge"".  My long term goals are to be able to eat in non extreme ways. I've always either intensely over eaten or under under eaten so I'm definitely projecting here.   I think it's a great idea to get all the food you want just be gentle on yourself so you can enjoy it.",False,False
