Then it was the super bowl. Tons of wine and snacks. Probably ate at least double maintenance. Then I binged on all the leftover pizza and brownies last night.

I did two fasts during that time. One of my colleagues is 172cm and 47kg and one of the prettiest girls I‚Äôve ever seen. I fasted while she ate like a normal person.  Skyped my parents today and it‚Äôs only after having some distance from them that I realize exactly how toxic my moms comments are. I mostly spoke to my dad but in the few words we exchanged she told me my skin looked dirty in the lighting and suggested that I ask my taller and skinnier younger sister for help choosing a wedding gown because she has better taste. All she talks about is herself and she doesn‚Äôt think twice before making some offhand comment that stings. If I call her out on it she tells me I‚Äôm too sensitive and to chill out. I asked for some vacation days to go home but now I don‚Äôt even know if I want to. I‚Äôm home alone now while my husbands on a trip and I just demolished the jar of peanut butter I bought. I want to cry. I think I‚Äôm gonna fast for the next 3 days.,False,False

I've been heavy restricting for the past month, and I actually haven't binged at all, but that's because I'm influenced by my depression. I have this problem where I can't even look at my body, and I will not even consider looking at myself without a jacket because I haven't lost enough weight to even look at myself. I also haven't weighed myself in like three months because I think if I see how much I weigh it's gonna be some super high number that's just gonna make me super depressed and fuel my ED, but it kinda fuels my ED either way. I started purging a couple months ago too, and it's an absolutely horrible feeling, and whenever I do some semi-intensive exercise I feel like I'm on the brink of passing out. I just want to start losing some goddamn weight so I might gain enough confidence to wear only one shirt in public. :/",False,False

Went from 120 to about 135(?) now wtf. I hate it. I hate social events where I have to eat. I hate being expected to eat. I hate me because why do I have to turn one meal into an entire binge/cheat day/week/month because I ‚Äúalready messed up‚Äù. I feel like I‚Äôm so fed up with all this - since this weekend I‚Äôve been stuck with my family and I‚Äôve been having to eat so much food (aka at least three FULl actual meals a day) and I‚Äôm so over it. I can‚Äôt argue bc they‚Äôll get mad and everyone‚Äôs going to fight about it and I‚Äôm too tired to be the reason people start fighting. I‚Äôm just gonna go along with it bc I‚Äôm too tired. But my head is also going insane and is about to go into fucking restriction the moment this whole family thing is done (Thursday probably) and I can‚Äôt wait to restrict and work out and just lose all this fucking weight again.   Sorry. Long rant. My dad apparently also thinks I‚Äôm too skinny and I look sick (lol I‚Äôm 130 there‚Äôs no way I‚Äôm even skinny) so he‚Äôs been watching me eat I hate it. ,False,False
