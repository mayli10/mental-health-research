It was never my grades she was proudest of, it was always weight loss. When I was losing weight was when she was happiest with me. I don't think I've ever gotten past the effect she had on me",False,False

My mom has been super skinny her whole life, but she's always going on and on about how fat she is. She has always heavily restricted (at meals she won't eat anything or will have 2 bites and then go ""oh my god I'm so full!!""). With that as my model of how you should eat, I was kind of  doomed. I don't want to blame her because obviously she's going through her own stuff, but I don't know if I would have turned out this way if I didn't look up to her.",False,False

My mom is an over eater and yo-yo dieter. Always has been. I don’t live in the same state as her anymore, but she’s still on her bullshit. Posts all of her keto meals to IG alongside her beer and non keto dessert photos, just like “I’ll get back on the wagon tomorrow.” I mentioned to her that keto only works if you follow it daily, not every other day.. and so naturally she says, “I’m doing it for health more that weight loss.” But yeah, that was a fucking lie lmao.",False,False
