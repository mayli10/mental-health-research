For real. I am able to move around the world and exist in it rather than hiding away from it, only because I feel confident in my thinness.   &gt; my energy isn‚Äôt 100%  This is the only downside for me too. My SO often asks me what‚Äôs wrong or why I‚Äôm ‚Äúmad‚Äù but really it just looks like that from the outside because I‚Äôm flagging by the end of the day when he gets home from work. My mood is usually fine, I just have RBF lol.",False,False

I have things going for me in my life. I‚Äôm just really thin and I don‚Äôt want to lose that. No, my energy isn‚Äôt 100%, but I like feeling fragile, you know?",False,True

My anorexia isn‚Äôt currently comorbid with any depression; I have hobbies, a strong relationship with my SO, I get on really well with my family, and so on. I gained a couple pounds recently that I‚Äôm in the process of losing, and until then I was even pretty happy with my body (and expect to be again once I‚Äôm back there). I had to have a full health check up because people were worried I was gonna die but literally aside from a couple of vitamin deficiencies which I now take supplements for, I‚Äôm perfectly healthy. I have absolutely no reason in the world to want to recover ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è If anything I‚Äôm much happier this way. I feel like I‚Äôm in control, I feel strong, and anorexia is what gives me the impetus to get out of the house, exercise, travel, see amazing things. Sure, it locks me in in certain ways (my hobbies are all to do with food or burning calories for example) but I feel like I‚Äôd be a smaller person (in the bad ways lol) without it.",False,False

I‚Äôve been clean from cocaine addiction for a few years; I stopped cutting myself (I‚Äôd done it for 20 years); I no longer fit the DSM criteria for borderline personality disorder. I‚Äôm ortho &amp; try to keep myself as healthy as I can while restricting and frankly, my ED doesn‚Äôt cause me much anguish. BDD, on the other hand, causes me a lot of emotional pain, but at least when I‚Äôm obsessed with my weight, I‚Äôm not incurring more debt from plastic surgery procedures.",False,False

In a sick way, I guess, I feel as if I can always go back to being sick? I don‚Äôt know, it‚Äôs just become such a part of me, I don‚Äôt want to leave it. Maybe like Stockholm Syndrome lol??",False,True

My therapist fired me because I wanted to be what she called a ‚Äúfunctioning anorexic‚Äù instead of fully recovered. I have a rigid routine and it‚Äôs the only thing that makes me feel safe and in control. Recovery would nuke that sense of security.,False,False

Like I do like feeling and looking sick but it would be nice not to be that way don't you agree? Like wouldn't it be nice to just be normal and want more outa life then to be sick and get the satisfaction from that?  I've tried recovery a bunch of times and it just doesn't stick. I just don't want it bad enough since like you I enjoy being this way on a certain level.¬†  I would try and think about what your ED took from you and what not having it would mean for your life. Maybe try and find something else that isn't as self-destructive that would also make you as satisfied and happy with your life as continuing to act on your ED behaviors does currently.,False,False
