She told a supervisor our conversation made her uncomfortable.  Wow. What a fucking *asshole.*  Ask you to stop? No. Stop listening? No. Focus on her work? No. Immediately try to throw her co-workers under the bus for bonding within earshot about obstacles in life? ***Sure, I guess.***  Yeah, anyone with half a sense of decency would've kept quiet.  The only way I feel for her is if she has her own secret and had a bit of a meltdown at hearing y'all, but there still would've been other ways to handle it! And it just sounds like some harpy went ""oh noo, that's PERSONAL TALK, that's NOT ALLOWED, I couldn't possibly mind my own business!"".  People really showed their true colors at your work. Glad you found a source of genuinely understanding support during this, at least.",False,False

A is training you, and you are new in your office, so it's only natural that you'd talk with one another and develop a rapport through discussion that is not 100% work related.  if A had told you that she suffered from anxiety, or scoliosis, or migraines, or any other kind of illness, whether mental or physical, i'm willing to bet money that the person who was eavesdropping on you wouldn't have said anything (because what's the fucking point other than to gossip or try and get you in trouble?)  taking it to the supervisor was absurd and unkind, period. they shouldn't have been listening in on your conversation in the first place? there are ways to zone out from background noise/colleague conversations and just get on with your own work.  if you had been distracting this colleague, then all they needed to do was say 'hey guys, i'm sorry but i'm really trying to concentrate on this thing, could you keep it down a lil?' and no harm would have been done.   you did nothing wrong, A did nothing wrong, and i'm sure your supervisor just thinks that the person who ratted on you is a whiny pissbaby with nothing better to do with their time.  i'm sure it was less about them feeling 'uncomfortable' and more that they just wanted to get your wrists smacked for talking on the job (which everyone in a fucking office does - there is such a thing as multitasking).   of course, i could be WAY off mark and they might be a saintly person who was filled from their head to their toes with genuine concern for the both of you and felt the burning urge to 'report' it.   but i doubt it. if you had been saying 'oh yeah i just want to die all the time' then sure, that would have been understandable. but i'm sure you and A were just talking about ED stuff like you mentioned - pre workout and exercise and feeling cold all the time etc.   TL;DR the person who snitched on you is probably worthless and has nothing better to do with their lives than bring harm and worry to those around them. you did nothing wrong so please don't be upset, it's 100% not on you xxx",False,False
