Five days here since I weighed in at my new lowest-in-a-loooong-time weight &amp; now I'm somehow up almost 10 FLIPPIN LBS despite keeping my days consistently under 1000 &amp; working 80 hours a week on my feet?! What gives, body??   I want to buy a new scale, but I'm terrified it's right. Maybe we're due for a juice cleanse? I'm hoping a few days of green smoothies loaded with fiber might be exactly what I need to get on track.... (Plus feeling like I'm doing something ""kind"" to my body usually helps me feel less crappy about the gain, maybe it could help you in the same way?)  Either way.... I'm so sorry we're both in a boat no one wants to be in. Fingers crossed for yours being a scale malfunction, or even better, a weird pre-whoosh blip. ðŸ’œ",False,False
