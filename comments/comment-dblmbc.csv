Eating disorders have a STRONG genetic component.   If I hadn’t sat through the eating disorders segment in health class and started starving myself, I would have seen a movie, heard about it from a friend, or, yes, googled thinspo. It wasn’t my fault and it isn’t your fault either.   I think I was around your age when mine developed too and I was pretty sick for a long time. But!! I’m actually 32 now! I grew up and made it! Now - I’m not “cured”, I still have phases where I relapse (hi, here I am rn) but I have a great job and a whole entire life. And yours is there for you too!  When I finally opened up to my GP last year about my past history and asked her about damage, she was so positive about how the body can regenerate. I have a couple things left over but nothing too serious.   All of this is just to say - recovery is FUCKING hard, never fun, but it can save your life. And life is long and takes you the strangest places. Your life is not over because of this. It may be something you carry with you, off and on, but it doesn’t have to be the defining aspect of your life.   Sorry, this all probably sounds pretty cheesy, it’s just... idk I really think we all DO deserve to be happy. People like us who go through his stuff are tough - we have a lot of fight left in us.",False,False

Well, basically, people who get eating disorders have a predesposition to it. Don't blame yourself, if you hadn't gotten it then because of thinspo, it would find another way. It's not your fault honey.",False,False
