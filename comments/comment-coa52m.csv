Which is quite sad because it reduces their lifespan and quality of life, and a very large proportion of cats and dogs(even wild animals like tigers owned by private owners that shouldn't have them) in America are. It's negligent.",False,False

Like... Sometimes I'm too fuckin depressed to get out of bed but if I'm home alone, I know I have to get up and feed my animals at least because just because I'm miserable shouldn't mean they don't get to eat their breakfast at the time they always eat breakfast... Or if we're out of pet food I immediately stop what I'm doing to go out and buy more because I hate the thought of them going hungry, when they have to wait and they just meow or whine because they're hungry and they need their food I feel awful and I wish I could see it that way for myself??? Sorry this is... Probably not that related of a ramble comment....",False,False
