I have the same mantra with my exercise. My 5km daily run that I do has exploded to a 15km run just because I can do better every time. I‚Äôm now up to about 100km a week, almost every run I try and go an extra 100m just because what I did last time is not good enough.   I‚Äôm a bit worried about what will happen when I get to an UW BMI.",False,False

I‚Äôm nowhere near UW, my BMI is the exact midpoint of healthy but it started out cutesy like oh I‚Äôm just dieting to be healthier to get a bikini bod (like, seriously? fuck off) but it‚Äôs gotten to the point where I‚Äôm not studying because I‚Äôm obsessively googling calories in every little thing and freaking out if I go one calorie over my budget for the day, and trying so so so hard from holding myself back from a binge every fucking second. My grades were the worst they‚Äôve ever been last semester and I‚Äôm in med school which is super fucking hilarous. Imagine getting triggered in cadaver lab by your cadaver üòÇüòÇ",False,False

I remember my boss came back from a big meeting with all higher up people and she brought us back cookies and grabbed a vegan one for me since I‚Äôm vegan. I took a bite in front of her and held that bite in my mouth for like 10 min till I could go to the bathroom and spit out the cookie and throw away the rest.    I would have never thought that a damn cookie would be such an ordeal but look at me now!,False,False

I went to the grocery store and bought some of my favorite safe foods (all liquids but it‚Äôs whatever) as self care because today was just so tough to exist through. The fact that we gotta put up with life AND having an eating disorder at the same time is really wild. Sometimes I just want to say ‚ÄúI have an ED, I‚Äôm having a rough day, please leave me the fuck alone.‚Äù If I wasn‚Äôt in a relationship before this all started getting bad I definitely wouldn‚Äôt get into one. My boyfriend is wonderful, knows about my struggles, and is really supportive in the most respectful &amp; wholesome way but these days it feels like I can‚Äôt put the proper effort into being with him because all I care about is scale. food. body check. water. tea. purge. supplements. caffeine.",False,True

One damn cookie. It‚Äôs like my ED keeps coming up with new rules for me to follow and I have to learn them as I go.,False,True
