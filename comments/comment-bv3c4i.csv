Any time I have a recovery attempt I can easily gain up to 20 pounds of food weight and water that starts falling off just as quickly as it was put on as soon as I start any sort of restriction again. Restriction makes your digestion a lot slower and things tend to sit around in you for longer than usual.  That being said, you’ve got this! Your body knows what it needs and I’m sure you look fantastic, I suggest not weighing yourself at all if you’re trying to recover, as hard as that is :/ I believe in u OP",False,False
