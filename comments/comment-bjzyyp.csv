Right now I'm undergoing training my body for a method of purging that is unheard of in Western countries and really freaking dangerous. That being said, laxatives are the ONE thing I will never touch.   I got to my low the other week, and I took ONE laxative after my binge just because I'm often in a lot of pain/constipation after a binge..but it didn't affect me aside from gas, and isn't that how most people use them anyway?  Vomiting at least makes sense because you literally won't absorb from anything you get up (Calories don't magically just get absorbed through water or whatever), but laxatives literally ruin your body even more for literally no reason.   They stimulate the nerves in the large intestine. Calories are absorbed in your small intestine. You do the anatomy lol",False,False

Your body digests everything as it passes through your body, Laxatives just help get rid of what's already been digested. The way used energy is expelled from your body is through your breath. Energy is stored as carbon, carbon is burned alongside oxygen, then your blood collects the leftover carbon dioxide and removes it. I haven't thought about it before, but it's actually one of the first things young students are taught about human biology. Kids obviously don't have the reasoning abilities to deduce that this is how you lose weight, but it's kind of amazing that none of us think about this enough to realize it until somebody points it out. I mean, it's so easy to just assume that burned energy is removed as digestive waste since energy enters your body through the digestive system.",False,False

Went thru a brief stint where I was abusing lax &amp; diuretics. Went into treatment gained 9 pounds in a week. All my clothes pretty much fit the same it was just dehydration. Absolutely useless. Was so pissed I never went back to lax/diuretics again ðŸ˜…,False,False
