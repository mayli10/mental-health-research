You're 24 years old, you don't need a babysitter to make sure you take care of yourself. Nobody can really expect you to only eat when other people are around. That would actually be detrimental to your recovery. The fact that she would even accuse you of lying is harmful to you. It's very rude of her to just assume you don't really want to recover and that you're going to lie to your own family to avoid it.",False,False
