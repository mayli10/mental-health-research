Taking change lying around to buy full family sized bags of chips. Making extra sandwiches to eat at night after everyone else went to bed. :( That's definitely when it started for me.   Actually, even before that, I'd binge by eating my whole lunch in 5 minutes on my walk to school, right after breakfast. Then other times I wouldn't bring a lunch at all. I was fucked up all along haha.",False,False

Then I would go on to have a couple of pieces of bread with butter and some cereal. All of that before dinner and some late night snacks.   I have no idea why but I thought this was the most normal thing ever lol. I remember my mum taking me to a doctor to get my blood tested because she had no idea how I was gaining so much weight for the amount of food she thought I was eating.",False,False
