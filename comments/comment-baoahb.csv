Even with broth or juice or whatever.  I've heard the explanation that all the dead cells + air + stress + lack of enzymes is what causes the diarrhoea but yeah I'm not a poop scientist.   Hope you feel better soon! Make sure to drink lots of water and get your salt!,False,False

If you just eat normal food right away you usually have bathroom issues since your body isn't ready yet. Try to start with the broth or soup and then wait 2 to 3 hours before trying something sold. Then go for toast or something small. After another hour you should be good to go. I'd avoid fruit till the last part though.  Personally I just eat what ever and make sure I'm near a toilet for the rest of the night.ðŸ¤·,False,False
