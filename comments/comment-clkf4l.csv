Once you get to a weight you're happy with and are decent enough at eyeballing calories without having to meticulously count that's about the time you can cut the chord if you find it to be more of a burden than help. Enjoy your holidays, eat reasonably, step on the scale once a month.",False,False

Isnâ€™t this what disordered eating is though? Trying to suppress your bodyâ€™s natural set point by restriction and purging through bulimia or over exercising. I had to get that through my head that if I eat healthy and exercise Iâ€™d still be a bit heavier than my goal weight. I came to terms with it when I realized Iâ€™m not hungry, my mood and energy are good, and my brain is functioning way better. My mind has never been this clear in my anorexia years. Good luck with your journey ðŸ’«",False,False
