That being said, if she’s not responding, don’t bother anymore: she’s decided to move on from the situation. Don’t bother telling her anything: she won’t care. To her, the friendship is over. If you need to fet it out, write it down and burn it.   I depended on River (not their real name) a lot to talk to about certain things, and it hurt when I didn’t have that. I didn’t realize how much I had depended on them until they were gone.  My recovery wasn’t directly tied, but it helped a lot; I found other ways to cope (including seeing a professional), and I’m relearning to only rely on myself.  (Don’t do that. Haha)",False,False

Can I ask, do you feel like your progress with your depression is completely tangled up with your friendship? I'm really struggling to separate the two in my head - like, losing that friendship goes hand in hand with losing my recovery. It's such a dangerous situation ...  I'm sorry to ask you loads of questions, but do you think I should contact her one last time before I leave it? I'm torn between telling her honestly how I'm feeling, and just dropping it... Like I said in my post, the last thing I want to do is make her feel pressured into talking to me. I also feel guilty about the prospect of being hypocritical, considering that I distanced myself from her when things went south.   I really hope that you're continuing to move forward with your own recovery ❤️ and thank you so much again.",False,True

I wasn’t as close to her as you seem to be with Heather, but as she was the only friend who knew about my ED, it was difficult. So I don’t have much advice regarding the relationship, but on how to deal with relapsing :)  I’m still in recovery, but at times I do want to just stop and go back to how things were, especially when I was doing it on my own after my friend’s passing. I was diagnosed a long time ago but my mum, who was the only one who knew, thinks I am recovered. When I was getting close to relapsing when I began skipping meals and making excuses since it was easier to not have to explain myself to anyone. And I realised I needed to have someone who knew who would help me by holding me accountable, even just by showing concern. So I told another friend about, which was hard, but just knowing that there was someone who could see through my lies was enough to keep me on track.   My advice would be to please seek out a friend or even Alex to talk to, maybe not as in-depth about your ED as you would with Heather, but just small things that you can get off your chest. It’d be better than keeping it all inside and having it weigh you down till you relapse. It might sound a little cliche but hopefully knowing that I’ve experienced a similar situation will help, I really hope you stay on track ❤️",False,False

The friendship was over when she started acting sideways about your relationship—probably a little before that.   It’s difficult losing someone who has been instrumental in your recovery. Everything hurts all the time and you just want to relapse and stop trying because it doesn’t feel worth it. You lost a friend and a part of your support network.   But you have Alex. You still have a support network. Expand that network.   It’s okay to be hurt and to feel the way you’re feeling. I had a similar thing happen right before the new year and I’m struggling to decide if I want to let them (they’re an enby like me) back in. They were instrumental in me getting help for my depression, and to have that gone...yeah.   If she reaches out later and tries to apologize, let her apologize. But things won’t go back to the way they were. They just won’t. This distance is probably going to be the new normal for a while. ",False,False
