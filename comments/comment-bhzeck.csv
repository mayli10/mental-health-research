And then literally as soon as I was in the ‚Äúhealthy‚Äù BMI range my body wasn‚Äôt having it anymore. I‚Äôm very grateful that I was able to restrict as long as I did tbh because I lost a lot of weight, but that phase of weight loss is over now apparently and it‚Äôs time for the slow and steady grind, and some muscle building.   I‚Äôm still a mess if I‚Äôm being honest, I ate a single Neapolitan trader joe Oreo cookie and am reworking my whole day of calories to stay under 1300 nowüòì but at least I don‚Äôt feel like binging! Feels better than having no energy and being ravenous",False,True

I've found the exact same thing in trying to deal with my BED: low restricting lasts for maybe 2 or 3 weeks and then I binge for 2 weeks straight, but eating regular meals and consuming 1200-1400 calories a day has meant I haven't binged in about a month!",False,False
