PHP was 8 hours so IOP was 4. We came halfway into their day and had group and snack and dinner. PHP already had a snack and lunch and is expected to have breakfast and another snack sometimes at home. Therefore, PHP was just two back to back IOP sessions every day. In IOP we would usually have 2 group therapies: a talk/ learning one and then an experiential one. So like we might have snack then nutrition group then dinner then art therapy then leave. You're also given personal appointments which they tried to schedule before the start of your day's sessions. These could be family or individual therapy or nutrition or psychiatry. In all, I think the most helpful thing was having meals there to get feedback on what I was eating and how I should process",False,False

I was there from 7 am to 7 pm, and I only saw a therapist for 30 min twice a week, a nutritionist once every other week for 10 minutes, and a psychiatrist for 10 min once a week.   If you want treatment from professionals instead of being babysat by a nurse then it would be better to see what's the max number of times that your health insurance will let you see each person of your treatment team during a week without being hospitalized. With most insurances after you reach a certain point like 2k in copayments you no longer have a copayment and insurance covers everything. There's also sliding scale payments, which means your copayment depends on income levels and doesn't involve insurance. ",False,False

It adds up fast. However you can try to work with your insurance to get them to cover it as medically necessary treatment. If there are multiple places around, you can try to compare prices. If your dad says he can afford it, I would take him at his word and not think about it. It's hard to justify in ED logic having time and money spent on you",False,False
