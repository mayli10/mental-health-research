I haven’t actually tried that, but I do have a packet in my cupboard from back when I was vegan so I might have a go, thank you ♥️ I’m just all panicky about the entire concept right now 😅",False,True

I've always been allergic to eggs so I've never eaten many but from what I've heard the justegg vegan egg replacer tastes just like scrambled eggs. I have a huge meat phobia cause of my arfid so I wont even fake meat but if this isnt the case for you I reccomend looking into it. please stay safe friend &lt;3,False,False
