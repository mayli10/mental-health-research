I usually just back out and find another site that can get to the point. I also hate when people leave comments about how they can’t wait to try it or how good it looks and then never comment about having actually tried it and how it turned out. The blogger clearly said drop a comment and tell me how it turned out not drop a long comment stating how you can’t wait to make it for your annoying little shits bake sale at school.,False,False
