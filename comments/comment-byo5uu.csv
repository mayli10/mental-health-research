My dad was totally addicted to mt dew and when he stopped drinking it he lost 40 pounds in like 6 months. Now he drinks Pepsi and complains about getting fat lol. I try to point out to him (in a kind way) when he is adding extra calories he doesnt need cause he is genuinely trying to lose weight but is getting frustrated. He blamed it on a lack of testosterone that comes with aging, lol.  I blame it on his relationship with his girlfriend, they love to cook food together but then they eat too much  Anyways, gotta love em",False,False
