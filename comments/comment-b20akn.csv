I can binge without purging, but once my stomach reaches a certain point of fullness, I *have* to purge or I'll feel awful and usually end up throwing up unintentionally. It's better for me to have small binges that don't make me want to purge than to plan a huge binge day when I'll inevitably end up purging.  Congrats on not purging! I totally get what you said about not feeling as crazy; for me, it's so refreshing to feel like food isn't controlling my life the way it usually does. I'm also so happy that you're gaining but feeling okay about it! That's awesome!",False,False
