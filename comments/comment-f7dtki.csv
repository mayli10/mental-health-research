I'm at a normal weight and i still have obsessive thoughts sometimes, but i'm an adult now and it got to the point where i was like ""who am i really doing this for?"" in my situation, the behaviors were a direct response to ongoing trauma, and once i removed myself from the situation, i slowly got better. i don't do anything gross anymore like sleep eating or eating out of the trash or stealing food just to throw it up. that was a very dark place for me and I'm glad it's over.",False,False

I would wake up with an empty cereal box next to me, or surrounded by granola bar wrappers.",False,False
