I'd happily hand the carton to a customer if asked and most would (you could just claim its allergies or something) --- people have asked for much stranger/more annoying things.    At starbucks, most base drinks (latte, cappuccino, americano) all come just espresso and whatever ratio of milk, whereas the flavored drinks are all sugary syrup to avoid.  At other shops it can be different, but you can always double check or say unsweetened/no syrup to be sure.  A typical tea latte is just tea and steamed milk, although starbucks adds vanilla syrup to their london fog and the chai latte is a sweetened concentrate.  I would assume any flavored tea latte has syrup, but the basic recipe is 1/2 tea steeped in hot water and then 1/2 steamed milk.  Starbucks specific:  \- If you want a flavored drink, skinny syrups have 0-5cal/pump (you can specify the number of pumps if you ask, but for hot drinks it's 2 in a small, 3 medium, 4 large), and skinny mocha sauce is 10 cal/pump but much thicker and more like chocolate sauce.  \- Egg bites are good for the cals, but expensive.  Oatmeal is also not bad and all mix-ins come on the side. You can also find snacks sitting outside on shelves for less than any of the sandwiches/pastries on the menu  Other shops:  \- From what I know, most places don't have as strict of a measuring system as Starbucks, but most places will customize your order to almost anything.  \- Pastries are at least 300-500 cal  \- They sometimes change up the milks (owners will buy whatever is cheapest sometimes) so definitely ask.  &amp;#x200B;  Don't be nervous to ask for anything! I know it's intimidating and just saying that doesn't change it, but it will hopefully put you more at ease in the long run, most baristas are happy to answer questions/customize.",False,False

I honestly don‚Äôt eat any of it out of pure fear. Especially the breakfast sandwiches. So sorry to burst that bubble..... the loaves and cake pops are some of my biggest fear foods.   Drinks on the other hand!   I am in love with our fruit infusion teas. They‚Äôre an herbal tea you can add to the regular iced tea. Comes in strawberry, peach citrus and pineapple. They‚Äôre sugar/calorie free and so tasty. I usually do white tea with the pineapple tea infusion. Just make sure to ask for it unsweetened!!!   I‚Äôm also a big proponent of shots of espresso over ice. I love a blonde doppio [light espresso double shot =more caffeine not very expensive compared to other Starbucks drinks] pulled long [long shots means more water pulled through the same amount of coffee to make a watery shot that‚Äôs still very strong] over ice in a  grande cup with extra ice. Then I usually dump cinnamon all into it. No sugar, no milk but a very strong coffee that‚Äôll get ya going.   Starbucks also does three sugar free syrups- vanilla, cinnamon dolce and mocha. I personally don‚Äôt consume artificial sweeteners but if you‚Äôre into it then totally give it a go! ",False,False

Anyway, I also agree that a regular coffee is best. Try a pour over. For this time of year look out for Kenyans, Rwandans and those from Burundi. Ethiopians will come around in May.

A pump is about 10 mL. I worked for a long time at a family-owned milk tea shop and once calculated the calories for the brown sugar simple syrup we made, and it came out pretty cleanly to 20 per 10 mL, which seems consistent with nutrition info I see on big chains.  On that tea latte‚ÄîI think you might just have to ask them, I've seen places that steep the tea in milk and others that will use a strong brewed tea first.
