My sponsor keeps telling me not to focus on weight loss and I now havent lost any weight in 6 months and I'm still so fat for my body shape. I'm 20lbs overweight. I cant see how any treatment facility would want for me to continue to be so fat, but they probably end up telling me not to focus on weight loss. I dont need treatment I need a fat camp.

Health complications from this disorder can happen at any bmi and the only way to repair it is to give the body excess calories. Weight restoration definitely does suck but according the dietician I worked with, she said the body focuses on building muscle first. (Which i totally believe because my body composition is way different post-treatment.) I think it’s totally possible for those in recovery to lose weight but if you never fix your relationship with food, you’re bound to end up back where you started.    *just my opinion! Please take with a grain a salt lol*",False,False
