Some can find the strength to leave an abusive relationship with seeing how others are horrified by behaviors that don‚Äôt seem that bad to them and I‚Äôm glad it can work for some people.   I was just sharing how for others these comments are sadly not enough (although I truly wish they were).,False,True

Not certain if this is accurate since I read it like, ages ago on Twitter, but I saw something that said it takes the average person *seven tries* to actually fully leave a *physically abusive relationship*, and by that same token I'd expect it to be even harder to leave a manipulative, emotionally and psychologically abusive one. Abuse fuuuucks up the way your brain works, especially since a huge part of many abusive relationships is the abusive partner isolating the other so that the person being abused doesn't have a support network or even friends outside of their partner. Hell, I was in one for three years and I only ever hung out with people my partner was friends with, and the only reason I ended up getting out of that relationship was cause I had to move 8 hours away. Abuse is some whack shit and while it's good that people call it out it always feels like there's some lowkey judgement in ""leave him"" comments, like ""obviously this is abusive and manipulative why are you still dating him"" like bruh that ain't how that shit works????",False,False

There‚Äôs a level of messiness that comes when two lives are intertwined (through shared finances, housing, and even social circles) that makes it not realistic to separate over every hurtful thing.

I do think wording the comments in a positive way is helpful and can show support.   Enabling is definitely an issue too. I would think that most people in abusive relationships are aware that something is not normal or healthy. Comments showing how the behavior is detrimental to that person can be a tremendous help to the victim, as it can provide reassurance that what is happenning is not love or healthy for them.   I just feel that comments on abusive situations should be worded carefully and provide support instead of only saying just leave him.",False,True

We never know the full story and people in abusive relationships can be dependent on their partner for financial reasons or have a living situation, kids and even religion that makes them feel like they can‚Äôt leave.

Abusive relationships work in a way where the abuser has a tremendous control over their partner and use gaslighting, stonewalling and other tactics to maintain the low self-esteem their partner feels.

I know everyone wants the best for each other in our community.  I just think that comments that are worded towards reminding people that they are worthy and should not accept being treated that way becauae it‚Äôs not a healthy behavior are more helpful than just commenting ‚Äúdump him!‚Äù without providing any further insight on the situation.   I feel like saying to just dump someone is portraying the problem in a very simplistic manner just like the ‚Äújust eat‚Äù comment do.

Especially since this subreddit has people here as young as early high school and others in their 40s and up and theres a good chance a lot of these people are dating boys that could be very emotionally underdeveloped and insensitive as a result. Theres so much nuance to it you cant completely know if its a 20 year old guy who is great but says things that are triggering their partner needs to have a talk with them about and if it goes well then great and if he wont accept this information and be supportive than its time to kick him to the curb. Compared to a 14 year old dating another 14 year old and he made rude comments to her and doesnt want to apologize. To a genuine emotionally and possibly physically emotionally abusive relationship.  Its hard to just tell someone whos being abused to just leave them since its such a huge process for someone. Especially if theyre married and or have a huge history. Knowing the whole story is important but we cant get that usually from rant/rave posts on here. I personally cant enter a relationship because of my ED and self worth issues and I imagine many other people here feel they cant leave relationships bc of the self worth issues tied up with their ED.   I hope everyone reading this is having a good day and I wish you all the best in your relationships and disentangling yourself from the mess of abuse if you're suffering from it right now.,False,False

We‚Äôre probably all in an abusive relationship here, not necessarily with another human but with a part of our mind. Substitute ED for partner if you‚Äôre having trouble empathizing/understanding. That said, the comments are generally coming from the right place, ideally we should all leave abusive situations and it can take many people telling us that over and over for it to sink in and spur action. But like recovery, leaving an abusive partner can require many careful and difficult steps, and it‚Äôs fucking frightening.  If you‚Äôre reading this and feel like you‚Äôre in an abusive relationship: my heart goes out to ya. You‚Äôre still amazing and strong and worthy of love and life.
