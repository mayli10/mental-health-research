I can't do rough sex anymore because I realized it just made everything a punishment way easier,False,False

I‚Äôve definitely struggled even pre-ED with feeling like my only value is sex-related. but I think he‚Äôs a good guy and maybe it even bothers me more than him. I obviously didn‚Äôt tell him about all my issues but I did say I‚Äôve been sick lately and because of that even though I really want to have sex my body doesn‚Äôt want to - which is true, my hormone levels are abysmal - and he was really sweet about it.",False,True

You're a person to be loved, not just a person to have sex with.  it's not the end of the world. worst case scenario, it might mean that you and your guy need different stuff in a relationship and that's okay. best case scenario, you can talk this out and get support and feel a whole lot better in your skin. it's definitely worth a try. &lt;3",False,False

Admittedly I've never done it but tbh I honestly at this moment in time don't ever see myself doing it, I'd just spend the whole time thinking shit like ""omg I bet this angle makes me look fat"". And I literally have no sex drive anyway due to restriction so it doesn't really bother me. I'm 18, I get a lot of interest off guys but I'm just not interested in it and would not feel comfortable doing it no matter what I weigh, ive never even dated eitherüòÇ But it honestly doesn't bother me, part of me wonders if I might be asexual?? But again it could just be the restriction combined with body image issues...",False,False

I also have a miriad of other mental health issues which make it a nightmare for other reasons but for sure my ED is a huge contributor to it. Like I can't take myself out of the uncomfortableness of the situation to actually enjoy the experience, I'm just worrying about how I look. It doesn't help that restricting takes away my libido (as I'm sure it does for other people too). I've basically given up on sex or dating at all for now since I don't enjoy any of it while I'm this deep into mental health stuff ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è",False,False
