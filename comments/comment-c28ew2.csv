Not sure what the reason is that you‚Äôre ‚Äúnot really interested in recovery...‚Äù but if you ever were able to become health-restored it would probably do a lot to help the people in your life stop having a negative view of veganism, and maybe encourage them to try it :)   Would you say the only positive impact of veganism on your ED is exploring new food, or do you mean that it helped you have a more positive attitude towards food?",False,False

Like I said, my health issues stem from my ED even if they get misappropriated to my veganism. I‚Äôm complaining about a problem of perception, not practice.   I also find that veganism had an opposite effect on my eating in terms of being inherently ‚Äúrestrictive,‚Äù as it forced me to actually learn how to cook and try new things, so that I could have varied and healthy diet. I really consider my veganism a net positive on my relationship to myself and to food (and definitely to the animals/the environment), and while I‚Äôm not going to make a judgement on whether others can/should be vegan with an ED/while in recovery, this is a long term life decision for me personally.",False,True

Taking care of your own health doesn't mean you have to live an unethical lifestyle -- there are many other ways you can promote ethical treatment of animals! (Or whatever you're choosing ethical veganism for!) You can probably do so more effectively if you are healthy, too.  **Doesn't take a rocket scientist to see the correlation between veganism and people with pre-disposed restrictive ED's...**",False,False
