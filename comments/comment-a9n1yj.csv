I’m not sure if you’re talking about a general medical doctor or a psychiatrist, but either way, it’s their responsibility to take care of your wellbeing. And if you leave every appointment feeling worse than when you came in, they aren’t achieving that.  Different doctors do have different professional personalities though. Some are more gentle and casual while some are more cold and stern. It should never translate to yelling though. If you feel comfortable, voice your concerns and let them know you’d like a softer approach. If you have a loved one you trust, perhaps ask them to come with you for some appointments. It sucks, but some doctors will suddenly find their manners when there’s a third party to hold them responsible.  If talking to them doesn’t work, or they’re being outright mean, find a new provider.

That attitude is not going to help you get better. Is this an ED specialist? Do you feel comfortable telling the doctor how you feel? Can you see someone else? To reiterate, you deserve better.
