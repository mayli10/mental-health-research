I fear dressings too even though before I got the way I did I would hardly take it but nowadays the bottle or pack can stay far far away from me.  It looks like your reddit broke in your post though because it got multiposted,False,False

Eds are so competitive your behaviors could be spurring that nature in her so i think shes probably at risk. You dont have to open up your whole heart but maybe have a conversation about your struggled with disordered eating and how you started seeing that behavior in her?,False,False

My orthorexia was at a high &amp; consequently I would always compulsively order the healthiest “safest” thing I could at restaurants. My friend started ordering the same things as me &amp; would ask me why I would separate &amp; disect my food in a weird manor. For example,  I would eat a salad but without the dressing. Obviously I was too ashamed to say “because dressings scare me &amp; I have no idea what’s in them, much less the calorie count.”  One time I even separated all the spinach leaves from my salad because I was afraid of oxalates.

Tell her you have some concerns and ask if she wouldn't mind talking about it, stress that there's no pressure on her end to discuss anything she's uncomfortable with. Idk what she knows about you and your ED, so I say use your judgement about when, if at all, to bring it up.  It may be nothing at all, it may be something. In the event she brushes you off, says she's just stressed and lost her appetite or whatever, make it known that if she ever wants to reach out to someone, she can do so with you. Maybe down the line, if she is in the early stages of an ED, she'll come clean. Establishing a safe and supportive space is essential for such sensitive topics to be discussed.  But remember in all this, to take care of yourself first and foremost. If the friendship makes your mental health worse, either because you're worried about her, or you unwillingly become competitive with her, to take a step back and set necessary boundaries.",False,False
