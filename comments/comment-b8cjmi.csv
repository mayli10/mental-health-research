My friend asked me to go for lunch the other day and I had the plan of just getting a small order of yam tempura (still an indulgence but a small amount with nothing else). But as soon as we were actually out and hanging out, I smelled this other BBQ restaurant and got hit with a massive binge urge. So we went to a different restaurant instead of the sushi place and I got a massive order of double-dusted wings smothered in sauce -.- also a full cal Dr Pepper cause they didnâ€™t have diet and I love Dr Pepper too much -.- lol    Not the first time this general scenario has happened.",False,False

Better just eat fucking everything then!"" And then I'll go home and eat half a pack of Oreos. Rip. Even when i try to just have a drink at the restaurant. And usually I don't even like to eat in front of other people but when I'm in binge mode i just cant seem to care.",False,False

Sheâ€™s been gone for a week and the binge just ended yesterday.",False,False
