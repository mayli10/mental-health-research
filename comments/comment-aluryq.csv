Eating normally is foreign to those suffering, it's like the body forgets how to ask and receive for food anymore it's really fucked up. If you're in a stable enough place right now to just go back to eating normally I so strongly urge you to do it, it will save you so much pain in the long run. If not, I still urge you to get help, it's so much harder down the road",False,False

This question isn't super straight forward because a lot of things are actually going on. A sub like loseit or fitness will probably have good info on their side bars, as we are not actually a weight loss sub.  If you were 5'5"" 200lbs and senditary (like an office job, student etc) your tdee (calories needed to maintain 200lbs at that hight) would be 2,014.   Then say you go on a diet and choose a 500 calorie deficit (about a 1lb a week loss rate) 1514 calories a day. No added exercise.   If you lost weigbt to 130lbs your tdee would decrease to 1,633. This is simply because you are no longer feeding yourself to maintain that 200lbs. Less mass needs less fuel.  So now if you are still eating 1514 you are very close to the amount you need to maintain and you will notice your weight loss stop or stall (this will probably happen sooner and the 1lb a week will be .5lb then 1/4lb etc) If you went back to eating 2014 then you would start gaining again.  A lot of this is the reason people often say it is a *life style change* and not a diet.   **I am not in anyway saying eds are lifestyles. I am refering only to the act of dieting in the classic sense. Eds are not lifestyles OR diets and I do not want anyone conflating the two.**",False,False
