I'm really sorry this happened to you specially on a good day. Totally agree, people should never comment on other's food unless they're really close friends.",False,False

YOU WOULD THINK THAT THE SOCIAL JUSTICE POLITICALLY CORRECT FEMINIST THAT YOU ARE WOULD HAVE A FUCKING FILTER FOR NOT JUST RANDOMLY CALLING OUT WHAT COULD BE A LEGITIMATE AND DEADLY MENTAL AND PHYSICAL HEALTH CONCERN FOR MYSELF AND POTENTIALLY OTHER PEOPLE AT THE TABLE. YOU ATTENTION SEEKING, MEAN GIRLS STYLE FUCKING CUNT.   Not that I’m still mad about this. I don’t hold grudges typically and I don’t even work there anymore but I still fucking hate that bitch.   Edit: To make the hate worse: Shes in her mid 30s, the rest of us were in our mid 20s, and she clearly has issues with binge eating (which, as someone who has struggled with that in the past, is a very legitimate issue) but she cannot stop herself from commenting on any woman losing weight or eating anything less than her massive fucking plate of a burger and chicken strips and smothered fries and 4 beers for lunch. FUCK I HATE HER.  Edit 2: just thinking about her has me not wanting to eat all day. Fuck you Emma.",False,False

Separate to your own ED or bread being a fear food for you. Someone should never be so impersonal as to invade your personal space and request validation. When you are obviously working and listening to something.   I see it in my workplace. I think people try to apply some sort of control or dominance through food. Especially with colleagues who are parents. A kind of over domineering figure. Like a parent or older sibling.  If I can share, I would say I don’t like eating. Food is not a pleasure I enjoy. I don’t like expensive restaurants. I don’t like cooking or baking shows. I distance myself from it. In work when colleagues ask my opinion. I do my best to distance myself from it. Yet they probe for answers. Comment on my eating habits &amp; sometimes compare it to their children.   I made my life choices and within my life choices is food. I respect your choices. Respect mine.   Sorry to hear this happened and I hope your yoga brings a little enjoyment at the end of the day. You have a good night sleep.",False,False
