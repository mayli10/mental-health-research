It played havoc with my ED.   1) Sponsored fasts for charity. We were encouraged to sign up to not eat anything for 24 hours at a time and have people donate to charity in our name.   2) Forty days and forty nights???? Challenge accepted!   3) Lent: some foods are ‚Äúbad‚Äù and you should give those up to achieve virtue.   4) FoOd RuLeS: no fish on Friday. No eating before Mass. No chocolate or candy or sugar during Lent.   5) Cleansing and purification. Need I elaborate?,False,False

On top of the food anxiety and people pleasing and stuff I‚Äôm also terrified that my ‚Äòchoice‚Äô to have an ED is actively going against who God says I am therefor I‚Äôm going to hell (i know it‚Äôs not a choice but my anxiety says WHAT IF IT IS AND YOURE JUST FAILING)  On the other hand, it is often the only thing keeping me alive and giving me hope and helping me see good things and blessings in the world",False,False
