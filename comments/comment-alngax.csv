We talked about it and it turns out she has been having these problems for a little while. I think I convinced her to check into the ED unit at the hospital, but idk if she did that. She hasn't texted me at all yet today and it's already 6:30 PM. Usually we talk everyday. So whether she went or not it really doesn't seem like that goal is going to work out. I hope she did check in. I know it's awful, but she's been saying she wants to recover and it's important that her heart gets better first so she can focus on other parts of her health. I hope she's not mad at me.",False,False
