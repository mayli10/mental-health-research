Because I'd KILL to be able to do high restriction and I'm as short as you, but upping my calories also ups my appetite as much and I feel like with anything other 1000, 1200 I just don't lose, and if I do, it's like a pound a month - I can't afford that since I'm so chubby now (thanks to binging, thanks to low restriction and fasting - see that stupid logic of mine?) that I can't wait a few years :(",False,False

This made me believe that actually restricting had to be an extremely low number of calories.  When I went through my worst phase of restriction, I was eating like you. 12-1700 a day. The difference was that I was an adult and my daily life activities were completely different and the foods I ate were completely different. I managed to get to my LW at this high restriction level. I maintained being underweight eating that much. If your body is using that many calories and still maintaining being underweight, then you could easily still be diagnosed with anorexia.",False,False
