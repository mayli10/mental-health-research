You need 110 ml per 100g of gluten, so you'll get a bit extra. Add half and mix, then add the rest and weave the dough with the headset and you will release the excess that you can pour into the water to boil.  &amp;#x200B;  The water to boil: chop roughly 1 onion and a few cloves of garlic, perhaps a little celery. Add 1 tablespoon of salt and when it is boiling add the seitan in a softly. Leave to simmer (not boiling) 45mim to 1 hour.  &amp;#x200B;  Then you can roast/broil it in the oven or fry it until it is crispy on the outside. I like it with saut√©ed vegetables and mashed potatoes.  &amp;#x200B;  \*If you prefer not to use powdered broth or cubes, you can use the water where you boiled vegetables instead of water in the liquid ingredients.  \*\* you can add other spices of your liking, such as pepper, chili, liquid smoke, or change the vegetable broth to mushroom broth or no-beef stock. And if you are missing one of the listed, do not worry, it will come good anyway.",False,False

So!  If you want all hens to be your flock, you have to hatch eggs first. Roughly half of those will hatch into hens (pullets) but the other half will be male (cockerels). The hens go off to be layers (or raised as broilers and holy fuck THAT is a horrible life they are bred to get so big so fast they are miserable).   The males? God I don‚Äôt even want to say it. I have backyard chickens and I adore the roosters so much :( they get ‚Äúdispatched‚Äù. They die in a horrible way, I can‚Äôt even say it but you can look it up.   Okay long rant almost done!! The industry around eggs is almost always cruel. The exception can be if you get your own hatching eggs, and raise all the birds in your flock regardless of male or female (you can buy sexed chicks from a hatchery but that still involves the males being killed). But if you do have a backyard flock like that, it is a gorgeous wonderful and symbiotic thing to see! My family does this and the birds all have names and go to the vet and when they die of old age they get formal funerals and burials.   TL;DR: Eating eggs is not inherently cruel, but humans manage to mess shit up :( This is my pet issue, sorry for going on so long, and thank you for coming to my TED talk.",False,False

For some reason eggs are just so hard to mimic and they fill that niche position of high protein and low cal. If you have extra cash to spend (and if it‚Äôs available in your area) the Just Egg is a really good substitute for scrambled eggs. I think the calories are pretty darn similar too. It‚Äôs hella expensive though so I wouldn‚Äôt go for it unless you have extra cash to spend.  Another good alternative is tofu. It‚Äôs way cheaper (I can get it for like a few bucks per each block where I‚Äôm at) and you can get 2-3 servings from each block of tofu depending on how much you like to eat at once. You could even make tofu scramble for some eggy flavor. I love tofu and it‚Äôs pretty low cal and very very filling. It‚Äôs also low carb I think unless you put bbq sauce on it or something.   Also if you do decide to eat eggs, that doesn‚Äôt make you a bad person. You have an illness, and sometimes illnesses make us act out, or we have to act in ways that we wouldn‚Äôt normally in order to heal ourselves a bit. Eating a few eggs doesn‚Äôt undo all the good that you‚Äôve done.",False,False
