But this comment has been in my thoughts and I think it is just so so important. I wish every parent going through this could read it.  Since having a child I definitely have like.. less *time* to think about how my body looks. It has without a doubt become overall less important, but I still find myself in this selfish and overly conscientious bubble.  My child is only 18 months so all of these things are important to anticipate as they mature emotionally. What a refreshing read. Thank you so much for your reply. I can't imagine doing this as a single parent. You sound like an amazing mom.",False,True

I'll answer your side question.    I pretty much restrict Monday - Friday and eat just below maintenance on weekends. I usually just bring some veg to snack on at work and then have a big dinner with family. End up eating 1000ish a day. Around 1500 on weekends. Weight loss is slow, but it's happening. I can't take care of my toddler when I'm starving. I don't really feel like I belong here because my deficit is kinda in a healthy range, but my thoughts definitely aren't.   I'm also still breastfeeding, which helps with the deficit, and so far, my supply hasn't been hurt.   Honestly, I'm not 15 anymore, obsessed with losing 10 lbs ASAP. I don't freak out over weight fluctuations. I understand my body, my urges, tendencies. And instead of fighting it, eating as little as possible and dealing with the negative side effects, I'm trying to work with it. I'm much more content with the way things are going now. And it's about as healthy as I'll allow myself to be at the moment.",False,False

I couldn't be light-headed in the car. I had to be alert and aware in the event of emergencies (single mom so it's all me). I couldn't be picky about food and transfer these anxieties to her.   It was hard. So yes, to answer your question, yes. The difficulty snapped me into the reality that my life isn't about me anymore, and this illness can make one so self involved and selfish and in a bubble, and it was time for me to work on recovery, for her sake if not mine.  Plus, she didn't care how much I weighed or how little I could eat, she cared that I could play with her and laugh with her and make cupcakes with her and eat ice cream with her...as much as it was hard to admit, eating more made me feel better, happier, more energetic and more capable of love.",False,False
