Was supposed to be going on a date and I didnâ€™t sleep well so I had one just to keep me going for the day and I was planning on eating a big meal but it got cancelled, the coffee was my own fault I was just thirsty and fancied a coffee. Thank you for the advice but it really was just a one off thing and I have actually eaten now :)",False,True

Mixing that with energy drinks is a very bad idea. Energy drinks can cause heart palpitations and cause cardiac dysrhythmias. Be safe out there!   Smaller amounts of caffeine like coffee or small amounts of diet soda would be better.,False,False

A couple hours passed and getting something to eat was the only option because I was so ill, it was just a normal sandwich too not one of the low fat ones or anything so Iâ€™m proud of myself for doing the right thing and getting my body the nutrition it needed! :) I wish you the best of luck fighting your ED!",False,True
