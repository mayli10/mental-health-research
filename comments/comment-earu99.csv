If so, they probably could refer you to someone else - especially if they are seeing multiple patients that were seeing your dietician. Your dietician also might have something set up to transition her clients to other people that they would recommend. I think that that's something common with therapists, dont know if dieticians do this as well.  Sorry you're in this situation :( especially since it's so hard to find people to trust with ED stuff",False,False
