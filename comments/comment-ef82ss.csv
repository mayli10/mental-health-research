In terms of safe foods, can you pick one thing and have it one time this week? Do whatever you need to for decreasing anxiety - like if that fear food is peanut butter, buy a single-serving packet (if you're scared you'll binge, for instance). Plan an activity for after you eat the fear food, like a xword puzzle. Or can you commit to, say, 1000-1200 calories a day? The other thing that helps me is focusing on values - ""I might be afraid of this food but I value sitting down and eating dinner with my brother, so it's worth it to me to sit through the food anxiety"". Keep us updated.",False,False
