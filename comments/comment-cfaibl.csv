Never had a healthy body image but it's also very much about control. It's always either eat everything or restrict restrict restrict.,False,False
eubgcsq,t3_cfaibl,t3_cfaibl,DisturbedWeakness,1,2019-07-20 13:30:31,/r/EDAnonymous/comments/cfaibl/is_anyone_else_not_really_bothered_by_weight_or/eubgcsq/,Yeah. I control food. I find comfort in it. I take the comfort away. I am the boss of it. I can punish my body for existence. And I don't really need it to be a certain weight. I won't be happy with a thin body. I just need to be in control. (As if that will ever make me feel better.),False,False

I almost feel like my body doesn’t belong to me sometimes.,False,False
eu8vyj8,t3_cfaibl,t3_cfaibl,PM_ME_YER_SHIBA_INUS,1,2019-07-19 14:52:28,/r/EDAnonymous/comments/cfaibl/is_anyone_else_not_really_bothered_by_weight_or/eu8vyj8/,"I feel like there's significance in that relief from self-annihilation, and desire to disappear. It's about more than just control; it's about living through hell then trying to still want to exist in this world.  Sometimes it feels like what I end up with on a given day is decided by whether it feels like I need to fill a horrible hole, or disappear completely. There isn't enough food in the world to satisfy #1, and there isn't enough food avoidance in the world to satisfy #2.  Anger, too?  I don't have any sort of weight goal. But chasing calmness...I get that.  I hope you find peace.",False,False

I always feel weird in groups and such because my issues aren't really based on weight and body image (although it does play into it a bit), it's largely a control thing for me",False,False
eu8l41d,t3_cfaibl,t3_cfaibl,yamasukas,1,2019-07-19 13:00:36,/r/EDAnonymous/comments/cfaibl/is_anyone_else_not_really_bothered_by_weight_or/eu8l41d/,"Yeah, absolutely. I don't care all that much what I weigh compared to some people, but stress tends to set me off into old habits even if I'd been doing okay at the moment. I was doing fine for a while and then some stuff happened, so now I'm here stuffing as many fasts into my week as possible because I need to feel control over something. If I'm worried about this, I don't keep myself awake at night as much with all my other thoughts.",False,False
