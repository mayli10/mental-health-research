Eating disorders aren’t about food or your weight — not really — it’s about your mental state. Clearly you are suffering, that should be “sick enough” for you to get help. You don’t need your body to reflect your mental state before you get help. Please, you are so young and you don’t want to waste your life on this when you should be enjoying yourself.   I visited my grandma a month ago and she showed me old photographs of herself and my mom. My mom pointed to one of herself as a teenager and laughed about how ugly and fat she thought she was. Literally no one looking at that picture would have said either word to describe her. And my grandma said how no matter how you look, when you’re old and look back on yourself, you always think “wow I was so beautiful then, how could I think that about myself?” But when you’re old, you don’t miss your beauty as much as what your body used to do for you. You miss having energy and strength.   How is old you going to look back on herself when you give all your energy and strength to your eating disorder? You’ll be as frail as 65 yr old you within a few years if you keep this up.",False,False
