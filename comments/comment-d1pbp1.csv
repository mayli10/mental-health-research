So much pain in my stomach and I felt like trash. I don't recommend laxatives, they are a trap!",False,False

Since they were trying to convince me *not* to use lax, I figure that was probably pretty honest, so it's the assumption I've always gone with.",False,False
ezpceko,t3_d1pbp1,t3_d1pbp1,hammerprice,1,2019-09-09 09:04:06,/r/EDAnonymous/comments/d1pbp1/is_it_true_that_laxatives_dont_work/ezpceko/,"I think the reasoning for ""laxatives don't make you poop undigested food"" is that laxatives only work on food that is already in your lower bowel, not in your stomach. So, for food to be in your lower bowel and be affected by the laxative, it has to have already started a lot of the calorie-absorption process. It won't force food to move from your stomach pre-digestion to your intestines any faster or without absorbing.  I would suggest that if you are seeing undigested food in your stool it's not because of the laxatives but rather because of an underlying, existing digestive issue. So it's true that you may be passing undigested food through your system, (which may be absorbed differently,) but that's not caused by the laxatives. Since you mention purging, it's possible that purging for extended periods has interrupted your normal digestive behaviour because your intestines aren't used to processing food any more. Keep fighting and it will fix itself!",False,False
