I asked her what was her secret for such motivation, as myself can't be bothered to be social even once a week. She answered with the name of her very recently deceased best friend (meaning that her grieving doesn't let her be alone at any time).  I answered ""well your method did not work on me"".  I said that because I thought it was funny and my mouth did not wait for my brain to think it over. Thank god my friend thought it was hilarious...But I was still mortified.",False,False

I didn't say it THANK god but I was there for the awkwardness.  My boss has MS and is in a wheelchair and has been for a long time and will never walk again.  We were talking to an acquaintance and the woman said she was excited about an upcoming vacation because she doesn't want to wait until she's ""old and can't walk"" to travel. It didn't even register with me because it's such a common phrase and I'm so used to my boss being in a chair that its just a normal thing.  The woman immediately turned white and goes ""I MEAN YOU KNOW LIKE YOU DO A LOT OF STUFF...not being able to walk...but you know.....I mean...."" She was sooo mortified and we couldn't help but burst out laughing.   Sometimes we say shit without thinking but I think most people won't take it personally, even if they are a little hurt. I think your comment was a fairly innocuous and it's possible it didn't bother her at all :)",False,False

My best friend in high school attempted suicide. When she got out of the hospital we were joking around and she asked me what I would do if [insert horrible thing here I don't remember exactly what it was]. I responded ""I would probably kill myself"".....after she just got out of the hospital...  WHY. WHY THE FUCK WOULD I SAY THAT.  Instant regret. I just wasn't thinking. That moment still haunts me all the time lol",False,False
