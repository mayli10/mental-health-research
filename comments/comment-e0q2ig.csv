I can't bring myself to throw food out, if my parents were to make me dinner I'd have to eat it because I just can't throw it away. I have a problem even throwing away food that's expired. I just feel horrible doing it.",False,False

My mom forced me to finish my breakfast milk. But my child-stomach couldn't physically fit anymore inside of it. I insisted I was full. She forced me to chug it. then told me to brush my teeth. By the time i walked to the sink i projectile vomited milk all over the bathroom mirror. Then went to school.,False,False

I grew up with parents that forced me to finish my plate too and I struggle so much with not wasting any. I have to remind myself that the food would have ended up in the toilet and put my body anyways. That I shouldn't use my body as a trash receptacle and it's not worth becoming obese over finishing food to get rid of it. Ugh.,False,False

I refuse to throw food away so I feel like I need to binge them all to get rid of them fast, because keeping them for too long is just continuing the weight gain over several days/weeks instead of all in one or two days.
