Also even now on fatlogic you still get many people supporting the ""his BMI is high because he lots of muscles"" argument despite majority of men not being bodybuilders. There will also be a waterfall of comments from women saying ""I am skinny/fit but love big teddy guys! :D"" further boosting them. I am not saying anyone deserves mean comments, but the difference in reactions is disheartening.

I have a friend who  eats well, is extremely fit (trains like 6x a week) and has tons of muscle and is generally the picture of health, and she still has a bit of visible fat- which is healthy! Meanwhile I know I won't be happy until I'm very underweight and my bones are visible and all of these people on fatlogic are promoting that type of bodies as normal and healthy when in reality bodies like that are the product of a serious disorder...",False,False

I feel like people are desensitized both ways and really have no sense of someone being under/over/healthy weight unless they are knowledgeable about it through experience and/or research. We are exposed to both overweight and underweight bodies in media presented as ‚Äúhealthy‚Äù.,False,False

I used to go on there to feel good but at some point a bunch of nasty dudes infiltrated it and any picture of a woman with extra chub or cellulite gets a million ""gross"" ""this is actually unhealthy"" ""fat"" comments. It's so negative. Plus, on sanity Sunday, the one day of week when you can post body pos stuff, all the dudes be like ""this doesn't belong here, this is promoting obesity"" etc etc I'm so tired of it",False,True
