I tried it for a semester and had to change my major because it was making me more obsessive, and it was stressful to internally disagree with a lot of what was taught. Also you will probably have cooking labs and stuff like that. Don’t make your degree based on being obsessed with something because you hate it, pick something you love to learn about/do because it makes you happy.",False,False

I worked so hard to leave school a year early because I was determined to get into my 'dream' job right away.    Then in my first year, I realised that I didn't want to help other people as a dietician or do nutritional research, I just had no other interests than being obsessed with food lmao. At least a third of people on the course had some sort of disordered eating that I saw. The constant talk of food made me so much more obsessed. I noped out after 1 year and switched course.",False,False
