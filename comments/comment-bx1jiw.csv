In what world is telling to me gain weoght gonna achieve anything",False,True

If I was forced to gain weight I would get out of there and go right back to losing it all. I understand if you’re like really really underweight but if your bmi is like 18 I think you should be allowed to maintain and focus more on fixing your relationship with food.",False,False

I just wish it would go away and people would let me do what i want to do. I get they want me to recover and id love to be normal as well but it doesnt work like that and i still feel like i need to lose weight :/",False,True

(zing!) But unfortunately none of the people saying that are people in charge of treatment.  But that's really what it is. Forcing someone into recovery (for an ED or alcohol or drug addiction, etc) when they're not ready for it just doesn't work. Nobody should be forced into recovery. It makes you miserable because you feel out of control or like you've failed, it worsens your relationship with whoever ""put you there,"" and it costs too goddamn much to go through with if it's not going to ""work.""",False,False
