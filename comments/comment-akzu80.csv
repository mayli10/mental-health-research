He already knew about my eating disorder when we started dating because I had just got back from 6 months in eating disorder treatment.   If you didn‚Äôt know him before you started dating, then it might be more difficult to talk about it with him, but I think it‚Äôs a worthwhile to tell him. Even if you start with something like ‚ÄúI have issues with food‚Äù and go from there, it‚Äôs good to start letting him in at least a little bit. If he can‚Äôt handle that, yeah, it‚Äôs sad and going to be painful, but that‚Äôs his problem and is no reflection of your own value and worth. It is so much better to be single than to be with someone who isn‚Äôt supportive. ",False,False

I told my boyfriend at the beginning of our relationship that I'd struggled with it in the past and was hospitalized years ago. I was doing good then though and had been for years. He expressed admiration that I'd worked through it and seemed positive about it.  Some stuff happened this year that reversed it for me. I am at a very low weight right now and in therapy trying to gain. It's hard. I struggle daily with even eating enough to not lose more even though a few pounds more mean my parents are going to make me go somewhere for in-patient. What I'm trying to say I guess is about six months into our relationship, it got really bad again.  He has been an amazing support and encouragement even on the days when I don't want that. He's still incredibly positive and kind even though I know I'm not the girl he fell for right now because I'm so weak and tired. He works with me to get me to eat more. He goes out of his way to help me. He never makes me feel like less of a person or like he loves me less.   Telling your partner can be a huge help if they are a good partner. Having an eating disorder takes over so much of your life that I think it's hard to be in a committed relationship without telling them. It's like having backup and someone to help you up when you can't get up yourself. It can help.   I'm not doing well but I know that without him, I'd be doing even worse. Writing this made me realize that if you tell someone and they don't react with kindness, then they aren't right for you. Having an eating disorder doesn't make you less of a person or a less valuable partner.  Good luck to you. üíì",False,False

I told my current girlfriend pretty early on that I had eating issues. when I told her i was in a better place and not really struggling too bad, but I was able to prepare her for when I did eventually relapse a couple months into the relationship.   also. if you don‚Äôt tell him, he‚Äôs going to figure it out eventually. would you rather her know that you purge, or would you rather have him hear you purging one day and find out that way?? that was the biggest motivator for me to tell her, I didn‚Äôt want her to find out on her own.   she still has had a hard time with it, nobody wants to know that the person who they are with isn‚Äôt feeding themself or is purging, that‚Äôs a lot for another person to handle.  you have to be prepared for your boyfriend to be in shock for a sec and also be prepared to educate him on what you‚Äôre going through.   good luck, it‚Äôs a really scary thing to tell somebody, but it‚Äôs worth it in the end to not have to hide that secret from somebody.

He has some experience with EDs, so luckily I wasn't starting from square one trying to educate him about it.  It didn't really affect our relationship. We don't really talk about it. I'd like to, honestly. I haven't purged in 5 months and I told him that. He's said, ""that's good,"" and nothing more. I was so stoked and proud and wanted to celebrate. He doesn't know how bad it was, though, and I don't see any purpose in telling him all the awful details. Sometimes I try to make ED jokes, but he clearly doesn't think they're funny, so I refrain. He's a really sensitive guy, so I think it's hard for him to think about me struggling.  &gt; I don't want to be an emotional burden or seem like a hassle.   Whether or not you are an emotional burden is entirely up to you. There's nothing inherently burdensome about having an eating disorder. But if you want him to cure you or comfort you a ton, then yeah, it'll eventually be tiring for him.  I would think about what you want out of telling him. For example, the nice thing about my SO knowing is that I can tell him, ""eating is hard for me today. It would be helpful if I could make my own dinner.""  I have also asked him to adjust the way he compliments me. He now doesn't gush about my collar bones and long skinny legs, but instead compliments my internal qualities more.  Be really specific in your language so he doesn't have a *wtf/panic* reaction. Like, ""I would prefer if you didn't offer me these foods. I don't expect you to be my therapist."" etc.",False,False

First, I want to say I'm glad you're working on getting better :) Next: I was ""in recovery"" when I met my boyfriend, but my behaviors cropped back up about a year in. We're pretty open about mental health stuff, and while I haven't told him that I'm diagnosed with an eating disorder, he knows that I have issues with food and has an idea of what those behaviors look like, some of the things that trigger me, and how he can help -- all of these are things we figured out together, he used to be (and sometimes still is) AWFUL at helping lol.   Sometimes putting a Big Scary Label on it can complicate things because people have their own understanding of the connotations. Explaining your specific situation, and just asking for a little patience around food generally makes for a more productive conversation, I think. ",False,False
