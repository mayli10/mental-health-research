She had the Uni meal plan which meant a fry up every breakfast and ridiculous cooked dinner and lunch (think the deadly Ps: pasta, pizza, pies,) and then ate all sorts of snacks and sweets on top. Yet she was bones. She had no idea about calories, never did exercise, never even thought about portions...  Second year her fast metabolism just slowed down, and she doubled in size within a few months and could not understand why.",False,False

It's a dramatic and suspicious response to childhood obesity alone, for all of that to happen so quickly. There's a pretty big blind spot as well \*cough\*. The arguments are weak and the timing is awkward. Do we need more lecturing and patronising on top of what we've had already? Yes I think a lot of people are. Which is why I screw up my face at the FDA for doing this now",False,False

There's this one skinnnyyy girl in my class who I'm quite close with - 23 years old eats like a child and has no bloody idea what a calorie even is. Eats fast food every day and loooooves anything chocolatey. She'll be like ""lets go out for brunch!!!!"" like 5 mins before our break and get salty when I say no. Like hello, I need 2 weeks notice so I can restrict lower leading up to it, and spend at least 3 days calculating every single calorie on that damn menu before I go. Only to probably freak out on the day and bail anyway. Triggers me so hard thinking about how she can just spontaneously go to cafes when she feels like it and not think twice about her order of sugary buttery pancakes with an extra side of ice cream, without feeling even a hint of guilt. Could you IMAGINE. Or I'll see her happily eating a chocolate bar minding her own business and fucking hate her for it in my head. Like how dare she have a normal relationship with food right in front of my face??? Rude.      My ED is ruining my life.",False,False
