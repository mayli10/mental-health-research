I've stopped the binge mindset for today, because i cant physically binge more -\_\_\_- but I know that tomorrow i could fall back into it. and I really want to stop the binge now, and not continue. the feeling of fullness, and the food inside me is triggering on its own. at some point in the past I would have purged but I can't do that anymore for various reasons, so I gotta just wait until it's gone and I can get through it.

I better understand the place you’re in and I know you say it doesn’t make a lot of sense but it does. Like any other animal we have a nature vs nurture response to stress and trauma. Over time we cling to these support mechanisms and dogma’s. When I was in treatment my therapist told me a story. It was basically about someone who was tortured by a dictatorship in South America. During the torture a piece of classical music would be played. Sometime after this person was released and rebuilt there life abroad. She entered a shop. Playing over the loud speaker was the classical music. Which had been played during her torture. Unable to control herself she broke down and cried. She said afterward she can’t remember what happened only that the tones and cadences brought he back to that time and place.   Memories are powerful. Their what stop us from putting ourselves in danger, shape our future decisions, perceptions and form our instincts. We can’t look into the future but we can look into the past to ask ourselves “how did this playout before.”   Naturally when you received the letter I am guessing your instincts took over and your coping mechanism sprung into action. You naturally wanted to feel safe again.   You looked to see how you dealt with this in the past.       What food types and liquids are you binging.    Are you studying or working. What is the likelihood of this person returning to your life.    What is your preparedness to stop a binge cycle before it starts.    We know the why. Now let’s look at the how. The process of the binge and try to work away from it.    Look at your emotions before you start a binge.   We know you feel scared (would I be right in saying that.) Do you feel a lack of control or a fear and foreboding. Like something is going to happen. So you have to act first.",False,False

You’re a person. A person who needs to heal. You’re under a lot of pressure &amp; I can empathize with your situation. I also use starvation to repress feelings of failure and loss.

I know it feels like things won’t change and it feels like a mountain is crushing you. Just remember you have shown the strength to post up today and share your story. So, let’s climb this mountain and plant your flag on it. Let’s own this and take possession of your life. We have plenty of time and I am a good listener. So, let’s get started…..      Its sounds as though you have gone from a restrictive cycle to a binge cycle. What you need to do is find the middle ground before you can start restricting again. Can you break down the events and possible triggers around your first binge? Was it a certain food, a smell, a thought or a social encounter? I can’t really help until you share a little more. If you want, we can talk over DM or just reply to each other’s comments.        Good to talk and if you need to rant at me.",False,False
