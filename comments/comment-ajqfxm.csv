I think we focus on being fit , but not overly skinny.  Foodwise,  we eat a lot of bread. Most of the time, we have a sandwich for both breakfast and lunch. As long as you're eating wholegrain bread, it is mostly considered healthy. I guess, we have the same other typical 'healthy' foods as the USA: Salads, fruit and vegetables as snacks, and a whole array of superfoods as chiaseeds.   What I do experience here, is that I am actively applauded for denying unhealthy foods. Like today at work, there were doughnuts and I refused mine. I had several colleagues telling me that I was eating so healthily and that they wished they could have that mental strength. ",False,False

He can't really grasp the concept of ED. He thinks that I'm beautiful the way I am, and that when we met I was too skinny (Probably 105 lbs at 5'2""), and now I look much healthier (115-20lbs). I don't know how much of this is him and how much is his Culture. When I visited his home his family seemed to think the same way. But either way, he has a much healthier view than I do.
