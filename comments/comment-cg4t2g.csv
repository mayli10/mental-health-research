My using the site was much less frequent when users started spreading the ‚Äúnews(?)‚Äù that the site was actually run by some pedophilic man trying to get nudes from sick teenage girls though.,False,False

Every time I relapse I‚Äôm there constantly checking and posting every day till I start to recover again. I‚Äôm relapsing now and so I‚Äôm on there a lot. Today I saw someone posting here about how toxic it is and the high restricting thing and yeah I have been feeling super shitty and guilty for eating around 500-800 calories a day when others are only doing 200-400 but because I‚Äôm an exercise addict I have to eat more than 400 calories or else I‚Äôll pass out on a run.,False,False

Even if MPA did initially start as the beacon of support that they claim to be (which is bullshit from the name alone), the users have cultivated an environment wherein damaging behaviours are encouraged.  I've seen so much shit scrolling those damn forums. I've seen (allegedly) non-disordered women posting for diet tips, I've seen seen the disordered encourage said non-disordered to train themselves to be disordered as though we were part of some great thing, and I've seen posts from girls claiming to be as young as 12 being tutored in the comment section by women of well over 20 years of age.  MPA is where the lunacy of eating disorders is seen most clearly",False,False

Because I had the same damn thing and I was never able to make sense of it in therapy. Like it's called MPA, My pro ana, I was on the website religiously yet I was still in complete denial that I was sick like pardon me? üòÇ I really had the same damn thing happen.  And you are so correct about that like I swear to this day I still see people posting for ana tips, and they get torn to shreds which I have my own personal feelings about how that's handled but it still happens like all the time",False,True
