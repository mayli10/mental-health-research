The behaviors stem from emotions. If we can heal our souls from within, the wellness of our souls would be reflected in our outward appearance (displaying healthy weight and healthy eating behaviors). In my experience, simply restoring weight and resisting behaviors is not recovery, it’s facade. I only learned this last year. I thought I’d been recovered before but truth is it was only surface level. Recently I’ve been working on deep introspection via psychedelics and psychoanalysis, and I believe this is is a more proactive method than all the previous “just go through the motions of a non-disordered person” rhetoric, which sooner or later, in my case, failed every single time. This is what I think. But I’m still not well, sooo idk, you could take it with a pinch of salt ;)",False,False

Weight restoration is the priority because a starved brain isn’t going to be learning very well. Once a person is weight restored they can focus on replacing their ED with healthier coping mechanisms and untangling the why of everything. The second part is a lot harder and you will see a lot of people who are weight restored but they are still trapped in the ED mindset; they find a way to make their habits “sustainable” until life inevitably kicks them in the teeth and they spiral down.   I would highly recommend at least getting in touch with a nutritionist, who can give you a proper meal plan, and work with you to challenge your anxieties around food. For the mental work, look into DBT skills for tolerating distress, and mindfulness.",False,False
