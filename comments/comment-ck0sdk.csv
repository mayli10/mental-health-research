It was nice.  It helped me feel like I had control over my food, and I could go through the motions, but in a less unhealthy way. I ate more, and generally maintained/lost. Never felt full, but also rarely felt empty, and that middle ground was alright.  It's hard to do keto without obsessing over nutritional information, though. And if you're vegetarian or vegan, trying keto on top of that is inherently restrictive, imo.  Watch yourself and make sure you don't start ruling out foods, or getting distressed at trying to pick foods that abide by multiple ""rule sets"". If you eat keto, don't try to eat low-calorie, cheap, convenient, vegetarian keto. That's just restriction with extra steps.",False,False

Sundays I carb up or else I will absolutely binge every week.  For the first few days I get terrible keto flu. It makes my body ache and I feel really wavy, sort of like when you stand up too fast but all the time. I fix this with electrolytes, so I'll just crush up some mineral salt in a cup of water and drink that. Multivitamins are also your friend.  In terms of the cravings you get when doing other diets, mine are significantly less problematic when I'm on keto. The high protein tends to help me stay full for longer too, but I fast one day between eating days so I end up hungry in the end anyway.   The weight loss on keto has been faster for me. But I think it's only been faster because the extra protein tends to get to work on repairing your muscles so working out isn't as exhausting and I can do it more often.   TW here because numbers, but I have dropped on average an extra 4-8lbs per month doing keto compared to the diets I followed during my last relapse. Hope this helps, stay safe!",False,False
