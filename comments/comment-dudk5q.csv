I've found that if I don't engage in my other habits, such as purging and low restriction, I don't binge. That's simply how it works. I get that a lot of us aren't ready for that but if we ever want to eventually stop for good, recovery to some degree is the only real option.",False,True

This past week I binged often but only purged once. I felt like shit bc I wasn’t maintaining or losing weight, and now this past weekend I’ve noticed making healthier eating choices and I’ve been working out.  Now that I don’t have the excuse of, oh I’ll just purge this, I have to deal with the weight in other ways. It’s difficult, but manageable at the point in my life I am at (going to therapy so have extra help).",False,False

I’ve stuck with number 4 for 13 years and I can vividly remember the first time I binged without purging. I think if I had made a different choice on that day the trajectory of my life would have been much different. I don’t think I would still be married, and I certainly wouldn’t have the career I have now.    I’m not so great at the other things, but I’m working on it. Right now not purging is the anchor that keeps me from spiraling out of control.",False,False

I also recently broke the binge/purge cycle. Unfortunately for me that means I have been restricting hard every single day and dropping more weight (the binges were helping keep my weight more stable), but one step at a time because binging and purging made me hella miserable, and purging is super dangerous for electrolytes when you've been long term restricting.  I got rid of my scale. That's it. That's what I did to stop binging and purging. It's been 2 weeks now, before I could only go a few days. It's also helped me to be kinder to myself and less neurotic because the scale fluctuations were driving me crazy and causing me to do the unhealthy fasting/binging/purging cycle. I feel a lot better just restricting every day than I did alternating fasting with binging and purging.",False,False

You are worth recovery, even though I know it sounds scary now. A lot of my life I've felt that my worth was tied to my weight inseparably and that just isn't the case.
