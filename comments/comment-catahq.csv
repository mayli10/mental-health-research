I've done a few cycles now where I've stopped to trim a little fat before continuing on. I never felt like putting it off. If anything, it's been hard to go for as long as I'm supposed to. (Unless my dr. says I need to keep gaining, I'm planning to stop next week and continue once the weather gets cold)   Cutting weight is also much easier when you've been in a surplus for a while. Your body is much more ok with it, lol.",False,True
