Gotta say though, on days when I'm &lt;500 (or even fasting) it's awful because I don't have the strength or energy to do something the best I can",False,False

After my workout I have 1.5 scoops of protein with water. I might have a snack or two between lunch and dinner, which ill usuallyeat with my SO. My intake ranges from 1400-1100/d because I do a lot of powerlifing and conditioning with mma. If I low restricted I'm pretty sure I would really hurt myself. On the day of a meet I'll eat ""normally"" with a fuckton of caffeine but I'll fast the day after as long as I can",False,False

My coach tells me every fucking day that I need to gain muscle and I'm not strong enough but *biiiiitch I gotta gain weight to gain muscle no thank youuuu*       Usually I'll try and have 1 protein before I go in for training (like half a vegan hot dog or something similar), and then after training we all usually have a drink so I count that as part of my daily intake. And then when I get home I'll have my usual dinner meal of steamed vegetables and saltines. If I did a *really* good job at training that day I'll reward myself with a candy bar or something.",False,False

If I feel rlly bad I drink half a Gatorade (the kind with calories) and a few gummy vitamins. As long as I sleep enough I can barely make it. Other times I’ll have two rice cakes w 1/2 a tbs of pb if I really can’t handle it. I keep salt packets on me and if I feel really dizzy I’ll take a pinch of that (bc it raises blood pressure and gives me a couple extra minutes for the eLeCtRoLyTes to hit) in an ideal world i eat a granola bar or a protein shake before practice but usually I don’t. I just become the drink master and skate by,False,False
