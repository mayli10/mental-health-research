Admitting you have a problem, wanting to get better and wanting to share your pain is huge and I’m happy you are ready to begin your journey to wellness.   I think you should gather some resources first. Eating disorders are very hard to understand for people and it’s easy for them to say the wrong thing and make you feel worse about the situation. I am assuming you are a teenager, if you’re not please correct me and I’ll offer different advice/resources. There’s a very helpful book called Help Your Teen Beat an Eating Disorder that your mom should read. I would get her the book and leave a note saying something along the lines of “Hey Mom, I’ve been struggling with food and my body for quite some time now. I’ve been lying about it because I didn’t want you to worry and I wasn’t ready to get help for it. I’m ready now and it would mean so much to me if you read through this book. I want to talk about it with you more, answer questions and come up with a plan for my recovery.”  Then give her a day or two to digest the information before you talk about it. Be prepared for your mother to be angry, in denial, numb, scared or any combination of those feelings. She may say things that hurt you or feel guilty. Keep in mind how scary it must be for a mother to learn their child is suffering and killing themselves. But don’t let that scare you off from telling her. She is your mother; she brought you into this world, she loves you more than anyone ever will, she can be your greatest ally if you let her, even if she won’t say the right things every time.   Good luck! You are very brave for opening up.",False,False
