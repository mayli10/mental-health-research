My boyfriend and I like watching this girl on youtube, she’s an mtf and gorgeous and hilarious, she mentioned facial feminization surgery and i was like “Lol i need that” and actually looked it up to see if they’ll do it on cis women. I went into recovery in august and almost blew all of my progress by stepping on my scale when in a vulnerable mood. we all make mistakes and that’s okay.  it’s going to take awhile for us to get better and it takes a lot of work, you being aware of your behaviour is good. and everybody on fatlogic is salty and have their own body issues, you read the comments and it’s like “I’m overweight but at least i’m not this person!”. please don’t be too hard on yourself. we have a disease and you’re one tough bitch ❤️",False,False
