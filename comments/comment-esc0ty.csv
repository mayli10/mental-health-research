When I was younger, I had lots of dreams and goals and ambitions... there were so many things that I wanted to do. I am slowly climbing the ladder in academia and I’m pretty good at what I, do but I feel like some soulless, passionless creature that lost any real interest or sense of purpose a long time ago.",False,False

I have always been a good student with perfect grades, but ever since I started obsessing over food/weight my grades fell. For most university students average grades are fine/not a problem, but since I'm in medical school and an international student looking for a residency in the US, this is basically killing my chances at ever becoming a doctor.",False,False
