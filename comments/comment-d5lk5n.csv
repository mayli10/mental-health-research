You should also measure yourself in advance and look at the website to see what size you’d wear there since all stores differ nowadays. If you’re going to buy a lot and try on a lot, you should wear something comfy like phaeo15 said. Maybe just a dress or a shirt and skirt so that it’s easy to put on and take off. And flats, sandals, or slip-ons since things with laces or zippers are annoying to deal with in changing rooms.",False,False

Maybe makeup or hair or whatever little boosts of confidence. Take it slow, try to get into a conversation you can carry on while you shop and kinda be distracted by if that makes sense. Try to avoid places like Victoria secret lol. And make sure you stop at a novelty shop or non-clothes place and get something cute or fun. Always makes me feel a bit better once I stop at the Disney store or hot topic and get myself something",False,False
