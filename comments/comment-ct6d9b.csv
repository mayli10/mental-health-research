Girls who style themselves that way REALLY get under my skin because of this. One of my boyfriend's best friends is like that, and honestly she's fucking awesome! But she's like a decade older than me and 50% of me and she always gets carded when we don't üò© I wanna be her friend but it's so damn hard on my psyche",False,False

I love you and hope things get better soon,False,False

This in no way justifies the behavior and I‚Äôm so so sorry that it made you feel bad. I‚Äôd never want to make someone feel that way and maybe she doesn‚Äôt either, but is a bit caught up in what she‚Äôs dealing with.  I hope this little anecdote provided a small peak into her mindset. Once again, I‚Äôm so sorry that her words hurt you.",False,False
