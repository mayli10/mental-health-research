(plus now ive started doing what Eli did and do sit ups in bed, when im watching tv on my laptop in the evening, so that’s a nice easy way to burn a few extra cals)",False,False

I like what Lucas *does* as in serving as a male ED sufferer that isn't gay, but they ruin him after that. The moment where they go to a restaurant and manage to get free food was a neat moment of teenage rebellion but.. eh. The best part of the movie was Keanu.",False,False

Like as other people have said I appreciate more representation of men with EDs but uGH. Not him. He’s pushy and annoying and immature. And like really why is the treatment center encouraging a relationship? Not to mention he so didn’t respect boundaries.  Not to mention the whole interaction of  Eli - “I don’t know you” Lucas - “I’ve known you for five years. Your art” etc  Like no dude. You followed her tumblr, you don’t know her. Rubbed me wrong. She had a deal about obsessed fans and guess what? He was one",False,False

I’m glad they portrayed a male character dealing with an ED, but I found him very annoying. Ultimately though, I have sort of itchy, irritated feelings about the whole movie. It felt to me like something really saccharine and status-quo posturing as something edgy and raw? (I do watch the first 20 minutes every few months.
