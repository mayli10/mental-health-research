Just remind yourself that you don‚Äôt need to eat a bajilion more calories. In reality, you need only 200-300 more. The content of what your eating is most important. Reminding yourself that this is for the baby, makes it easier to stomach a bit more food.   If you‚Äôre happy to be a Mom, embrace the changes you‚Äôll have as necessary for your baby to get the best head start.

I suffered from AN prior to trying to get pregnant and around the time I started to ‚Äúshow‚Äù most of the thoughts about my body were gone and I was constantly thinking about my little one‚Äôs body and health and growth and what I could eat to make my baby as smart as possible.

And those 9 months FLY so even if they suck (mine did, I was involuntarily puking all the way to the end) it‚Äôs over pretty fast.  I want to address the freedom aspect too.  Make time for yourself and your husband.  It‚Äôs imperative.  The first 6 months are crazy because baby will likely cluster feed and won‚Äôt sleep more than 2-3 hours at a time (you‚Äôll be so sleep deprived you‚Äôll barely remember it) but after that you and your husband can switch off watching the baby and hire an occasional babysitter to get out of the house.  You won‚Äôt have *as much* freedom but you will still have it if you discuss when you want time for yourself.  Thankfully if you already have a stellar marriage then the baby creates a new thing to bond over and love immensely.

Like, wow, we can make a tiny screaming, emotion-feeling super computer?! Crazy.   But of course, this is a big decision! Definitely discuss it with your spouse, and know that there's nothing wrong with pressing pause on this if you don't feel ready, and there's nothing wrong with going forward, even if it seems scary. It's a life changing decision for sure, but it doesn't have to be life changing in a bad way.

The first trimester I actually lost some weight and couldn't work out due to being exhausted but now I'm working out and eating anywhere from 2000 calories (I'm tall) to sometimes almost 3k which is awful and scary but it's only when I go to parties or like Easter. It's hard to not starve myself the next day to compensate for days like this and constipation sucks but overall I think it's been good for my mindset and it feels nice to know that my life is a lot bigger than just me now. I feel blessed to know I didn't screw my body up permanently and I'm excited to do things better than my parents (mom unintentionally screwed me up with body image and weight)  Emotions are a whole nother story but I'm so glad to hear your happily married.
