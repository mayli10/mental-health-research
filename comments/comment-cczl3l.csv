I've only been in treatment for a few months so I'll try to stick it out for now and see what happens.",False,True

I'm an obsessive calorie counter (albeit a consciously and compulsively restricting one), and the PCP and therapist's instinctive leap to *let's hash out all the stresses and traumas of your life* is landing a little flat.  Like, I'm not denying there's a maladaptive stress-coping aspect at play here, but the stresses themselves are nothing news-worthy. Just life being life.",False,False

I wasn't able to actually recover until I quit all treatment, including seeing a nutritionist and following a meal plan. Obviously treatment helps some people, but sometimes what you need is normalcy and the ability to not focus on your ED, and treatment can prevent you from reaching either of those things. Can you discuss this with your therapist and explain why it is not helpful? Maybe they can help you advocate for the kind of treatment/support that would be useful right now.",False,False
