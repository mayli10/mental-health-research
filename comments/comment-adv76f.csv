I'm all for you getting out of this horrible toxic relationship,  but saying embrace your lonely to someone who is potentially so depressed they might be suicidal is a horrible idea.  Maybe see a therapist? ",False,False

You're still lonely because he's not giving you the love you deserve. Burn the whole asshat away. Try to distract yourself if it helps. He will only steal away your youth and time that you can never get back!,False,False

Then separating at some point in the future will be more manageable.  I am literally the exact same way so I know this seems impossible. But you definitely cannot live like this forever. Criticisms escalate into emotional abuse. ,False,False
