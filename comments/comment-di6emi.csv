Then my secret eating started to become more frequent and more food, and I started exercising and restricting *even more* to compensate. The ""binges"" (not too high-cal but I feel very out of control) and excessive exercising have really picked up in the last couple of months.  TL;DR - I went from pure (very) high restriction to bingeing and purging with exercise",False,False

I restricted and lost weight but if I binged due to feeling ravenous I would just eat less the next day workout more.   This part is sorta NSFW but basically I was seeing a guy and I was scared I would reflux because I agreed to meet him after I had overate. I had previously Lowkey threw up but he didn’t notice and I played it off ( if you understand you understand lol) but I basically was like well what if I threw up before hand so I did and that combined with anorexia tendencies(I’ve never seen a doctor about it) and that I was still losing weight sorta caused me to do it more often. I’m not bulimic I would say it’s mainly that I restrict and eat nothing then am ravenous which I eat a lot and feel uncomfortable but instead of just walking it off or resting a bit I throw up so I don’t feel too full. I still don’t do it often like just if I ate and feel sucky.  I just wanted to add for the sake of others on here I did not lose weight from throwing up please don’t do this the consequences of purging can cause serious harm I would say a lot faster than restricting. This is because you don’t need to be a very low weight to be affected by tooth problems or electrolyte imbalances.,False,False

In high school, I remember the first time I ever binged and purged. I immediately became hooked (doesn’t help that I have control issues, along with an addictive personality). I started losing weight healthy around 8th grade, where I started at 210 lbs. I got down to 160 and decided it was too slow of a process, (since I was starting high school, I was under the pressure to be as thin as possible) and there began my eating disorder. I lost the same 20 lbs until I went to college. These last two years, I managed to get down to 130, and more recently, I weigh in at 110. I haven’t purged for a long while, because I developed a taste for extreme restriction. I probably only eat 200-800 cals a day now. So I guess you can say my bulimia developed into anorexia over time.",False,False

For me at least, I was anorexic until I got to such a low weight that my brain just decided one day that I needed food far more than my want to lose weight and that's where the binge/guilt/purge cycles came from, although it never developed into full scale bulimia, I kinda wavered between the two. I think they're inextricably linked but that link is a lot weaker for some. There's definitely studies done that show how adjusting to feeding after a period of malnourishment can lead to a vicious cycle of binging and subsequent psychological feelings of guilt and shame.",False,False

Started out with severe anorexia and purely restriction.  Then, I started bingeing out of the blue, moved to anorexia b-p diagnosis then started gaining weight and over time and I developed bulimic behaviours. So I am one of those people who started bingeing suddenly and through sheer panic and desperation to maintain some semblance of control, I started purging. But I hate it. I just wish I could go back to before when I never ever binged. I'm not overweight at all but I have gained a significant amount of weight and I fucking hate it. I feel so ashamed of losing that control so much that I have avoided some people who knew me when I was extremely thin because I feel like they will judge me too.  It sounds weird but fundamentally, I still feel like an anorexic and I've flip flopped between the two for years. Because the bingeing started so suddenly, I never really dealt with the anorexia properly so it's still the underlying problem for me.  It's a weird space to be in with the force of two eating disorders fighting in my head constantly. One to restrict and then feeling guilty when I don't but also, too scared to restrict too much in case it triggers a binge.   I personally think bulimia is more challenging than anorexia (not generalising but for me personally). I suffered all the usual effects of anorexia (period loss, hair loss, osteopenia etc...) but the bulimia has been far more distressing for me. When I was anorexia I was semi-functional. I was obviously still sick but on the back of bulimia I have developed chronic fatigue. Also, my skin was great during anorexia (no fucking hormones), now I have the absolute worst skin of my life because the bingeing and purging has fucked up my body so much. I never had bad skin before my ed.  I feel like my body has betrayed me. I'm someone who likes to be in control (maybe a cliche but it's true for me lol) and to go from that level of control to having fatigue which means I can't control how much energy I have and therefore I don't get to decide what I can do ( I can barely exercise for example) as having bulimia, well, it's just totally fucked up my mental health.   Still, I finally feel like I am hauling myself out of this mess. For me, I've had to consciously eat much more than I would be comfortable with (outside of a binge) and over time, that has reduced my binges so I don't need to purge. I'm not out of the woods yet but control is finally coming back. My biggest trigger is getting too tired, either from doing too much or just from insomnia so I am still slipping up but it's getting less over time.  Sorry this is way too long!  tl/dr: Yes, this is true for me!",False,False

Anorexia is the phobia of food, they struggle to put food in their mouth. Bulimia is the guilt of eating food. They don’t have as much problem eating, but once it’s eaten they feel a lot of guilt.

Most eating disorders involve restriction. Diagnoses really depend on what behavior is central. So for me, even though I binge and purge, I'm anorexic, not bulimic, because my primary behavior is restriction, not binging and purging. There are people who are bulimic and are underweight because they only think eating is worth it if they're binging. Also a lot of the people with BED in my treatment program have talked about restriction making them more likely to binge. And just because a behavior is more likely to happen when someone is restricting doesn't mean that it's related to anorexia, it means that it's related to restriction behaviors, which can and does exist outside of anorexia.",False,False
