For hair skin and nails you need all the B vitamins.. and enough fat for some nutrients to be absorbed. Also protein really helps if you can get your macros to at least 20% protein and at least 20% (healthy) fats you can be feeling and looking good no matter what your caloric intake is ‚ò∫Ô∏è  Remember to note how much you take of micronutrients. Some of them are provided in supplements up to 300% of daily required dose. If you stack multivitamins make sure you‚Äôre not double dosing any of them. Some can be not so good for us if we take too much. It has to be a fine balance üôèüèΩ",False,False

I‚Äôd point out though that you should take iron and calcium at different times of the day, as calcium prevents the absorption of iron. Take the iron with vitamin C instead.",False,False
