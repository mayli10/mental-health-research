My teeth are aching and I'm dizzy and I'm trying to resist going back for round 3. It so easily gets out of hand so please don't be be me. (Also apologies if this is a little incoherent)  Some of my favourite foods have been ruined by puking them back up (looking at you homemade burger)  So even if you have to take it slow with the sandwich or hell even tell your gf about the purging please do. This is one of those ED habits that I really do believe can pick up dramatically and quickly  Actually you know what, let's make a deal. I'll go eat some green beans with salt and go to sleep, you don't purge tomorrow? Yeah? ",False,False

I'm not bulimic but from what I've seen on this sub, people wish someone had warned them of the dangers and consequences before they got so sucked into the cycle.   It might seem like a quick fix now and an easy way of getting rid of that sandwich and that guilt. But purging your sandwich will turn into purging every meal, every day.  If the sandwich is the issue, are there any safe foods you can eat for lunch? Or try and distract yourself by eating/surrounding yourself with your gf/friends so you don't purge?  You've got this. You don't have to get sucked into this cycle. ðŸ’•",False,False
