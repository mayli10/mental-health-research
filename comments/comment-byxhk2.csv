So I would log a normal day of what you eat into chronometer because it will tell you what micro nutrients are deficient in your diet. If you are fasting often or purging often but eating very healthy foods like leafy greens it's probably low electrolytes. If you just eat whatever you can to keep your calories low its probably a matter of multiple supplements would be needed.  However, you should consider that buying multiple supplements multiple times a year may end up being more expensive than a doctor's visit, bloodwork, and eating the most nutrient dense foods you can.  Good luck",False,False
