A lot has changed for me.  Gone from extreme restriction to bulimia and back but I have never stopped counting calories.  I got ill 12 years ago now and I didnâ€™t give a shit about nutrition. I missed out entire food groups and paid the price (hair loss ugh). Now I actually want to be skinny but somewhat healthy so I am more obsessed with getting enough vitamins. Had to delete Mfp and get rid of my Fitbit though. I thought I would get fat without it but itâ€™s made no difference to my weight (Iâ€™ve actually lost weight). Iâ€™m starting to see the light at the end of the tunnel for me but I am realistic,  not all of my disordered behaviours and thoughts are going to disappear.

I remember in my early teens stressing out over an apple and crackers for lunchâ€”too many calories. Iâ€™m a little more relaxed now in that area. I understand vanity sizing now and have stopped freaking out if my pants size changes from 1 brand to another. I donâ€™t tape measure as much anymore.   I still drink over a gallon of water a day to keep the appetite down. I still stress if I havenâ€™t walked as much as I should haveâ€”5 miles a day is the minimum. I still exercise/weigh in as punishments.  Iâ€™ve started C/S ing, drinking Diet Coke, and chewing gum. Iâ€™ve started bodychecking with wrist and elbow bones, arm vascularity, thigh gap, and hip fat. Iâ€™ve also started learning that my behavior is a complicated set of coping mechanisms for underlying issues. And, Iâ€™ve started trying to recognize that some days will be better than others, and to forgive myself when a day goes badly, rather than punishing myself or carrying punishments over to the next day. That last one is hard to do, but itâ€™s been very freeing from a mental health perspective, and physically, really helpful in limiting binge/restrict cycles.",False,False
