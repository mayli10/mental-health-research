Does anyone else feel like that? I feel so hopeless sometimes.  I feel similarly because I'm so proccupied by my weight, looks, my intake, my failures in regards to my weight that to a point, my head isn't rooted in reality and I'm almost never 100% paying attention. Even when I am, certain things I see and hear will trigger me into thinking about something weight-related. It's all-consuming. Social media just makes it all worse because then I'm just looking at all the people who are so much fitter and better looker (and therefore somehow better people?) than me. The worst thing is that I know what I'm doing wrong, and I know what I need to do to change. But like you, I feel hopeless because I can't see to hold the self-discipline to do it despite knowing full-well how much better everything was when I was smaller/losing weight. I'm essentially walking in circles and that's why I've came to the conclusion that I needed to tell someone. I'm dreading expanding on all of it, but it has to be done. I'm glad my post made you feel better. You're not alone in this what-so-ever. I think thousands struggle with the exact same issues and don't even realise it's a problem. ",False,True

It made my night. I‚Äôm not exaggerating.   I‚Äôm obese with an ED also and I feel like the worst ED-er EVER. I feel like a failure. The goal is to be think and I can‚Äôt even do this ED correctly!
