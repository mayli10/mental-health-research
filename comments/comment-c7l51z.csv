I did end up losing more for a bit, after being prescribed &amp; maintained at sub-level bmi, Psych never noticed, in fact she congratulated me ""You look so good at new (higher weight)!""  Crazy bc weight was less than before (?)  I was rarely weighed at her office, maybe my choice of clothing or tonnes of makeup made her believe I was a higher weight, but I'll never know.  This was over 2-years ago.  I'm still getting the Adderall.  (Yay?)  I think it all depends on your doctor. My Pdoc weighs me always...so pre-visit I'll increase salt-intake, and at times increase intake 2-3 days before any appointments.  But, to answer your question, it depends on your doctor.  I'd generally believe this would def happen if a patient with ED loses weight.",False,False

I really hope I'm able to stay on it even when I lose weight, I could probably blame it on school but üò¨  Thanks so much for replying though, I appreciate it!",False,True

But there was a period of time where my doctor was paying extra attention to my weight because they didn‚Äôt want the meds to make me lose too much weight.   They hinted at if I kept losing weight at that rate they‚Äôd have to lower or cut off my dose,False,False

It sucks because it takes me soooooo long to lose water weight after a binge but i guess it's worth it. Have you heard of anyone actually losing their prescription because of weight loss?,False,True

I 100% get that fear of losing your prescription because of weightloss.   What I typically do is save binge/‚Äúcheat‚Äù days for the day before an appointment. The bloating alone puts me up like 10lbs and then chugging water right before adds to it.   Now if you‚Äôre losing a LOT of weight in between appointments idk how well it‚Äôll work. But I consider it motivation to actually eat since ADHD is a huge part of my life.,False,False
