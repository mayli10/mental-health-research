Otherwise I used the site https://www.sailrabbit.com/bmr/ to calculate it and that seemed pretty accurate as well.  I think your TDEE depends on your weight and height. I‚Äôm quite tall at 5‚Äô7‚Äù and I‚Äôm not underweight (although on the low side of the healthy BMI range) so my TDEE is going to be higher than someone who is a lot smaller than me and weighs less. Also, I‚Äôm very active and I typically get at least 10,000 steps in a day + running on the treadmill 3-4 times a week + horse riding 4-6 times a week + looking after my horse and cleaning the paddock everyday + my job is quite physical. On non-active days my TDEE is around 1700 and on very busy days it goes up to 2200-2300.   Unfortunately I don‚Äôt know whether your TDEE is accurate as I‚Äôve only had experience with calculating mine. But I have seen loads of people on r/1200isplenty who swear they maintain on 1200 (however they are very sedentary). I‚Äôd maybe have a look at the spreadsheet I mentioned if you are ok with providing all the data. Otherwise I highly recommend the website I linked to.   Wow this comment got so long sorry! I hope this helps and I‚Äôm not just rambling üòÇ  ",False,False
