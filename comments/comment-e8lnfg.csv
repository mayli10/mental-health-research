They're just extra work imo and honestly I don't want to be womanly or have two uncomfortable blobs stuck to me. I enjoy having next to nothing as long as the rest of me is proportional,False,False

They're currently between a 32 and 34 A. Sports bras help keep everything sleek and flat.   I enjoy other feminine aspects of my appearance so like you I don't think it's dysphoria. I just feel so elegant and streamlined and *right* when they're small to non-existent.  Howevs. I fucked myself over with the extreme yo-yoing over the past sevenish years. My boobs have gone through so much size variation that they're covered in stretch marks. Like, they're visibly empty skin sacks just hanging from my chest. They'll never look normal.",False,False

Well right now I'm fine with them, I'm an A cup, like 36A Idk how sizes work but relatively small.  But a month ago I had such a BURNING hatred for them that I cant believe I felt that way looking back st it now.  I wanted to rip them off.  I tried to bind them (without a binder oof), just could not stand them on me, I just felt so uncomfortable with them and it wasnt just because they were balls of fat on my chest, I just genuinely wanted a flat chest and to dress androgynous and to APPEAR androgynous.  There are times where I do feel more masculine than feminine but regardless of how I feel I always dress the exact same way.",False,False
