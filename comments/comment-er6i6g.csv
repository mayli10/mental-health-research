They differ from normal multivitamins because they are specifically for women's nutritional needs. I take a gummy vitamin every day (made with pectin so it's vegan!) If you restrict/honestly pretty much any female, you should also take a calcium tablet each day. I'd say those are the bare essentials... however when I get my blood tested I'm often deficient in a bunch of other shit. It may be worth getting a round of bloodwork done. If you are low in iron/vitamin D/potassium/phosphorus that can cause medical problems and require specific supplements",False,False
