My best friend has always been smaller than me and she holds her weight way differently (I’m all stomach and she’s all ass). I offered her some shorts to wear bc she needed them and she was shocked (lmao upset because it means she’s as fat as me) that they fit but now she steals my shorts so  ¯\_(ツ)_/¯   I don’t have much to console you but you aren’t alone! 💕,False,False
