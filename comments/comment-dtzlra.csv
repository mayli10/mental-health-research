How much you restrict is not important.   This is not a contest and it should not matter how ill other people are compared to you.   What's important is how you feel. Are you suffering? Then you are ill and deserve help.,False,False

My diet is essentially the same or even less restrictive as a lot of people on weight loss subs, so I feel like an absolute fake.   Sometimes, it helps to remind yourself of what a normal relationship with food looks like.  *Would a normal person have a panic attack at changing their food habits for one meal?*  *If you got injured and couldn't exercise for a while, would it be normal to lose your mind over it?*  The other day, my colleague just munched on a 400cal potato chip bag at a meeting, commenting on how she just *felt* like having it that day. It blew my mind and I realized I'm actually still sick, even though I'm not completely starved or skeletal.   Stay strong &lt;3",False,False
