Don't worry.  700kcals is a bit much, so watch out for health problems. You've done very well, just our bodies tend to keep us off of enjoying our successes.  Have you measured your waist, wrists or other parts? Maybe you lost there some cm.  A friend of mine told me to measure myself so I don't feel so bad when I hit such a wall and that progress is still being made although the scale won't show it.
