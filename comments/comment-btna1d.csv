I can’t believe how much a weight difference it makes on your face. It’s like a totally different person. Sometimes lately I’ll look in the mirror and like, move my skin fat back physically to see how I lost it before and find my ‘skinny face’ again hahaha",False,False

I haven’t even bothered logging my dumbass fluctuations, but my safe weight is miles away. It seems like just a week ago I was annoyed at going just above my goal weight after a day and now it’s like .... wat  Everyone has commented on my weight gain and how much ‘better’ I look but I’ve become a complete hermit. I don’t work and I had to push a year of school forward because I can’t afford it. I cried looking at myself in the mirror today.  My only word of advice that saved me from binging last night and tonight was: you did it before, and you can do it again. I think this is important because before I hit my gw I actually didn’t think it was physically possible for me to actually be thin / skinny. It is; and we will do it again.",False,False

Lowest weight ever last fall and now I've gained back +25lbs and I feel so overwhelmed with the shame and guilt of how I look that I can't even function? Like I hardly talk to anyone outside of work, if I have to go out I only wear baggy clothes and won't look at anyone. It's horrible. I'm so sorry you're feeling the same way :(",False,False

Nearly the same numbers and everything pretty much. I torture myself by looking at pics of myself at my lowest weight because my face and body legit looked so much better :(,False,False
