Cortisol is elevated by exercise(especially strenuous aerobic exercise like running), stress(internal/external), poor sleeping quality etc. I can't speak for you but I had the same fears as you when I was recovering which lead to me running way too much, my fat percent still being super low, me being stressed all the time and eventually my body giving up on me and the recovery process taking so so much longer(still going on) because your body also needs some fat to finction. I don't think strength training should be as stressing for the body, if it's really important for you maybe you can do it a couple times a week, just don't overdo it. Maybe you could try some gentler exercise(walking, yoga?). Hope this helped, good luck in recovery :)",False,False
