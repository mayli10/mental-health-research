The thoughts don't really go away but once I give in to appear normal I can kinda flow like that for a while and its wierd bc I'm like ""wait ive eaten normal for like a week I am totally fine?""",False,False

If she knew about my disordered eating it would break my fuckin heart. I lost a lot of weight when I came off to college but every time I go to her house I revert back to my old eating habits to appear normal and it's kind of comforting being back in that cocoon of food and love. And then I leave and freak out but it's nice for the few hours I'm there.,False,False

I always feel like I‚Äôm faking because I don‚Äôt have issues eating out, like in restaurants and stuff. I do have some weird food habits, like cutting the insides out of sausages and eating them separately (yes I know that‚Äôs gross) and obsessively researching menus and calories before we go out, but I don‚Äôt leave food on my plate and I don‚Äôt freak out about ‚Äúunhealthy food‚Äù until much later when I get back to my room. I definitely don‚Äôt purge when I am with other people either because I‚Äôm terrified of being caught. So from my parents point of view, I just eat like a normal person and they have no idea what my ED entails. And then that makes me feel like a big ol‚Äô fakey fake.",False,False

Whenever I go home everything goes out the window - I justify it to myself by my parents will notice if I'm not eating much and my dad's way of showing love is feeding so there's just no way I can keep it up so I might as well push it to the back of my mind.  Same applies if I'm at my boyfriend's for the weekend...which is most weekends. So I basically feel like I only have an ED during the week and take weekends off and oh boy does that make me feel invalid. Like, sure I ate less than 2000 calories for the whole week and most of that was in alcohol, but I ate like a normal human being this weekend so I clearly don't have a problem, right?",False,False
