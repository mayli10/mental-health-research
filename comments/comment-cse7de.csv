I understand why it’s really difficult to hear but she might be struggling herself and using this as a way of coping with being around people and food.   If you can just let it slide then do, but if you want to respond perhaps try a positive approach - telling her you don’t need snacks to want to hang out, ‘I’m hungry so I’m totally having 2 courses but you don’t have to!’ etc.   I could be totally wrong, it’s just that what you describe sounds a lot like things I’ve said before to try to ease my own guilt about eating.",False,False

I binged before dinner a few times and couldn't finish the actual meal. But I had been with her all day so I knew exactly what she had been eating. I guess she binges at night though because she doesn't enough during the day. That would explain the crisps and stuff.,False,True

I have a friend bigger than me and she always tells me she lost so much weight weight, when in fact, she didn't. At least I never saw a slight change in her appearance. She always reassures me her bmi is on the end of normal, bordering to an underweight bmi (I doubt it). She always tells me that she ""hasn't eaten anything until now"", is ""building so much muscle "" and ""losing fat""....  I'm fed up with it. So (I do not recommend) I told her my stats and told her that I know people who are taller than her and weigh less, she isn't ""almost underweight""(more the opposite) and she doesn't eat tiny amounts.  Really felt good. For 10 seconds, then she justified herself, again. All in all, i think most people like that just want to live their lies, I guess there's nothing one can do. Only thing I can do when she triggers me, is think of how fat she is and avoid contact for as long as possible.  Sorry I guess this wasn't helpful at all:(",False,False
