I’ve used them for almost a month now so I’m pretty sure it’s more than just water weight.   I take a couple before I start eating. Then I eat. Then I take a couple more. Seems to do the job for me hahaha,False,True

I've never used them and probably never will, I just don't understand why they're so popular. By the time they kick in, shouldn't all the food be digested and absorbed into the body? I feel like they just make a person lose water weight??   No hate at all, I'm just curious!",False,False
