You'll have to identify your personal triggers, maybe make a list, and work out solutions to each one.   I've just come out of a six week binge session myself. My triggers were mostly stress and later a sense of failure after gaining some weight. I would eat a normal, reasonably healthy dinner, and then snack on candy, and then finish a whole pack of candy, and then binge uncontrollably because I had already failed.    My solution was twofold: For one, I ate mostly the same boring thing every day for a week. Oatmeal, vegetarian ""schnitzel"", bananas, vla. Still doing that to an extent. This has helped me distance myself from the emotional aspect of food and has allowed me to get back to a ""food is fuel"" sort of mindset. Two, since I can't cut out candy (for... reasons, haha), I now eat it _before_ cooking a normal meal. Normally, I can contend with a small serving of candy after dinner, but when I'm in binge mode, I can't not finish the bag. This would cause more binging the same day or the next. With this new approach, I might be able to stop and then eat normal food. Great. I might eat the whole bag, in which case I can skip the planned meal entirely or just have something small if I get genuinely hungry later. The fact that I'll usually be around maintenance calories at that point is enough to stop me from binging the next day, because I didn't ""fail"".  Of course it's not a long term solution to substitute dinner with a half a pound of gummy bears, but it lets me break the cycle of binging because I hate myself and hating myself because I binged.   That's just my personal solution, but maybe some of it resonates with you.   Things that didn't work for me: Setting a hard limit for calorie intake. Only buying candy once a week. Setting a calorie limit for candy. Intermittent fasting. Straight up fasting for 24+ h to ""fix"" the last binge. Avoiding being home. Not logging. ",False,False

I also try to shut off any distractions before I binge (no tv or radio) and think about what I’m doing while I’m doing it. I’ve been able to cut it off mid binge successfully for months now.  The other thing I do is drive to an unusually far location for binge foods. Like if taco hell is two blocks away, I drive the whole way to the one across town so I have time to think about what I’m doing. 60%of the time I’m able to turn around and go home before indulging.",False,False

For some that causes them to binge more but idk just helps me.. stay safe love ❤,False,False
