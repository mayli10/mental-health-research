There’s homeless ppl and drunks and probably so many underage kids at the McDonald’s downtown with the clubs around.   Don’t sit there crying and blaming yourself. Those ppl at McDonald’s are stupid. Try complaining to their head office bc they should put a notice up for something like that. If they don’t, it’s probably bc they’re not actually allowed to do that.",False,False

I’m over 18 but didn’t have id on me. Because clearly it’s better for someone’s safety to have their plans ruined and be left to wander around the city at night as opposed to being in a McDonald’s with some drunks /s,False,True
