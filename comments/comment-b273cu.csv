I'm eating the number of cals to maintain but it feels like a struggle, like every meal is so measured and controlled, I'm forever counting and calculating what I can/can't eat. I think if I suddenly became non-disordered and ate intuitively there's no way I could stick to the correct cals based on my TDEE. Idk how I used to eat anything and not care and somehow didn't put on weight?! ",False,False

You said youre counting calories. write them down, and your weight. If you eat maintanace you will see. Doesnt matter if its 1200 or 1400.",False,False

I’m 5’6”, 90lbs and my BMR is around 1100. I’m extremely active every day and my daily weekday TDEE averages just less than 1700, so based on our differences I would say your burn estimate is correct.   But like recovery doesn’t have to be 1500 kcal intake/day, you could eat at your own maintenance or slightly under. ",False,False

Calculator are just die estimation. Everybody is different. Write down how many cals you eat and how much you weight and you will see if you lose more or stay the same.

My stats are about the same as yours right now and I always end up gaining if I eat more than 1500. If I do absolutely nothing and just eat, 1300 calories is my perfect maintenance amount.   I think the expectation is that you should be more active which is why your calorie intake should be higher. This may sound hella preachy but what really helped me while I was recovering was exercising more because it made me a lot happier and gave me something to think about other than the way I look.
