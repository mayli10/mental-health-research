Also they have sauerkraut (look for 'chucrut' in the canned goods section) and you can eat half the tub for ~100 cals. Carrefour has this fibre chocolate cereal (Cereales Stick Fibra, Carrefour brand) and it's the lowest cal cereal I've found so far. And if you don't mind the high price tag, Alcampo has these mushroom veggie burgers for ~90 cals each that are also super high protein",False,False
