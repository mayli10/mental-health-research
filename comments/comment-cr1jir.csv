Otherwise if you feel perfectly fine and checkups with your doctor don't find any problems you're probably okay. That's not always true though. I'm definitely very sick and doctors have run tests but can't figure out why. I feel sick though. If you feel healthy you probably are. Just be careful that you don't fall into that ED mindset where you think certain problems are okay because they're not debilitating.,False,False

Some people also start to experience symptoms of being too thin when they go anywhere even close to an 18.5 BMI. It's different for everybody. Some people can be healthy like that, but not everybody can.",False,False
