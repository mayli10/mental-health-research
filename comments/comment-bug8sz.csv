My guess is that by metabolism, you mean TDEE or total daily energy expenditure, the amount of calories you burn in a day. It's composed of four things: your basal metabolic rate (BMR; the amount of calories your body needs just to sustain life if you were bed ridden and did not move all day), physical activity (any kind of exercise), NEAT (non exercise activity thermogenesis, things like walking, fidgeting, cleaning the house), and the thermic effect of food (your body needs energy to break down food).   Your BMR is affected primarily by age, gender, height and weight, and muscle mass (among other things, but these are usually the big ones mentioned). You can't do anything about your age or gender, but if you want to increase your metabolism, the best way to do that is by increasing muscle mass, because muscle takes more energy to maintain than fat. So take Woman A and Woman B. They are the same age and gender (obviously) and the same height and weight. However, Woman A has more muscle mass than Woman B. Woman A would burn more calories in a day than Woman B, because muscle mass is more ""expensive"" to maintain.  Basically, if you want to increase your metabolism, you can put on muscle mass, increase your physical activity, and/or increase NEAT. From my understanding, slow or fast metabolisms are subjective. Says Woman A has a twin who is exactly like her, weighs the same, has the same muscle mass, everything. They're identical in every way and have the same energy expenditure. One cannot have a slow metabolism and the other a fast one barring some kind of medical condition.   People who think they have fast metabolisms may have a ""fast"" metabolism in the sense that they burn more calories and can eat more compared to someone else who is similar in age and weight to them. This may be because they have more muscle mass, do more physical energy, or expend more energy on NEAT. NEAT can vary hugely from person to person. One study found that it can vary up to 2000 calories between individuals of the same size (source:  [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK279077/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK279077/)).   Here are some great YouTube videos, all citing peer-reviewed papers, that discuss metabolism science and what I've talked about in this comment:   [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1a8zuTfZhK0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1a8zuTfZhK0)    [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8K3\_tGLIfc&amp;t=19s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8K3_tGLIfc&amp;t=19s)   [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6xnZhO-PkI&amp;t=621s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6xnZhO-PkI&amp;t=621s)   Hope that helps :)",False,False

Some people also burn extra calories from NEATs (basically, fidgeting and the like).  Things like hyperthyroidism, fevers, and medications can increase that further, but it’s still not a huge difference.  Most people who are “naturally skinny” just don’t eat as much as they need per day and don’t notice that they’re eating significantly less than others, or are very active in their day to day lives without exercising (they have to be physical for their job, they walk everywhere they go, their apartment is a walk-up and they live on a high floor, or whatever).  Even before my ED I was “naturally thin”, but it’s because I grew up being taught to manage portions and I had a hard time sitting still.",False,False

So yes, people require varying amounts of calories, and feel satiated at different calorie counts, for all sorts of reasons. A lot of people don't have an accurate sense of how much they're really eating, but it doesn't mean they are disordered.  In terms of your question (could two people consume the same amount of calories and end up at different weights if all other variables were controlled?), I have no idea how you would even go about testing this, but I think the answer would be no. You would essentially have to be testing the same exact person, just at different calorie intakes.  When I think about people with ""fast"" or ""slow"" metabolism, my first thought is about hypo- and hyperthyroidism. That's about it.",False,False

I also heard that the more muscle mass you have, the higher metabolism. And other things can affect it too, like thyroid problems can speed up or slow down metabolism. So like, people with hyperthyroidism struggle to gain weight, while people with hypo struggle to lose weight, etc.",False,False

Pretty sure my ED started when I was 11 (and I had disordered thoughts/behaviors even before then). Pretty sure that stunted my growth. I have never been a normal weight, but I’ve never eaten normally either.   Like you said, it’s pretty possible that a lot of those “naturally skinny” people have EDs themselves (like I did) or they just overestimate how much they eat and underestimate their activity. Unless someone has hyperthyroidism or some other metabolic condition, I don’t think fast metabolisms are real.  EDIT: I’d also like to add that people thought I ate a lot, and they’d always comment on how amazing it was that I could eat whatever and never gain weight, but I’d actually only ever eat around people, and when I did, that’d be my only meal that day. So, even if you think that you see this “naturally skinny” person eat a lot because you always see what they eat, that might not even be the case.",False,False
