Only got out of it because it was time to swap the tube and the GI doctor just did it in their office without any specific tools and missed my stomach. Horrible pain but got it out and was fine a week later. I ate alongside having the tube and didn't gain much weight, if any really. If you have any questions about the procedure, my experience, etc feel free to message me.",False,False
