I came back here to say, if it helps, try to think a about not binging for just the day. Try not to think of it as the whole year. Take it day by day and eventually week by week and then soon enough, you’ll have strung together a whole year. You took time to develop these habits and it’s going to take time to undo them. You’re not a bad person because you binged. When most people try to quit a bad habit whether it’s smoking, drinking, whatever, it’s rarely cold turkey. It’s ok that you binged. Just keep trying. One day without is a day of progress. Don’t count the days in a row without. I believe that sets us up for failure. On the drinking subs you’ll see a lot of people get upset and mad at themselves because they went xx days without drinking and then they ruined everything by drinking for a a day. They didn’t ruin everything. They still have those days under their belt, it’s a slip up and you can still continue forward and count the days. I hope that helps you and that you’re feeling better now.",False,False
