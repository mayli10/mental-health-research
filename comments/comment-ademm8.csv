My husband called me beautiful at a BMI of 18 and the same at a BMI of 28 :) there’s always something beautiful about everyone at any size :) it can totally be an attitude too. When I was bigger (pregnant) I wasn’t as stressed about weight gain or what I was eating. I just enjoyed it Bc it was healthy for the baby! I think that made me beautiful to him :) suddenly we could enjoy a meal together without added stress and that was really nice! Sorry for the long comment haha! ,False,False

He would often tell me I was beautiful, which made me feel like I was fatter than I thought. He also told me a lot that I would look even better if I gained some weight, which made me think I wasn't good enough, but would also made me want to lose weight. That whole relationship fucked with my head and I'm glad it ended a year ago (he was a horrible person). The issues with my weight and eating stayed though.",False,False

It happens to lots of people at one point or another and the attraction is no less genuine just because you're outside the type he is most frequently interested in.",False,False

This man specifically likes something she does not want to be. My fiancé loves me and calls me beautiful, but I know he'd like me more if I was as slim as when he met me now I'm a big overweight. He always compliments my hands and feet, saying how cute and small they are and how he loves how much bigger his hand is against mine. He's trying to make me feel good and be kind, but it just upsets me because it just reinstates to me what he likes, that I am not. A slightly different case to OP, but I get it.   &amp;#x200B;  I do however agree that you shouldn't read too much in to it, I have chosen not to, because ultimately I know my boy loves me, however I am.
