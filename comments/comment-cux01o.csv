Theyâ€™re not in love with these women; theyâ€™re objectifying them. A lot of the fat fetish revolves around the fact that the fat the woman is carrying is humiliating. Or, on the opposite end, there are also fat fetishists who want to be dominated. I am on the submissive end of the spectrum, so that only makes me even more terrified of being obese again.  Long story short, it doesnâ€™t help. Though, I do look at skinny fetishists sometimes, longing to be like those girls :â€™)",False,False

Binging on celery and carrots is great (I actually love them) and I think I will just limit myself to that. The two stores I go to just have wierd ways of organising things and the vegetables are literally facing the chocolate sections (chocolate is my ultimate trigger food...).  I wish I could just have someone do grocery shopping for me, that would make things so easier if I didn't have to enter the store ever ðŸ˜­  We have a similar pattern, I guess. It's either b/p for days or restrict/exercise so bad I get to a negative net calories count. Both are equally damaging but at least the restrict one is cheap...",False,True

That's the hard part, unfortunately. Right now I'm stuck in a binge period (diagnosed with EDNOS, binge purge restrict cycling) that I haven't been able to really break out of, but so far my best method to at least curb my binging when I go to the store is to avoid the sections that contain my trigger food. So it's like... ""Oh, you want to eat an entire back of chocolate chips? TOO BAD FUCKER WE'RE DOING PRODUCE ONLY, TODAY. HOPE YOU LIKE BINGING ON KALE.""  It doesn't always work, but it's helped a little! And that way if I do binge, at least then it's on food that actually has some nutritional value, you know?",False,False

And thank you for your answer :)  Have you found anything that helps with binging? My only method is to either never go to the store or really be almost crying in front of my trigger food in the store to the point I'm embarrassed and just leave...,False,True
