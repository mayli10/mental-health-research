It means they will probably pay attention to what you eat or possibly even feel responsible when they see youre not. And if you want it on the dl be smart about who it is you tell.  Former starbucks barista here: when i was at my lw and about to go to treatment i decided to be open with my manager and supervisors about my issues and all but one were fine. Everyone was very nice and good and made sure i wasnt put in a position they knew would be hard for ke and appreciated my openess. I had one supervisor who didnt think i should he allowed to keep my job because a requirement of the job is beinf able to lift 30+ lbs and i couldnt from muscle atrophy and low blood pressure.  This is just my story though. I think being open if youre comfortable with it is a good idea but be mindful about who it is you choose to talk to about it,False,False
