Also a little bit of elastic sewn into the back of your jeans works! you can do it with minimal sewing skill and it pulls everything tighter, when I still used to shop in the kids section I found a lot of pants with that as a built in feature using buttons so it was adjustable.   Some clothes are really easy to take in by just following the side seams a few centimeters closer than they were made, then cutting off or sewing down any excess so it isn't super bulky. Just look for simply cut items with only a few straight seams and it shouldn't mess up the fit too much.",False,False
