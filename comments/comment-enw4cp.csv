If you had a problem, truly congratulations for getting it under control. Or if you just are trying to cut down your alcohol intake, congratulations anyway!! :]  I wish I had the willpower to quit drinking again.  I was admitted to the ER for an unrelated issue recently and my bloodwork shows how fucked up my liver is getting.  Of course my doctor has no idea why, and I admit nothing to him. ;D",False,False

Something about how the body metabolizes alcohol can lead to the body screaming for SUGARRRZZZZZ in the absence of alcohol. So sugar can be a tool to moderate the urge to drink, buuuutttt the flip side is sugar cravings can become a demon in their own right (*raises hand*). Fwiw, fruit seems to work best for me to satisfy my sugar lust without going off the rails. And stopping drinking has been so good for my overall mental health, that itâ€™s worth my sugar yo-yo-ing.",False,False
