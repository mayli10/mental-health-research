It’s weird because he’s not critical of anything else that I do, he’s basically as supportive as I could ask a person to be... except with food!   At one point he lost 50 lbs just by straight up portion control and now he’s quite svelte.  Perhaps he sees me eating big salads or a big plate filled with just one thing and assumes I’ll be eating al that AND more later. I also think he may have some personal issues with food that he’s projecting on me (got those issues from both parents lol), his whole side of the family is outwardly critical of people’s bodies. Doesn’t matter your age, gender, etc I guess it affects everyone.",False,True

I have dealt with this exactly and I think that your dad has whatever psychology my mom has.  My mom also hears what I say in extremes  (like exactly how your dad heard your comment).  She get's seriously offended when I tell her she's saying something that is hurtful to me. So if your dad is like my mom, he is a hot-button pusher.  Does he make rude comments about people and things you love?  Does he know your triggers and innocently hit them?  I'm sorry :( ",False,False
