A doctor's ability to diagnose accurately is dependent upon knowing all the facts. Your weight and purging frequency are really important parts of this puzzle and without that information, the doctor can't give you the help you need. I know it's scary to out your disorder, but if you can handle going back and being straight-forward about your ED you will likely get a more accurate diagnosis and more appropriate treatment.

Hopefully that gives you at least some peace of mind. I agree with the other posters who said you should try to see a different doctor, and maybe at least try to let them know about the purging. Or at least tell them you vomited, even if you don't say why.

Some I have had have paralysed one side of my body, sometimes teeth, tongue and gums only, once I've even hallucinated.

Knowing an accurate weight is part of this, even if you don't want to mention the purging. It's likely that they may have taken your symptoms more seriously if they knew your weight was low and that you have a history of an ED.     I'm so sorry you are dealing with this, but if you want to stay safe and are dealing with something potentially life threatening, then I think you need to be honest with your doctor. Or you can go to a clinic or emergency room so that you don't have to see the doctor again - it can be just a one time thing. ",False,False
