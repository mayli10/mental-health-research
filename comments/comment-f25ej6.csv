Unless if I'm reading this wrong, in which case I apologise. From his perspective, he may have noticed a change in the pants you're wearing and he may have been surprised by the fabric (men's pants are usually a lot stiffer). Many people don't associate stretchiness with weight gain but rather comfort and freedom of movement, regardless of weight/eating habits. Have you tried telling him how his comment sounded?",False,False
