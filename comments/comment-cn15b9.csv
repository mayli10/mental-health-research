I’ll be sure to think about total Kilojoules intake from now on too.    [Protein Bar Reviews](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLSKYXeL_QnCrChffXan1tk6l96A1f1GhL),False,False

Thinkthin also has other flavors like cookies and creme and peanut butter but they taste blander. A few years ago when I was better at not bingeing (fucking kill me) I used to eat half a protein bar at a time, if you're concerned about calories you could do that?

The protein drinks have nicer macros than the bars. Premier Protein has chocolate drinks that are 160cal and 30g protein. (So if you only drank 2/3 you would be at 107cal and 20g protein)  Also plain nonfat greek yogurt has great macros. Mine are 100cal for 18g protein.  As always, baked chicken breast with the fat trimmed off is basically pure protein (4 oz = 110cal and 26g protein)  The bars are more of an ED classic lol but if you're lacking in protein, drinks, yogurt, and chicken will be your best bet",False,False
