You truly have a great chance to fully recover (without having a bunch of ingrained thoughts).   Research has legitimately shown that individuals with an eating disorder duration of 5 years or less (I'm fairly certain it's based on 5 years but I'll verify and link research articles later when I'm at my computer).  I've struggled with an ed since I was 12 and I'm 28 now. I really regret that I was so willful and stubborn when my parents tried to help me as a young teen. I've wasted so much time, added so much unnecessary stress, and have missed out on so many opportunities through these years. It's  saddening when I reflect back on how much missed out on.  I'm not trying to sound preachy but time passes so fast and I hope you can reach out for help so you can enjoy your teens and twenties.",False,False

I wish I would have been more serious about recovery at your age, then I wouldn't be 19 with bone density issues and my heart having stopped while in hospital. Trust me, there us NOTHING good waiting for you by sticking to an ED. You don't have to be 100% certain you want recovery, just reach out and make the first step. Do it now, before you lose yourself.",False,False

You should do your best to get out now while it might be easier because once you become older it begins to be something you can’t live without if it isn’t for you already. and this is all coming from someone who isn’t that much older than you. Even only a few years apart has me a lot less hopeful than if I tried to tackle this at your age ,False,False

I've spent so much time worrying that I'd live my whole life with it. Now, six years later, after countless therapy sessions and hospital stays, In actually doing better. One day something inside me just screamed ""no more."" I'm not cured. I'm not fully recovered. But i'm closer than I've ever been. I never, ever thought I would be so close to a healthy weight, purging so comparatively infrequently. Give it time, grit your teeth, and don't give up. Someday there may be a rainbow. ",False,False

Get the help while you're young and it's easier. I know it'll be really hard, but you really don't want to be dealing with this as an adult",False,False
