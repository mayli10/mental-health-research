But again, I’m right there with you. I stopped on the substance abuse for awhile but now I’m going back to it and really regretting it. Living with this ED shit is the worst. I am NEVER satisfied with myself, my personality or my body. I hate it. I do want to say that binging is not going to help with any of these feelings. Always makes me feel worse. I guess we will just have to learn how to break out of these habits? It’s so fucking hard. I’m sorry. ",False,False
