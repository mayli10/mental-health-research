We’ve been married 30 years, and his weight has been relatively the same since I’ve known him. His whole family actually has a very healthy mindset when it comes to nutrition and body image, which has always been so foreign to me. He grew up with stability, and free of trauma, which is opposite of my experience. He eats consistent meals and a couple of snacks. Eats when hungry, stops when full...I think he is rare, and in awe of how little space food and body image take up in his brain.",False,False

But on the other, there are definitely still many people - perhaps even still a majority - who aren't. They eat what would be known as ""intuitively"" and maintain an average/healthy BMI, and exercise moderately because they enjoy it. At most, they might make a conscious effort to pay attention to macros, but it's not through a lens of tracking and weighing everything - it's simply, ""I had a lot of carbs for lunch, so I should eat something less carby for dinner,"" or ""I feel kind of sluggish today, so I should make sure there's plenty of veggies and iron-rich foods in my meals.""  I have been awed by/jealous of these people my whole life. Before I started restricting, when I was binge eating every day, I couldn't understand how someone could be satisfied with small portions. I couldn't understand how someone could eat delicous food and then not immediately want more, more, more of it, or ESPECIALLY how they could stop when they were full instead of when they'd finished their overly-large portion. Didn't they enjoy it? Didn't it make them happy? Didn't they want MORE of that, then?  Since I started restricting, my awe has changed to people who eat my fear foods without hesitation. People of healthy weights who eat white bread and peanut butter and pasta and rice and full-fat/full-sugar foods. I'm still in awe of how it doesn't turn into a binge for them, since I'm scared of those foods mostly because they're binge triggers, but I'm also just stunned by HOW they eat it. Without a second thought in the world. Like, again, they might be thinking to themselves, ""Oh, I had a big lunch, so I'll probably eat light tonight, if I eat much at all,"" or ""I didn't eat much today so I'm really hungry for this big dinner,"" but that doesn't translate to fear or anxiety or trepidation in how they eat. They still... just eat it.  Meanwhile if I eat something with any of my fear foods in it (they're less scary if I'm eating in public because I know the 'cooldown' period between when I eat and when I'm back home, which is where I binge, will probably be long enough that I can talk myself down from eating more) I'm constantly thinking to myself, ""this is okay because it's all I'm going to eat today. Or it's the only thing I've eaten in the past \[X\] hours. Or I'm going to fast tomorrow. Or I'm only going to eat half."" And the idea that those kind of thoughts of ""compensation"" aren't running through other people's minds whenever they eat... Baffles me.",False,False
