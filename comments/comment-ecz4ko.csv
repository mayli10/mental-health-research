Eating disorders are complicated obviously and stem from multiple psychological factors, but I always say to people: if weight and being fat is your biggest concern, all control and emotional issues aside, *virtually no one gets fat on a 1200 calorie a day diet (in fact most will be rail thin), but almost everyone survives and can even be healthy and functional on that amount* it’s our retarded ED brains and low self esteem that convinces us that it’s reasonable or virtuous to eat below that amount. It’s a death sentence. This is why imo the most important aspect of ED recovery is hitting the self worth angle. If you love and respect yourself, you don’t want to kill yourself, period. You might still want to be *thin* and you might still count calories, etc, but you don’t want to engage in objectively harmful and unsustainable practices. That’s the difference between women who starve themselves skinny and women who work hard out of self respect to have those bodies.",False,False

I’m assuming she’s instructed you to consume at least 700 calories and NOT purge, correct? Eating 700 calories is better than nothing and not purging is better than purging (which, btw, is fucking horrible for you and I can’t believe I did that for so many years, I’m lucky to be alive) Over time eating 700 calories of course you will lose weight, but for 2-3 days isn’t very long. Has she instructed you to increase that caloric amount afterwards? What’s her plan for after 3 days if she isn’t seeing you for a month? Are we missing information?",False,False

Is it possible to get a sooner follow up appointment? Because in my opinion this is poor professional practice to encourage restriction in a client with an eating disorder.",False,False
