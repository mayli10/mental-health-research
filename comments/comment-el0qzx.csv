Hard fucking same bro  Anyway my advice is eat a nice big breakfast before your morning dose (prep it in advance if you're not a morning person), lots of protein/granola bars, trail mix or nuts bc they're high calorie and easy to eat a lot. Protein shakes (maybe even the gainer type) might be worth a try if you think drinking your cals might be easier? Or something like soylent/huel/etc  Also this scenario is when I got diagnosed with celiac lol so if you have a lot of regular GI issues please see a Dr for them and don't just chalk them up to recovery!",False,False
