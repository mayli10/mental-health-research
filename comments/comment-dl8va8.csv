I’m either am so happy with my weight that it fuels me to not eat, and food is less appealing. Or I am happy with my weight so I feel like I can splurge a little more &amp; end up bingeing. Or my weight is higher than expected and I end up on an all out eating spree all day and can’t stop  Postponing dinner- for some reason, eating causes me to be ravenously hungry. If I eat dinner at 6, I’m going to end up bingeing all night. If I wait til 8 or so to eat dinner, the dinner &amp; binge all happen at once so the damage is less  Skipping breakfast- normally, once I start eating- I’m starving and craving food all day. The longer I can wait to eat my first meal the better. I aim for 12, 2 is the most ideal but 11 am or 12 are more common unless I keep busy  Avoiding trigger foods during the day- if I eat chocolate during the day, I will end up eating chocolate (and prob other shit if I try to avoid the chocolate) all day but if I wait til nighttime I can usually just eat a normal amount of chocolate   Knowing the exact calories I’m eating- if I go to a restaurant without calorie info or I eat at a friends house or even it turns into an all out binge day. I spiral out of control when I don’t know how many calories I ate. I can eat 2000 calories at a meal (id rather not but.....) and continue to eat normally if I know it was 2000 calories. But I could also eat 500 calories and not know the exact calories and then just binge the rest of the day",False,False

Like, okay, next week I’ll have a binge day on Monday. It’s been a good week and worst case I can fast the next day, no biggie. Then throughout the week I decide what food(s) I’m going to get and what show to put on and basically just make it almost... an event? A date? Lol. It helps me a lot, personally. I find if it has a strong negative connotation, I spiral out of control super fuckin easily. But suddenly turn it into a reward I’ve earned and can pamper myself thoughtfully? Not bad! I can handle it.   If I’ve been restricting heavily and the binge urge has been *really* bad, I’ll have a maintenance week/high calorie restricting week. Giving my body and mind that boost of food tends to help me balance out. I mean, I do end up having a medium-ish binge during that; but I can handle making up for it with less calories the next day than I could before.   And like what’s been said here already, I just keep binge food away. Literally all of my food is low calorie as hell and doesn’t taste that great anyway. And I put all of my money into my savings account so it’s harder to get to and then I have to *think* about why I’m taking money out if I get the gall to go out for food.   Or I’ll take a handful of melatonin and sleep.",False,False

Some things that have helped are:  \* OMAD, and making that one meal be interesting and complete (instead of just portioning out one blob of food from a big pot, have a ""main dish"" and several sides so I mentally feel like I've eaten enough)  \* literally not having any bingey foods in the house... nothing that's easy to eat on its own (protein bars, pb, quick junk food, etc.).  That way when I do binge, I have to take time to cook whatever it is I'm craving, and even then the caloric impact isn't that insane (oatmeal is filling :)).  \* Don't log calories until after you've brushed your teeth and are in bed.  I noticed that any time I logged cals during dinner and was under, I'd eat more.  If I was over?  I'd eat even more out of guilt.  So now I go through dinner as a mystery, eat my allotted food and ENJOY IT... and only find out my total for the day when I'm about to pass out.  \* As for eating at all other times of the day... I have to make sure it's either an allowed ""event"" or done completely in passing.  Like, either sitting down at the table eating a meal with someone else, or I'll eat ""functional"" food for myself and my health while I'm running around doing other things.  Binges usually happen when I'm alone doing nothing, or around other people and food doing nothing in particular besides eating lol.  &amp;#x200B;  Edit: just tryna format. Ain't happening.",False,False

It gets me away from food and my dog likes walks (I also like walking her she’s v cute).  If you don’t have a dog you could just take a walk for a while. It helps me clear my head.,False,False
