Being healthy here is also hard since most meals revolve around on lots of rice. And organic veggies and free range eggs or anything much more healthier in general is just f*ckin expensive and limited. Sometimes i go to markets in bgc and makati to buy certain things. Btw where in the Philippines are you from? Nice to see a fellow pinoy here ðŸ˜‚,False,True

I hate wasting food because I don't just see people on the streets who need it -- I actually know people who would gladly take the food (aka relatives who aren't as well off). Knowing that there's so many people who would be so grateful for ANY food and here I am trying to not eat. What makes me most guilty is buying low cal/low carb or some other ""healthy"" food for a ridiculously expensive price and knowing the amount of money I've spent could've fed a family of 10 for a week.

Especially the idea of training my body to desire pain and suffering because that's what feels safe to me. My parents were emotionally abusive and I guess I didn't realize it at until now but I did get out; I'm still being abusive towards myself because that's what feels normal to me even though I barely see them anymore. I really needed to hear that. Thank you.,False,False

Once I move out and can sustain myself I'll continue it.
