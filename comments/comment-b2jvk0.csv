I know it has so many kcal but for some reason I love it too much to care. even at my most disordered, I've always felt this way. hopefully you find a place you love this much one day.",False,True

After I’ve finished eating (whether it’s all finished or not) the guilt is so overwhelming, it doesn’t feel worth it to me. So now I’m feeling gross because it’s a waste of money, waste of food, and it’s a waste because I hate myself after. :/ ",False,False

But maybe I shouldn't focus on gaining weight and should just try to be healthier. I do have a meal plan that's almost all liquid so it wouldn't be overly filling and it's 1650 calories. Some of the ingredients are expensive, but I guess if I wasn't buying fast food all the time I would still be saving money.",False,False

It's just so expensive though. I think I've probably spent over $100 on fast food in the past month and I haven't even gained weight. It feels so wasteful.",False,False
