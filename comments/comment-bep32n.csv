I can't afford the meds to treat my depression nor the treatment to help me through this.  I just want to encourage you to 1. Talk to a doctor about your depression. Mine helped me find meds that are $10/month (and i have no health insurance) 2. Seek out community resources. I found counseling at a women's resource center for $25 (and they don't turn women away if they can't pay). Try 2-1-1 (211.org).   Good luck ðŸ’– You can pm me if you want.,False,False

I know I'm really involved with a story when I create a character of my own to interact with the characters in the story. It's unusual that I put myself directly in a story like this, which is why it caught me so off guard. I might end up creating a character with these issues just to have a safer environment to explore these ideas from. I can't be having this crisis every week ðŸ˜‚",False,True

I do the same thing except I use a fictional character as a self insert basically and imagine all the things his friends would do for him if he were struggling like I am. I imagine them keeping an eye on him and cooking his favorite foods to try to tempt him, and driving with him to his doctors appointments and holding him close when he's upset. And it doesn't necessarily mean I want a real person to do those things for me, in fact I'd probably hate it, but I like exploring the scenario of comforting and accepting comfort through fanfiction",False,False
