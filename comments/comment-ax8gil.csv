Dwayne wouldn't be caught dead eating wings unless it's one of his legendary cheat days. This crazy guy actually did his diet for a month:  &amp;#x200B;  [http://rockingfor30days.com/the-rocking-for-30-days-challenge](http://rockingfor30days.com/the-rocking-for-30-days-challenge),False,False

Meanwhile one munches on chips crackers, all of the bread and drenches her popcorn in butter. The other eats reasonably healthy but adds in high calorie extras (peanut butter, honey, nuts etc.)   My boyfriend saw one of them the other day and said “wow [bleeeeeep] has really put on some weight”.   I want everyone to be healthy but I struggle so hard with people who say they’re working out to improve their bodies but then eat like shit and rarely exercise.   I also tried to explain that most people don’t have bodies that defy the laws of physics. Aka count calories and eat less than you burn to loose weight. I gave up because it just wasn’t worth it.

He decided he was going to do something about it so he ordered a bunch of weightlifting stuff online and got a gym membership and started working out for like thirty minutes everyday. Great, right?  Except he didn’t want to change anything about his diet so he was still frying up mountains of food for every meal. All he ate were things like chicken wings, fries, fried chicken, burgers, etc. Basically if he could drop it in a deep fat fryer he was good to go.   This was years ago and he still hasn’t lost the weight. ",False,False

I really hope she doesn't do that every time, she honestly just doesn't know better but I didn't know if it was my place to tell her. She also said before that part of her plan for weight loss was to stop having unhealthy food and have more smoothies instead, I did tell her that time that most smoothies you can buy have just as much added sugar as other drinks.",False,False
