I tend to describe it as being “passively suicidal”. I’m not taking direct life-ending action...buutttt I’m gonna play dice with the universe and I’m fine with losing? I think for me there’s a lot of anger happening underneath the depression or despair. At the universe. At people trying love me. Like daring them to abandon me? But then, I’ve got that lovely BPD diagnosis, so that’s pretty on-brand.   For me, when I’m feeling and acting like that, I’m usually in an overwhelming amount of pain. If that’s the case for you I’m so sorry you’re struggling. I hope that if you want help, that help will find you.   PS: Some of what you describe (as far as taking lots of high-risk actions) sounds similar to what I’ve heard people talk about with the manic episodes of Bipolar I. (Just as a side note in case it’s maybe worth considering if something like that could be going on too?)",False,False
