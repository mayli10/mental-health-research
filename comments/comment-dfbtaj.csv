Don’t let diagnostic requirements invalidate your feelings and struggles. Who gives a fuck if someone “doesn’t meet the weight criteria for anorexia” or something like that. Doesn’t mean you aren’t suffering, so don’t doubt your feelings.  It’s like saying, “i think I’m sick, I have a cough. But I’m not coughing up blood yet so it probably doesn’t matter.”",False,False
