Aspartame was rumoured to be a carcinogen, but this was quickly proven to be a false claim. There was no evidence supporting that aspartame causes cancer and it was later proven that it doesn't. It's probably not entirely good for you, more research is needed to determine exactly how it effects the body, but we know that sugar isn't good for you, that it causes weight gain and a plethora of health problems, so I can't imagine it's worse than sugar. If anything it likely just causes different problems.",False,False

The weight of existing scientific evidence indicates that aspartame is safe as a non-nutritive sweetener.""  One can a day is very little! You'll be fine!
