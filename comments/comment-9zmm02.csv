If you have a habit of drinking a lot of soft drinks and stuff, you can say that is big contributed. If your family thinks/knows you may struggle with other mental illness like depression, you could say that got in the way of you taking care of your teeth.   I encourage you to get this fixed because tooth pain is terrible and you don’t deserve to suffer. Ive had two root canals (and those were only partly my fault) and one of those has a really bad abscess. Like think of a comically swollen face from a tooth and that was me. That tooth caused me the worst physical pain I’ve ever experienced. I went to the dentist a couple weeks ago and it was embarrassing and the dentist tried to have ‘come to Jesus’ talk with me about it but it didn’t take long. I go back in two weeks for some work. And I’m looking forward to it because I’m having pain again and this might make the pain stop.   TLDR: find whatever excuse suits your situation and just go to the dentist because you don’t deserve to suffer the pain. ",False,False

I found a dentist who specialized in people who are afraid of the dentist, and I was completely transparent with them.  It ended up being a very positive experience.  They fixed my tooth, made several more appointments to do some other work I needed, and I never felt any pain, and I never felt judged at any point.",False,False

Im 34, so it's been going on for a long time. Grinding my teeth from starvation induced anxiety, EC stack and malnutrition caused breaks and fractures in my teeth. I had to get one extracted and an implant placed, plus 1 root canal and 5 crowns to protect the teeth i fractured. I have a mouth guard too.  Look up a dental discount plan and show it to your parents. I have something called the Carington 500. It discounted all the procedures I needed. Insurance covered very little. I got it down to 5k which I paid with a no interest Care Credit loan. I set the payments to pay off in 2 years before the interest free period is over.  Do your research and then TELL your parents. Give them options (they may know this stuff, they may not, but if they don't it would be a huge help).  Don't mess around with your mouth. Besides the health issues, you don't want something else making you feel bad about yourself like missing and decaying teeth.  Good luck and don't be scared!!!  ",False,False

I would say that you should tell family you want an exam and a cleaning. Both of those are routine. Then you can find out how everything is doing at the exam.  Good luck!,False,False

When I finally went a few months ago, I hadn't seen a dentist in nearly a decade. Since this was the case, I ended up needing a lot of work done, which is never fun. I'd encourage you to go and get it over with. The longer you wait, the worse and more work it'll need.    &amp;#x200B;  As for you family, can't you just say you need to go because you haven't been in a long time?",False,False

I also hate the dentist and I think anyone who has experience purging lives in constant avoidance of ""facing the music"" if you will.  That said, you should probably get it taken care of ASAP. I know someone who suffered sepsis as a result of advanced untreated tooth decay. Even if it's alright for now, it can quickly become serious business.  You don't have to tell your family about your purging if you or they are not ready for that conversation. People suffer dental issues for all so sorts of reasons (falls, cracks, normal wear-and-tear), and saying you think you have a damaged tooth shouldn't raise any red flags. Your dentist will probably be able to see evidence of purging, but as a medical professional, they are bound to strict confidentiality procedures. No one has to find out about your ED unless you want them to.  Good luck and hope you're able to get the tooth checked out soon~",False,False

The longer you wait, the harder it will be to fix. You can't change the past so don't dwell on it, what matters is now. I know how easy it is to put things off, so make sure you see a dentist asap.   Don't wait for the ""perfect"" time to tell your family because it will never happen. If you feel you're ready to tell them, then the time is right. Ultimately it will be better with their support. I hope everything works out well.",False,False
