So many others including myself feel it too. There‚Äôs no quick trick to make it go away, but something I always try to do, even when I eventually binge anyway, is to sit with the pain I experience before I binge. I repeat to myself that such massive amounts of food will only numb the pain, not get rid of it, and will make it worse after the euphoria of losing control to eating it goes away.  Pain isn‚Äôt fun, I don‚Äôt want to feel it for longer than I have to, no one does, but it is there for a reason. Pain helps you grow. The same goes for periods of restriction. I can‚Äôt keep the pain away forever by scrambling for control over something else, and I shouldn‚Äôt want to, because embracing it and thinking about why it‚Äôs there has always taught me or shown me something that has made me better.   Sending love and support ‚ù§Ô∏è",False,False
