Being in a cast and a brace is super traumatic. All of this SHIT is super traumatic. I’m so sorry you’re going through that.   The best advice I have is to start reading ‘in an unspoken voice’ about how the body holds onto trauma and how important the mind body connection is. Emdr and somatic experiencing really helped me after I was in an accident.,False,False
