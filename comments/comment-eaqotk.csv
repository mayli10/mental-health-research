I don't know if this will help, because I don't want to belittle you or your problems, which are genuine. But that foggy feeling, the anxiety, depression... all of those are directly related to calorie starvation.   https://mental-health-matters.com/anxiety-attacks-how-improper-diet-and-dehydration-are-triggers-for-your-fear-based-panic-attacks/  https://www.healthyplace.com/eating-disorders/articles/depression-and-eating-disorders-when-sadness-never-fades   I hope those articles help you realise one thing: yes you have triggers, but the eating disorder is almost guaranteeing depression and anxiety. It's what a brain does when starved, constant fight or flight.    Its a vicious cycle, where the one thing that will help you feel better the most, giving your brain, literally the fuel it needs to function properly and get you out of this fog, to help arm you to deal with whatever is stressing you out, it's the thing you're compelled to avoid. I fucking hate eating disorders. It's the saddest thing in the world to see people who should be happy torturing themselves  You can do it! You can be happy. Choose it  I wish you the best",False,False
