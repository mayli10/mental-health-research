I freaked out knowing I'm hear about it every day and have to be supportive.   Instead of making comments on the weight, I'd say things like 'You seem more energetic or happy' or whatever and I'd ask how she feels. Basically words of encouragement that don't just focus on size/weight. Ask questions: Have they felt a difference? Anyone else notice? Hell, even ask directly what you can do to support them.
