I was also motivated by ethical reasons and then had to really debate for a long time if going vegan was even a viable option (I have a strong tendency to cut out entire macronutrients annnddd it’s always a disaster when it happens). Even though it worked out for me, I don’t think it’s safe for all people with eating disorders/ in recovery. Like many people in recovery would probably be fine if they did it mindfully and with support but there are risks. The ease of restriction is a big one. So is that the social aspect of eating can be disrupted in an acceptable way when you’ve got a real reason to not eat the food and I think that can be isolating in a way that fuels disorder tendencies. (Also there’s this crop of young, vegan influencers are such disordered nightmares that I’m almost hesitant to say I’m vegan when talking to people who know about by nonsense but that’s neither here nor there)  I think having to maintain as a condition of going vegan helped, because then I was choosing it as a more psychologically healthy lifestyle than my former restrictive one. I was lucky that I was still very supported while transitioning, so I saw being vegan was something like a privilege that my team would let me continue to have if I showed them I could do it in a non disordered way. I also totally wanted to prove my nutritionist wrong which was highly motivating ☺️",False,False

When I tried to explain this to my psychiatrist he said ""but we want you to lose weight."" When I said the only way I've ever lost was obsessively calorie counting to the point it takes over my life he said ""well if that is what works for you, you should do that.""  It was a slap in the face. Pretty much insinuating that I deserve to go through emotional hell bc being fat is the worst sin ever and I must go to any length to lose weight.",False,False

But I'm not gonna lie it's made it easier to restrict. One upside is that it helps me control binges. But I also caught myself using it to get out of eating the other day. I gotta find some balance between the two lol.",False,True

It freaked me out a whole bunch. It’s sort of gross to say/ embarrassing but I ended up going vegan (which is very possibly risky for someone with an ED history/ a lot of people definitely use it to hide their disorders so I’m not recommending you try it unless you’re going to be really honest with yourself about whether it’s healthy for you or not). Anyway it helped me a lot. I didn’t lose weight but I can now miraculously maintain my weight without having to think about it. And that freedom has really improved my relationship with food.  Importantly I don’t really know why the vegan thing worked. I mostly eat garbage foods/ am pretty much a junk food vegan so it shouldn’t be that helpful. Like I don’t eat healthy at all but am still firmly in the normal range. Like that I can eat pizza most nights of the week while maintaining flies in the face of every nutrition thing my ED brain thought it knew. And I feel like because I’m able to maintain pretty much no matter what I have a much more sane/ balanced relationship with food.   But also I don’t know if going vegan is right for everyone, like I think it helped me and has allowed me to sustain my quasi-recovery for the last 4 years but I also know that it’s still a food rule and that’s inherently dangerous. Having the rule that I can’t have any other rules has been protective (like it stops me from acting on my orthorexic tendency to fear bread and oil but also those thoughts still pop up from time to time). Seeing a therapist also helps. But dude, it was a hard sell on the nutritionist front, my RD made me promise that I’d stop if I dropped any weight/ was highly skeptical for a solid year. So yeah, massive grain of salt and not for everyone but that’s what helped me ☺️",False,False

Last year I lost almost 30lbs and everyone was congratulating me not realizing I was in a full-on relapse after a couple years of being relatively okay but overeating. I also had a decent loss in high school but no one had any idea I was at my worst back then. I don't recall any time where I just lost it healthily. I have no idea how to eat intuitively so it feels like I just need to pick and choose what ED behaviors to continue. Currently I feel like I'm encouraging my ortho side because I feel like it's at least better than full-on starving. At least I take vitamins when the ortho tendencies are strongest.,False,True
