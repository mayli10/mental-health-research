I lowkey hoard food and don't feel comfortable unless my fridge is bursting. But I don't eat most of it; I nag my family for not eating it and all the perishables I have to throw away while they eat garbage  from packages. I also cook constantly. I have issues, I know.",False,False

Idk what it is, but whenever I'm there, I can't stop binge eating late at night, so I end up just throwing away mountains of cookies, crackers, chips, ice cream, candy, chocolate, cake, etc. I feel awful because I know they also spent a ton of money on the food too. But they would've lost that food anyways cause I would've binged on it",False,False
