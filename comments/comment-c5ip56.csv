The office is on the other side of the city and I don't have a car, so forcing myself to put in the time and effort to get over there and see her seems to be helpful in and of itself. The structure, being out in the world, interacting with strangers -- that does me lots of good.",False,True

OK. The onion rings I can understand, I guess. But watermelon???   The only therapist I have experience with just always wanted to talk about my mom (even when I didnâ€™t bring her up) and how I should just eat right and exercise. GREAT IDEA! Iâ€™M CURED!   I will say, it does seem like she has quite recovered as much as she probably should be if she wants to help people who have the same issues. ðŸ˜’ But what do I know, I have no idea what that kind of recovery even looks like. Does she seem to help you at all? Or make things worse? Or just neither really?",False,False
