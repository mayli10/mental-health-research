Hell yeah I'm too old for this shit.  Thing is, it's not about knowing better.  Doctors, nutritionists, people who know more about the body and mind than we ever will have EDs.  I sometimes feel isolated being older than the age range of people who appear in documentaries or post on forums, but with age I kinda want to talk about it less.  It feels like I've talked it all out.  &amp;#x200B;  Mental illness have no prejudice.  They affect anyone of any age, race, religion, etc.  I found it easier to do recovery (been weight restored twice) when I was younger.
