And i can completely understand - some how I‚Äôve greatly lucked out on how my body responds to fasting. I know a lot of people end up fainting if they go without food, but I‚Äôm oddly unaffected in that way.   I really do hope you find comfort. I know exactly how you feel with the frustration ",False,False

I thought it was dehydration but no matter how much water I drink the same thing happens sadly. I'm unable to function on anything longer than a 1 day water fast. I wish I could water fast though. I also have hypothyroidism and it's a pain. I'm glad you've found a way that works for you.,False,True

But the biggest help has been the fact that I‚Äôll lose about 10 pounds in those 7 days, then the rest of the month is spent eating healthy and maintaining that weight.   The ups and downs from water weight and the plateaus don‚Äôt torment me like they used to because having a planned fast at the end of the month gives me a sense of security and control-ability. I also am a lot kinder to myself because the water fasts take a good deal that I don‚Äôt want to waste on short punishment fasts from an out of control binge.   Of course anything of the sort should be researched heavily and discussed with your doctor. It‚Äôs something that worked in my specific case, but obviously everyone is very different and what might work for me can be extremely dangerous for someone else if it‚Äôs not supervised (just like my thyroid meds are great for me but would totes kill my hubby if he felt like trying them for funzies) ",False,False

Walking a lot is a really good idea actually as it also keeps me doing something so I don't have time to sit and obsess about things.I'm really into podcasts at them moment so it's a good excuse to listen to them while walking. All your advice makes sense and I should take it for sure.  I find high restricting hard as I'm more of a fast then binge/purge person but I'll give it a shot.,False,True

And if I have time I pair the walking with HIIT or volleyball to create a deficit from exercise. Walking helps burn calories without making you ravenous but HIIT and other sports should be played before you plan on eating because they ramp up appetite a lot.   I would recommend taking a break from calorie restriction and just eat at maintenance while increasing exercise. That‚Äôs what works for me :)  You can also take a little bit of Miralax(occasionally) if you feel maybe you‚Äôre constipated/backed up. The intestines can hold more than you think. ",False,False

They tend to happen juiuuuuuust after I passed 80/70kg or 85/75/65kg and I would just hover in around there for a few weeks.  But it should sort itself out in a few weeks time depending on what your doing. Shoot me a PM and we can chat more about it if you want üòÄ sending my love and stay safe ,False,False
