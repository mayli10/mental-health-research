I have to say tho that I am feeling relieved that I am not alone. You are not alone either.  I hit my lowest weight in years on Wednesday, ran nearly my fastest 5k race Thursday morning, fasted until dinner and then fucking ate EVERYTHING and drank wine until I absolutely could not stay at the table anymore from the stomach pain. I had forgotten how enjoyable food could be. Went to the bathroom and felt like I was going to throw up. Not like force myself to throw up, throw up because I physically could not keep so much food in me. Spent the rest of the night miserable. But today the pain is gone and I’m ready to get back to a more normal routine.  Sorry for the vent. Don’t hate yourself and don’t feel like you SHOULD want to purge. ",False,False
