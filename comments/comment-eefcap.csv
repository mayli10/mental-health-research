If I were you, I would see as many different specialists as is needed for you to get diagnosed and finally referred to an appropriate treatment program. You deserve help &amp; health!",False,False

Food isnt the problem. It's possibly the solving/coping mechanism for a deeper seeded problem. Regardless, even if you did this for attention, what does it matter? That fact that behaviours like this consume yours and others lives (including mine at one point not near this extent) make it a legitimate problem needing legitimate help. Dont let others misguided you or say you ""dont look like you have an ED"". ED doesnt care about size gender or anything. Anyone can be a victim. Everyone fighting ED deserves help. Including you. Try a second dietitian, doctor and or, other resouces. What is the worst that can happen? Hope that helps a bit :)",False,False
