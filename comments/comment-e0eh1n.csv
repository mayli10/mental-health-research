Got home, cooked for someone else and decided I could have a little bit more. Ended up having two portions. It only totaled to (TW NUMBERS) 350ish cal for the two portions but it brought me up close to the calorie goal my dietitian wanted and now I feel gross. I’ve been a pound heavier because I’ve literally been full of shit (constipation wooo!) and I was hoping that restricting, hydrating, and lots of coffee would get me down to my next gw by Monday with or without the constipation. And now I feel like I’ve ruined it because I couldn’t keep my mouth shut. I’m hoping that at least the extra food will act as bulk to get my intestines rolling. And I know I’ve basically just hit my BMR, not even my TDEE. But, like, still....",False,False

I cant deny it. Im a self harmer I guess now. I always do this. Something new to replace the old. Some new neurotic habit. Nothing gets better.  My life was over as soon as it began..

So far so good and I'm not even feeling that shitty.  I bought a dress for my prom and my mom told me not to lose weight because it will be saggy on me... On one hand she's right, but on the other, I'm sick and I need to lose. I know it will make her sad. I'm worried.

If it said I burned X calories a day I should have went down further.  I hate my tdee, I’m a high restricter because I can’t function that well on too low calories and don’t want to make the family I live with see me as disordered when some already have yelled at me about my eating habits before. The numbers aren’t lining up and I want to yeet.  I did text one of them how I’ve been feeling down this week and unfocused because due to my grandma’s passing over the summer life is extremely different and I’ve had to change stuff a lot as a result. I haven’t gotten a response which is fine because I’m nervous about the potential consequences of being emotionally open with people so there’s that.  I don’t know how Thanksgiving will be without grandma and I don’t know how much of my feelings I’ll eat the day of and may wind up off for a couple of days due to leftovers too but if the recumbent bike isn’t gonna get moved and gets batteries I know life will be okay and it will work out because I bet the scale will hate me for awhile after Thanksgiving",False,False
