I wouldn’t say it was a cause for my restriction, but I do remember that at my lowest, when I was also a student athlete working out 2x daily, 6 days a week, I lost my period, and it was glorious. I attributed it to my relatively low weight and obsessive exercise, so it was definitely a factor in continuing my behaviors",False,False

I have pretty bad periods (though not as bad as yours, jesus what a nightmare) but I can't be on hormonal birth control because of some genetic risks for clotting. So I literally am motivated to starve in order to stop my periods.  And I have, my periods stopped already with this relapse.",False,False

Gain 10-15 pounds of water weight and bloat so bad I looked 8 months pregnant  b. Hemorrhage. Literally uncontrollably. It was typical for me to bleed through a super tampon and maxi pad in the span of ~4 hours  c. Be bedridden by debilitating cramps. I’d have to stay home from school for 3-5 days, just laying in bed with a barf bucket and heating pad.  d. Be admitted to the ER for IV fluids, pain management, or iron transfusions. Not every month, but pretty damn close.  So yeah, Mirena has been a fucking lifesaver for me.",False,False
