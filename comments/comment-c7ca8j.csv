I was shocked to maintain over 120 recently, but I thank god I haven‚Äôt gained over 123  ever. I was a skinny soft untoned mess all my life. I miss when I was 10 and ate everything in sight and was twig skinny. That was before disordered eating. I don‚Äôt think my body ever recovered from that type of metabolism. I was skinny compared to most people afterwards but the women on my father‚Äôs side of the family are sticks without even trying. I wish I could go on the scale and see 110 or below again.",False,False
