If you are at this point it means you WANT to get better. You need to forgive yourself and really love yourself to make this work. Remind yourself everyday that you deserve happiness and you deserve to eat whatever you want. Meditating really helped me with the self love. I would also recommend keeping a journal and writing about how you are feeling that day.  You ARE going to gain weight. Especially if you have BED , you probably dont know what normal healty portions are. You essentially need to re learn how to eat. Dont even think about trying to lose weight as you try to mend your relationship with food. You are setting yourself up for failure if you do. I've had to learn what it means to actually feel hunger.",False,False
