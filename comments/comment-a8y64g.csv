I’m glad you like your body shape and i wish you were happy with your size. I’m sure you’re perfect and beautiful. Body dysmorphia is a lying bitch. My body shape is literally referred to as banana (which is apparently the most common body shape but I don’t really see it often so idk). It’s banana if I’m underweight or have a higher fat index.  I choose to be skinny because either way I’m going to have no tits and ass. No curves (beside belly and hip dips). At least if I’m underweight I feel like a have a distinguishing feature. Plus I have a naturally un-flat belly so being smaller helps that situation. It makes no sense and I know that. I know many people would prefer me with a little more belly just to have a little more everything else but I don’t care at this point. My disordered eating and body image has little to do with actually being attractive ,False,False
