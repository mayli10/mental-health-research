My situation is slightly different to yours in that I had anxiety + panic attacks so bad I was off work for 4 months, then I relapsed and it eased my anxiety a lot BC it gave me something else to focus on",False,False

As someone who also has an abusive background, I find it that I do better with managing stress when I feel ""successful"" in my ED. I tend to be less suicidal and less impulsive with self harm when I feel in control of my ED. I definitely understand the lesser of two evils",False,False

A bad one, but it is one. A fellow PTSD sufferer here, and I fully understand that. But, life would be a lot better for you if you found a healthy coping mechanism. You may not feel ready for that, and that's okay, but please keep it in the back of your mind- there are other things that could do what your AN is doing for you that wouldnt also endanger your life. Much love to you",False,False
