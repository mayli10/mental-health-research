I guess I've never really thought about it. I've always been five pounds or so shy of overweight and been uncomfortable with my body but still okay.

It takes no pressure at all to cut off circulation. I had to wear plus size tights back when I was a US size 4 pant. I was dating a guy at the time who constantly forced pictures of 70-90 lb e-girls he was talking to onto me so I wanted to shrink to nothing so he'd stop hurting me, so he'd love me instead of telling me I was fat.   After that, I experienced serious changes to my body (same guy forced himself onto me immediately after I broke up with him and made me stay with him for the pregnancy, birth, and adoption) leaving me with diastasis recti, a separation of abdominal muscles that can only be kind of mitigated. I have a big apron of stretch marks and horror, skin my abdomen isn't able to carry so it's just warped flab. I didn't recognize my body anymore, just wanted to starve in hopes that one day I would again.   I left him and am with someone who genuinely cares now, but the desire to shrink to nothing still exists. Maybe it's Peter Pan Syndrome. Maybe I hope it kills me. Maybe I want to make my illnesses more visually important so people will take them seriously. Maybe I want to fill the role my ex wanted to be as a coping mechanism.
