I rarely see people on here who binge as much or often as I do (barring people who binge/purge [in this case I'm talking about bingeing with keeping the Calories inside of them]), but I come on here because my BED has morphed over the years (purging, fasting, restricting, inching closer and closer to my UGW, etc.), but if you want to see people talk about bingeing, like actual bingeing bingeing, head on over to r/bingeeatingdisorder.",False,False

It used to not be this bad but I probably don’t go more than a week of restricting without binging. Right now I’m on day 9 of binging 👌🏽👌🏽👌🏽,False,False

I know longer keep binge-food in my house so it's rarely ever spontaneous unless someone has given me food. Sometimes I will plan a binge. It's never worth it.  If I am consistency restricting and counting calories, I usually binge twice a month, and it lasts one-two days depending on if I throw out whatever was triggering me and don't dig it out again :/",False,False

At my worst I’d be binging two or three times a day, with each binge being anywhere from 1,000 to 5,000 calories. As my anxiety’s gotten worse (I’m too ashamed to ask my mum to buy me binge food) my binges have decreased, as there just isn’t enough food in he house lol. Nowadays I usually binge about once a week, although sometimes it’s multiple times in one day. The calorie count’s usually below 2,000 though. ",False,False
