If been very afraid of getting close to a guy. Like who thw fuck finds me attractive dude I look like a slobby mess.  But for some weirs reason I feel quite comfortable around my bf. I felt like this from the beginning. Don't get me wrong I still have all my issues. But he knows how to help me with them and stuff.  Maybe the right partner helps.,False,False

The thought of getting physically close to any guy that shows interest makes me crinnggee. I’ve convinced myself that when I really reach my ideal weight (which, joke’s on me, is never enough), I could date like a normal person, but until then I dodge men like my life depends on it. Lol so yeah let’s be alone together.",False,False
