I found my bed too painful to sleep in and it was difficult to sleep any way, I watched a lot of late night tv, so I would often sleep on the sofa which was really soft. One night, I had been up watching the games till 4 am and it was hot so I left the window open (Ireland, it was a heatwave). The room was in darkness. I just saw the curtain move as someone started to step in through the window. I screamed for my brothers and that poor bastard got back out that window as fast as I could. Didn‚Äôt see him for dust. I still chuckle when I think of the shock he must have gotten.",False,False
