I am not and was never a 44DDD or whatever ridiculous number they told me. I was more a 38/40 C everywhere else. VS is stupid. Go to Target,False,False

I've internalized a lot of shit about my weight and wore around a 38/40DD when after properly measuring myself I'm a 32GGG   American sizing is fucked. Felt super good to get an accurate band measurement without wanting to throw up!!",False,False

But yeah fuck VS. I was just there today and they don't have a size for me either as I need a 28/30 and the smallest there is a 32. I'm not NEARLY as thin as the models..so I' m wondering what size they  would wear?? VS really just doesn't have a wide enough size range to have a well-fitting bra for everyone, so they're pretty much useless as a lingerie company.",False,False
