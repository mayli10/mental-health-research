The competitive nature of my ED is SO bad. I have a feeling with New Years Resolutions AND a new policy on weight at work, imma be in for a hell of a few months. If anyone around me is openly dieting- I literally. Can. Not. force myself to eat more around them. It’s insanely strong. My calories can’t be higher, portions bigger, choices “less healthy”. I’ve had to beg people not to talk about it in front of me because I’m so fucked in this way.  Flip side, I love counting other people’s high calorie meals and feeling sickly superior even though healthy me doesn’t feel that way.",False,False

Like, it felt easier to concentrate on homework in high school or in the gen ed classes in university because ""whatever, they don't matter... I'll just do my homework begrudgingly and be done with it"" vs. the senior level classes which I ONLY NEED TO BARELY PASS in order to graduate.     Likewise, you could probably feel ""more validated"" in your ED because there's more pressure on you (from your own brain) to not fuck up, which mostly leads to erratic overeating.  For her, it's more likely a ""bonus"" to skip a meal here or there or go running a few miles every few weeks.  No pressure, less thought involved, and probably little to no binges.     But as far as having to be around that... idk, might be fun to imagine yourself as the carefree person who ""chooses"" to skip meals cause you're not hungry.  Or when you do eat, it's because you have a damn good reason to.     IMO though, eating habits aren't what validate or invalidate your ED.  She's not ""better than you"" at having an ED, restricting, etc.; she's just fortunate to not be as consumed by it all.  And if she's gonna continue her societal dieting, I wouldn't attempt to keep up regular mealtimes around her.",False,False
