As a general rule they don't need to get your specific weight, just a general ballpark number so they can clock any dramatic changes. Plus you'll have been dressed which makes way more of a difference than you'd think. I've been weighed at a few medical places and I always ask if I need to take my shoes off, and the answer is always ""nah, we'll just take a kg off, it'll be close enough"". So if you were wearing your shoes then that accounts for 2ish of those lbs.   Also, congratulations on getting into nursing school! That's such a big achievement, you should be proud!",False,False

My mom used to work in hospitals as a labrotory med tech, and she used to get SO annoyed at how inaccurate the scales are, since they aren't held to the same strict accuracy standards that the labs maintain for their equipment (even though weight readings can be equally important information, especially for calculating the dose for some medications!). Apparently at the hospital she worked at they rarely ever changed the scale batteries, or re-calibrated the scale after each use",False,False

And doctors scales are all kinds of effed up. My doctor used to weigh me on her digital scale ON CARPET and it always read crazily wrong. And slide scales get shifted about so much that they lose accuracy quickly. I think someone mentioned about about lots of sizes using them too and that makes a difference. When they‚Äôre weighing 15kg children and 300kg bariatric patients on the same scales, you obviously lose calibration quickly. In short, you‚Äôd need a high tech, freshly calibrated industrial scale to get your ‚Äútruest‚Äù weight but your home scale gives absolutely the best sense of trend (ie losing 10kgs according to your home scale used under the same conditions every day is an accurate indicator that you‚Äôve lost 10kg).",False,False

For myself, and my toddlers, they always start at a way higher weight &amp; I have to tell that the range I expect, they lower it to that and then kind of just settle on something as the weight is balancing  Plus... clothes? Food? A sandwich and a drink is going to weigh a lot in your stomach even though the weight of the food/beverage has no effect on weight game",False,False

I know it doesnt seem like it should be that way, bc you would *think* a scale at a doctors office would be the most precise, but your home scale is actually better. So dont stress about it üíï",False,False
