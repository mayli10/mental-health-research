I‚Äôve had 4 super long haul and 3 short flights in the last 2.5 weeks and despite vowing I‚Äôd eat nothing it didn‚Äôt happen. On the first long haul I refused the meal, but I‚Äôd ordered veggie so every time I got served first and it was impossible to keep refusing. Thought I could resist the food - nope. Even though it was awful.   Then spent layover time pacing frantically up and down airport corridors. None of the damn airports were big enough to hide what I was doing, felt like everyone was staring at me. ",False,False
