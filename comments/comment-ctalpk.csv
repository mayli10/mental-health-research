(Naturally cause your restricting.) The alcohol acts as a stimulant and a sedative on your body. What could be happening is subconsciously or consciously you’re using alcohol to offset the effects of restricting.   Alcohol sugars aren’t absorbed the same way as normal sugar but the mind does crave it the same way it craves sugar. When your tongue tastes the sugar in the alcohol. Your mind subconsciously or consciously wants to just binge drink the sugary liquid and to replace the lost carbs.   Naturally the ethanol lowers you inhibitions and you keep drinking.   I kind of follow the same behavior you posted above. I have written about it in previous posts. If you want I can discuss with you further.  Hope my sharing helped.,False,False
