When you eat cake, you're supposed to be ""happy"". Cake is the ultimate symbol of indulgence (looking at you, Marie). There are so many more connotations with cake than there are of other foods with the exact same nutritional value. I can totally see how it could be a binge trigger!",False,False

My dad regularly gets chocolate cake from the grocery store and I never fail to eat half in one sitting (I leave enough for him bc I feel bad). I’d eat the whole thing if I knew he wasn’t going to have any. Cakes and pies. Basically if it’s up to me to cut a “slice”, that means I’m just taking the whole thing with me to my room.",False,False

It was my mum's birthday yesterday and we had this ice cream cake which was soooo good I couldn't help myself from going into the freezer in the middle of the night and binging on 3 more slices,False,False
