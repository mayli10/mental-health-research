I felt like a weird mishmash of symptoms and it always bothered me. But one day in college (I forgot which class it was), the prof showed us the spectrum of eating behaviors. I never ever thought that eating behaviors could be a spectrum but after seeing that, it made perfect sense. Although I don't have a clear cut eating disorder, I'm definitely under the disordered eating category. I have a link for the spectrum if you want to check it out. It gave me some weird sense of peace I guess lol   [https://imgur.com/gallery/vhqCYyL](https://imgur.com/gallery/vhqCYyL)",False,False

All that matters is that you're happy, confident, and healthy. If you are not those things, you owe it to yourself  to strive for those things in a productive manner. Why does it matter if you have an ED or not if you ""\[binge\] til it hurts"" and you ""also feel shitty about it"" and you purge? Like, why not fix those things regardless of the diagnosis. Taking that mindset is way easier than fixing the ED-imposter syndrome everyone seems to have.",False,False
