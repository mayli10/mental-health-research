Thankfully I’m feeling a lot better right now than I did last night after I processed all the information, and yeah opening up about such a sensitive topic after 3 weeks is a no-no Obviously if I keep having feelings for him I’m going to distance myself from him a bit because I don’t want to ruin his relationship though...",False,True

Firstly, don't ever be friends with someone who you are romantically interested in if they don't reciprocate those feelings. If you choose to remain friends if they don't like you romantically, then you'll need to accept and respect that and never think of the possibility of getting together with them as a couple. Too many issues come about when people complain about being in the ""friend zone"" when they were never even considered a potential romantic/sexual partner in the first place. I would say figure out where the lines draw for you and him sooner rather than later. If you're going to get jealous over him dating another girl or if you start comparing yourself to her, then you simply shouldn't be friends with him--at least not best friends.  Regarding telling him about your ED... uh, no. At least not yet. Definitely not after 3 weeks. You may think you know him, that you are similar people, but you've only known him for 3 weeks. You can't really trust him. And you don't know how he will react. Some people don't want to deal with other peoples' mental problems, which is completely understandable. It can be too much baggage.  If you guys do remain friends or start dating or whatever you decide, then you can revisit telling him about your ED. But don't expect him to just accept it and support you because not everyone is like that. I'd try to bring up a topic about mental health with him and see how he reacts. But I definitely wouldn't tell him until you actually know him. 3 weeks isn't enough time to truly know someone.   I mean if you don't care about people talking about your ED with others without your consent, then by all means, you can tell him. But I'd say you should develop a more trusting bond (after deciding if you can stay in the ""friend zone"" comfortably) and learn more about him before you spring your mental issues on him.",False,False
