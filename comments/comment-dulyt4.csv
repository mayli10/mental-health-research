This is truly my favorite online community. We're all fucked up but we love and support each other so much whether we're ready to recover or not and that's just the purest shit.             I wouldn't have made this decision without u guys. Having someone to talk to about the ups and downs of anorexia really helped me get through it. Being able to relate to others showed me that I'm not uniquely crazy. And all the posts about ppl deciding to recover really intrigued me so I'd look at their post history and relate to them a LOT. That showed me I'm not too fucked up to recover, and I'm also ""sick enough"" to recover.             And let's be real I'll probably relapse again. But if that happens I'll know who to run to. And you'll welcome me with open arms again and again. That's somethin really special. So even though I'm trying to recover I'm always gonna wanna be a part of this support network so I can do the same for anyone else struggling. Cuz I genuinely love you all.",False,True
