If you drink 3 lbs of water, you will be 3 lbs heavier. until you pee it out. but sometimes you only pee out 1 lb because your body is like ""hey I'm just going to hold onto this 2 lbs of water for a while""  water retention can happen due to dehydration (if you are dehydrated and then drink a lot of water, sometimes your body will take a while to ""process"" it) or due to recovering muscles (this is why it's so common for weight to go up when fasting and exercising even though that causes a 1000 or 2000 calorie deficit) or due to hormones (for biologically female people)  basically, don't sweat it. you totally lost fat if you fasted for 3 days. Your body is not broken, you're just retaining water. It will come off eventually!",False,False
