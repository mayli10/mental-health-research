All of my hunger is mental. On the rare occasion I do feel physical hunger, it doesn’t make me feel the need to eat bc I like the feeling of hunger (lol). But the whole thing makes me feel bad bc I’m so much more likely to eat when I’m not hungry and then I hate myself more for eating cos it’s like why am I eating I’m not even hungry",False,False

I feel guilty for not being hungry but then at the end of the day of no food I’m like “well maybe I should eat 100 calories” and THEN I’m like but WAIT! Shouldn’t I want to continue this fast for as long as possible.,False,True

It means I’ve been consistent with my eating for a long period of time, and losing just gets easier and easier. It feels like transcendance lol",False,False
