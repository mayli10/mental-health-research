Had an ultrasound which showed my gallbladder was full of stones and severely inflamed. Had surgery the same day. Iâ€™ve had no problems since and the relief is AMAZING. Itâ€™s common for attacks to last up to 12 hours so you could definitely still be feeling it the next day.,False,False

Iâ€™m starting to think it might be that, it would make sense. Idk itâ€™s the next morning and I still have a small burn going on. How did you find out you had an issue with yours? Gastro? Or did you end up in the hospital from it originally",False,True

Iâ€™m thinking potential gallstones/gallbladder attack with the severe pain after eating. Eating disorders can fuck up your gallbladder big time (recently had to get mine removed) and a gallbladder attack is the most excruciating thing Iâ€™ve ever experienced. Hugs ðŸ’”,False,False

Tried gaining weight on purpose and failed because I just got too sick. It was easier when I stopped trying I guess. But yeah being bloated and in pain and other stuff all the time really sucks. Not eating would be preferable. I think my problem is a bit of a mix between damage from ED and genetic stuff I inherited from my mom,False,False

I feel like I always have digestive issues, but this severe pain is pretty new. Iâ€™m worried after such a long time something is wrong internally. I just donâ€™t even know what to do anymore. The pain just makes it easier to not eat which just brings me back to square one of being my EDâ€™s bitch. Ugh. Life, dude! Too much.",False,True

Personally eating normal amounts causes me a lot of pain, so I have to be very careful about how I get my calories. Sometimes I'll order food from a restaurant I've never been to and the portion sizes will be huge, but I eat it anyway and then I'll feel really sick after. I've been trying to eat normally for quite a while now though, so I know it's not just because my stomach is too small. I'm worried something is pretty wrong so I'm waiting to see a specialist about it. If you feel like you can relate it might be worth going to see a gastroenterologist.",False,False
