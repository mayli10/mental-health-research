Even if you aren't overweight, there were always comments to help you be ""mindful"" of your size. Like it wasn't on your mind 24/7. I cant say anything to make the comments less hurtful, but it is just their own insecurities reflected on you. You are more than your weight and you cannot control their comments but you can have your own self perception and know who you are and what size you are. I know this is the most unhelpful comment you could get but hang in there. ",False,False
