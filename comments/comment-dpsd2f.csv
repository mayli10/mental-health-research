It's getting in the way of my education. I failed all of my courses last year because of it and I'm trying even harder this semester, but I'm still falling behind. I often end up stuck in bed all day because it gets bad. And the person who was supposed to help ignored me, so it's not like I'm going to get any better before the end of this semster :(",False,False

That’s why I brought it up.  Maybe also buy some probiotics?   You’re right there are endless possibilities when you start comparing. It will be figured out though!!,False,True

Like, maybe twice this year? I kind of do a little now, but I think it's because I ate more than usual. The food I ate probably just doesn't fit in my stomach.  Bacteria could play a role in my symptoms, but I don't think it's the main problem. One time I ate something from a restaurant I hadn't been too before that seemed kind of cheap and ended up sick for 5 weeks straight. I saw a clinic doctor who said it was probably a virus or bacteria causing inflammation so he gave me medicine for that and it helped. Another time I tried the same medicine because I had the same problem and it kind of made me feel worse. Sometimes ginger and turmeric tea helps, but other times ot does nothing at all. Medication can sometimes mask the symptoms, but I never actually feel better from it. If something I read about gut bacteria is true then I may be sensitive to different bacteria because I had trouble eating as a baby until I had a surgery when I was around 3 years old. I read that in the early part of your life your immune system becomes trained to ignore the bacteria in your gut and that can influence the rest of your life. Maybe I'm just more sensitive now than before because of problem with my GI tract that is somehow made worse by bacteria? There are so many possibilities base don what little I do know that I couldn't begin to guess. The most I have to go on is comparing my symptoms to those of different illnesses.",False,False

You feel like something is going wrong in your body, get a doctor who can help :)   In the mean time though, try and write down everything you eat and if there is pain/what kind of pain afterwards. If you went in to the doc with that kind of info, it might help them figure it out!  I just picked up some off brand Prilosec OTC and it feels like it’s already working!

My GP did refer me to gastroenterologist, but he refused to help me because I weigh a few pounds more than some arbitrary number he came up with. I'm a little on the tall side though so I'm at the same BMI as a girl of average height at that weight. It's really dumb. He did order a CT scan, but he literally said it was to make me feel better. He clearly had no interest in helping me. Maybe he'll change his mind when I have the follow up appointment for the scan, but I'm probably going to have to wait to see another gastroenterologist since he sucks.",False,False

My pain is usually after eating, but sometimes not. It can be at unusual times. Stomach pain is only ever after eating though, so I have to imagine it's related to digestion. Digestion can be sped up or slowed down in a number of ways, so it's hard to say. I find it tends to come a number of locations repeatedly, but too many to point out. They're always the same spots though. That's why I'm worried it's ulcers or some kind of damage.",False,False
