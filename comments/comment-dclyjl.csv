I was in the same place last year- not going to classes at all because I was too busy bping. Please, please, please try to get help. Walking into the counseling center was the hardest and most embarrassing thing I‚Äôve done in my life- and for the first few months I regretted doing it- but now I see how much life I‚Äôve gotten back. My eating disorder was stopping me from being a good student, and killing my career dreams, among SO many other things. Once I figured this out for myself, I decided to get better. Try to find anything you can think of that bping is taking away from you, and focus on how much you want that aspect of your life back. I don‚Äôt know if this‚Äôll help for you, but I hope it does. &lt;3",False,False
