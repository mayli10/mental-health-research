I also eat around the chocolate chips in cookies and then eat those last. Also, whenever I eat like pancakes, rice, beans, or something like that on a plate, I always cut it into squares and eat the same amount off of each side. I also always eat the skin off apples before I eat the rest, same with oranges.",False,False

(eight grapes. sixteen pretzels.) liquids are consumed four sips at a time, or four gulps if it's water. i eat a pyrex cup of oatmeal/flaxmeal thickened with psyllium first thing every day, and eat it ridiculously slowly. gotta let it drop off the spoon and only eat what sticks.   here's one of my favorite meals/rituals: 5-6"" banana. cut it into inch-long pieces. each inch is 15 calories. slice each piece into 1/4"" slices, then each slice in half. cook up a veggie burger [70-160 calories. boca spicy chick'n is 160 but so worth it.] with some onions and cabbage in light margarine. the burger gets cut in 6 pieces like a pie or a pizza would be. each triangle-like piece gets cut into 4 smaller triangles. everything goes onto a plate and is eaten with chopsticks. yes, even the banana. it's difficult to pick up so it makes it take longer to eat, so the meal is more satisfying. then it goes like this: four bites of cabbage/onions. one piece of burger. four bites of cabbage. one piece of burger. four pieces of banana. four gulps of water. repeat until meal is finished.

I can‚Äôt just eat the chicken on its own.   I always like a ton of sauce on anything I eat but I prefer to dip rather than put it all over my food for the most part. Condiments are my best friend. Any type of salsa, hot sauce, Asian sauce like XO is amazing. I also love an expensive sweet chili jam üòç but I try not to allow myself to binge on expensive food. ",False,False
