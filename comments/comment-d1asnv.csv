And I am looking so bright and shiny according to her. Like every damn time I am walking in her office she asks me if I have stopped dieting cause I look so energized and she can't believe how I can't have bags under my eyes. I am not sure if she thinks Ed patients actually wear Chanel under their eyes cause my eyes are really dark. My fucking mailman asked me if I was sick and stopped me a week letter in the street to ask me if I really wasn't sick. The mail man.   Some therapists just aren't a good fit. They may try to do some sort of roundabout therapy where their comments are supposed to help you push through some things, but if it is just a trigger and the therapist doesn't see that then the basics are wrong.    And if you really want to help yourself you should make sure you have got a therapist whom you feel OK with.",False,False

This therapist just might not be a good fit for you, and maybe itâ€™s a good time to find a new therapist who specializes in AN. Generally, therapists understand that this happens, and he would probably be more than willing to refer you to someone else. You deserve to feel heard, understood, and not triggered in therapy.",False,False
