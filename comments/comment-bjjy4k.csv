You're naturally tired and deprived of energy after a day of restriction, and your body needs calories and fat to keep going.",False,False

I ate over 2,000 Calories in less than 5 minutes, I wasn't at all full, and my stomach wasn't at all distended.   I honestly don't know how normal people eat that kind of stuff. Any kind of spread like that (cookie butter, Nutella, are the same).  As for nut butters, I have a small amount of orthorexic tendencies, so while small quantities do make me feel better, my BED gets triggered at anything that is more than like 45 Calories worth of that shit, so it really does feel like a waste.  My solution is to eat three nuts every night. If I want peanut butter, I'll spend those three nuts on whole peanuts. Whole nuts are still high in Calories, but idk, they make me feel less shitty about my gluttony than nut butters.",False,False

If you have a trader joe's nearby, their regular peanut butter is a LOT less sweet than other brands (jif, skippy, etc) and for me, at least, it has less of a chance of triggering that chain-reaction spoon eating you mention (and i recognize very well).",False,False
