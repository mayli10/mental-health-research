I thought it was a total loss to post my location but would love a venting buddy! I really do want to be healthy but... this just works so well. I stopped tracking calories and I'm basically on autopilot. It's awful. New to reddit but going to see if I can figure out how to send you a message. üéÑ,False,True

I need to write that shit on my fridge.   I'm also proud of you, not restricting when you hit a plateau is difficult. It's not easy to be self aware and then act against instincts.   I'm really hoping that when I get to 150 that I can maintain a range within 10 lbs of that and not reach an under weight category. Last time that I was - I was also fainting often. Bald spots. I am realizing I need to reach out more because I passed out in a train at SFO airport last week and I almost feel like a pro. I sat down before it happened so I didnt get a concussion? üï§üí£   Thank you. Truly.",False,True

I‚Äôve been the same underweight weight for months and do high restriction, or else I‚Äôd be fainting on the clock.   I know a good way to healthily gain weight back, especially if you‚Äôre training, is reverse dieting. You slowly increase your caloric intake by about 100-200 every week or two until you get it back up to maintenance.  It works! I‚Äôve tried it. It helps retain and build muscle while your metabolism adjusts and keeps fat off.",False,False
