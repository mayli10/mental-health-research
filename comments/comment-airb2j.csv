When I lived with my ex I never binged, then when we broke up and I lived on my own that was ALL I did. Now that I live with family, I very rarely binge. ",False,False

Although, to be honest, I’d stand a better chance of learning to eat right if someone was here.  But then others times I LOVE that I can get away with these weird habits.  I’m so thankful for this sub to see other ppl that understand the struggle.  It’s a silent battle I’ve had since probably kindergarten.",False,False

I can consume disgusting quantities of junk food without restraint, and it shows now.   I don’t have to hide wrappers or containers or worry I’ll get caught.  I’m now cycling back to my high restriction habits, that all or nothing thinking, and no one knows about that either.  Living alone has allowed me to do that without feeling judged and I post messages and pictures everywhere that encourage this.   I know this isn’t a healthy way to get over my BED and that living alone has just encouraged my EDs.  I wish I had someone to hold me accountable.  It’s my big, ugly secret and no one knows how it controls your life.",False,False
