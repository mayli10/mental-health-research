I wanted to give my best answer to you :) - Recovering from an eating disorder isn't easy but I want you to recognize your strength for trying to get better. Everyone has their own set of time it takes them to improve with eating and even minor differences with food behavior are milestones. For some, it's a journey to reach that point of wanting to recover and then actually taking the steps to try and do it is a whole other battle. The fact that you are trying and wanting to get better is so wonderful and I'm proud of you for it! I encourage you to not give up with getting better despite any obstacles that are troubling to you right now.    It is unfortunately common to struggle with healthier eating habits and sometimes even have moments where you shift to the unhealthy behaviors you used to engage in. A setback in your progress of improving does NOT at all make you a failure please know that. At the end of the day we are just struggling humans who are only trying to do our best. It's hard to have self compassion but truly try to be kind to yourself. You deserve to recover and most importantly, there is always a possibility of recovering even when you're in doubt. Doubt can be powerful and paralyzing. Sometimes it leaves you with a lack of hope or a feeling of being stuck and thinking there is no escape to your problem. Just know that none of this is really true! Getting better can eventually be within your reach. Especially if you continue to have days where you are trying to eat more normally. You will have good days with recovery and days where you don't do as well. This doesn't define you or your chances to a different life. This is all part of the process of recovery just remember that.   It's good to have a support system with your family and/or friends but if you haven't sought out this option, professional help specifically someone who specializes in eating disorders may be able to help you in this process. People who we are closest to can't always understand us or what we're going through. Take what you said yourself as an example, ""people just say listen to your body."" Even if a professional told you that, there are some other professionals that are very educated and knowledgable about your certain circumstance. I'm sure someone could offer helpful advice or coping skills for you to get through this even just a therapist as a sounding board to your mind can make a difference.   One other thing I'd like to add is eventually your body will adjust and you'll be more in tact with hunger cues. I have gone through recovery myself and didn't understand my body or it's needs especially at the start of the process. This understanding of your body will take time of course and how long it takes is probably different for everyone. I advise you though to be open and honest about not knowing hunger cues to a professional again if you decide to do so maybe someone in the medical field like a doctor or nutritionist (someone who understands the way bodies function). They can help you navigate this as it's occurring and could maybe give some insight to you.   Please stay strong throughout this. I bet once you make it to the other side of recovery the one where you're doing better, you will look back on everything and feel like it was all worth it in the end. I am wishing you the best and hope something I said helped!",False,False

Keep reaching out-there is bravery in grasping at recovery. I see it like others as steadfastness. Your current behaviors donâ€™t define you. You have the freedom to be ok. Just say that last phrase out loud . Not the phrase I allowed my self .,False,False
