I don’t necessarily binge, but i eat things i do not eat during the week. So this morning i had a bagel with cream cheese. I may eat a little something special for dinner but I’m not sure yet. Normally i plan these things out really well but the only thing i planned this week was the bagel. Tomorrow i May have a small treat but basically back to business and then back on track Monday :)",False,False
