No salt is for potassium so I don’t see why you couldn’t use light salt if you wanted. ,False,False

Take 1 liter of water and mix in 1 tsp of Himalayan pink salt and 1 tsp of no salt. Drink it throughout the day and I promise you will feel so much better.   I fast for 5-7 days at a time when I get on a streak of bad days and that’s the only thing that keeps me from passing out. Learned this trick from watching Cole Robinson’s videos on YouTube. He’s the creator of the “snake diet” which is a fasting based diet.   Stay safe. I hope you feel better soon. ,False,False
