A lot of people have bad reactions to these foods at first, until their system gets used to it. This is why kimchi has a bad reputation among people who primarily consume a Standard American Diet and try kimchi once. They like it, so they eat a lot of it, but then later they have a bad time in the bathroom and assume that that's what will happen every time. Start with just a little, and work your way up. That said, fermented vegetable foods like kimchi, sauerkraut, and others might be good for someone in your situation because they are ""pre-digested"" by the lactobacteria. ",False,False
