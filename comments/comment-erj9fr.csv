I literally made a rant on my ed blog about this. Like, no food EVER is good, especially since I am basically a drama queen who only thinks in extremes. When I really start to spiral I get nervous about fucking water and veggies like ‚Äúomg but what ph water and is it filtered and are these veggies fresh and organic because if not then it‚Äôs not worth the calories‚Äù. Or the amount of times I‚Äôve googled ‚Äúvegan keto recipes‚Äù because I want to have best of both worlds.",False,False

It sucks and I‚Äôm nervous to eat because it I eat too much I get an allergic reaction (EoE causes white blood cells to fill up your esophagus) and it feels like I‚Äôm choking. Was fucking great to get out of 3 months of rehab and immediately diagnosed with that. It‚Äôs easier not to eat.,False,False

It's so much easier to just not eat.   But I know personally I feel the best when I stick to a Paleo type diet. I have a friend who is 100% Paleo for health reasons and I never feel sick after eating her food, never feel bloated or heavy or like I need to run to poop, and still feel like I get a well rounded meal every time.",False,False

Vegan means nothing to health, you could be eating deep fried vegetables /chips all day everyday and be vegan. Keto is healthy for epilepsy, reversing diabetes and fertility and can be healthy if done correctly (not huge reliance on cheese and meat, eating nuts, fish and avocado). High Carb low fat means nothing in terms of health, you could eat only sugar and it'll be HCLF, carnivore isn't healthy in general.",False,False
