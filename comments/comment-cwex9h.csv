It's so hard to feel a connection to people when they're all just so... typical? Like everyone is so boring and disappoints me as much as I feel like I disappoint everyone else. So, I don't really want to be around them at all but I force myself to sometimes just to feel like a real person. Yet, in the end I always end up feeling like this? It sucks and I'm trying to go to therapy (insert laugh track because I've been through that for years without much to show for it cause I'm that bitch). Yknow, I genuinely hope that you and me, both, can find something that gives us a spark of joy.",False,True

My ED is all I have, it's the only thing giving me any sense of control or productivity.  I'm a depressed anxious mess with suicidal ideation for over a decade now. The ED thing is pretty recent (since spring 2018) but I've thrown myself into it because I've nothing else. I'm unemployed, don't really talk to anybody, live alone and I only leave the house for walks/runs when I can. When I think about making friends (really, I just make strangers out of everybody I meet/know) it's not just that I'm awkward (or ""wEiRd"") it's that I don't really like anybody? So of course I'm going to die alone.  I think about grad school, getting an internship or a basic job (part time jobs/grocery store or retail jobs aren't a thing here) but it's all too much.  I know I'm not lucky enough to successfully die, I just wish I could fall into a coma, lose all consciousness or stop exisiting.   Hang in there ðŸ’•  I'm sorry I can't be helpful, but just know you're not alone. I do hope things somehow get better for you.  There are awful days, worse days and the absolute worst days, we just gotta live to see another awful day I guess ðŸ˜­",False,False
