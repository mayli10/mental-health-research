Get a second opinion or third until you feel like you've talked to a doctor who actually listens to what you're saying. Even if the problem isn't physical, but mental as eating disorders are then the doctor should be providing other forms of support like referring for therapy or dietician!

Everything was normal. :-) I don't have an ED and all the pain was in my head  Well, that being said, my red blood cells are borderline, but my doctor didn't seem too concerned with it, and just said my chest pain may be costochondritis, but must have also been partly anxiety.. I. Don't. Even. Have. Anxiety.   Since all of it was in my head, I wasted three days to bingeing, trying to fix a problem that probably wasn't even there. I shot up like 5 pounds for no reason. I'm such an idiot. Most of the pain is gone, but some of it is still there, so idk. I'm just going to continue fasting and b/p'ing because obviously my body is still perfectly healthy and I still have 10 pounds to lose.  I feel so stupid. I was in so much pain that I was in tears the other day. My brain is broken. My body is not.",False,False
