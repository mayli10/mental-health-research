Bruising is more common in people with poor nutrition. It doesn't sound like a rash. Go see a doctor if they get bigger (bruises don't do that) or if you have any other symptoms or a rash develops (like if the skin itches). I'd show it to your school nurse just to be safe...,False,False

It is blood vessels showing because there is not enough fat on your body. It is harmless and will go away when you are better nourished and have gained some weight back in those areas. I was worried too but it is completely ok :),False,False
