Cheese is more solid and therefore more trustworthy to be scraped.,False,False

You can always fast or do other damage control beforehand or afterwards. One really nice romantic date night dinner won’t ruin you.   Don’t let your ED ruin literally every aspect of your life. There’s options.,False,False

Some Marsala is made with heavy cream and butter, some with coconut milk and oil, etc. Then some eggplant Parmesan is breaded and baked with only a bit of cheese, some is deep fried and then baked, some has a lot of cheese, some uses mozzarella, some only Parmesan, etc.   Going off of nothing I’d say it’s a crapshoot. If you scrape cheese off, my best guess is eggplant Parmesan is lower. Probably not by much.",False,False
