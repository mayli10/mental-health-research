I use Cronometer to track my nutrition personally. It's not perfect as some foods haven't been added to their database or have incorrect information, but it's well enough to get a general idea of what you're eating. I know that my hands and feet used to get numb and tingly when I was at my lowest weight. I started losing weight again after my symptoms got worse and I noticed that coming back, but after I started focusing more on nutrition it stopped.   When you say visual disturbances I assume that you mean things like seeing something move in a shadow or your vision distorting. That can be a symptom of high stress. Well, I suppose I'm not sure how normal healthy people's brains respond to lots of stress, but I have BPD so I'm really sensitive to stress and I used to get symptoms like those when I was really bad. I also have ADHD so until I started taking medication for it the other day it was impossible for me to ever relax.  Regarding dizziness, confusion, and spacing out. I have noticed that this is something which occurs for me as my ADHD medication starts to wear off. It can last for hours. I had assumed that was normal, but thinking more on it I suppose it could be because ADHD meds are an appetite suppressant, so I don't eat as much.  Migraines can be tough to treat, but I find that personally eating more carbs and consuming caffeine helps. My doctor recommended that actually. When I do get a really bad migraine I take acetaminophen for it. I have some pills which have the medicine and caffeine that work really well.",False,False

I hope you can find someone who helps for you üòî my neurologist doctor guy, the one who ordered all these tests, doesn‚Äôt think there‚Äôs anything actually wrong with me except ‚Äúheightened reflexes‚Äù and that it‚Äôs all just part of some kind of psychiatric issue but he wants me tested for literally everything it could possibly be, just to make sure. I‚Äôve been trying to get this fixed since last summer and so far I‚Äôve been put on like four different medications that were meant to help, and passed around from doctor to doctor, and no one has really helped üòÖ  At first I thought it was entirely related to the restriction/purging. Dizziness, random spells of confusion, memory problems and ‚Äúspacing out‚Äù really badly, plus CFS symptoms like chronic fatigue, post exertional malaise, and full body nerve pain. Then I also get migraines, stabbing pains similar to what you described, random numbness/tingling in my hands, and random visual disturbances (which the doctor said ‚Äúmay be psychiatric‚Äù so idk but they showed up at the same time...). Because I‚Äôm in pseudo-recovery, I have gained a LOT of weight and I know that it is no longer likely to be a weight-related issue, but maybe it‚Äôs tied to some kind of damage I did while purging? Idk sorry for the essay ! ‚ô•Ô∏è",False,True

The nurse was talking about how small my veins were. She couldn't get enough blood out of the vein when she tried to go around the spot from the first one. She had to go right through a spot that was still healing to get enough blood. The most help I have actually gotten so far is a gastroenterologist telling me to try fiber then prescribing a laxative when that dodn't help. He finally agreed to look inside me, but he hasn't been very helpful yet.  May I ask why you're seeing a neurologist? What symptoms do you have? I get migraines, lethargy, nausea, bloating, general abdominal pain, localized stabbing pains in repeat locations, and it seems that I don't process food I eat properly as it was very difficult for me gain any weight. I have come close to fainting a number of times, but it hasn't happened yet thankfully. I'm pretty sure this is all caused by my restricting. Would you say that you're in a similar situation?",False,False
