Yeah i feel guilty eating but i can't help it. I survived for months without any solid food and nobody can tell what's going on so i don't think there is anything wrong with me.,False,True

An ED is NOT about fitting into any dumb criteria, itâ€™s not about what you weighed or what you weigh now. Itâ€™s disordered eating, itâ€™s having a bad relationship with food, itâ€™s about an obsession with your weight, whatever that may be. Does that sound familiar? Youâ€™ve been going without solid foods for months. I assume you feel very tired and lethargic?   The voice in your head telling you that you donâ€™t have an ED, even though youâ€™re already underweight and want to lose more, is telling you this because it doesnâ€™t want you to realise that itâ€™s harmful. Itâ€™s trying to tell you that you can keep going. But you canâ€™t, not like this, not without any food at all. Talk to us about it and get yourself some help, or else your body is going to give in.   I wish you the best, best of luck. Hang in there. This stuff sucks ass. ðŸ’«",False,False
