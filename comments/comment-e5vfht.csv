You can add more bananas if you want the cookies to be sweeter. Also regular oatmeal would probably taste better than multi-grain.",False,False

I'm nervous and bothered that they might be trying to e-diagnose me. I already got frequent headaches before ever doing anything, always struggled with stomach issues since being a little kid, don't get enough sleep because my brain sucks, and the only reason why my skin has been dry and cracky lately is just that my hands hate the dish-washing liquid we use. The issue had only started once I started living with them.  I'm worried they may try and take my food scale or bathroom scale and that's not what I need. I'm fine with being told to eat more or something but I already asked about getting more snack-type food (fiber one bars, 100 cal popcorn bags, pickles etc.) because my groceries are mostly separate from the rest of the house and I really don't want to touch anyone else's or use their stuff. I've been undereating a little bit more since the grocery trips had been delayed and I wanted to make sure I had food until then. I know everyone means well that I live with but it feels like they're pushing me more into the disordered line then if I were functioning on my own. I'm with them because of my grandmother's passing over the summer in an accident (I was in it but came out physically mostly fine) and she was the closest family member I had. The one trying to e-diagnose me is a little bit distant honestly and I don't think they really know me that well. I'm scared of being emotionally open due to usually always getting negative reactions and don't want to burden or drag anyone down so it's not like I'm particularly short or irritable with anyone.   However, I've been in 2 arguments that resulted in my dinner being thrown out since staying there and that's about it. Different person who has anger issues on that front. Other than that I'm just trying to pitch in where I can and not step on anyone's toes. I just want to be able to have foods I like and know the nutrition info of and get through the day. Can't eat what's not there y'know",False,False
