At my worst I've been kind of dizzy, but never passed out. You nearly passed out three times in a row. A doctor literally told you that you're unhealthy. Since you said you wish you cared enough I think you can do it. Just focus on eating healthy foods and work up slowly from however much you eat now to something more sustainable. I think if you take things slow and give yourself time to prove to yourself that eating small amounts of food won't make you suddenly get fat then perhaps it will work. That's what I did at least. I did get back up to a healthy weight after more than a year. I mean, it didn't last, but that's due to other circumstances regarding my health. I think if you really committed to it that you could at least be healthier than you are now. Even if you don't really eat enough you could at least not be nutritionally deficient.",False,False
