I was in therapy for a while &amp; my therapist literally didn’t understand how bad it was &amp; suggested “exposure therapy” which basically meant I was supposed to try &amp; sit through whatever was triggering me &amp; try to deep breath etc.... it only made things worse. I’ve gotten to the point where I just tell people in advance “hey I have misophonia so x, x, &amp; x really bother me would you mind if we don’t do x, x, &amp; x while we are together? Or do you mind if I use ear plugs, headphones, or run a fan?” Most of the time people are very very understanding &amp; a lot of people are just uneducated &amp; curious to know more. Sometimes I encounter fellow misophonia sufferers &amp; we can chuckle over our commonality. Where I really struggle now is with dating because there’s no way I can get out of never eating or sleeping with someone simply because they’re “breathing or chewing too loud” I dunno I wish I could tell you it gets better but for me it has just led to isolation &amp; further depression.",False,False
