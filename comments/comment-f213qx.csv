I haven't had the willpower to try it, but it's basically like a keto diet that also excludes dairy. My friend who I suspect had pcos but it's not diagnosed has been really successful on keto. I know how frustrating it is. I'm really unhappy with my body because I feel like I gain weight like a middle age man, my legs and arms are ok then just a big belly, I would honestly rather just be evenly fat than weird fat. I would like to try these diets but unfortunately my bulimia makes it pretty impossible to stick to.",False,False

My birth control is called Diane 35.,False,False
