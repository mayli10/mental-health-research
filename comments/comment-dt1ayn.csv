My BF has had a major problem with wanting to be bigger and more muscular most of his life. When he was younger he got super sick and a bunch of kidney stones from way too much protein because of it. I thought this would make him more understanding of my wanting to be underweight because even though it’s opposite it’s similar. But I was wrong. He cannot understand my ED at all unfortunately.,False,False

He’s insecure and had to try and level the playing field by bringing you down. Now you know how sensitive of a topic this is for him and you can approach it more carefully. The next time you mention it you can preface it by reassuring him of your intentions and going about it in a respectful and mindful way. If he knows about your ed that’s really low of him. If he doesn’t I’d consider telling him. You guys can support each other. If he knows you’re struggling with an ed and is regularly an asshole regardless of serious attempts at communication you should dump him :p,False,False
