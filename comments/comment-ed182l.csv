It means a lot that you are taking time to comfort a random stranger online.  I did text the girl, but somehow it doesn't make a difference? Like in my dumb messed up brain, the fact that I ate so much food is way more significant than the fact that I kissed someone, and I think I am just broken like that.  Im tired, and a little bit drunk, so I think I should just go sleep and maybe the morning will seem a little less painful.",False,True

You were happy and excited about life so you chose to eat. That’s so powerful. Don’t let the part of you that believes you don’t deserve to exist take that away from you. It’s just trying to tear you down so you are forced to rely on your self destructive impulses. You didn’t binge. You fed yourself. You don’t have to starve yourself to make up for it. Why don’t you text that girl you like and tell her how much you enjoyed your time with her?,False,False
