I do get where you are coming from, my body craves fruit and veggies regularly. But for me, it's also about incorporating ""fun foods"" into my diet- like being able to spontaneously grab ice cream with friends or a cake or doughnut from the markets.",False,False

I forget who, but some dietician I follow on Instagram actually used this as her recovery method from her own eating disorder. She says “no labels, no limits” meaning all Whole Foods, that are not packaged/processed, are allowed to be eaten without restriction of any sort.  Can be totally problematic at some point I think, definitely still a bit of disordered thinking, but dude, it’s still better than being under complete control, and in the depths of an eating disorder.  You’re just still technically restricting if you have the mindset of food as inherently “good” or “bad”",False,False

I think trying to maintain a perfect diet 100% of the time plays into disordered thinking. So allowing flexibility, theoretically, should be part of healthy recovery.",False,False

It's like a pendulum, you were being pulled back and kept to one extreme side, it's only natural to sometimes swing back in the other direction just as extremely.
