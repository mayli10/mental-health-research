Since i have three kinda of food i think of: safe food to eat, safe food to chew and spit, and safe food to save up for a month to eat (and prob purge) and they constantly change. Safe food to eat ill one week just eat a single slice of low cal toast w sugar free jelly 2 times a day, to nothing but frozen veg and hot sauce, to eating lettuce pickle and mustard salads. Right now im on a huge apple kick w applesauce packets and sliced apples w cinnamon. And i jusr keep baking apple pies and cakes to c/s. But my fav food to c/s constantly flips between burgers and chicken wings to pancakes and bacon. Can u tell how focused my dumb bitch brain is on food?",False,False
