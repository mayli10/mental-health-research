For example, yesterday my collective intake was about 700 calories above my maintenance (oops) but I just went out with friends and ate bigger meals than usual but I didn’t feel like I was out of control, whereas the day before that I just lost my mind and couldn’t stop eating, I wasn’t even aware of what the hell I was doing and was just shovelling everything into my mouth, the calories were very similar for both days but the feeling was different, idk",False,False

A binge is defined by feeling a loss of control (subjective) and eating more than a normal/healthy person would during the same time period (objective).   Someone might feel they lost control over their eating and couldn't stop and only end up consuming less than even a normal amount of the food.    Someone else might just have gone over the calories and later feel guilty about it, but not had that feeling of loss of control. That's more like a subjective feeling of having overate, even if they didn't objectively overeat, than a subjective feeling of having binged.",False,False

Subjective are when you FEEL like it's a binge (aka ""fuck i went 500 over my planned intake with three cookies and hand full of m&amp;ms"")  Objective is when you totally lose control. Stuck in your head, screaming ay yourself to stop but your body is on autopilot. You can't even taste the food you eat anymore. It doesn't stop when the bag is empty. Lowkey black out and when it's finally done, and your sitting on the couch surrounded in crumbs and your stomach is visibly sticking out because it's *so full*. Lots of food in a short amount of time, usually also high calorie (2000?3000? 4000? And up) ON TOP of your usual intake.   At least thats what ive learned",False,False
