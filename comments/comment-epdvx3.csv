I’m a massive failure in pretty much every way— I do have a degree and am technically quite smart, but I’m a fucking idiot when it comes to real life. I have never had a “real” job, just one minimum wage job where they’d hire just about anyone, and my current minimum wage job that was handed to me out of pity. I’m single, never had a relationship longer than three months, no kids obviously, I can count the number of friends I have on one hand, am ugly us fuck, and due to severe anxiety I am unable to do a lot of really basic fucking things.  But I’m really good at starving myself though! And starving or not, I’ve always been the thinnest girl in the room. That’s literally the only “special” thing about me and the only thing I’ve ever really been noticed for.",False,False
