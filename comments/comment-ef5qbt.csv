Even in a more social definition of sympathy they got it wrong. If you look up sympathy on Google there will be three definitions. The first two are relevant to this conversation. The third one is a physics thing.   The first definition is the more social one. That is to say that sympathy is an expression of pity or sadness for a person's problems. This is sympathy in the interpersonal sense. You listen to another person and you feel bad to know that they're going through something difficult. Maybe you do try to help the person, but the video pushed an opinion that helping people is wrong and so they misrepresented sympathy to drive that point and it doesn't have to be like that.   The second definition is the more personal one. It describes understanding between individuals. This still requires that you make an effort to understand the person, but it refers to that understanding itself and not an expression of your understanding. The way the bear behaved toward the rabbit in the video could be due to empathy, but the video does explain the thought process that leads the bear to helping the rabbit. This shows sympathy because the bear recognized what the rabbit was going through and considered what he would have found helpful while going through the same thing.  Empathy is more basic than this. Empathy is your ability to understand the feelings another person is experiencing rather than the entire situation itself. This is again a personal sense of how you feel in response to whatever you are witnessing, but you will instead react to the feelings themselves and not the situation at large.   Say that you see a homeless on the street. It is clear to you that this person is hungry which you can recognize because you have been hungry before. You have never been homeless before so you can't sympathize with the homeless person, but you can empathize with being hungry, so you focus on that. Perhaps you might approach the homeless person and if they would like it if you bought then some food or you might give them a bit of extra change that you have on you so that they can hopefully collect enough to buy food for themself. Perhaps it might help to think of it this way. You cannot relate to the problem, but you can relate to a symptom of the problem.   Consider, with this in mind, my initial comment. When trying to get people to treat ED sufferers with compassion it is important to appeal to their empathy so that over time they can build sympathy. I hope that clears up what I meant :)",False,False

It's an immediate reward system that a lot of people can relate too. There are more people that were on the verge of addiction than you think!  However, eating disorders are almost 100% mental-driven (only BED can be somewhat closer to an addict behaviour). Very very few people will experience stress around food, desire to lose weight constantly or negative body image to the point of developing an eating disorder.

I'm suffering from bulimia.  Bulimia is very tricky because you know it's wrong, it has so many visible negative side effects as well as a rapid degradation of your health. Yet, it's so hard to stop.  I opened up to two people and they asked me ""so why do you continue?"".

Some people go for a smoke, I go for 5kg of chocolate down the drain. But then they see you cry and in pain and saying that you HATE doing this. It's just like a love-hate relationship or an abusive relationship and outsiders just don't understand why you stay, and after you leave you also don't understand why you stayed, but when you're in, you see no way out.

Empathy is when a person does not use personal experience to gauge how to respond to something. Like, if you have lost a close loved one before you can sympathize with others going through the same thing because you know their pain. When you experience empathy you are simply analyzing a person and imagining how they must feel. In a sense you are attempting to feel how they feel in order to figure out how to respond to how they feel. This is actually a hardcoded neurological response in the human brain. Well, not *only* the human brain, but we are talking about humans here. Your brain has things called mirror neurons which fire off both when you do something and when you see somebody else doing something. This is why if you see somebody struggling to carry something heavy your first instinct might be to go over and offer to help them carry it. Your brain is telling you how that person appears to feel based on the information you have witnessed. Empathy is great because it encourages us to help others even when we can't relate to them by extrapolating from what we do know instead of trying to base on our own experiences. Like, we all understand how different things feel on a basic level (like emotions, physical strain, illness) and so empathy makes us feel those things in order to encourage us to help others who are struggling. The downside to empathy is that if something is too foreign to us than we just can't process it at all.  This is why sympathy is so important as well. Using the example of somebody carrying a heavy object again, sympathy can be applied to this as well. Perhaps you think they have a handle of it pretty well and don't need help, but then you watch them for a moment and you realize that they're moving a lot of heavy things and that they're all on their own. You might think of a time you had to do a strenuous and repetitive task or a time when you had to do something all on your own which took forever. You could then think of how you would have liked to have some help in those moments and then decide to go offer this person help moving their things. In these cases you already have information on what it feels like to be in that situation or a similar situation and so you don't need to make so many assumptions to figure out how to respond. The downside with sympathy is that if you have never been in a situation similar to another person's current situation that you can't use it to truly understand what they are going through.  Sympathy and empathy are often used together to compel humans to help each other. Sympathy can build upon our empathy so that we feel a stronger compulsion to help people. I feel I am not making my point clear. I would say that sympathy is psychological while empathy is neurological. So the human brain converts sympathetic thoughts into empathetic feelings in order to make us want to help other living things. This is where I get to my point in responding to your comment as this is what you got me thinking of. When it comes to eating disorders we as eating disorder sufferers can sympathize and empathize with other people who have eating disorders. Like, if somebody doesn't want to eat you understand that and know how to respond to it. A neurotypical person cannot sympathize with people who don't want to eat nor can they empathize with them. Like in the examples OP mentioned there are people who might try to be sympathetic, but they are misguided. They are misreading the experiences of the ED sufferer and misattributing their own experiences to the situation. This is where people get the idea to say or do things that they think will help us which come across a pandering, demeaning, belittling, or counterproductive to us. Then there are also the people who cannot even come up with any experiences through which they think they can sympathize with us and this is when people can respond to our problems with confusion which can then lead to hostility.   Your example of pooping was a very good one here. Say that a person expressed that they avoid pooping because it is a very painful experience for them. Maybe they have an injury, a GI illness, or inflamed hemorrhoids or something. Any body can relate to not wanting to feel pain and so they might respond to that as if it is something reasonable even if it is not something good. As we all should know, not pooping when you need to is bad for you health. If this person did not provide an excuse for not wanting to poop however a person would likely not understand and would not react the same way. They might say something like ""*Why don't you want to poop? That's stupid! Don't you know how bad that is for you?*"" This is not constructive of course, but the person in this example has become confused and cannot figure out how to respond which upsets them and leads to hostility. Not wanting to eat is the same as not wanting to poop, as you suggested before. To somebody who has a healthy relationship with food they cannot fathom anything different. Food is a necessity like water, air, sleep, and warmth. And, well, like pooping. They simply have no way of making any logical connection to their own knowledge or experiences which can help them figure out a response.  This is good to consider, however. It shows us that instead of trying to get a person to relate to our experiences or our behaviours we might instead try to get them to relate to our symptoms. If you say to a person ""*I suffer from anorexia and because of this I cannot mentally bring myself to eat enough.*"" they can't relate to that. That won't help them understand. Instead if you said ""*It doesn't quite matter why, but I experience a great deal of anxiety when I eat.*"" or ""*I feel that I get full very quickly when I eat and this makes me feel like I am overeating when I have a normal portion size.*"" you are shifting the focus from the reason or from what you are doing onto how it makes you feel and this is something that people can relate to. If people have experienced anxiety attacks they will be able to sympathize with your anxiety and may come up with a response which attempts to help reduce it. If you use the second example and compare how you feel after every meal to how people feel when they gorge themselves at a buffet than that is as well likely to be something that a person can relate to. From there they can imagine what it would be like to feel that way after every single meal you eat. In this case their response might focus on ways you might be able to eat more calories with less volume. Eating disorders are complex and so I believe that if you tried to focus on the entire illness that you would likely overwhelm people who have never suffered from one and it won't work. Instead, breaking it up into smaller parts can be a better way to help people understand what it is like for you to live with an eating disorder.   I can't imagine anybody being able to learn what it is like in one day. This is something that would have to be explained over many conversations over time between people with a fairly close relationship to one another. It would be nice if this was something people could figure out on their own and if they could do all of the mental labour themselves to come to an understanding, but I have to assume that the only reason I was able to come up with this thought exercise myself is because of my experience living with mental illness and with anorexia in particular on top of having an existing knowledge of how the brain works in cases like this through personal research into psychology, studying ethics, and through self-awareness meditation. I would not think that I am an average person in this regard and so I wouldn't expect an average person to naturally go through this process when faced with a situation where a person is struggling with something they don't understand. To be honest, just writing this post was quite exhausting. This isn't a process I would be likely to go through unless I had good reason to think that I should. Nobody is perfect nor can anybody be expected to be perfect and so people are likely to take unfamiliar situations at face value. I wouldn't say that it's our responsibility to make sure that everybody understands us, but I will say that it is at least worthwhile to try to build understanding with people who we are close to. Perhaps then they might eventually understand us well enough to spread that understanding to others.",False,False

I have never found anyone to be empathetic about it. Before I learned to cope people would just think I was acting weird if I ever had an episode in front of them.

Another friend of mine who I lived with shortly after did figure out that I have an eating disorder as it was getting to its worst.

He's not generally too gentle or caring, but at the very least he is usually sympathetic of stuff that serious. Maybe he thought I was just being dumb and could snap out of it if I wanted to?

You know, like a person who ravenously eats any sponge they can get their hands on or drinks nail polish every day or something else like that. In cases like those it's an addiction like alcohol or like drugs, but it falls into a fringe category where people don't understand how it started and so they think people must be doing it because they want to.
