I was perfectly aware of my horrible habits, food was an emotional crutch that I had no control over. happy? bread. sad? bread. it's the weekend? uhhh of course I'm gonna treat myself to nachos, i've had a very rough week of eating bread. I felt bloated, and gross. i kept constantly body checking and asking myself wHY Am I nOt LoSiNg WeIghT  &amp;#x200B;  so now the torture is different. I am hyper aware of everything I am putting in my system. i treat unsafe foods as weird forces that just draw me to devour them in a single bite so i just cannot keep them in my home. now my happiness doesn't come from short term relief from eating fats, sugar, and carbs, but rather it comes from the slow burn of knowing I am making conscious, healthy choices. my happiness comes from seeing my hair and nails not breaking from how brittle it is from gorging on empty calories, that requires a bit of sacrifice, and sometimes I flirt and eventually fall in the dark hole of binging behavior, but happiness is to realize this and to crawl back out of it to start again.",False,False

If you are lo-carbing you'll be miserable. Better strategy is to do Intermittent Fasting. This way you control which days are those where you don't give a fuck about how peachy you are, and which are those when it does count to be more sugared up.  source: I've lost 10kg eating mostly chocolate and pizza doing intermittent fasting 1 day normal + 2 days fast, for few months  All you have to do is watch that the sum of calories on average does not go over 3x your daily limit to lose weight. It works because you can not stuff yourself with so much calories by accident after 2 days of fasting, because your stomach got smaller in the meantime. You get used to it fast, in under a week.",False,False
