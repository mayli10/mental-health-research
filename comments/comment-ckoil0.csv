You don't have to add like 10 disclaimers or make anything sound a certain wait. You can say exactly how you're feeling.,False,False

Here I can just be like hey, ya girl is still freaking out about the same 5 lbs and wants to die bc of an Oreo... and like a hundred people will get it and know how to be supportive of ME without condoning my ED. No explanation needed.  No trying to soften it to be more presentable.  No trying to assauge someo need elses faux-concern.  It's honestly so safe here idk how I'd cope without this community.",False,False

I didnâ€™t have friends or family that understood so going on those sites and PrettyThin really helped me get through my teenage years.,False,False
