I am well aware that it’s pointless, but the laxatives are more of a mental reassurance that I’m “empty”.   I am planning on breaking my fast today with chicken and salad, and hoping tomorrow is a better day.   Thank you again for your help x",False,True

Laxatives work by causing the body to infuse extra water into the large intestine. This is why you end up dehydrated (and why there can be initial weight loss), and your body responds by holding on to more water than it would normally, causing you to gain water weight.  Their action on the large intestine means also that they’re not very effective for what you’re trying to do, because most of the nutrients (including calories) are absorbed in the small intestine so by the time it’s in the large intestine and can be cleared out by laxatives it’s already too late. Its not worth it imo. But enough of the lecture ;) onto some damage control:  If you eat fruit and veggies and drink enough water (1.5-2l) the weight will equalize in roughly 48 hours. Be careful when rebalancing water. Don’t drink too much water or eat too much salt, and if you can try to stay off the b/p at least until your weight settles back down. I would ask you to try not to use laxatives, but if you do use them again maybe consider taking an electrolyte drink afterwards if you have passed a lot of water during purging, and recover from the water imbalance by healthy eating and good hydration.  Good luck  ",False,False

I’m also being kinda hipocritical because at BMI17 I don’t feel sick enough to get help. It’s almost like I have to prove I really had a problem by getting diagnosed/hospitalised which is a TOXIC way of thinking.  I’m so disgusted in myself today wow 😂💓,False,True

Just keep doing your thing and dont binge... patience is key. Dont say ""fuck it ill est my pantry"" cause then progress really wont happen... usually when I fast (24hr in right now) the first day or two i gain and then once i hit 48+ hours it drops to lower than my starting.
