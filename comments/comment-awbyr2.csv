It made me cry all over again (in a good way). You seem like such a strong, intelligent and kind person, thank you so much for making me feel heard and a little less alone tonight. I am proud of you too and wish you all the best&lt;3",False,True

Mental illness hits everyone.  So many people believe that money buys happiness, and I have to disagree with that.  Money buys comfort.  Money buys pleasure.  But money does not fix hormonal imbalances and mental disorders in general.  You living comfortably does not make you any less valid.  An eating disorder is an eating disorder, no matter how small or big, no matter the amount or money you make, and no matter if you have other mental illnesses.   I see you equal to me; you struggle with what I do, and you know what?  You matter!  You are strong for making it so fucking far in your life.  EDs are difficult to deal with; even if you eat ""normally"" for five, ten, fifteen years, you could still fall back.  But that's okay.  Everyone slips up.  You are valid, you are strong, and I am so, so proud of you for getting through college.  That is amazing in itself.  It gives me hope in getting through community college.  I am proud of you, and I say that with all of my heart.  We are all fighting similar battles here.  ðŸ’•",False,False
