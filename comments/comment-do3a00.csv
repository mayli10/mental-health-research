I posted this a while ago but it's worth sharing with you to put you off. They suck!   Hello, So I wanted to share this to maybe help some of you. I have been using lax to purge since I was 15. I am now 32 and have just been diagnosed with a vaginal prolapse. Basically that means that my bowels are protruding in to my vagina and that's happened because of muscle weakness due to lax abuse.   I need an operation and in the meantime I have an uncomfortable lump in my vag that feels like a big grape is just hanging out there.   When I started using lax the internet wasn't as big as it is now. I didn't know that lax didn't get rid of calories. By the time I was able to google and find that out I was already addicted to the feeling of emptiness that lax gave me. I ignored advice anyway.   If you use lax to purge, honestly, just stop. It's not worth it. You'll end up in hospital with stitches in your fanny.",False,False
