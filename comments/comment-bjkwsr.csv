I truly believe emotional recovery has to keep up with the physical in order for lasting success. Realistic goals, baby steps and full disclosure to loved ones and support network have been the key for me 💛",False,False

It's been so refreshing to hear others speak about recovery in a positive light. I only just began reading/posting on here and at first I was terrified but it's proven to be such a motivating and supportive experience. Also, congrats on your recovery victories!! I hope to be able to say the same for myself one day, wishing you luck!!",False,True

Jumping 4 bmi points is too overwhelming and imo is counter productive for recovery. I’ve jumped 2 bmi points by myself, it took 6 months, I took baby steps (aim for half kilo gain at a time, once target is hit just maintain for a while until you settle into it, with the solid intention to move on and up again). Honestly, I could not have done this any other way. Ana brain would not have cooperated if I’d set unrealistic targets.   Be honest with your therapist. Don’t try to hide the weight loss. It wasn’t intentional, that’s the truth. You want help, that’s the truth. Your therapist hears that and it shows compliance, it’s a healthy sign.  My restoration has not been linear. Just like weight loss isn’t linear, don’t get disheartened. Weight restoration is haaaaard hard hard. Especially when you WANT to do it. Recovery is hard but voluntary recovery is in a league of its own.  You can do this!  Good luck 🙏🏽",False,False
