I’m definitely obsessed with keeping my nails looking nice. I usually go for an “oval” or a semi “almond” shape. Plus busting out my gel nail kit keeps me away from the kitchen,False,False

But at a certain point they’re too long and start breaking if I accidentally bang them on something, so I keep them a medium to long length. I also think they make your fingers look slimmer. My nails have always been strong despite restriction and frequent gel manicures and they generally look nice. But I’ve been depressed lately so no more manicures and I bit down 2 nails to a shorter length but luckily still have a free edge.",False,False
