It says I've gained 20 pounds in two months, even though I'd have to eat 3000+ calories *every day*. I never have more than 2000 during my binges. It fucking sucks. I don't know what's real anymore.",False,False

I literally rely on junk food because I rarely have the energy to cook for myself. Even with the most recent meal plan I made, the healthiest meal plan I have ever made, it includes a McDouble combo because they're so cheap and nutritious. I would have to exercise with that plan because it's way more calories than I burn currently. For that reason it would have to be something I worked up to and I would need a job because it's not so cheap as my current eating habits. It is still cheaper than previous plans I made, like the last one where I used shirataki noodles to get enough fiber, but I would have to buy apples and oranges all the time and fruit is expensive.",False,False

I weighed more the next time I visited the doctor and wore a similar outfit so I think maybe the nurse weighed me wrong that day. Of course, my doctor got really concerned about my weight loss so if that's the case than that nurse made my life a lot harder for absolutely nothing.",False,False

I did eat something on the way home, but it wasn't huge enough to make such a difference. He did tell me that he weighs the same at the doctor's and on the scale at his girlfriend's house that he does on his home scale, so it's hard to say it might not be accurate anymore after all the years he has had it.",False,False
