This is basically just me rambling so feel free to ignore it   I relate to this a lot. I feel very socially inept, I hate taking risks, I avoid one on one conversations if at all possible because what if I don't have a good answer and it's getting awkward? I can't deal with second hand embarrassment (or first hand of course) or conflict at all, I try to avoid it at all costs. This leads to me not ""having"" any opinions on a topic, because I feel like everyone will think I'm stupid and annoying when I don't agree with them. I also feel like I can't articulate what I think in the right way most (if not all) of the time so that doesn't help. I never write in group chats because who cares about my stupid opinion and I hate making decisions.  I am always genuinely surprised when someone doesn't dislike me even tho I bring nothing to the table, I feel like I don't have a personality.   The only time I feel somewhat competent to talk to someone is when I'm tipsy/drunk so that's fun too. But I tend to get too drunk and annoy everyone around me which just leads to me hating my ""personality"" more. I try to stop drinking but if I'm anxious because I can't avoid a situation I drink beforehand because it calms me down a little and reassures me.   Sorry for the novel idk if it makes sense lol just needed to get it out (and I don't have a therapist)",False,False

Honestly, a lot of the times I can't tell and don't even think to distinguish where it's coming from. From the way I talked to my therapist she figured I had it and had me fill out some forms before I was diagnosed. I think a big difference is that having avpd makes me internalize everything and take it as though there is something personally wrong with me. I feel that I will never succeed in life or have friends because there is something inherently wrong with me. I also cannot take criticism well, and conflict is hard as well. I have many times seen some random person online arguing with someone that wasn't me (I'm not involved whatsoever) and I feel like everyone will hate me for disagreeing with this random person, because everything about me is bad and I am a disgusting person.  I also generally don't find difficult situations ""worth it"" in general so I avoid taking any risks, because I view myself as socially inept and a bad person, I figure I can't make a good friend if I tried.",False,True

Like do you recognize which one it is in situations that make you anxious or sth?  I don't want to diagnose myself or anything but I know I have a lot of symptoms of avpd (is that the right abbreviation?) and was just wondering.",False,False

I, also felt for many years that my doctor's weren't helping me enough. But over time, I realized that there's only so much they can do. They can't change you beyond helping you think differently so you think healthier thoughts and to manage your symptoms with medication when possible. I actually decided to study psychiatry and I'm about to graduate as a psych nurse practitioner and I realize now more than ever that mental professionals are not gods. We can help with meds, but no med works perfectly or for everyone, and not everyone gets better. But you can get better *enough*with the right treatment and the determination to feel better. For me, things got better when I decided on a goal: studying psychiatry, because it gave me a reason to stay well. Now I do pretty well, aside from my current ED relapse (see? Not many people get all the way better). But I'm better enough to live a pretty good life. You can get there, too.",False,False
