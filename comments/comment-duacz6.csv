FYI de novo lipogenesis is incredibly inefficient and over 90% of the fat in our body comes from dietary fat. Fat is much preferentially stored as fat. Carbs are first stored as glycogen then fat, but a lot is lost as heat (look up dietary thermogenesis).  Also can't fully  understand what you're saying cuz you're clearly not a native English speaker.  Read the China Study people. Why are Asians so much leaner than Americans? Cuz they eat a starch based diet. Tell me how rice is more fattening than ice cream cuz it's more carb heavy?",False,False

Like 90% of the reason why I worked so hard to lose my freshman 15 (more like 25 lol) in just under 3 months was because I noticed such a harsh contrast in how I was treated. People, especially men, are so much nicer to me when I'm at the lower end of a 'healthy' bmi/slightly underweight. It's pretty gross. Also, it goes both ways: the thicker girls‚Äì‚Äìthe girls who used to be so, so cruel to me‚Äì‚Äìwere suddenly dying to be my friend after I gained 30 lb. It was weird to watch them suddenly accept me as human, as one of them.  I lost the weight because I got fed up with how my family treated me. We're Korean, so it's typical for anyone with a slightly overweight‚Äì‚Äìor even mid-healthy‚Äì‚Äìbmi to be treated as sub-human. (Obviously not all Koreans are like this, but culturally it's pretty acceptable to be overtly 'fatphobic'.) They said they don't know where their beautiful girl went, and don't you hate yourself for being so overweight?  (I wasn't. My bmi was twenty fucking one.)  I don't know why I went on a tangent about me; the post is about you, so that wasn't my intention. I guess my point is that I really empathize with your experiences and understand how people are so cruelly superficial. Sending you a virtual hug, bb",False,False
