It's nostalgic and sweet and I can't get enough of it. One day, if/when the stars align and I'm at a point where I'm happy with my body and with the means to do so, I want to get a tattoo related to LPP   I'm also fond of Pride and Prejudice and Anne of Green Gables, and I adore The Swallow by Charis Cotter! It's a *whole* ride about these two girls, one of whom can see ghosts, and they fight ghosts together and form this beautiful friendship -- this book never fails to make me cry, it's been my favourite for a long, long time.   On The Jellicoe Road and Saving Francesca (Melina Marchetta) are another couple of good ones. I read these a while ago but whenever I see people asking for book recs, these titles just blossom up in my head. I hope they help you in some way! :3c",False,False

I was **so** into books as a younger person, and was horrified when I became unable to concentrate enough to read at all. I've been getting back into reading lately, getting a few books out from the library at a time, or re-reading books I own that I remember enjoying. I just finished ""John Dies At The End"" by David Wong, and ""God Bless You, Mr. Rosewater"" by Kurt Vonnegut, and I'm almost done ""The Ocean At The End Of The Lane"" by Neil Gaiman. My absolutely favourite set of books is the Discworld series by Terry Pratchett, particularly the books focusing on the Wizards or Death.",False,False
