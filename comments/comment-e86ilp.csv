I believe there are some support groups out there for friends/family of addicts. Nar-anon Family Groups is the one I know of.    I‚Äôm an alcoholic and my SO went to Al-anon for a bit, and it seemed to help him. There were people there who understood what he was going through, and he could talk frankly without fear of hurting anyone. I think his biggest takeaway was to start understanding that it absolutely wasn‚Äôt his fault he couldn‚Äôt ‚Äòsave me‚Äô. That he did nothing wrong. I had to want to recover before anyone could possibly help me, and even then it needed to be people experienced in a solution to addiction rather than him.   I hope you‚Äôll take care of yourself. Offering love to your brother can be an amazing gift, but I‚Äôd urge you not to do it at the expense of your own mental health. And lastly, I hope the test you mentioned went ok &lt;3",False,False
