Also psychology.com has a filter if you are looking for therapists where you can chose specific specialties like eating disorders or anxiety and find a bunch of therapists in your area that maybe can help you? That is what I did (I also have anxiety) &amp; it has the added benefit of you not having to tell anyone why you are seeing them you can just say you are anxious. (I found a really cool therapist this way and am PLANNING to talk to her at our next appt. but... I am chicken who is bad at taking her own advice so... we‚Äôll see)",False,False

I know recovery is hard,  but try the meds for a little.  They could help you make healthier choices.  Id recommend maybe writing down your thoughts and feelings with your ed and as kind-of weird as it is, bring the confession paper to your next check up / appointment you make.   It's your choice to come forward but it you can't bring yourself to speak, surely any doctor might be confused at first but if you can practice the line ""Its hard for me to admit this issue I have outloud, so I wrote it down. Can you please read this""  Regardless we are here for you honey,  you made a great step by admitting your anxiety. Stay as safe and posirive as you can x üíñ",False,False
