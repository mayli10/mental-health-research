I spent a year faking wanting to recover and gained not an ounce.  I used up someone else's place in treatment when I knew I didn't want to gain.  As a compromise I'm maintaining.  That's all I can do for now but I'm not beating myself up about it.  At some point I'll go for it, but we all have to feel we want to recover to do it.  Keep yourself as safe as possible.  Pressure isn't good for anyone.  When you're ready, you're ready but please take care.",False,False

Both engaging in ED and recovery are hard. You have to be the one to choose which hard is better for you.  &amp;#x200B;,False,False
