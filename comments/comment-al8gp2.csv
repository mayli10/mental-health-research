I’m sorry you’re having to deal with his egotistical bullshit.   As for dealing with him, I think the first thing you should try is being very blunt and straightforward with him. Something like “hey, I’m going to ask you to not bring up my personal life and to not discuss or debate it. I’m not comfortable with it and it’s none of your business.”   If that doesn’t work and he keeps going, maybe try “I’m going to stop you right there. I will not discuss this with you anymore. I’ve let this slide for long enough, and I have already set a boundary that you’ve blatantly ignored. I respect you as my roommate, so please give me the same courtesy. I’m not a mystery or problem for you to gawk over and try to solve. You are my roommate, not my close friend, and these personal topics are not yours to talk about and are not up for discussion.”   If that doesn’t work, flip the scrip. Start discussing and debating the finer points of his issues. If he calls you out on it, try “see? It doesn’t feel very good to have someone try to dissect you, does it?”   Mean, nuclear option: make every part of his life mildly inconvenient, but in a way that he never finds out it’s you, so it builds up until he can’t take it anymore and he wants to move out.
