As I mentioned below. My eating disorders came to define me at the age of nineteen. When my weight fluctuated between safe and dangerous. My comments (below) relates to my cultural norms (irish male, politically active background, religious orientation catholic.)  At nineteen I started college. My teenage years had been filled with depressive episodes and issues with food. At nineteen, when most people began to explore mature and long lasting relationships. I had consciously chosen to become emotional sellabit. I had and still have a lot of female friends who at the time wanted to graduate are relationship to another level of intimacy but how could I love someone if I couldn’t be honest about how I was living my life. So for most of my life before accepting the truth about my ED. I remained sexually and emotionally sellabit.  In the past and even now I find it hard reconcile an ED and a relationship with the overarching framework that supports my life. If I cannot be honest with someone and fully share who I am. How can you really know me and love me or allow me to know you and love you as my lover.",False,False

And then they went numb...so I ran to my room to grab my phone just incase I needed to call 911 if I accidentally poked a hole in my stomach wall...and to text my boyfrien to say goodbye if it really was the end (puncturing my stomach is a huge risk for me/the way I purge now).  Well, no sharp pains in my stomach, so I knew I was in the clear. Even though I knew I wasn't gonna die anymore, I still felt like shit. Confusion, numbing everywhere, muscles on fire, sudden onset of fever (literally out of nowhere), faintness, horrible aches everywhere, and it just general ""okay dude, you're bulimic and it's really starting to mess with your help because you're malnutritioned now"" pains.  Went to therapy. Didn't tell anyone there.  Came back. Expected to fast, but I just knew that if I continue on the path I'm on, I will die very soon. Before, I completely doubted the restrictive tendencies of my ED could ever get strong enough to be a true cause for concern for my health. But now, I've already proven to myself that I will do it if given the chance. I'm talking about being dead in the matter of months. There is zero way I would survive a year like this. I'm losing weight too rapidly and purging literally everything someone eats and flushing everything away and fasting when not b/p'ing will kill them.  So tonight, I ate chicken and veggies. It was the best goddamn food I've had in weeks, as I'm sure the only Calories getting into me are simple carbs rn. As good as it felt though, there is absolute terror that I will binge or purge again. That being said, the shitty feeling I had earlier today hasn't gone away. I still have a fever and feel like I got hit by a truck..but I just had my meal, so the physical weakness is just a reminder that I *need* to actually keep this food in me.",False,False

Eating is something I don’t   enjoy. I am more comfortable when I am hungry rather than when I am full or   well-fed.   My   weight since I was nineteen has fluctuated between safe and dangerously low.   Like you at twenty seven I went through a period of serve weight loss. At my   lightest weight 8 stone 9 pounds (my height 6 foot 1 inch.) This was the   turning point in my life. The point when I knew I was sick but it took six   years to admit I had a problem or even to begin treatment.   My   anorexia never affected my employment or employment prospects. If anything it   added to my drive. I started as a junior engineer at 13 stone and became a successful   lighting designer at my lightest 8 stone 9 pounds. My visual appearance I   know was something that was spoken about privately amongst colleagues. It was   debated was I physically sick, did I have an addiction problem or was I just   really active (a fitness nut.) Comments on my weight was always along the   lines of your very lean, you are as lean as a race horse, do you run a lot and   one colleague who I had a relationship commented “your thin but so fucking   toned, so jealous.”   I did run a lot and my friend a personal trainer worked with me as best he   could to retain as much muscle as I could. It’s amazing how the hypertension   brought about by hunger can full you.  When   I finally chose to inform some friends and colleagues who I thought deserved   to know my truth. I am a man with anorexia. It never acquired to them that me   a man could develop anorexia or have a feeling of shame around his body. They   presumed I had fulfilled a dream to be lean and look toned.",False,False
