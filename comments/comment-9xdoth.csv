Like there  are so many posts on there that straight up have no meme about it  and are just straight up “I’m going to kms” and proED is such a supportive and accepting place ,False,False

A meme about killing yourself will get 1K upvotes on r/2meirl4meirl but god forbid someone suffering with an eating disorder wants some support. ,False,False
