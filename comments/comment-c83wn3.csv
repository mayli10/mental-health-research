Especially with your SO, maybe he’ll be able to support you through this or at least he’ll try to avoid triggering you. butbesidesallthat, please see a therapist, the longer you postpone it the harder it’ll be for you.",False,False

I know that it can be really hard getting help and starting recovery. But I personally think if you find someone to talk to, like a therapist, then you'll be able to have like a sounding board for your thoughts and feelings. The worst thing is to feel trapped in your own spirals with only yourself as the person you can reason with and you cant really reason with ED. I hope you get all the support you need :)",False,False
