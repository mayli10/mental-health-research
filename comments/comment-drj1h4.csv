A coworker at my new job offered to give me rides from my apartment to work, and it's about a 2-mile walk at 5am in 30Â°F weather. I ended up taking the offer because I didn't know how to tell her that I made the walk solely for the calories burned.  Now I'm compensating by running 40 minutes at night. My roommates don't get it, either.",False,False

I hear non-disordered (I assume) people talking like they have an ED all the time. And really they're just getting suckered into fad diets. Which I guess is a slippery slope into ED tbh.,False,False

Especially because in many ways itâ€™s normative to have a sort of messed up relationship with food and exercise, so a lot of the talk about it is disorder-adjacent. Itâ€™s really hard to know what things will get seen a little messed up but normal vs what things are going to be seen as super not okay and concerning... ðŸ˜”",False,False

I've started just not talking about food or exercise at all so I don't expose myself. When the topic comes up I try to act flippant about it but that sometimes doesn't work.,False,False
