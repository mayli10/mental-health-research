It’s important to try to identify them early (they look like small little white spot lesions or they are light brown/yellow). Brush with fluoridated toothpaste and use a mouthwash that has a decent amount of fluoride (ACT is good). Also floss every day.   My teeth were starting to show signs of damage and I immediately went to the dentist. Lucky I got to them before they became full cavities, so right now I’m essentially working on damage control. No soda, brushing 3x day, mouthwash 2x a day, flossing 2x also.",False,False
