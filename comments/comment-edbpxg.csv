When I was a kid I was underweight, not due to ED stuff but because I was on ADHD meds that suppressed my appetite and, being an ADHD kid, I just didn't have much interest in eating. I always got attention for being ""so small and skinny!"" and my strict, devoutly religious parents were always worried. Eventually I realized that refusing to eat was the only thing that got them to listen to me and not just force me to do whatever they wanted me to do. Food was the only thing I had control over.",False,False

I was an extreme picky eater (possibly ARFID, in retrospect), and night after night I'd be forced to sit at the table, literally gagging and retching while being forced to eat cream soups, onions, cheesy things, slimy things, things that pop in your mouth, etc.  Frequently my (now former) stepfather would scream directly into my face after swallowing, which would also cause me to throw up.  Sometimes he made me eat the vomit.  TL;DR  I blame him for the development of my eating disorder",False,False

I gained weight, at 13 I was chubby, people started to tell me thing, even my family, two assholes in school bullied me for my weight and that’s how it all started.",False,False
