I’m the thinnest in our office, not being vain, it’s a statement which gets made very often by my coworkers (I shy away from certain clothing which they would deem “too sexy” so that they’ll stop judging me”, but they are basically making fun of me without thinking I realize what they’re doing. When I initially started working I ate regularly again and started buying junk food and my boss actually makes a comment about how I’m eating too much...yeah well THAT triggered my ED, safe to say I’m back on the fasting train...",False,False

The internet isn’t going to help you in that regard. How relationships affect your ED should be pretty obvious.

It's because EDs are pegged, subconsciously or not, as a disorder of female vanity (even if the sufferer is not female). The world tends to dismiss the pain of a disease that's for ""stupid"" ""vain"" young women, and takes it less seriously than the pain of loved ones who *don't even have the disorder*. People just don't bother to consider the perspective of the actual ED sufferer, because fundamentally, the sufferer is not seen as an autonomous, capable person. The sufferer is just a vortex of irrationality - too self-centered, probably, to even want relationship advice (/s).  I mean, look at Borderline Personality, another ""crazy female nonsense"" disorder. Try googling that shit and see how denigrated it is online, and how many results come up that are like ""Have Borderline? DBT can help!"" versus results more like, ""Is your loved one is a FUCKING PSYCHO? Here's how to escape the nightmare they've made of your life.""  I'm not saying EDs and Borderline and so on aren't hard on loved ones, but man. The cultural concept of hysteria is alive and well, even if we don't take it literally anymore.

After I relapsed in my ED my relationship at the time turned abusive and it only fuelled my ED more (even though my partner wanted me to recover). I don't have any sources but it seems like toxic relationships often worsen ED behaviours because we (or at least I) seek other areas of our lives to control when one facet is out of or own control (or controlled by others),False,False
