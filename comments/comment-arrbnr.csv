My restriction was going so well and then I got pregnant. I asked my doctor how many calories a day a pregnant woman should eat and she was happy to tell me and didn't seem to be judgemental about it at all. I explained to her that I'd recently lost a lot of weight and didn't want to put on more than necessary.  Anyway, as much as it pained me sometimes I stuck to her recommendation. I came home from the hospital 15 pound heavier than my pre-pregnancy weight and that weight was gone within 2 months (I think some was water weight from sitting in a hospital bed for 3 days). Health of your baby aside, you really don't want to be restricting. I had a bad day 3rd trimester and honestly thought I was going to need to go to the hospital because my blood pressure was so low I couldn't stand without being extremely dizzy.  It's not easy when youre obsessed with your weight as I am but right now I have a very healthy and loved 8 month old and I spent the first 3 months after she was born basking in the ""you don't even look like you had a baby"" compliments. Just try your best to do right by you &amp; baby and know that there's no shame in asking for professional health if thats what you need. ",False,False

If you tell them the situation when you call they will get you in right away. A dietician can likely help you get a nice meal plan together so you have options when you’re craving something or wanting to plan out the weeks dinners etc.   Sooo many people I know who had babies and were physically “looking” larger during the pregnancy but bounced back immediately. After birth is a lot of water weight which comes off. Just because you have to make room for baby doesn’t mean you’re going to be bigger forever, it’s all temporary and will pass.   I hear breast feeding helps regulate hormones after and helps with weight loss so if you’re planning to breast feed or pump that will help. Ask your OB.   You’re going on a crazy amazing journey and the fact that you’re worried means you want what’s best for your baby. Mommy skills are kicking in!!! Congrats. ",False,False

Just think about bringing a beautiful child into the world. After you have the baby, you can achieve your dream body as long as you do it in a healthy way. For example, if you want the skinny with abs look, achieve it by going to the gym and eating enough healthy food. Trust me, starving does not create slim stomachs in the long term, But going to the gym does and you can be strong, healthy, and skinny. Recovery does not have to mean having a body that you pretend to be ok with. Recovery can instead result in having a healthy body that you are proud of. It will take time, but the end result will be worth it. But in the mean time, just focus on defeating your eating disorder and eating healthy so you can have a healthy baby and also a healthy strong body.",False,False
