I think some memory loss and dissociation occurs as well  Adding insult to injury people will say ""you look amazing"" etc and also misleading beliefs that eating disorders are about vanity and the media  It's a lose-lose situation- both are dead ends imo. It's a fear-driven illness that brings out the worst in everyone",False,False

I love FINALLY being able to wear the trends I didn’t “let” myself wear before. I know I’m perceived as skinny and that helps give me confidence even if I don’t feel skinny myself.   It’s annoying bc I’m not underweight for my height so now I just wanna get “healthy” but without losing this body lmao. I know that’s not realistic.,False,False
