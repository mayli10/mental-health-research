Just reaching out again because I saw you posted this, after seeing you respond to my comment. I'm so sorry if I upset you, but please let me help you understand my comment. I was making fun of the people giving you terrible advice (aka the people saying you just need to see your friends again and see the happiness in life). I think you misunderstood as me giving you more terrible advice.    You're not an asshole and I wasn't implying as such. I was talking down about the people trying to tell depressed people to realize they're assholes. I'm just a sarcastic person and I think you might have thought I was being serious and directing it towards you. I was mocking them, not you.   The awful advice those people were giving in the comment section was not helpful. /r/thanksimcured is a subreddit dedicated to making a mockery out of people who say stuff like ""Just get over it,"" because it's obviously not helpful. That was what I was referencing.    I think it's annoying and frustrating and downright maddening when people who don't understand how real and debilitating mental disorders can be. Simple advice that works on normal people just don't apply when someone is struggling with depression. I struggle with depression. I know how hard it is to get out of bed, or the feeling of suffocation when I can't back out of a social event. I really understand how hard it is and I've grown distant from so many friends because of it. The people who think it's as easy as realizing I'm being a jerk to my friends by declining invitations don't add any constructive feedback.   Anyway, I really hope you didn't hurt yourself and I'm so upset that my sarcastic comment was taken in the wrong light and might have hurt you. At least with me, some days feel like I'm taking a step forward and two steps back and other days I make a bit of progress. And sometimes it's like I just fall down the whole set of stairs to the bottom again. I hope you didn't spiral that far, but if you did, know that you're not alone in the feeling. It seems like you've made a lot of efforts to do better and I am trying hard to believe we will all get out of the darkness, so please hang in there &lt;3   If anything I said didn't make sense again please ask :( I don't want you to think I had directed those biting comments towards you.
