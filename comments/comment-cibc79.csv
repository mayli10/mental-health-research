A meal plan always gives me anxiety because it seems like a diet. It would be helpful if we had someone to look up to who's had ednos and recovered.,False,True

I wish I knew how to stop compulsively overeating, but I don’t think there’s a one size fits all solution. I’ve heard from recovering addicts in ED treatment that the pull they feel towards their ED is stronger than the pull towards their substance of choice and I fully believe that. It’s hard to stop using a coping mechanism that’s been with you since childhood.   I hope things get easier for you. I wish I could be more helpful :(",False,False

With an hour of weight lifting and an hour of yoga a day, I  was losing weight and It was  a high. I also did not want more food (not to restrict).  &amp;#x200B;  Working out this much was fun and it kept me busy  since right now I am not in school or working. Its summer and I work at a school.    Binging is one thing but,   How do I quit compulsive eating. Thats something that's been ingrained in me since early childhood. Food is more of an addiction than alcohol and drugs combined (I would know). How do you quit your drug of choice when you have to consume it?  &amp;#x200B;  Is a mean plan a good idea for a person with EDNOS?  &amp;#x200B;  I have no idea where to start cause people on youtube recover sites dont know anything other than anorexia and bulimia. I had a therapist tel me ""people with eating disorders dont eat"". I got down to my lowest weight eating 1000 calories a day so clearly she doesn't know what she's talking about""",False,True

I totally relate to your story, so you’re not the only one who’s experienced shifts in behaviors &amp; diagnoses. I binged to the point of extreme discomfort &amp; vomiting when I was in elementary school, steadily gained weight until I got to college, then swung the other way and lost 140ish pounds. Then my family finally got worried and forced me into treatment. I’ve been in recovery for two years and it’s been a constant battle between urges to restrict, binge, and purge. It really hasn’t gotten any easier.  I don’t know if any treatment center properly addresses atypical diagnoses yet. Unfortunately, they’re under-studied despite being frequently diagnosed. Even when I was inpatient, only a small percentage of the patients were on weight restoration plans. Most of us fell somewhere in the middle. The best advice I can give is to notice when you feel the urge to use a behavior and slow down. Try to ride the wave as long as you can instead of acting on the urge immediately. If you feel the urge to binge and notice yourself going for a binge food, push yourself to get out a journal and write down everything that’s running through your mind. It feels forced sometimes, and you won’t always be able to resist, but you get stronger every second you’re able to ride that wave.  I wish there were an easy solution, but there just isn’t. So much of recovery depends on your ability to anticipate and respond to your own triggers and impulses. I think that’s why recovery feels exhausting and why treatment burnout is so common. Good luck! You’re always welcome to PM me if you want to talk!",False,False
