I've tried to recover a few times but each time I get to the point where food is just ok. I lose my drive to recover from there since it doesn't seem worth it to eat anymore. The weight gain is hard too but without the enjoyment of food it makes it really hard to find the will to not go running back to Ana.,False,False

I would walk to the store and spend an hour trying to pick something out, get something easy (like rice and veggies) and then come home, make it, and throw it out.   What made it a bit more tolerable for me was finding healthy, easy to eat things, like yogurt or smoothies you can add your favorite fruit to. Even if theyâ€™re not super appealing at the time, I started to feel better and could enjoy them soon.",False,False
