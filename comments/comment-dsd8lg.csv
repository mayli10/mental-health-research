I’d hate to have the fact of my parents monitoring my meals 24/7, I’d much rather have a random nurse do it. I’d feel a lot safer in a facility catered towards ppl like me. I guess I’m willing to accept res or inpatient but I’m definitely not skinny enough to be referred to that.",False,True

Variables could include your doctor’s recommendations, decisions by your parents/guardian (if you’re a minor), whether you’re classified as a danger to yourself (if you live in a place where that has ramifications), what forms of help you *are* willing to access, and what forms of help are available in your area.   I’m kinda curious what aspects of Maudsley are anathema to you? It’s not what was used during my adolescent treatment so I only know a little about it.",False,False
