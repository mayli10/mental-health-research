All my friends were skinny dancers who couldn't shut up about how ""fat"" they were. I was a normal, healthy weight, but felt gigantic around them. They would throw food at me during lunch and joke about my size. On top of that, I was being bullied by a guy I liked. He would say the most awful things about how I was too ugly to be loved, he couldn't understand how I would ever think he'd like me, etc. So, I downloaded MFP. I started counted calories. I got a Tumblr and spent hours browsing the kind of thinspo you can't even really find anymore, like seriously unhealthy shit. I started throwing away and hiding food that I didn't eat. I went through packs of cough drops everyday to keep my mouth busy so I wouldn't think about food. I exercised like crazy.   For four years.   In my first year of high school, most of which I spent oversleeping to avoid eating breakfast, I gained a little bit of weight. Not a noticeable amount, really, but maybe 5-10 pounds. Mostly because I finally had friends and was going out/doing things like a normal human. I didn't really believe there was anything wrong with me. That was, until my new friends hooked me up with my first girlfriend. I was so in love. And I suddenly had SO much motivation to starve. So I dropped 20lbs in a few months and reached my lowest weight ever. I was fasting a lot and working out far too much. I got dumped. I experienced extreme hunger; I trained for a half marathon. Eventually, after looking at myself in the mirror and \*truly\* seeing how sick i'd become, I got a therapist and started ""recovery."" I've gained a shit ton of weight since my lowest-- still haven't had my period in five years, though. Hate my body more than ever. Lurk around this sub in a desperate attempt to trigger myself. However, if there's one thing i've learned from my 5 yr ED, it's that willpower is a limited resource, and I'm pretty sure I've exhausted all of mine. I think my skinny legend days are over.",False,False

I got better after abt a year, and was ""healthy"" for a long time, but I guess it was quasi-recovery. Then I relapsed at 22 again, I guess it was bc of a combination of life stressors. It's interesting how this seems to be a common theme among sufferers, first getting sick as a teen and then relapsing as a young adult. I really hope that I can slowly recover the last half of my twenties and be healthy in my 30s.",False,False

I was binging/purging because I couldn’t stop eating but I didn’t want to be fat. I lost some of the weight but realised that it was fucking up my teeth, and my family was figuring out as I lived at home.

I have had a bad relationship with food for as long as I can remember, but that’s when it truly developed into a disorder. I don’t know exactly why it started to be honest. I think it was when my other mental health problems started and I just needed some way to gain control over myself. I couldn’t control my emotions but I could control my weight, I guess? I just remember exercising almost constantly and starving myself during the day and bingeing on food during the night. I didn’t really know what an ED even was when I first developed one so it took a long time for me to realize it was disordered behaviour.",False,False

I don’t think I’ve ever been normal about food. When I was very young I would barely eat and it made my parents so upset, and then when I was like 9 I would eat like 6 slices of bread in secret and feel shameful and out of control about it which, in retrospect, is reminiscent of the mentality of binges but idk I feel like it doesn’t count as bingeing. When I was 10 I was going to wear a skirt on a special occasion so I ran on our treadmill until I felt sick every day the week beforehand. When I was 12 I tried to purge for the first time but couldn’t.      When I was 14 I started restricting, exercising, obsessively weighing myself. Skipping meals and lying to everyone around me about having eaten when I hadn’t. I had a private Pinterest board of thinspo. I used to write the word “fat” on my thighs w marker. I knew it wasn’t normal but I honestly still don’t know if this was “enough” to be an eating disorder bc I eventually kind of came out of it on my own and started eating again, and since it’s been so many years I can’t remember how severe/consistent the behaviors were.      15-19 I ate kind of normally / overate and gained 20 pounds. I’d still sometimes skip meals and lie about it, and I usually wouldn’t eat during the day, but in the afternoon and at night I’d consume most of my calories. Like I wouldn’t eat during the school day and then at 4pm I’d bake cookies and consume 1000 calories worth and just continue eating other stuff throughout the night. I’m only now realizing how disordered that was but I didn’t feel like food occupied that much of my thoughts and I no longer weighed myself every day so I thought I was fine.      At 19 (end of 2017; I’m 21 now) I finally purged after trying a few times throughout the years and I immediately got hooked and started doing it every day.  It literally came out of nowhere like I hadn’t even been trying to lose weight before this, I was just stressed and lonely. I’ve been in a restrict/binge/purge cycle ever since and food occupies absolutely all of my thoughts.",False,False

But the way I remember it was that at age 13 I woke up one day and abruptly, actively desired to not eat. It was like a switch flipped in my brain.

Over the years I tried unsuccessfully to lose weight.  Now I'm not even sure what I am. I wanted a healthy relationship with food and weight. I'm losing weight the healthy weight but lately I've been falling in a spiral, don't know how to define myself now. I have binged a few times and have compensated through different methods. I've been skipping meals lately and overexercising and have become obsessed with being skinny again.
