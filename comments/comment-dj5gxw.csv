I mean I was writing reallllly nasty shit to myself and logging everything I ate. I carry them around everywhere with me in my huge purse and am literally so afraid that one day I’ll die unexpectedly and someone will find them and read them and I would die of embarrassment again in the afterlife.   But of course I can’t just part with them for some weird reason?!,False,False
