I live on the other side of the world from my mum, and I haven't lived with her since I was 17 (I'm 28 now). Recently she came to visit and stayed with me and my husband for a full two and a half weeks, and all her self-sabotaging language for the duration was exhausting and really reminded me of what it was like to live with her and my dad when I was a child/teenager. My dad exhibited the same behaviours as yours does, as well as making racist and homophobic ""jokes"" about strangers whenever we were out in public. Whenever that happened I would just sit quietly and at least acknowledge internally that it was bad and I didn't want to be like that, but my mum's comments about herself I fully accepted as normal at the time, and I've definitely carried that on into my life and relationship now.   While mum was here visiting she would literally say things like, ""I'm so bad!"" while having eating or drinking ANYTHING, which was so bizarre and unnecessary-seeming to me and my husband, but after she left I started basically doing the exact same thing.",False,False

I even stopped making fun of our fatty ginger cat because I don't want them to learn that size = worth. Daughter is almost 5 and son just hit 3 and I want them to have the best possible relationship with food/weight possible.,False,False
