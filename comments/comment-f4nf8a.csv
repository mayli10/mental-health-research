I’ve been showering every day, brushing my teeth, working more on skincare, and lots of other self care things. It’s weird. I can only take care of myself when I’m starving.",False,False

When I have panic attacks I often (involuntarily) vomit, and it’s such a feeling of relief once I finally do, like I’m purging the anxiety and bad feelings, and basically finishes the attack/I can take a lower dose of diazepam at worst. So often when I’m having a panic attack I will purge, and it’s not about the food at all, but then if I binge and purge it’s those same good feelings, especially because I always feel shit during/after a binge",False,False
