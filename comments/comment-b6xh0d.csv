Everyone talks about the munchies, but I rarely get those. Instead, I'm just sitting there like ""yeah, I could go to the kitchen and start making a healthy chicken and mushroom meal that will invariably spiral into me some a hundred extra ingredients and then also making pasta as a side dish...  Or I could set up my flowerpot and vape some weed until I forget I was hungry, then keep smoking and watching Joe Rogan until I'm too lazy/sleepy to make anything but a massive plate of raw veggies and a dip cup of dressing.",False,False

I'm currently trying to cut down on use of recreational drugs to curb hunger but damn if it doesn't make it hard to not binge.  The choice sucks:  Do I get high and not eat or do I not get high and go on a food rampage?,False,False
