Eating larger portions and eating emotionally was pretty normalised in my family, so I never thought it was weird. I only realised I had a disorder after I started purging, because it’s such a stereotypically ED thing to do.",False,False

Awhile ago, I roughly calculated the amount of time that I’ve spent on ED-related thoughts (not even actions, just thoughts). Like, if I conservatively spend 6 hours a day obsessing / calculating calories / body-checking / making fantasy food lists / etc, and I multiply that 6 hours a day x 365 days a year x the number of years I’ve been like this... I actually cried when I saw the number. I wish that I’d never started that first diet half a lifetime ago :(",False,False

I was overweight but in a relatively good mindset when I decided to start living a “healthy lifestyle” and “lOsE WeIgHt FoR mYsElF” in my teens, which spiralled into a period of intense restriction and very quick weight loss. It was almost like a switch flipped for me, too. I came back from the weight loss quickly after a long binge period that eventually evened out, and stil remained in a “*healthy weight range*” but I’ve kind of been yo-yo-ing back and forth ever since.",False,False

Like dieting, exercising before and after school, eating alone in my room, just all around self conscious about my appearance even though I was petite and a healthy weight. I remember a guy telling me I had a muffin top at lunch when it was just that my jeans were kinda tight and high wasted wasn’t a trend. So I only ate a bag of cheese it’s and a vitamin water for lunch everyday.  Then in college those tendencies were worse and I was just in denial even though I knew it was a problem. I worked out A LOT, avoid the dining halls, really kept to myself.   When I relapsed hard core this year i didn’t know why until I figured out when things are chaotic and out of control in my life I do two things: clean and alter my eating habits. I was quitting my job and starting to hang out with my ex who was super flaky and just a fuck boy really.  Then one day I made a huge pot of vegetable noodle soup consisting of egg noodles, carrots, peas, celery, and veg broth. I counted each calorie on a note pad and portioned it out like meal prepping for the week. Then I started eating only a hard boiled egg and a quarter of an avocado at work every day. My excuse was “my roommate and I bought a Costco pack of eggs and we just boiled them all so they wouldn’t go bad!” Then i lost 25 lbs in 2 months and I felt great and kept going. I kept telling myself that I love salads, I love broth based soups, dairy hurts my stomach, all of that kind of stuff.   It just creeps up in ya.",False,False

I’d alway been active but slightly overweight, so I put myself on a “reasonable” diet and exercise plan and set out to lose 20 pounds. Buuut something switched on in my head, and eventually 20 became 50 (oops). People quit complimenting me and began leaving eating disorder pamphlets around, but I thought they were all full of shit because I was eating healthy and exercising and what the hell is wrong with that and I don’t look anorexic anyway.      Even stuff like social isolation and food-related meltdowns didn’t make me think I had an ED. The first time I tried to purge, though, I remember thinking ohhhh this is fucked up, I just opened a bad door. Unlike fasting or running, I couldn’t justify it as “healthy” or do it out in the open.      Not long after, my family pushed me into treatment, and it kind of all sunk in. I still had doubts though, and I have even more now because I’ve gained a lot of weight since then. I know intellectually that EDs affect people at all weights, but I still feel fraudulent a lot of the time",False,False

Basically through binging I had gotten from a healthy weight to my HW that I had in high school and started dieting (bc, as I know now, I got triggered). But that dieting went down to under &gt;!500!&lt; cals a day with exercise and I had terribly, terribly bad intrusive thoughts all the time. Somehow I found out about the term ""thinspo"" and then I found ED forums and was on them for hours every single day (even at work). Of course, I denied that I had an ED because I wasn't ""skinny enough."" Then I got super high one time when I was alone and had an ""intervention"" with myself and concluded that I indeed had (have) an ED lol. I'm undiagnosed, but I don't really need a psych to tell me I have an ED, and if I want/need a diagnosis, it won't be hard to get. I really hoped it was just a phase, but here I am still doing this 3-4 years later :'( thankfully, at least the intrusive thoughts aren't as bad or as frequent now lol. still fat tho",False,False

My ED started with me being crazy terrified of getting food poisoning (which is still a huge fear of mine, just not my *main* fear), and then when I got older and body image was a Bigger Deal and my ~emotions~ were out of control, not eating/bping was an obsession that doubled as a comfort. And then the idea of no longer having that comfort *terrified* me. So food became Bad News Bears. Eating and potentially gaining weight would take away that control.
