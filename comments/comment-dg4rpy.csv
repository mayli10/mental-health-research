I told my friends about my ED and it took them some time to fully understand it (they seemed really shocked that males could get ED's aswell). Probably would of helped them understand it quicker if I wasn't so god aw full at trying to explain things. I can think it all up perfectly in my head but when I say it out loud its just a mess lol. I had to resort to showing them cringy videos explaining lots of it.,False,False

I know dropping them may seem like a no brainer but as someone who’s trying to be more rationale than I have in the past, I really appreciate outside insight on situations before I make decisions. I will do and I’ll also do my best to not let it stop me from opening up in the future when needed",False,True

The part where you brought up what may happen behind my back is something I’ve never even thought of, and it probably is true too : (. I’m going to take your advice and try to move from this all and hopefully not let it have too much of an affect on me in the future.",False,True

Their behaviour is very cruel and unsupportive.  I am so sorry that they are treating you this way after you opened up to them. That would have taken a lot of courage for you to do as well. Shame on them!   This says so much more about them than it does you and I really hope for your sake that you dont let this stop you from opening up to others. Being able to find support is very important.   Find some better friends.,False,False

If they mock you to your face, how much do they mock you behind your back? To other people you do and don't know?  Only shit people do this, and it makes me angry that people think they can treat other people like this and not bear any consequences for their actions. I'm sorry you've become a victim of people you thought you could trust.",False,False
