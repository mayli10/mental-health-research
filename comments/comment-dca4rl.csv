Drinking lots of water, sleeping well, etc. Peppermint tea is great if you're feeling nauseous or have any heartburn. Ginger tea, imo, is REALLY great - literally just get a ginger root, grate some into a hot cup of water and sip it. There's a bunch of woo-woo medicine that says ginger is good for digestion, I don't know how true it is but anecdotally it has helped me with bloating.   &amp;#x200B;  I'm sorry you're in pain, love. I hope it eases soon.",False,False
