If it cheers you up, I took laxatives a couple weeks ago and was shitting like crazy at work (early morning, no one around) and when I went to flush the toilet it wouldn't work. Nearly fucking died in the bathroom from embarrassment and anxiety. I had to go find the maintenance worker and ask him if he turned the water off (he had). And, since I work at a place of gossipy hoes, he told everyone how freaked out I was.",False,False

And she knows The Secret.  At least someone else knows that feeling, although I am sorry that you know that feeling.  But the cleaning lady who cleaned your mess has doubtless seen worse. Maybe she just thought you were hungover in the shower or something like that",False,False

When I was in the dorms just a few weeks ago, I vomited in both the shower stalls on my floor, multiple times. Thankfully the drain cover in both came up. Not thankfully, after a few times of vomiting things stopped draining. One time, a bunch of stuff was regurgitated by the shower drain... a clump of everyone's collective hair, held together by my chunky vomit.   Basically I clogged both the showers so everyone had to take 5 minute showers cause the water drained so slowly that if you were in there longer than that the water would overflow",False,False
