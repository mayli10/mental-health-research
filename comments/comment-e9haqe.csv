When you exercise you make micro tears in your muscles, when you’re resting those tears are rebuilt but stronger - overtime this is how muscles increase in strength and size, they adapt to the stimulus given.   With any kind of ‘damage’ in the body (even the good kind) brings some amount of inflammation around the area. This is why your ankle might swell if you twist it. Imagine that in at a much smaller level around your muscles.  So you could say, in a way it’s water retention. This can make you look slightly ‘puffier’ and even weigh slightly more than what you’re used to. Most people aren’t hyper-aware of their bodies and don’t notice, but someone with an ed absolutely will.   Also, with increased fitness, comes increased muscle, and increase muscle mass is denser because muscle itself is about 75% water, while body fat is about 10% water. So slight increases in muscle and decreases in body fat can make you look the same or slightly bigger with water retention, but show a higher number on the scale.   The GOOD thing about muscle is it’s more metabolically active than body fat, meaning the mmore you have the more calories your body burns to maintain it at rest (increased BMR)   These are just facts, I’m not good at comforting people, but please know that you’re **not** getting fat from exercise, and more muscle mass and strength is a **good** thing",False,False
