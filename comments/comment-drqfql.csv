I don’t know your story but this is a very brave and smart thing you are doing for yourself in every aspect. Good job!  I never did inpatient but I did go through outpatient and I’m going to very honest with you it sucks at first and it’s  super hard.  I  probably cried and broke down everyday for the first week or so  but it gets better.    and you learn a lot I mean so much! I still carry to this day from 14yrs ago . I’m not fully recovered from my ED but I have better awareness.    Good luck!,False,False
