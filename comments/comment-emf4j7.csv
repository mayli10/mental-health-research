I was actively working on recovery. It was early morning and I made tea and offered her a biscuit (like a small cookie) and she said right to my face, ""Oh, I'm not eating fat right now."" I was like, well, excuuuuse me for being a fat pig.",False,False

Plus the *constant* unnecessary comments about ""how do you eat so much and stay skinny? Haha"" :\  When I did start gaining weight the comments about me being skinny stopped and idk which side of it felt worse.",False,False

This group helps to remind me that the environment I grew up in wasn't normal or healthy, and it helps me to piece together some of the underlying causes of my EDs.

It reminds me too much of having to turn down food that I really wanted because ED brain is a bitch. Even if they are turning it down from guilt, they could still just say ""No thank you"". There's no reason to spread guilt to other people.  Happy birthday!",False,False
