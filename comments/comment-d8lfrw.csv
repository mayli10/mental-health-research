When you regain you dont regain all the muscle you lost, unless you strength train. Most of what is regained is fat. Muscle burns more calories than fat so having a lower percentage of muscle at the same weight means that you literally require less calories to maintain or lose. So like, strength training is really useful in this regard. Not like I'm fucking doing any tho lmao.",False,False
