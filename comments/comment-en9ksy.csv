I prep myself multiple 200-300 calorie small meals to eat throughout the day so I never feel deprived and my blood sugar stays steady. I’m currently experimenting with fasting but it’s not necessary and I wouldn’t recommend it until binging is under control.,False,False

You want to avoid feeling like shit because  you risk binging if you feel too horrible. I find that 1200 cal spread throughout the day in high volume veg based meals doesn’t feel like absolute starvation.",False,False

fdx45bk,t3_en9ksy,t1_fdwq4vj,Hyper_F0cus,1,2020-01-11 11:52:08,/r/EDAnonymous/comments/en9ksy/restricting/fdx45bk/,"Yeah and depending on your BMI/BMR you could even stay under 1200 5 or 6 days a week and then have a day or two around 1800 and still lose significantly amounts of weight. I’m quite large (5’10”) and a normal BMI, I’m trying to get to a BMI around 19 or 20 as a short term goal, so with exercise and all that taken into consideration I allow myself one day every week where I up my calories. It is important to stick to strict restriction most days though.",False,False
fdwqayn,t3_en9ksy,t1_fdwprkz,prettyweeper,3,2020-01-11 10:49:16,/r/EDAnonymous/comments/en9ksy/restricting/fdwqayn/,okay that makes sense,False,True

It’s not physically possible to gain weight while restricting.   What does happen to me though on a weekly basis, I will eat around or under 1200 caps a day all week and the scale won’t budge (mostly because intestines aren’t moving very fast) then I’ll have a “cheat day” and eat between 1800-2100 and then next day will be down 2-3 lbs. this pattern has been working great for me and really helps prevent binging/keep up my morale.",False,False
