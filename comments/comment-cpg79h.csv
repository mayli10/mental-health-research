Try on what you want to wear today after a nice shower - you will not be freaking out last minute. Try out your makeup too - heck post pics and I‚Äôll cheerlead you! This is what I did for my job interviews because I have such awful self esteem üò¨  Drink enough water today - it will help your body feel better. Don‚Äôt eat too much salt on anything. Those should help w bloating.   Obviously none of that will fix your issues mentally but!! I‚Äôm sure you are bomb and are gonna kill it!!

The guy could care less about your weight and just be an overall sweet guy who likes you for you or he can be a shallow mofo and only judge you based on your appearance regardless of your personality. I was talking to this dude who went on a date with someone he met in a dating app and the first thing he told me after he finished his date with her was that she was fat and the photos she used weren‚Äôt accurate. The ironic part is he‚Äôs kinda chunky himself (he‚Äôs on a weight miss journey so lost like 20 pounds but he‚Äôs still somewhat fat) idk why he‚Äôs so fat phobic. Like before when they were chatting he was raving about how cool she is and that she‚Äôs pretty etc. but then as soon as he saw her irl all he focused on was her weight. So dumb. And he complains about being lonely and is afraid of being forever alone. Like his dumbass is doing it to himself. Anyways I hope this hinge dude isn‚Äôt a jackass and I hope your date goes well!
