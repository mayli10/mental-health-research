Too obsessed/anxious to respond to emails or texts or do any school work. It put my PhD enrolment at risk and now I'm severely behind on writing, and my advisor thinks I'm a flake. It felt really bad, but I pushed it to the back of my head where it grew and got worse. The anticipation of confronting reality and picking up the broken pieces was worse than the original anxiety!   I finally had a good day. I didn't try to do too much, just sent a few emails apologising and kinda half explaining that I was 'going through some stuff' (then I immediately turned email notifications off so I wouldn't have to read the replies haha). 'Try to have a good day' isn't advice and I guess I don't have any, but like the other comment says, one step at a time. It's not all or nothing x  &amp;#x200B;  &amp;#x200B;",False,False

I try to get out of the house and go for a hike when I'm feeling spirally and like I'm at a dead end. Just try not to think too hard about what you have to do to get out of the house. One step at a time. ðŸ’™,False,False
