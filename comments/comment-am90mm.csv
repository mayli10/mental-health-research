I'm going back to maintenance calories for now since my stomach has gotten stretched out from binges, and as you mentioned I'm afraid I'll trigger another binge if I fasted right now so  I'll eat sort of normally for a bit!! and then maybe restrict calories little by little because if I don't eventually I'm gonna go crazy lmao",False,True
