When we crave something it’s because the body is lacking in that particular nutrient. So that being said, I think vitamins are good for those with a restrictive diet/eating disorder. However, taking a multivitamin won’t make a shitty diet less shitty. It just might mitigate the effects of such somewhat, imo. ",False,False

I should eat more fresh vegetable, fruit and lean protein and less fat and carbs and if I do I don't need supplements.  If I take multivitamins when I'm in a good restriction streak, it would be good for me. ",False,False

For most people multivitamins are useless. They only do anything if you have a deficiency, in which case you would only take supplements for what you need. I do know that excessive amounts of certain vitamins can be harmful, in the same way a lack of them would be, so I suppose an overdose would be a concern too. ",False,False

They’re probably referring to people who live off of potato chips and beer, not people who restrict calories. ",False,False
