They have 20 grams of protein for 230-240 calories (depending on flavor). They're filling too and I find that they taste better than other protein bars with similar stats.,False,False

Meat is great too if you can muster it, though it has more fat. Egg whites are also pure protein.  After that, protein powder is second best, whey preferably.  Or casein. Alternatives are okay, primarily soy, but even soy isn't as good as whey. Make sure to look at the sources.  Protein bars are okay too if you can muster eating them. It widely varies from company to company though. I stick to Quest. Bars have to lowest protein ratios out of everything I listed aside form maybe meat.",False,False

Canned beans are awesome. I love doing weird bean burritos with low fat refried beans.  Sliced deli turkey is the shit but watch out for that sodium.  I am not vegan/vegetarian but I love a lot of the meat substitutes out there. But they get kind of pricey... You may be able to ask your family to pick something up if it's on sale. Sweet Earth has some yummy burritos. They're under 300 cal. The last couple I had were 16g protein.  When it comes to protein bars, I love the ONE brand. Tastes better than quest. The ones I have with me right now have 210 cal, 20g protein. 1g sugar (23g carbs but 8g of that is fiber) 7g of fat. Which sounds scary but I eat these as a meal replacement and fat can help with satiety and nutrient absorption.",False,False
