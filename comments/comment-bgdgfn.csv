A lot of Korean girls, especially idols, do have disordered eating bc of the high beauty standards. It's just considered normal and ""taking care of your body"" to eat minimal portions &amp; skip meals; it would take a very severe case to actually be diagnosed with an eating disorder there and have anyone be seriously concerned about their wellbeing. Look at AOA's Jimin and her transformation. There are people who think she looks too skinny because they saw how she was before, but if she'd debuted at her current weight they'd think nothing of it and be in awe of how good she looks. It's really fucking sad actually.",False,False

Seola of WJSN talks about cutting out bread and switching to americanos instead of lattes. There's clearly a shift towards sustainable weight maintenance instead of the batshit crazy weight cycling that's been a norm for a long time.",False,False

IU is small and underweight but even she would be dead if she kept doing the ""IU diet"" since it first came out.  you have to understand Korean celebrity lifestyles to understand what these diets are for... they are crash diets. they are diets to make sure that idol looks skinny enough for the stage and for the camera.  it's completely normal for idols to gain weight back during their ""off"" periods when they're not promoting. it's weight cycling, and it's not good for your body at all.  since their career depends on it, it's considered acceptable for them. but please do not do this. Also, IU has come out as being a bulimic so that speaks to the difficulty of maintaining her body. is she skinny because she's living off of sweet potato dinners and apple breakfasts? or is she skinny because she's purging anything that goes over her limit?",False,False
