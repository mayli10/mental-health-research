Decaf espresso, coffee, and iced coffee! The frozen coffee always has caffeine (and sugar), but an iced cappuccino (which is slushy-like) can be decaf. (and sugar free!!) :)",False,False

I've gone in and asked for just a toasted English muffin &amp; been able to get it, they have packets of jam and margarine sometimes, and also some locations carry fresh fruit (usially bananas)!

If I ever get something to eat i get the egg white wake up wrap its 150 calories for one and you can get it without cheese too. They also have oatmeal as well and the veggie egg white omelet on a multigrain thin and its good without cheese and usually i get rid of the top of the sandwich thin.  /.....I would give anything for them to start carrying a reduced fat cream cheese or something not so scary,False,True
