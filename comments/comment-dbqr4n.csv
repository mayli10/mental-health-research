I'll squeeze those delicious green bastards into my limit. Idc. Me to my ED brain: you'll never take me avocados. Not even from me cold dead hands!   There's just so much you can do with them.   Few of my favorites:   Simply on its own with some salt and pepper.   Mashed on toast topped with a sunny side up egg.  Mash and mix together with tuna to replace mayo in tuna salad.  Throw some avocado, tomato, cucumber, and onion together. Dress with lemon juice, salt, and pepper.. you got yourself a mighty fine and simple salad.",False,False
