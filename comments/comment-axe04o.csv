I got fresh parmesan and basil to put on top and sprung for higher quality meat.  I guess if I make it more decadent and special it won't feel as bad but I am still upset I didn't get to plan ahead. I plan on put the same effort I put into my work cooking into this meal and trying to dissect the flavors when I eat it and try my best to eat intuitively.  Thank you for the comment and empathy. ,False,True

I’m sorry you’re struggling. One thing from therapy that helped me was the concept of making whatever you decide to do a conscious choice, so that you’re not allowed to feel guilty about it later. That way you just move forward from it, rather than letting it break you completely ❤️  Idk if that helps at all, but either way I feel you, and you have my support.",False,False
