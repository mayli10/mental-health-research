Studies have shown that it is pretty ineffective (and incredibly expensive, regardless) if someone goes inpatient when they are not actively invested in their inpatient treatment/getting better.   Outpatient therapy is a much more likely and better outcome of coming clean. And I really encourage you to do so. The earlier you seek help, the better your chances of a full recovery. You can do this! We're all here for you. ",False,False
