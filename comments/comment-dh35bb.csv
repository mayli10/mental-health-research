Ohhh, **the irony.** OP [edit: sorry, *commenter,* ""thefakeme,"" not OP], your own flair suggests that just like ""literally any other mammal"" *you* are eating as much as you possibly can for survival – and more. Naturally *on this sub* our focus is those starving themselves. But across our society with two-thirds the populace overweight or obese, and that number rising(!) – the ED killing many (and it's the elephant in the room) is our runaway *over-* eating.  Personally, while I wish urgent help for every victim of restrictive EDs, I'll speak that which cannot be spoken: *they're unto something.* Sure, they take things too far. But me, I'll have a bit of what they're having. Just sayin'…",False,False

Talk about top of the food pyramid privilege.,False,False
