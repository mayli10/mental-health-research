Having a longer cycle of restricting/normal eating or binge eating is still an eating disorder. If you are having uncontrollable thoughts, and guilt about eating, and purposefully restrict yourself for any reason (control, body image, coping), itâ€™s still an eating disorder. It comes in waves, and your feelings and issues are validated no matter the timeline or fluctuation.   Also in case you need to hear it- you as a human being, with thoughts and feelings and goals, are valid and deserving of a good relationship with your body and food regardless of what it looks like on the outside.",False,False
