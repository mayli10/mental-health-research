Walk around the park a little? I know it’s hard to be comfortable with your body in situations like that. (Trust me, Ive been there) sounds like distracting yourself right now is a good choice since you have some time to kill. I know it feels shitty but wallowing on this for the next few hours is just going to hurt you even more. I hope you feel better soon and find some positives throughout your day at the park. Be gentle with yourself, another opportunity will arise where you’ll feel more comfortable. You can take all the time you need right now to focus on feeling good.",False,False
