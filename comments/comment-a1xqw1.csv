I’m a bit bigger than you but we’re similar.   I’m 1.63m and I used to be 37kg I was “model thin” and I loved it tbh. After having kids I was 52kg and I had big boobs and butt, but slim toned arms and legs bc I did MMA, and I loved that too. I was hot! Lol.   Down to 43kg now and now in my late 30s I look worse at this weight than I did at 37kg when I was young. My skin seems “loose” around my bones and my ribs look emaciated, I have this dent at the front of my rib cage where I should have cleavage. I hate wearing bikini on the beach and would love to put weight on, but I’m scared that my body will look different, that I’ll just get a big fat belly and stay too skinny in other areas.   Now I’ve seen that skinny looks different after 30/after kids I do worry that the normal weight won’t look as good as it did before and getting back to 52kg seems too daunting. I’ve set my goal for now to 46 as I think small steps is more manageable. I guess I’ll just take it from there and if I’m comfortable I’ll go for 48.   Gaining weight is hard, not just physically but mentally too. Think too far ahead and there’s a risk of feeling overwhelmed and relapsing. Just like overweight people who set realistic goals are more likely to succeed, I think that gradual and realistic is the key to sustain gains too. ",False,False

I was skinny, still ~1-3 pounds underweight (118-120 at 5’7)  Stopped working out, had kids &amp; now I’m 97-98 lbs, obviously still 5’7.. I’m terrified to gain weight now. I don’t have the time to work out. Every time my weight goes up it is all in my stomach it seems like... or my face. So instead I just refuse to let myself gain weight  It sucks bc I was happier with myself at that weight and not obsessive about what I ate at all",False,False
