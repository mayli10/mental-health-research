Yeah, it's not just him but he's the worst.  Anyone who thinks they're going to make EC want recovery by telling her to eat or telling her she'll be hotter is an uneducated dick.  I saw the video and it's all Wow, you'd be so hot I'd totally date you.  If there was a reason NOT to recover, then that's it, right there.  I'm not into youtubers (only asmr), but I'm aware of Cooney because of the ED, and of onion because he's a notorious prick.  I don't have any thoughts about Eugenia tbh.  She has a problem, but she's not the only one.  It's annoying that so many people want to see her check into a clinic yet there are women in a more advanced state of malnutrition on ig and nobody cares.  They're not famous so meh.  (Or maybe they really haven't ever seen many anorexics in their life and we have because it's part of our life having an ED).  I'm not sure what onion's motive is.  He said he's turned monetisation off for his EC videos now so it's not for cash.  It's like he gets off to needling her and he doesn't really gaf about her.  Summary, it's sad that she's going through it but nobody except herself is going to ask for help.  He's a nobhead.  I don't get the popularity of some of the famous youtubers and he's one of the main ones where I see no appeal.",False,False

(Also side note that his wife Lainey is androgynous goals)  However I really don't think he's handling the whole situation with Eugenia right, even if he is doing it out of a place of concern. Part of his argument is that her social media presence is triggering people with EDs,but him making videos on her all the time is just increasing her exposure even more, and if he thinks that him just trying to logically explain that she needs to gain weight is gonna fix her then he really doesn't know much about EDs or mental illness in general.",False,False
