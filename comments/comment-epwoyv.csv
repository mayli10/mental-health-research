I also think that because i was eating it allowed my family to turn a blind eye to my ED when I lived at home for a summer in college so get your frustration. I don’t really have much advice to offer but i’m sorry you’re feeling this way. EDs are about so much more than caloric intake, and eating sometimes doesn’t make an ED any less real.",False,False
