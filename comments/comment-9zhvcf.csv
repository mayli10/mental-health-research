So instead of gaining 30lbs in a few months, I did it over 3 years .  I am thankful for nature.  For green forests and the sound that wind makes as it sweeps through their branches.  I am thankful for the snows and the sun that melts the snow into rushing rivers and thundering waterfalls.  I am thankful for the clear smooth water in the creeks that quenches my thirst after a long walk.  I am thankful for the surroundings that don't judge my body or my ability or my mistakes. The forest and the trees and the mountains accept my silence and my reflections; give me solitude and quiet to heal and breathe.  Mostly I am thankful for my daughter who gives me reason to live and manage my illness. It is for her that I get it together every day, that I suffer always with hope that one day it will be better.   I am thankful that I see kindness and love everywhere, even though I don't see it for myself. One day it will come, and I know I will be thankful for the hope I hold onto each and every day.",False,False
