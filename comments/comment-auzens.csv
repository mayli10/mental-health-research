But if I got into bed with the intention to sleep, I'd lie awake. Purely anecdotal, but I think my brain associated my bed with work rather than sleep, and it was keeping me from sleeping well. Now I have a separate work place and a sleep place, and that (plus routine, going to bed earlier, etc) seemed to help me fall asleep. Idk exactly which of the many factors it could've been, so take it with a grain of salt, especially if working in bed works for you! Sometimes though I'd read over what I did the night before and be like ""what the fuck is that, that doesn't make any sense"" lol. Idk, I hope you find something that helps keep the thoughts at bay so you can sleep better. Good luck!!!",False,False

If you need more guidance for skincare or grooming, the /skincareaddiction sub is great for that, have lots of product recommendations and beginner routines! (I'm not linking directly just to keep from calling attention to our sub).   The cleanser was a big game changer for me, I used to wash my face with bar soap and it definitely did not help my acne problems. If you need a spot treatment solution for anywhere on your body, I've been using the Clinique brand for years and it's always worked well. Just be sure to follow it up with a moisturizer cause it's pretty drying, especially on my face.

I go to bed with audio with words so I can't and won't think. It's usually podcasts or Youtube videos. If I forget it, I end up mentally falling into existential rabbit holes, like whether free will is real, when I'll die, the things to come 500 years from now that I'll miss, whether we'll figure out immortality before me or my parents die, or I start to become scared and aware of my heartbeat.

I go to bed at wildly different times every night, from 10 to 2. Productivity, even if it's just busywork with no real purpose, makes me feel good and safe and I stuff my day with it, mostly to keep from eating.   But, no matter what, I always try to make sure I do my nighttime thing. For me, it's washing my face (helped clear up my acne, which was a gigantic insecurity and another source of anxiety for me for many years), brush my teeth (I got so many cavities when I was little because I never built the habit, now my mouth tastes bad if I don't and my dentist is super happy with me, haven't needed a new filling in years), and put my hair in a towel or t shirt for bed (protects my curls, which I didn't know I had until I started caring for my hair better and it totally improved my self esteem and further insecurities and anxieties).   A lot of things beyond my sleep quality improved once I consistently followed a night routine. In the summer, when I don't have classes, I also include some yoga or reading to relax and it usually keeps all the thoughts away, cause I fall asleep right after. It certainly didn't fix my entire life and I still miss a night here and there, but it improved a lot of things. It takes at most 10 minutes out of my day, which if I'm going to bed at 1 already won't matter much for how much else I can get done or how much sooner I can fall asleep if I didn't do it.  I would really encourage you to try something! Even if it's just brushing your teeth and then hopping into bed, no matter what time it is. My days aren't nearly consistent enough for me to have a ""okay it's 10 o'clock, everything else shuts off now so I can start my routine and go to bed"" kind of thing, but even then it helps a ton.",False,False

My anxiety is very much centered around being perfect. So basically, my day is so stuffed full of things that I have planned down to the minute that every night before bed I am doing something different. Maybe I'm working out because 10 pm was the only time to fit it in. Maybe I am doing homework that isn't due for 3 more days. Honestly, if i am doing something that benefits now but has no benefit for the long run, i feel guilty for it. Like reading to take a mental break. If it's not a textbook assignment, i feel guilty for reading.

I used to think I was helpless and I thought what I thought and that was me, but after a lot of practice, I've gotten better at going ""nope not today Satan.""

The same thing happened to my dad, so I'm sure it'll come soon for me, too.   I do the same! If I don't have a plan, esp. for food, for the next several days I keep thinking about it and can't fall asleep. That's fairly recent, like after I stopped meditating, so idk how to stop it and I have no advice for you :(  Sometimes if I plan to get up early and do the day's planning then, then I can fall asleep. But again, sometimes nothing works. Sorry, it's so frustrating and tiring! I just do my best to keep my night routine going, take my melatonin, try to relax/shut down the thoughts and get to sleep. But sometimes I do everything perfectly and it still doesn't work.   Do you have a night routine you do before bed? It's kind of a normie tip so idk if it helps at all with OCD or insomnia, but some people say it eventually gets their brains and bodies into the habit of going to sleep right after finishing the routine. Takes a while to build up though.",False,False

Other times even if I take it, I start thinking, and then can't fall asleep despite the hormone.   I also used to have a nightly meditation habit of 10-15 minutes, which put me to sleep almost instantly (about half the time i even fell asleep during the practice lol), so maybe you could try that? I know it sounds super wishy washy and it's not for everyone, it didn't instantly make my life better but at least I got to sleep more easily. It helped with the thoughts usually too, because there was a space of time that I could think them and let my mind run, but for the rest of the time I was counting breaths and *not* thinking. It only worked if I did it in bed though and could just lie down during or immediately after, because if I had to get up from some other room and walk to my bed the thoughts beat me there.",False,False
