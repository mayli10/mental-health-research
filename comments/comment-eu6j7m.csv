I tell them I have no objective or desire to continue purging because it's scary and hurts a lot physically, but here I am still always on a 'diet', cutting out sugar, OMAD, intermittent fasting... seemingly healthy but here I am reading this book about ""bulimic college students"" and crying because I identified with it too much and realized how much emotional fulfillment I feel like I'm lacking.  yeah... I guess it's better though.",False,False
