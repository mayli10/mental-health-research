She was, unfortunately, really good at it. She never binged. She found it easy to simply not eat anything.  It's incredibly triggering and frustrating for me... someone who b/ps practically daily.

The closest i got was eating a bowl of carbonara on top of what i had already ate for that day but that's not even really a binge.   Now i binge everyday lmao,False,False

I frequently skip days as I've never had much of an appetite to begin with. Most of the time I only eat one meal. My version of ""binging"" is eating two sandwiches instead of one. I don't bother counting calories.   Before, I'd have cravings. However, over these past two years, I've lost 95% of them. I used to love shortbread cookies. Ordered a box of them off Amazon. They tasted like a bit like saw dust. Same thing for many other foods I used to love. Each time I'd have an old favorite and found it lacking, the more and more I regretted bothering to eat because it'd either give me stomach cramps or just not taste all that great.   When I come out of fasts, I'll have some broth, and that's it. That's enough to sate me. If not, I'll throw in some mushrooms to make it a mushroom soup, or add some rice.   The only thing left that I can still appreciate is ice cream, and yes, I can and will eat the whole tub of it and not feel a lick of shame.   I think that's it. I don't feel bad for eating. I don't shame myself for enjoying what little food I do or for breaking my fasts. What makes me anorexic in particular is that I'm easily put off eating, and that I'll take it to extreme lengths (like not eating for those 12 days). But I think that's what balances it out, the fact that, should I want something to eat in the moment or as a craving, I just go ahead and eat it. ""Better a little bit of what you love rather than a lot of something mediocre or unwanted.""",False,False

If you consider it eating more than you normally do in an average day though, like since I usually eat max 1500 calories then say maybe eating 2000 calories, then I guess. When I'm restricting I'll sometimes get too hungry after a few days of it and eat a normal amount even though I only wanted to eat like half of my normal amount. I don't know if you would consider that binge eating. When I get like that I do kind of just want to eat absolutely anything I can get my hands on, but I have really good self control so I tend to stop with an amount that I know is enough for me. Part of that comes from knowing that if I eat too much I will feel sick though.",False,False

I am probably on the more 'restrictive' side of EDs, as in, I can easily spend whole months just restricting and never binging (although it really depends on how deep I am into my ED - right now for example I am binging much more often).

I have binged, but only two times, when I was going on and then off this medication that fucked me up. However, my anorexia was ""unusual"" (and in my opinion so is everyones', since everyones' experience is unique to them) in that I restricted to a comparably high amount of calories compared to the average person suffering. If you ""high restrict"" and are ok with slower weight loss you likely won't feel the need to binge. However, for most people with anorexia it's a huge struggle to be ok with something like that.   &amp;#x200B;  I did have extreme hunger, but only when I started eating more. However at this point I was mentally doing well and was ok with increasing my calories to a high amount that satisfied the hunger. So I didn't binge, I just started eating three substantial meals a day plus snacks.",False,False
