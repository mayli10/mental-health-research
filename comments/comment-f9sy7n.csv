The way she like almost hoards the food, mostly biscuits ice cream frozen pizzas and pastries is what tipped me off. She’s also very obese which is not common in my country at all.    Every time I see her I wanna tell her that she’s not alone in this and that I empathize with her so much. I just know I wouldn’t want someone to invade my space like that, so i don’t",False,False

Sometimes I don't understand why they let people do so much to lose weight when she was so obviously so far away from LIVING life properly, but who of us is? Only 1 person has ever really questioned my weightloss, thank you that one teacher, I wish you the most gracious life.",False,False

And we make eye contact and recognise each other. It's something behind the eyes. And I know that sounds so stupid but I'm sure I can instantly pick out the restrictive eater in a crowd. It's not even a weight thing.,False,False

I’m always seeing skinny people and instantly looking at their thighs to decide if they’re malnourished. Usually not, but occasionally I’ll see a particularly skinny woman who seems more tired than she should be. And I feel a lot of things. Mostly sad, partially validated, and sometimes competitive. It’s a weird mix. But it’s kinda nice to have company in Hell.",False,False
