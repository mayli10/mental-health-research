I lost a bunch of weight in high school, then I gained half of it back in my gap year, then i was gaining and losing the same 10 lbs for 2 years and finally gained another 20 lbs and now I'm back where I began.  I realised my body is super tired and weak from my past ED behaviours and probably couldn't endure serious restricting and purging for prolonged periods of time.  Right now I would suggest focusing on gaining back your strength, immunity etc. I started taking a bunch of vitamins and supplements that I don't really get from food since I eat a lot of junk.  Health is so much more important, which we often ignore here. Please try and care for your body no matter how much you hate it. ‚ù§",False,False
