They handed it out like candy so I asked the patients about it. What I was told was like a horror story - everyone had gained huge amounts of weight on it. One girl was 40kg and increased to 80 and it was like it had gone straight to her belly and nowhere else. Even though they all said it was a good medication and they felt better psychologically on it, I refused to gain weight even though I dont eat anything. So I put the pills under my tongue everyday and flushed them down the toilet.  &amp;#x200B;  I did actually look into psychological studies about whether the weight gain effects were bad, and it was only moderate (5-10kg most of the time - not 30/40kg which was probably more due to the side effects like sugar craving etc) but the idea of any weight gain at all when I wasn't changing any actual habits scared the shit out of me.",False,False

She's kinda keen on fitness and diet stuff too (not extreme just in that generally vague ""light activity and healthy eating"" way) so she asks more than others and I just make excuses about exercising and watching what I eat. Same for my mother, but she has even less of an idea. She doesn't ask so I don't have to lie as much but I feel so bad when she's ""proud"" of me for ""getting healthy"" and I have to smile and nod because she would die if she found out I was losing weight in an unhealthy way.  I guess I lie by ommission to everyone... I feel bad when I tell my partner I've eaten when I haven't, or eaten more than I really did. Been a few times where I've picked them up some food and pretended I ate mine in the restaurant/car when I didn't get anything at all. But they also see me when I binge and stuff so I don't think they're too worried lol.",False,False

He was too proud to send me to the hospital, and my disease was too controlling to allow any room for recovery-thoughts. Teachers were literally offering me their lunches at school everyday and gyms would send trainer to ""talk me down"" from exercising when I came in. No one knew what the fuck to do to help me.
