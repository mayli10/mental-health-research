Before I even told my friend about it on multiple occassions she jokingly told our friend group ""eat, dont be like fouram444, she doesn't eat"".  Or a few months ago thus other friend of mine took a look through my notebook because I let her, it was just filled with my schedule and to-do list and whatnot and forgot that months prior when I got the notebook I wrote down a safe foods list with calories for each portion.  She read it out ""foods I can eat"" and flipped the page and saw my exercise routine, and then she said ""oh I think I'm getting to your more personal stuff now, here"" and she gave it back.  It was polite, also, this girl commented on how ""she never sees me eat"".  Like, bro, if only you knew ;(",False,False

There are often catered lunches and free bagels and donuts every Friday. I have a policy of not accepting any free food at work, and I even tell people about it.
