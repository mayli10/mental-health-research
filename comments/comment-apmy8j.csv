I also had like 5 different classes that semester on the upper floors of my college and didn't know where any of the elevators were. I couldn't possibly count how many times I tripped on the way to class because I was running late and going up the stairs too quickly. Hopefully you don't have to get one of those things. Just try to take it easy for a little while until it heals.,False,False

Please learn from my mistake and DO NOT RETURN TO EXERCISE TOO QUICK. Seriously, you could re-injure yourself.  Hope you heal up quick! ",False,False
