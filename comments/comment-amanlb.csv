I wasn’t ready for recovery and it gave me this awful view on what recovery is! Also it caused me to learn to eat super fast and shovel food in my mouth as quickly as possible to get it over with, which introduced me to binging and purging. There was LITERALLY no good that came from it. ",False,False

Not to mention messing up my relationship with my \*brother\* who my parents would make watch me eat when they couldn't (yikes) and being told to finish every little bit of food on your plate (as if having to  scrape the milligram of peanut butter out of the corner of the packet with the tip of your knife isn't disordered).   And forcing me into recovery before I was ready and basing the whole thing around supervision so when I moved away for university I relapsed HARD,False,True

Not to mention that it fucked up my relationship with my parents. All Maudsley did for me was make me untrusting and skeptical of people, MORE terrified of food, and bitchy and defensive when asked to eat. I haven’t had a milkshake in 6 years because I’m convinced they all have boost and butter hidden in them. I can’t finish a plate of food, I have to leave at least a little bit, because if I finish it, like Maudsley mindset forces you to, I’m going to be in recovery (AKA fat). ",False,False
