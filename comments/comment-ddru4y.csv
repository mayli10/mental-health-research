I'm in the thick of it right now and I'm hungry every two hours at LEAST, if not immediately after I've eaten something. Sometimes my stomach is full but my brain still thinks I'm hungry, because it's finally able to get the nutrients it needs and it's desperate to get my body healthy.  Don't worry, it's not forever!",False,False

I think that insatiable hunger is normal and yes, it's because your body is scared it won't get fed again. Are you eating enough to maintain your weight? Are you eating what you want  to eat, or is it the food fantasy thing that you are thinking about food because you want to eat, say, a grilled cheese sandwich and instead you eat a salad, then you can't stop thinking about the sandwich? anyway we care, we're here for you",False,False
