It wasn‚Äôt ED based so I literally low restricted like crazy. You know the drill, my poop producing guts were like ‚Äúok we‚Äôre not needed. Better just shut off.‚Äù So after I finally made it into Renfrew Philly my body was not ready for refeeding. I was at a normal BMI at the time so they basically just started feeding me a maintenance MP off the bat. Also I really did want to eat and I tend to play ‚Äúperfect patient‚Äù so I was eating 100% right away so I could get privileges. After 9 days without a shit I started to feel horrible. I was distended. Every bite of food into my belly was pain. I went to the nurses and finally convinced them to give me something. The bitch ass nurse lead says there‚Äôs no possible way it‚Äôs been 9 days. I‚Äôm like I literally haven‚Äôt pooped since I‚Äôve been here. Then they gave me magnesium citrate. Anyone who‚Äôs had mag citrate knows that it‚Äôs the most foul thing of all time. So I drank the whole bottle and they told me that it can take up to 12 hours to hit. So when I hadn‚Äôt shit by the time I‚Äôd gone to bed I said I would wake up to shit I was gonna.   Well spoiler alert I didn‚Äôt really wake up to shit. I woke up to myself shitting. It basically felt like that hardened compacted poop was blasting out of me as bullets. Then the gush of mushy shit started. I jumped up and started screaming at the top of my lungs. It was honestly horrible. I was so upset. I run to the bathroom dragging shit all over the bedroom. I was in one of the 4 bed suites so my three roommates were waking up and were like WTF. I ran to the bathroom and was crying hysterically as my bowels finished emptying. I didn‚Äôt know what to do with my shit soaked self so I stripped and got into the shower. Except I realized I didn‚Äôt have any shower stuff in there with me. Ever try to wash various viscosity poo off yourself using only water? Well it sucks.   By now the RC has swarmed my room and were evacuating my roommates and suite mates. It was a literal biohazard. Plus a girl with PTSD had started a full blown disassociate episode from my screaming- so she was screaming and crying and thrashing around in my literal shit party.    Basically we couldn‚Äôt sleep in the room that night. Plus I got in trouble for the whole situation since I had triggered this girl into an upsetting flashback that caused her to spread my shit all over our room.   Overall that was the most disgusting and upsetting night of my life in treatment. ",False,False

When I was 16 I had my only affair with lax abuse. I was hardcore binging at night, then taking lots of lax, going to school the next day and fasting, and then would eventually shit my brains out in the PM. So one day I was pounding the elliptical like any sporty ED teen does. The YMCA was across the street my high school so right after school it was filllllllllled with other student. I was doubled over in gut pain but kept pushing myself on the elliptical on a high resistance. The stomach pain got worse and worse until I was telling myself if I could burn 500 calories then I could go to the bathroom. Well 500 calories came and went and I kept pushing myself. I decided to just let out a tiny fart and suddenly I had explosive lax diarrhea into my short athletic shorts. So many people saw me. So. Fricken. Many. I felt like I was gonna pass out and kind of kept leaking shit as I made a mad dash for the locker room. Honestly one of my most embarrassing moments of my entire life. It was such a wild moment for everyone who saw it too. I never lived down the time that ChaosSauces shit herself at the YMCA. Then went I was IP in senior year no one was even surprised bc obviously someone who shits their gym shorts that aggressively has an ED. ",False,False
