The binges keep getting smaller because I have so many memories of how horrible I felt from past binges.   Once I get to that certain point where I start to get really out of control and panicky Iâ€™ve associated that feeling with every awful thing that comes out of a binge (bloated, sick, exhausted, guilt, lethargy) and so I get really scared and just canâ€™t continue eating. Itâ€™s weird",False,False

I used to be super restrictive in my preteen and early adult life (I was diagnosed AN-R at 12 or 13), then went through periods of semi recovery in my early 20â€™s (looking back at it though it honestly just seems like 3 or 4 separate year long binge phases). I would purge occasionally, but not more than a few times a month. After I had my daughter in April 2017 I went back to restricting heavy to lose the pregnancy and binge weight; I was doing so well. Until I ate like a normie on thanksgiving and have been b/p-ing like 3x a week ever since. I have no idea why itâ€™s so hard to get back on track. I wish I did.  I canâ€™t get back to restriction to save my life. If I eat once it triggers a b/p sesh.   I know neither is healthy, but I really feel so much better restricting. I feel so out of control now and all the overeating has completely made my self esteem shit. I am clearly not AN-R anymore and that is one of the hardest parts for me.  I hope youâ€™re doing okay. Sorry I just was like ranting on your post. I was typing that while eating fucking cookies and trying to figure out there I can vom since my SO is home taking a nap before he goes to work, so Iâ€™m a bit emotional right now. ",False,False

People here are beating themselves over eating 1200 calories a day and Iâ€™m over here and canâ€™t tolerate much below 2000 ðŸ˜… ",False,False

The only times I am able to get a restriction cycle going at all is when something major in my life or schedule changes (moving, summer break, new job) and I am extremely busy. But my daily intake increases each time.   It's also been much easier after I gained ~10 lbs but who cares since I'm just making up for my prior failure lol. ",False,False
