What worked for me is just remembering how great i'll feel once i'm recovered. No more calorie counting or freaking out at going out to eat.  None of that bullshit. Honestly i don't have any advice to combat those particular thoughts but thinking about my life once i'm recovered has helped me not give up on it. Hopefully you feel better soon ‚ù§,False,False
