I fucking love them. It might be more fun than just jogging haha My favorite are Chloe Ting, and they usually combine cardio and body weight exercises. There are also Zumba and dance tutorials but the best thing is that it is all free and you can do it from home â™¡   I know some people like to avoid weightlifting and body weight exercises, however 1 lb of muscles takes up roughly have the space as 1 lb of fat, and it increases your metabolism and ability to burn fat. I have a scale that measures body weight as well as body fat, and so Iâ€™m not as worried about the weight fluctuations, but the body fat ones.",False,False
