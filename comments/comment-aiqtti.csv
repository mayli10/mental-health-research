Not only did I basically never feel full/satisfied after eating, but even foods I previously adored like donuts wouldn't ""taste good"" the same way they did when I was healthier, so going out of my way to eat fear foods or really any food became completely pointless. I think at a certain point your body just gets so hungry, food almost becomes emotionally meaningless in a way. You are driven purely by a primal urge to eat anything and everything, and then when you restrict further, even that goes away, and the only thing you have left is your self-hatred. It was a horrible existence.",False,False

I had a full on breakdown over lignonberry crepes at IHOP once. Embarrassed my then boyfriend. Waitress was a sort of typical lifelong southern server, aka a sweetheart. She tried to make it right, but my brain is like a petulant child. Once my food is ""ruined"", I can't eat anymore. (Ironic given that I usually can't stop eating.)",False,False

Iâ€™d been terrified to eat there for two years so over Christmas my SO and I resolved to get a meal there. We went and I chickened out last minute, managed to have a bite of his grilled cheese dunked in the tomato soup, but that was it.   Couple weeks later somebody found a WHOLE ENTIRE DEAD RAT in their bread bowl.   Dunno if that will make you feel any better lol. I have full on melt downs when I order food and itâ€™s subpar so I relate to your still thinking about it a week later, Iâ€™m not trying to make fun of you or anything, just - it could be worse, I guess?

Saving up and anticipating something high calorie and then having it be a disappointment feels absolutely fucking terrible man. Itâ€™s like, damn!! I canâ€™t believe I just wasted so many calories and progress on something that wasnâ€™t even worth it!!  Just remember that in all honesty, 780 isnâ€™t that much. Youâ€™ll still lose even with it there, and 1200 is still really little. I hope you donâ€™t dwell on it for too much longer, good luck!",False,False
