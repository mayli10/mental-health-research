You could just peek in the door or have a friend fake a call that you have to leave? I’d try at least one meeting and see how it goes :) I wish we had something like that here :( or “I hate myself so I purge and abuse laxatives since I can’t stop eating” anonymous :/,False,False

I was looking at the OA website and most of the 12 steps talk about God and I’m not really comfortable with religious stuff,False,True

I've been going to OA for almost 2 months now and have reduced bping from daily (sometimes multiple times a day) to about once a week (and trying to quit!) Give it a shot if you can op!,False,False

Even though everyone else is going through the same thing. Maybe ashamed is the word? I’ve been chew/spitting instead of over eating lately. I hope if you do go that it’s a great and positive experience for you OP!,False,False
