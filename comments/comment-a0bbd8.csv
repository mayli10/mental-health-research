I'm sorry this dude was an asshole to you. It's hard to find people to mesh with that really get you, but just because you haven't found your person doesn't diminish your worth. ",False,False

I know it hurts like hell to have this shit happen (speaking from experience), but anyone who believes trans people are repulsive solely for being trans are repulsive themselves. You are a man despite any incongruities you may have with the ""typical"" depiction of a man. Lots of people don't fall within that typical depiction for a huge variety of reasons, and it's okay.  There are so many awful people out there and their actions/words hurt like hell (and unfortunately good fucking lord SO many of them are on dating sites), but there are also a ton of kickass people who aren't transphobic garbage and don't try to deny that you're a man.  All of that may sound cheesy but... Sometimes the reminders can help. I'm sorry you had to deal with that asshole, and I'm sending a ton of love your way. ",False,False

You deserve to be with someone who thinks you're wonderful!! Do you really want to be with some asswipe who is (a) so fucking oblivious they didn't bother reading your bio, (b) is just a trashcan of a person that he actually let those words slide across his keyboard? I mean that is not a fucking acceptable way for a human being to act.   Sorry but fuck that guy. You're worth a million of him. You fucking slay every day, don't let this fucking neckbeard occupy another moment if your energy. ",False,False

I’m not trans, so it’s not the same, but I have the same kind of self-talk. No amount of lost weight will ever make my dad love me. :/   I’m sorry you’re feeling extra down.

Life can seem really shit sometimes that’s for sure. Sometimes I roll out of bed and go “well hello there MAN FACE” and want to fall into a pit and never come out but other days I see me for the woman I really am. Ups and downs, I just have to remind myself that it’s my head doing me in. People that aren’t me don’t fixated on my face, my eyebrows, my nose, like I do. Normal people don’t see my stomach underneath my shirt and go “hmm probably another pound down would do”  It’s all in our head, and I just haven’t figured out if that’s better or worse ",False,False
