I kind of just blurted it out and they were really taken aback by it but supportive. They basically asked me what I wanted to do about it (like therapy or pills or whatever) and asked me to explain what's been going on. They asked me how much I've been eating, what I weigh, etc. I would be prepared for them being surprised and asking questions and making some insensitive/triggering comments.

You are so capable and this is a really brave thing to do. Wishing you the best x",False,False
