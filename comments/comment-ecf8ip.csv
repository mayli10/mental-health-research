The bloating is almost surely from it as well. Perhaps try a vegetarian version in smaller portions? Since it doesn’t have fermented fish extract it might help with smell and some bloating.  Try taking probiotics in the morning on an empty stomach if not already doing so :)",False,False

I’m gonna blame the kimchi, unless you usually eat that much without side effects.  I mean cabbage/kohl is kind of infamous for causing gas.  (One lacto pill per day sounds reasonable, unless the directions say otherwise???).   Anyway, feel better!",False,False
