I got told to stop it by every nurse every impatient though. It was incredibly annoying beyond belief because I could not stop, it's what I do to help myself as long as I can remember, but they only saw it as an eating disorder behavior until my parents complained. After that I was allowed to stim with my hands without harm (though I did regardless lol just turned into extra ensures I would never drink thus  a tube) but I was STILL penalized for my legs. They tell us it's a problem to worry about that stuff just to burn calories, but then they enforced it into my brain and now I just shake my legs back and forth purposely as a way to exercise since shaking is a normal thing I do and doesnt feel like it's doing anything",False,False

I do not know how to sit still. A lot of that comes from being in constant pain(I have some chronic pain issues)so for instance I rock when I'm sitting and look like a total loon.,False,False

It’s always been a nervous habit for me but also once I developed an ED it’s gotten more intentional. Can’t just be still...ever :/,False,False
