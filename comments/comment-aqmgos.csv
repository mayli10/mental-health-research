This morning I poured myself a glass of milk, took one tiny sip, then accidentally spilled all of it. So I took it as a sign and didn't pour another, just cleaned my room and did some laundry. But later my best friend wants to get Starbucks and go to this crepe place called sweet Paris because they have a 2 for $20 deal today. I guess it'll be okay since that'll be the only thing I eat today, but I worry I'll get home and have to eat with my sister, and I know my niece and nephews will give me candy. So even if I make it till this afternoon I'm still gonna have to stop myself from eating too much but also eat enough to not weird out my friend or my family. I could easily eat nothing after that moment this morning but since I have to eat with my friend it'll just awaken the beast.",False,False

Well I just broke up with my boyfriend on Saturday, it was the right thing to do, but still has left me feeling lonely. Also my mother ruined Valentine’s Day for me when I was young, by telling me that no one would ever buy me anything pretty because I didn’t deserve it. So I can’t let that get the best of me today",False,True

I always get jealous when I see the multitude of posts her asking how to deal with relationships and meanwhile I'm over here too fat for online dating. I just want to date someone who doesnt have smelly feet, has a job, is about my age, into me, and is fun. Turns out that's too much to ask for. ",False,False
