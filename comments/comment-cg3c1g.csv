I am definitely the chief foodie in my relationship, but I have also definitely rubbed off on my SO over the years and he’s a hardcore lover of good food now too. Something we do every weekend is I choose a couple of restaurants that I think he’ll like and we go on a mystery adventure where we walk out to wherever the location is and I surprise him with where he’s eating that day. He picks a bunch of stuff from the menu and I read to him while he eats. We do this at least twice every weekend, maybe you could adapt something similar to your situation.",False,False

But, If you find a compassionate and understanding partner they will support your needs.  Good example: my sister is married to a foodie. She has SO many food allergies, she literally cannot eat out. She tags along with him, orders a glass of wine and MAYBE a veggie salad or plain grilled chicken (if the kitchen confirms they can accommodate her without risk of cross-contamination). He doesn’t care, he still gets to eat and spend time with her!  I’d say dating while dealing with an ED (or any mental illness) is just overall difficult because it takes a patient and understanding person to be supportive through it. But they do exist :)",False,False
