I’ve been maintaining within 5 lbs of my LW for a few years, and when I’m at the bottom of that range, my husband has suggested that I not lose more weight because he doesn’t want it to affect my ability to get hired (I work in a looks-based industry). I have body dysmorphia and can’t really trust my own self-perception, and I can’t really trust most other people, but I do trust my husband. I love women, but the ones I’ve worked with are hyper-competitive and I’ve only had hetero women make negative comments about my appearance, and since my ED is deeply tied to BDD (I like to skirt the line between sick and sexy, and I do care about being attractive), I tend to dismiss the opinions of people who aren’t attracted to women.",False,False

Like anything under a slightly-higher-than-average weight for me will always be “scarily thin” according to my parents, bc they care about me a lot and any weight loss triggers the fears of what happened before. It also has to do a lot with your behavior/general appearance (hair thinning, pale/shallow skin, dark eyes) and a family member is able to notice and witness this transformation whereas you’re too close to yourself to notice it and strangers don’t have any other point of reference",False,False
