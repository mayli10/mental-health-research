My aim is to complete it, along with the suggested food diary and charts then take it to a therapist that specialises in ED's. I'll have actual evidence in diary form that way and my own thoughts on each aspect of my ED.   Take a look. I answer the questions in a notebook instead of on the sheets because then I can read them on my phone or computer and answer on paper. I have them all printed out too but I find the sheets too big and awkward to write on and not enough space.   I hope this helps at least one of you. """,False,False
