With all my free time I would walk (way to weak to run) around the track by my house for maybe 2 hours 4 days a week then walk home (20 min). Then try to do a hike once a week.   My excuse was that I loved to be outside and tan. Oh and if I do a ‚Äúlight‚Äù exercise I am more comfortable consuming a larger amount of calories for dinner. Said dinner would still be a can of progresso light soup and maybe a cucumber tomato salad.   The obsession with walking turn into me walking to the grocery store, to the tobacco shop for vape pods, literally anywhere a normal person would drive to. But now it‚Äôs freezing and I wanna join the gym at the local rec center since it‚Äôs $50 for the whole year. I‚Äôd only be using the cardio stuff so a regular gym wouldn‚Äôt be worth it.  It‚Äôs an addiction.",False,False

I still lose weight. How can I have an ED if I'm eating that much daily?! Ha! I must just be super healthy! Right!,False,False

I wake up early to exercise. I  exercise literally every chance I'm not with kid/partner/doing housework stuffs. Being able to jump on my bike or treadmill for 10 minutes here or there really adds up. I put off doing fun things because of this ridiculous addiction.  The guilt I feel not making my daily step goal is HORRIBLE. I KNOW logically I'm not going to gain weight not exercising because the whole common sense calories in vs. out thing.. You don't even NEED to exercise to lose weight if you're eating healthily..  I have an addictive personality. If I were at my old job I'd have about 3k steps at the end of the day because my specialty is surgery which means spending most of my day standing in one spot assisting the doctor.  But this fucking fitbit and mental illness won't let me rest.  I'm underweight and fucking exhausted. I can feel this killing me but I can't stop.  The only comments I get from people anymore are 'you look tired"" fucking right I do, because I literally am. I know how stupid this is but I keep on doing it..  Edit: I started exercising because I thought I could stop starving myself and eat normal healthy nourishing foods. I starved myself into amenorrhea and thought, shit, eat healthy + exercise and be healthy and normal and wow no more ED.  Ahbababhahahahhahahhaahaha",False,False

I'm up to 40k+ daily, some days 50k.  It's an awful awful awful fucking thing to be addicted to and at these levels I'm constantly starving.

However, is this just you trying to hit a healthy step amount per day? I just ask (and am in no way trying to invalidate you) because I do something similar.

If you are finding that trying to get your 10k steps every day and it‚Äôs causing you undue stress and anxiety, or if you are interrupting your every day life (like sleeping or eating) to complete the 10k then maybe you can reflect on why that is and work on behavior change.",False,False
