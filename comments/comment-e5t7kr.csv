You deserve to look forward to Thanksgiving dinner with your family and eating your moms famous rolls. You deserve to feel warm and sleepy after a meal. You deserve to have a brain that functions at 100% and a body that is strong and carries you on the best adventures you can imagine. You deserve to eat cinnamon sugar tortillas like you did when you were a little kid and cake and ice cream on your birthday.   You deserve to not have to wonder why you should recover because you deserve to understand that you are enough and you never deserve to suffer.,False,False
