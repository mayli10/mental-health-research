An electrolyte inbalance is usually also the reason for heart failure with bulimics. Not trying to scare you but at the same time I kinda do, there are good moments in life and it would be a shame for your life to end too soon. I quit purging two months ago  because I love my dog and want to be there for her for all of her life. It is difficult but I try to make the conscience decision every time I think about b/ping to choose life, and it actually makes me feel more in control.

It was the fear of cancer that broke my cigarette addiction. Heart attacks are the reason I won’t let myself purge even though I think about it every time I eat (I already have a minor heart issue). I’m still obviously fucked, but I feel like it would be worse if I wasn’t so damn scared of everything. Some people don’t understand the actual consequences of any given action and I think it’s good OPs therapist is taking the extra step to make their patients aware of the facts regardless of if it helps or not. The chance of it helping is worth the risk. ",False,False

We can't really judge OP's therapist based on the information in the post, and they may well have had a decent reason for trying to get through to OP in that way, even though it didn't have the desired effect. Since EDs are notoriously hard to treat and virtually no one outside the super rich has access to truly comprehensive treatment, it can really be incredibly difficult for therapists to keep finding new approaches and techniques to address deep-rooted (and essentially, as you say, illogical--indeed, biological) issues.   However, I completely, *completely* agree with you that it's so regrettable that it has made OP feel worse, and they 100% do not deserve to feel any guilt over not being able to discontinue the behaviour at this time.   Love to OP &lt;3",False,False

EDs at the base aren’t logical so showing you that probably doesn’t help much other than fear and guilt. Which then fuel your ED even more. I’m really sorry OP but don’t feel guilty about yourself.
