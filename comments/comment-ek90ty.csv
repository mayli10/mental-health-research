Have you tried slacks or wideleg trousers? Also, you could see if you can find a midi loose skirt and wear it with some looser sweater. You could try looking at modesty styles for some inspo thats a little less form-fitting.  Also, perhaps if your dress is too V necked, you could try safety pinning the inside and see if it looks not too weird? Ive done this with a lot of tops that I wanted to wear to something I shouldnt have been showing too much skin",False,False

Maybe you could get a camisole just in case it dips too low?  (Edit: another idea I just got was a pantsuit? A lot of those are pretty flowy and the legs usually aren’t tight as well + they usually don’t cut too low as well!),False,False
