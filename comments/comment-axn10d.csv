You obsessed over food every minute you say, now imagine that but with other things, studying/work then your brain stops taking into consideration other activities.

As a kid she never wanted to eat, even snacks or treats and just always acted like having to get up or come inside for lunch or dinner was a hassle. Now as an adult shes one of those people who just consumes soylent and those nutrient calorie dense shakes. Its bizarre. Im convinced she has no tastebuds or something wrong with how her stomach tells her brain shes hungry. Ive definitely met people who dont care about food as much as normal people.

But sometimes I get too interested/hyper focus (thanks ADHD) and don’t realize that I’m hungry until my blood sugar drops and I’m sweating/shaking.
