I feel weird when it takes me a thousands years to order and i make it crazy complicated. so anyways, for instance, you could do a side salad, add grilled chicken breast, dressing on the side, and a side order of brown rice and roasted vegetables. sorry i just made up a random example, i hope nothing was triggering. have fun!",False,False
