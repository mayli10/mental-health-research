I'm not sure if you've been eating breakfast but having a day where you just started with coffee and then decided to have a liquid meal replacement was kind of ""playing with fire"" which is likely whey you decided you were into the idea of restricting.   I've never tried to recover or had a treatment plan but I think you could try to start meal prepping or writing a weekly meal plan that includes enough calories each day ",False,False

It was only a reply to your question if you should eat. Counting calories or macros would make the deciding easier.  When in doubt i try to eat something high in protein. If i am not hungry enough for that than i am not hungry enough for anything else, is my Motto. If you know you didnt eat enough you always could eat something small in protein, that should not start a binge and is helpful for your health.   If you dont eat at all maybe take a multivitamin before going to bed and drink enough water!   Good luck",False,False

It gets too obsessive and even more restrictive than without counting calories. I prefer eating intuitively, and if today that meant not eating- so be it. I could use losing a couple lbs.",False,True

It doesn’t matter if I want it, I need it. I even keep my gain foods in the medicine cupboard rather than the food cupboard!  I have a teenage daughter too so I also remind myself what sort of role model I want to be, that can be a big driver for me when I know I haven’t eaten enough.  Finally, take baby steps. If you feel overwhelmed by something divide it into smaller parts and take each part every 15 minutes.   Good luck you can do it x",False,False
