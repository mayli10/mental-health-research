Especially with tall characters; shorter characters are easier to do accurately.  I feel like an easy way to avoid this would be to just describe their body types. Yeah, that's subjective, but I'm super obsessive over weight and I've never once thought ""okay, but what is this character's EXACT weight?"" Like, surely it doesn't add that much to the experience, especially to an average reader who isn't thinking about numbers constantly.",False,False

Most of us? Pull a number from our ass. Usually a number we hear a lot and then slap a height on it. Not many writers plug the numbers into a calculator to see what the BMI is.   It is not worth getting worried about because most of us are again pulling it out of our asses.",False,False
