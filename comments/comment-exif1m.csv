Unless you work out like a lot a lot it‚Äôs probably not muscle mass either. The most likely solution is that you live in a country with a high obesity rate, and most people have a skewed perception of what a  healthy weight is. That, or you have an abnormally large frame",False,False

That‚Äôs why little kids can have a BMI of 14 and be totally healthy.   There is an alternative BMI calculator for very tall or short people that I use because the standard one is shit if you‚Äôre not 5‚Äô7",False,False

Fucking sucks. And anyway, BMI is a ridiculously awful indicator of health. The criteria for anorexia no longer states specific percentages or numbers to be met in order to be diagnosed, largely for this reason.",False,False
