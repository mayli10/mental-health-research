People with EDs die suddenly from cardiac arrest A LOT due to low potassium. Go to the doctor!!! Ask them to draw a metabolic panel and check your electrolytes (chloride and sodium may be low as well).  Long time ED victim/Nurse right here so I know what I’m talking about 🤷🏼‍♀️ lol,False,False

Likely it’ll be a case of “eat more, your body is dying”; but it could be anything and when it comes to your heart, it’s better to be safe or dead.",False,False
