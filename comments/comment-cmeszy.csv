I've been experiencing it for a long time and never had any problems from it besides the discomfort so personally its not a cause for concern for me.,False,False

I've been trying to drink lightly salted water to help on my sodium intake, but it wouldn't hurt to take a vitamin C tablet and get some rest.

It doesn't hurt or anything but feels, phlegmy. Which is why I thought I might be sick. As for the size, it's hard to say but it's relatively small because it doesn't cause me issue to swallow or talk or anything like that.
