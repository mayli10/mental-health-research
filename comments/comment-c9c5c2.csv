I was diagnosed with type 1 a year and a half ago and at that same time my ed kicked off. I used to restrict and binge/purge while still giving myself insulin, then restrict and still give insulin, but now I’m at the point where I can’t bring myself to give me any insulin. It’s bad and I feel really terrible all the time.  I want to try and move towards recover but tbh I’m scared, I don’t want to gain, but I also don’t want to lose bodily function of anything, and I really don’t know what to do.   If you don’t mind if I ask (you don’t have to answer if you aren’t comfortable), what brought you to recover? How did you go about begging to work towards recovery?",False,False

Over half of all women with Type 1 have reported that they restrict insulin for weight maintenance purposes... I don’t know what the number is for all T1 diabetics (men and women) but it’s impossible to get a correct estimate, since there is only one large scale study that I know of for sure.  It’s extremely difficult to overcome bc we are required to have acute knowledge of what we are consuming. Our days and function revolve around numbers and food. So absolutely, it’s not at all surprising so many of us struggle with this.   There are so many more resources and much more knowledge about the coexistence of diabetes and eating disorders than there was when I was in treatment beginning over a decade ago... There are even specialized treatment facilities and programs that focus on diabulimia now.  What I’ve found to be the most difficult part apart from overcoming that intense fear of weight gain is remembering to test.  Anyway, I believe in you and have faith you can overcome this because it seems like you have a desire to get better and that motivation is an absolute necessity. Food isn’t like cocaine or gambling where you can just stay away, especially when you have additional aspects of it to manage besides mindfulness and consumption. Please feel free to send me a message if you would like to discuss anything at any time! Best of luck to you.",False,True

Tbh, my ed was really triggered by my diagnosis with type 1, so it’s not too surprising that I eventually started exhibiting diabulimic tendencies.   Idk it’s just really nice to know that someone has been through what I’m going through. And that they came out the other side and that they’re doing better. I know how much this disease can mess with your perception of food and it’s just nice to know that someone might actually be doing okay. I’m really happy that you’ve found recovery, and I hope that I’ll be ready to work towards it too eventually. Thank you for sharing, and congratulations on your many years of recovery (and I hope you have many many more)!",False,False
