I calculated that the one plant-based powder I saw in stores was 6 times as expensive as whey powder. You would be better off just eating beans, peas, and nuts. They'll be less expensive and they have calories whether you eat the whole food or the powder, so it doesn't really matter. If you want to be certain you're getting enough protein you can always look up the protein content of foods.",False,False

It tastes awful and isn't satiating. I'd rather eat real food that actually tastes good. I will tell you that, as a national level power lifter, I have never drank a full protein shake because it's just not worth it to me.  My favorite source of complete protein that is plant based is nutritional yeast. It goes so well on so many things and doesn't taste like trash",False,False
