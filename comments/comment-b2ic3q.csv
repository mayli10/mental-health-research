The caffeine is absorbed so quickly that it never makes it to your intestines anyway. And laxatives can f*** up your electrolytes, which would put you in even greater danger of cardiac issues.   Similarly, although charcoal can technically absorb caffeine, it would have to be taken with or immediately after the caffeine to be effective (again because caffeine is absorbed into the bloodstream very quickly after consumption).   Your best bet is to avoid any new sources of caffeine and drink a lot of water to avoid dehydration. If you feel like you are having heart palpitations, dehydration, panic attacks, or other symptoms, you should probably see a doctor.",False,False

If you start feeling really bad. Ie vomiting, dizziness, heart issues please consider going to a hospital. At least one of the treatments for caffe over dose is laxatives? Or zero cal charcoal.
