Actually I was discussing flowers with an ED friend, and he personally was against flowers because he believes it codes more feminine, where EDs are generally stereotyped to underestimate male prevalence.

I think a good icon that represents the purpose of this sub would be a watering can watering a slightly-wilting flower, maybe again, a periwinkle.
