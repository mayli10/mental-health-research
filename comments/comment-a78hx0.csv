Im leaving to go back to my apartment in a day or two and should be able to eat foods I'm more comfortable keeping down there.   ‚ù§thank you so much for the advice though.

Your stomach is icky feeling as you're putting the lining in a lot of stress.    We understand and no judgement but I hope you can go sometime without binging and purging.   Just some broth to heal and maybe some portioned out safe foods. The more you purge the hungrier you'll get and the more it'll take toll on your body.  Pumpkin soup and some low cal toast is an easy one. If toast is a fear food skip it but try go for maybe a small potato or something simple yet not sugar filled. Maybe a small bit of cheese / low cal meat (pastrami is really low cal)    Veges and watery fruit is good to but go easy as the fibre / sugar in the fruit can be hard on an uneasy stomach. Take it easy xxxx,False,False
