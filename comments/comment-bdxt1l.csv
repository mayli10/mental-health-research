It's a super small amount (*1/8th teaspoon*), but it's like 20% of my daily sodium intake. Technically the recipe where I would use table salt said I should use 1/4 teaspoon, but I don't care much for the taste of salt and this recipe probably wasn't made with the intention of people eating it every single day, so I'm sure reducing that half the extra salt will be fine. Getting the perfect amount every day would at least be better than getting more than I need every day. Plus, if I do add the potassium citrate to the smoothie that will make it taste saltier anyway, so it will probably balance out.",False,False

They're to omega fats and they're important to your health. Great sources are tree nuts like walnuts, cashews, and almonds. You should also focus on getting enough potassium because that's also great for muscle and brain health. Only about 5% of the population actually gets enough potassium in their diet, so it might be a good idea to use potassium supplements. I know that in the US the FDA puts a very low limit on how much potassium can be in a single pill because some people have problems that make it so they can't process potassium properly and need way less than an average healthy person, so I would instead recommend a powder like potassium citrate powder. It tastes bad, but if you use it right you can cover up the taste pretty well.",False,False

A handful of nuts instead of (or alongside) something like grapes or an apple is not that many extra calories (maybe about 160) but that energy is released steadily for a longer period of time. Almonds are my go to but cashews are also great as are brazil nuts.,False,False
