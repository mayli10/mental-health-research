My mum is only 5’5” and my dad is 5’2” so as much as I’d like to blame my eating disorder I’m pretty sure it’s just my genetics.,False,False

Sometimes I wonder if I should try eating ""normally"" and see if I'll actually grow, but sometimes I doubt that how I eat has stunted my growth, and I think that it's better to be ""safe"" and just carry on as I always have. My parents aren't that tall either, I'm taller than my mum so sometimes I think it's just my genes that make me short, meaning eating has nothing to do with my growth. And in conclusion, I never really come to a conclusion. Wishing the best for you &lt;3",False,False
