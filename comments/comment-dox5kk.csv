Really well written and I’m a fan of how fuckin crazy nuts she got. Deals with bulimia and anorexia.   Unbearable lightness by Portia de Rossi is also pretty good, deals with bulimia and anorexia as well. Though not as intensely as wasted.   I liked identical and perfect but Ellen Hopkins, but tbh the ED part isn’t like super crazy focused on like I’d prefer. But I’ve always liked Ellen Hopkins, so it’s worth it. They deal with both bulimia and anorexia as well, I think. It’s been a while so I don’t fully remember.   Right now I’m starting how to disappear completely by Kelsey Osgood and what I lost by Alexandra Ballard. So far they’re alright. Both are anorexia focused.   There’s a few others i might pick up later along the line, but eh. We’ll see. It’s surprisingly hard to find books about EDs that are actually well written and accurate. I personally don’t trust any male authors unless it’s about a male main character.   ED teen novels is my guilty pleasure because I have to feed the angsty, edgy teen inside me",False,False
