It's an estimated equation of relative oxygen consumption. The only truly accurate calorimetry is oxygen measurement or heat generation measurement, both of which are complex.   But the MET equation works as an estimate for a given activity.   1 MET = 3.5 mL/ O2 per kg of body weight per minute.   Each activity has a standardized assigned MET value. Just for example, stationary biking at moderate to high intensity is 6.8 MET.   So you multiple 3.5 x your weight in kg x duration x MET assignment. Divide by 1000 to get your oxygen consumption into liters and multiply by 5 because 5 kcals are burned per L of oxygen consumed.   I weigh 54.5 kg so for me biking 50 minutes at a MET of 6.8:   3.5 x 54.5 x 6.8 x 60 = 77891 mL/O2 divided by 1000 = 77.89 L/O2 x 5kcals = 389 kcals for an hour which is about reasonable   You can find the MET value for different activities here:   https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;source=web&amp;rct=j&amp;url=http://prevention.sph.sc.edu/tools/docs/documents_compendium.pdf&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjA3sWu1s7gAhXmrlQKHQ8GADMQFjAEegQIARAB&amp;usg=AOvVaw0u3VG5m8n5jYHQQx1xse6l&amp;cshid=1550815686355 ",False,False
