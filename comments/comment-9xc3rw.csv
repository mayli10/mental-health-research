Whoever is doing this wants us to be isolated and feel rejected.  That‚Äôs why they gave no explanation of the ban. They knew that many of us would think we were banned from the sub by mods and blame ourselves. It‚Äôs all a big mind fuck to cause anxiety and chaos in a vulnerable community.",False,False
