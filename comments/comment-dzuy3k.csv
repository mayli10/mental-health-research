I think it's because I've been obese, so I'm already used to being the fattest one in the room.  People thinner than me have no effect on my self-perception.",False,False

You know? Like if I had to pick an ideal body aesthetic it would be lean, like muscular and toned just not shredded or beefy, but not skinny.  *But* I also want the number on the scale to be ridiculously low, at the very least low enough that I could binge and binge for months and still not get fat, but ideally as low as I can possibly get it, certainly low enough that I'm embarrassed to say it out loud and everyone around me is really concerned about it. And even if people don't know the number I still want them to be able to look at me and know that I'm suffering by being like this. And I want them to look at me and worry that I'm sick, not just mentally sick but physically sick as well, and I want them to look at me and thing that I look fragile and weak.  I don't want to look skinny, but I want to be recognized as tortured and wasting, and that requires me to be skinny. And also I am *obsessed* with the number aspect. I *need* the lowest number, aesthetics be damned.",False,False

I never felt ugly but if I put on weight I freak out cause I feel out of control, plus also anxiety when I feel too full or from eating greasy foods, it just makes me feel filthy and fasting makes me feel clean, losing weight makes me feel cleaner. Why yes, I HAVE been diagnosed as ocd, but do I do anything with that knowledge? Nope.",False,False

I *really* don't want to be sickly skinny, but I'm acting like it nonetheless",False,False
