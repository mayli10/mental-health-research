It all got worse when i lost all my friends bc one of them was rly petty and a bitch overall and she pitted everybody against me. These was my first real friendsgroup which helped me cope with the stress of being a highschool student. I developed depression and panic attacks and ended up overexercising to a point where my spine was bruised. I have been in this hell for almost three years now.",False,False

The first time I started restricting was when I was 14, because of school stress, depression and unstable friendships. The second time, when I was 20, was after a suicide attempt that landed me in an inpatient program for depression. Restricting was a way to stay in control when everything was out of control. It also gave my life meaning again, in a sick way. Now I’m just stressed and anxious. I have no idea if I’ll be able to write my bachelor thesis, or if I’ll ever get a job, or if I even chose the right education. I just want to disappear",False,False

Like, I used to binge a shit ton as a child. It was my only form of comfort and entertainment with a father always working and an alcoholic mother, plus we were always struggling financially. In highschool I just lost my appetite as I grew, so I lost a bunch of weight without trying.   Now, rolls around junior year, I get with a 23year old because I didn’t realize how wrong the age difference was. I thought he was fine, he made me feel special for being “so mature for my age”. He obsessed over weight. Constantly talked about how fat other women were, always made sure to tell me how cute and tiny I was. If I ate in front of him he would mention how much, how fast, etc. He fetishized my weight. He was so fucking emotionally abusive and manipulative, I constantly had to walk on eggshells around him. After we broke up, I guess he was following me around. A mutual friend told me he laughed because “oh she’s getting fat now that we broke up”  So that’s where the obsession with my weight actually started. The man who ruined my life and made me fearful of commitment, relationships, and wary of positive interaction bc there was always a sinister intent behind it, laughed at me because I gained weight. And now I’m hellbent on making sure no one can ever use my appearance as an insult again.",False,False

I was put into treatment for severe self harm, and I completed treatment after about 4 months (4 long months of being in a small ward with 19 other girls... most of them were violent too, including myself. Shit was crazy lol). I learned a bunch of helpful skills, but I really only knew how to apply them to cutting urges. So when I started binging and I gained quite a bit, I turned to restriction when the reality that I was over 300lb hit me hard. My disorder made me think that restricting wasn’t just a different form of self harm, but rather just a quick way to lose weight. Of course, I totally used it to self harm, and now that I realize that, I won’t deny it. Now I’m addicted to starving and it’s fucking terrible, and I’m trying to recover as best as I can :(",False,False

I hated being (in my mind) not as small as him because it meant I wasn’t beautiful. Or he wouldn’t want me. Or I wasn’t good enough. The list goes on but I was so insecure about it and felt soooo relieved when he could eat again. He didn’t know it, but the next wrestling season I cut weight with him.
