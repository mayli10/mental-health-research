I can keep our meals the same size by giving me half a plate of salad and him half a plate of carbs (but the same protein, veg, flavourful things) - it works superbly, although me not liking carbs obviously helps. I also give me alternative carbs - sandwich thin in place of burger buns, Konjac noodles in place of vermicelli, and chickpea pasta in place of wheat pasta. Given I don't really like salad, I've found it easier to just split meals in 3 and for him to have twice as much.     It helps that I love cooking and he doesn't, though. I get 100% free reign in the kitchen (and he cleans up afterwards).",False,False

High restricting (even at 1200) will yield better results in the long run and give you more wiggle room in the evening. You will certainly still lose at 1200. ,False,False

Thank you :)  Ohhh, I thought of one other thing that really helped me. I'm going to sound like the fasting sub, but supplementing my electrolytes made a HUGE difference in reducing that panicky ""I NEED to eat"" feeling.   It doesn't work instantly, so if I'm already binging it's too late. But if I make an effort throughout the day, my body doesn't try to mutiny in the kitchen.  I take a thermotab (salt supplement) and 90mg potassium supplement at lunch. I am not an electrolyte expert, and I know you can get yourself in trouble with them, though.",False,False

I snack on ingredients while I make the dinner, so there's more calories. Then, even though I've logged 300g of potato I don't actually measure and just eye ball it.

Then after dinner, I make my version of hot cocoa: * 1.5 tbsp cocoa powder * 2/3 mug of water  * 1/3 mug of milk of choice * optional sweet dessert tea bag  It's not super low cal, but since I do OMAD I dont fret about it, and it somehow stops me from binging on girl scout cookies.

Part of the issue is because I'm married, we have dinner together in the evenings. If it was just me I'd be happy to just have really low cal stuff or even skip dinners.

Well, I plan out 8-900 and then always end up at a maintenance amount from all the little extras I add in cos I can't control myself. I'm aiming for 1000  today though and I'm trying to split it out a bit more throughout the day so I don't gorge myself later.

To combat eating a gigantic meal/s I plan to have a series of snacks during the evening.   I have to resign myself to the fact that I am going to want to eat quite a bit in the evenings, but planning ahead and portioning it out over numerous snacks instead of one gigantic meal (followed by huge portions of snacks) definitely feels better and results in a lower calorie intake. The huge meals just results from me needing food, and the uninhibited snacking results from me planning to restrict all day but then feeling really hungry at night and just desperately eating. If I have snacks planned I can feel more comfortable eating and don't find myself going as crazy because I have already decided I am going to eat them (instead of guiltily stuffing my face with whatever I have).   If you're at 8-900 a day now you could go up a bit to 1100 and still maintain a loss. Some evening meals I like to portion out across the night to indulge my need to eat are:  * 1 warm meal - a pressed wrap, a piece of fish, some soup, etc. nothing high cal but warm and comforting, i find this is important to feeling satisfied in the evening * cucumbers and dip * a smoothie * hard boiled egg/s * vegetable crisps",False,False

Higher restriction is more sustainable, and in the long run, far more effective. A few other thoughts:    * I find a half hour walk is a great way to break up the evening, stop eating, and have some quality time with music or spouse. For me, it's not so much the evening that's a problem, it's just the 30-60 minutes after dinner. Buying yourself some time with a walk, drive, or shower can really help.   * If I go over my TDEE, I make sure I eat my TDEE the next day (no deficit). This avoids harmful binge restrict cycles, and makes overeating more annoying (two days of no deficit rather than one).    * I try to find foods I absolutely love, and can handle in small portions. If a hummus sandwich and a protein bar are my two favourite foods in the whole universe, I'll have them food dinner and I'm satisfied and very happy, and unlikely keep snacking on some other random food. Only works for safe foods (def not binge triggers), and with enough of a calorie budget to have a genuinely delicious dinner. ",False,False
