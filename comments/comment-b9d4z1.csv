Please get good walking shoes ASAP. I'm currently using Merrell glove trail runners (not the toe kind...) and I love them but sometimes I wonder if my knees would have appreciated shoes with more padding. I walk 20-30k steps every day by having eliminated my car. It started out as necessary when I couldn't afford car repairs but I've become addicted to the 3,000+ calories burned every day so I'm working on selling my car. ",False,False

It's a tip someone gave me when I was on an extended hiking trip (2 months), and I'd gotten blisters right at the start.  Cornstarching my socks for the rest of the trip totally preserved my feet and made everything way more comfortable.  Also, avoid cotton socks in favour of wool or polyester.",False,False

Infection is apparently a huge risk at bootcamp but they can't just stop walking/marching so he says they use something called Moleskin. It protects the blisters while you keep walking on haha. I'm picking some up today.,False,True

It’s been MONTHSSS since I’ve had my feet with no blisters. They’re all peely and gross. I hate feet anyways so I don’t really mind but still I think I’d prefer to not have in pain feet (you get used to the pain after a while tbf)  Please pick up some good walking shoes!! I haven’t found any yet cause I’m poor but I heard they help tremendously!,False,False

I found a cheap pair of adidas trainers in TJ Maxx which are basically entirely made of mesh and they are the most comfortable shoes I’ve ever owned. I’ve walked hundreds of miles in them, from shopping to hiking. Currently doing about 8 miles a day and worried they’re going to die soon!   They’re called ZX Flux but I just googled them and I think I’ve got an old version - the current ones seem thicker/more structured. But mesh shoes: highly recommended! ",False,False

Last summer, my feet were so ragged and blistered, people were commenting on them. I walked an average of 10k per day. I had to wear a different pair of shoes every day just to try to get the blisters to form in different *places* on my feet. The poor backs of my heels...   That was the only saving grace of this winter, was that I could wear thick socks and my feet healed a bit. I’m excited to walk everywhere again but super not excited for the pain and blisters to come back. I am here for you bb. ",False,False
