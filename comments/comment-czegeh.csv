Like no Karen this was not a fucking choice. This isn't me wanting to be skinny and refusing to eat. This is me being psychologically unable to make myself eat. And it's miserable.,False,False

I fully understand that it sucks and why and i don't wish it upon anyone, but i want it. I want the control and the ability to do it and have that gratification and i also want people to see that i'm not ok (but i can't tell anyone because ???,, illogical brain doing things) which currently nobody understands or seems to notice. I just wish i could have the power to do it, i'm miserable anyway, with or without it.  Why anyone without a fucked up, depressed psyche would want AN i don't understand either, though. I'm absolutely not pro and i wish everyone who has it that they can recover completely. But i want it, i want discipline and control so bad, even though i rationally know it won't solve anything.",False,False

Like I know it's been romanticized but like...I just lay around with dull skin, shedding hair and crying.  I wish there was an accurate ED doc where it's not the ""UW need IP"" types but just like...my NW ass sitting around for 4 hours focused on the snack I'm allowing myself to eat and obsessively telling myself whether or not I can have the snack.",False,False
