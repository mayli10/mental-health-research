Anorexia isn't about the numbers. Anyone who is anorexic has been a normal weight with distorted thought processes. I am 'recovered' in terms of numbers but because I still struggle - especially if I'm stressed about work/life/anything.   &amp;#x200B;  Don't confuse bloat for actual weight.

Just stick to your healthy meals.  &amp;#x200B;  Stay strong! X",False,False
