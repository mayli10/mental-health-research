They dehydrate your body, so you really need to be pushing your hydration intake to help combat this. Also if you have a sore throat look into Flonase or a saline rinse to help relieve the post nasal drip. The decongestants actually curb your appetite, because they are stimulants, so the pseudophedrine in them suppresses your appetite. Ibuprofen is good to take and will help with nasal inflammation. I would also advise some allergy medicine to help drainage and allow your body to process the mucus in your system faster.  Drink some ginger/green tea to help with detox your system and it will also help with the water retention. Hope you feel better soon! :)",False,False

So if seeing the scale fluctuate is going to be upsetting, your best bet is probably to put the scale away for a few days. I hope you feel better soon! Hydration is your friend.",False,False
