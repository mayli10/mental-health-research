I'm feeling that way right now, because I ate some old nachos last night. I only ate them hoping they would make me sick, though, so I guess I can be proud of that. But just like what I think u/CloudySideDown said, I'm waiting it out and trying not to engage. When you start to engage your disordered thoughts with whatever rationalization you come up with in the moment, they only get worse and worse and harder to deal with. In the moment, it's all peaches and cream and feeling like a feather, but then you start to realize how doing this will effect your future, and wish you never started to begin with. So, listen to yourself, don't start again. You'll find something else disordered to latch onto in the future that doesn't make you starve yourself. Or, ideally, you'll find a healthy coping mechanism this time. Mine lately has been these quarry hikes with my boyfriend, we go out there looking for precious stones, and it's good exercise to feed that disordered side of my brain, but I also don't feel like I have to starve myself because I'm doing something I love with someone I love. I'd say that's healthy? Find a thing. It seems like a stupid waste of time from the perspective of a depressed mind, but we both know a healthy coping mechanism won't strip away your identity, it'll only make it more prominent.",False,False

Try urge surfing where you see the feeling come and rise up in you then slowly dissipate. All urges for everything come and go. That or you could distract yourself with an activity or self soothe using things like drinking a hot tea or taking a shower. Possible listen to soft music or anything else you can think of that is comforting and relaxing,False,False
