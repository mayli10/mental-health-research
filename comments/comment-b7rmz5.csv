I’ve gained a lot of weight, lost a lot of weight, gained again - repeated that for a few years and now I’m losing. Guess what random stranger? The disordered and horrible thoughts never went away. Shocker.",False,False

What bugs me most is when people call out your eating behavior out of nowhere even though they know how much you struggle with food. For example if you’re restricting someone has to comment on it by saying ""I don’t get it, just eat more. Why would you eat so little? Are you honestly full?"" On the other hand if you eat more than usually they say things like ""I’m so proud of you for finishing your meal"" or ""you’re not on a diet anymore are you?"" or the worst thing one could say: "" you seem particularly hungry today don’t you?"" Just STOP commenting on other people’s eating habits if you have no idea what you’re talking about and what someone’s going through...   I hope you’re doing well though and I wish you all the best &lt;3",False,False

Some people need to keep their well-intentioned unhelpful comments to themselves.   Sure, I don’t have my shit together but you don’t know what I’m dealing with, you have no idea what all I’ve tried, please step back and shut the fuck up. I’m not looking for advice!",False,False

I had to teach myself to enjoy food and not just in private. That is one of many ways people with anorexia can get better. If somebody had come to attack me over that because they knew about my eating disorder and didn't like my behaviour I probably never would have gotten better. It would have made me feel ashamed of eating and pushed me further into restriction. It's absolutely disgusting that anybody feels they're in the right to behave like that. Shame isn't a motivator. It just teaches you to hide who you are.,False,False

And I really should have said people without eating disorders in general -- because I definitely think a lot of the behavior has the same root causes and is tied together.  I hope you're doing well. &lt;3,False,True

Funny how the person who stalked her post history wants to be seen as some amazing white knight who’s saving the community from the evil, toxic anorexia sufferer. There was literally no point in telling people she was anorexic, the post was about elevating her food ffs. But nooooo posting her meals on cooking subreddits (which could be part of recovery) is wrong and obsessive, and she should leave the internet forever, because only nice, mentally healthy people can be on the internet and if you post about your problems in any way then you’re a toxic mess who needs to stay away from the normal people lest you infect them with your evil mind disease. It annoys me so much.",False,False

I'm not anorexic so I don't experience exactly what you have but I've definitely noticed similar comments about depression (which is the root of my food and body image issues woot woot). like people say ""happiness is a choice"" or ""get help instead of complaining about it on the internet."" like okay, I've also been in inpatient before and I've been seeing a therapist and on medication for 4 years, I think I've earned my right to complain about it on the internet. sending you strength &lt;3",False,False
