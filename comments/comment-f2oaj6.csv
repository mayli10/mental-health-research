Sometimes binge eating IS intuitive eating. Your body and mind are working together to restore. Feed your body a bounty of healthful foods. Your body is trying to recover itself after a period of heavy restriction - I wouldn't call this binge eating, I would say it's more like intuitive replenishment.  You're doing great!! Also ~ helps immensely to not use a scale and just focus on how you feel. Numbers can be extremely triggering.  Hugs to you!!",False,False
