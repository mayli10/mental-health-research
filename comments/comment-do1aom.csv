I was falling asleep in every class and during work outs, etc.   I was restricted from exercise and took an enormous amount of iron pills for six months. I was really constipated and it sucked because I was rowing on the crew team and couldn’t continue my sport.   Eventually my iron levels were back to normal and I felt a lot better.",False,False

You can ask them not to tell you your weight/hide the scale from you so you don't have to find out (not sure how common it is but in the UK they always ask if you want to know even for non-weight/ED related things).  As far as nutrients, are you taking anything like multivitamins or iron tablets? Obviously it's not a substitute for a balanced diet, but they can at least help to balance things a little for people like us. If it's something really serious though you should go to the doctor and get it checked out, and try and take care of yourself x",False,False
