No-one learns if they are left to continue their behavior. They don’t even need supporting comments- silence, even, is a reward for their negative behavior. “Shut up and listen to me for a moment” is not, to be honest, always something that needs to be respected. People earn respect. And if they’re going to be screaming toxicity in your ear and wanting you to say silent for it- that is not anything someone should respond with with sitting idly and shutting up.   And no. I will never say this is a healthy sub. ProED was not a healthy sub. A place where we focus so much on our disorder- and yes, some do recover, but have you noticed how many relapse if they stick around here? We guise ourselves as harm-reduction and support- but in reality, we are *encouraging the disordered mindset*. It’s similar to reading books on eating disorders- and not self-help ones. It’s triggering. And it is a *disorder*. There is never going to be something positive about it- the closest you will get is *recovery*. You cannot get rid of toxicity when this is something harmful and will likely kill one of us someday, and possibly already has. If you want to get rid of it, then you cannot practice it.   It is up to you what you can handle and what you cannot. We can go back and forth all day; but we are in agreement. The attitude is wrong. It should change, even if just a little bit. But again- it does not happen without a fight. It does not happen without a voice. And realize it is not your fight alone. There will be allies who will also learn to speak up. But they won’t exist if the problem is not vocalized. And again- this post is a *good start*, even with the shit response it received. Realize that I am on your side. I am showing you the obstacles, the need for a fight, the reality of it all. You brought up that you are both gay and an immigrant- this is the same. It is a battle for minorities to be heard and respected. And it is *not* fair. It *shouldn’t* require a fight. But it does.   I personally will discourage anyone from being here. Male, female, non-binary- it doesn’t matter. Perhaps I am only speaking for myself and those I know with a similar mindset- but when I am here, I do not want to be healthy. I want to dig myself so deep in anorexia that I lose everything. I want it to be all I think about, all I talk about, all I *am*. Regardless of the bullying- yes, to all of you, *bullying*- you are receiving here; your therapist is dead on with you probably needing to leave here, especially since she’s going to want you to be healthy. Nothing here will help you get better. It feeds the disorder. You cannot learn a normal life with eating if you are surrounded by the disorder.",False,False

And I am sorry if I come across as blaming, that is not my intention, and it is not my goal. Nor do I want to wrap myself in the ""victim"" blanket and take no criticism, so I will take that on.   And yes, my Struggles should not be prioritise over any other person's, I agree, I don't want that.    My point is, when a person's reaction to their struggle is to totalise and generalise negative stereotypes towards a whole group of people, that is a problem. I hate to say it *again* but if you seek validation by negatively stereotyping an entire group of people, we need to have a talk. I think we are in agreement there.   I think the issue is that there are those in this group who push back hard when confronted with this mentality. and that is fair - no one wants to be told they are being negative towards others, but I feel that there is a complete lack of empathy to try and see things from a different perspective. Whenever any person tells me ""Shut up and listen to me for a moment."" *I shut up and listen* because it is important for them, and it is important that I give them a reasonable shot. I empathise a lot with women here because their feelings are often my feelings, and I want to help them. But I can't help and emphathise when I am surrounded by people who say my gender is the reason they hate themselves, or the reason they starve, or how terrible they are because of *insert thing here*. It is hard to be empathetic to someone who, at least online, acts like they hate the group you belong to and you cannot control.   Your next paragraph is truly upsetting.   &gt;This is not a mentally healthy place to be at all. There is always going to be damage done to your mental health, here. Things are not going to be fair.

It’s prevalent here, it’s prevalent in treatment. Toxicity is the life blood of eating disorders.  What you describe here is the real world. The real world is not healthy, it is mentally damaging, and it is not fair, but even as you say further in your comment, we *need* to stand up against that. If Toxicity is the lifeblood of EDs, then lets starve the fucker and let it die.

The comments I have been getting are fairly terrible. A couple of PMs, comments that I, or my comments, are cancer. (Thanks everyone, we all want to be compared to cancer). This is what happens when a minority stands up and it sucks because I know that women, and many women here, face those same struggles to stand up and to be heard. I know and have seen what it is like to be that lone voice saying ""this isn't right"" and being shouted down because it is uncomfortable.

Because you will find that while yes... a majority of sexual assault cases are perpetrated by men. a Majority of men *do not perpetuate violence against women*   [A 2015 study estimates that only 25% of men have perpetrated a sexual assault on a woman by the last year of college.](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ab.21584)   So, yes! Most men commit assault crime that is reported, I am not disputing that *at all*. But a majority of men do not assault women. Those are two separate statements.   So when you go and say ""a majority of men do terrible things"" (by the way, explain what 'terrible' means because that is a subjective terms) it is *also* a falsehood because as statistics show, not a majority of men hurt women. It just means that a minority of men abuse and assault multiple women... which is abhorrent.   So I stand by my above statement.

My mother used to use her period as an excuse when you would abuse me. And by abuse I mean, emotional, mental, and physical abuse. It happened often. I would get bruises, I was be told she wished she aborted me, she said I was a piece of shit that will amount to nothing and I was 8, 19, 12 years old.  This was obviously a lie. My mother was abusive at all times. However she would tell me differently.  Now, I do *not* take that experience of my mother and equate it to all women (or all mothers). I dont say “women are the worst during their periods” because I know that’s not true.   I used this example because that’s what this sub does towards men often. Someone has a truly bad, and true, experience but then instead of saying “this person was terrible to me”They go “Men are shit”  That’s the connection. That’s the comparison. That’s the point I was making.  Yes, the subject *is* cancer, that’s the fucking point. You calling my comment cancer without even reflecting on the toxic cancerous shit that’s flung around here about other out groups is the problem.  Also, “Not all men” is the same as “not all black people” Christ, listen to yourself. You are using the exact language as racists and sexist. Check *your* privilege.  And I point out my privilege a lot, however (again) being a sexual abuse survivor myself and my perspective is equally as valid as yours, even if it makes you uncomfortable.   I have experienced sexual assault as an adult man. I have been groped unwantedly, I have had to push men off of me when “No” wasn’t respected. Being a gay man isn’t all sunshine and rainbows, and within our community we have massive arguments about this men can be just as abusive to other men as they are women.   And believe me... to give an example, a friend of mine died last year, his partner abused him, forced him to look a certain way, forced him into dangerous body modifications for his partners sick fetish and died as a result. I led the charge against this man, and now he’s facing a wrongful death suit because... surprise... the police doesn’t take man in man domestic abuse seriously.   Just being a male doesn’t mean I’m immune to the shit women get from other men. While I will never know how a woman feels like when she is attacked by a man. I know what it’s like to be sexually assaulted, raped, and the ramifications of that.   Also, I am not taking your space. ED is *not* a women’s only space. The fact that you cannot even recognise you are excluding men from this space with your actions isthe issue. Yes, women currently (sadly) make up the majority of people who live with this illness, it’s not exclusive to you, or your gender, stop gatekeeping.

But. We are not in a place where people are emotionally healthy. These are both aspects that you’re going to find much, much more often in emotionally healthy and aware people than those who are dealing with a handful of disorders and who knows what else.

We need to have conversations like this.  I am a sexual abuse survivor myself. While the numbers are vastly lower that we know of, men and boys are sexually abused as well. I was sexually abuse by a group of people, both men and women, over the course of about 8 months when I was 6-7 years old.    I want to state that clearly because despite being a man, I do have insight into being a victim of sexual assault and it’s ramifications... and I’m not simply talking out of my ass.  I will not counter or push back against your statistics because they are true. Women are sexual assaulted at huge numbers (and it’s devastating honestly) and many anxieties, traumas, PTSD and traumas can result from it, including EDs.  And I understand the mistrust, the toxicity, and the (for lack of a better word) hatred towards men by women who have been assaulted or abused.   I’ll say I have posted here but I hide my gender so that people respond. If I respond to gender related threads pushing back against toxic conversation, I’m pushed out.   I *wish* I could be more open about my struggles here, but it’s very hard because all that built-in tension. Am I seen as fake? I’m anorexic but overweight and a guy... but who believes me? Do people here I’m being a creepy guy because they think all men are creepy.  I find this group to be very supportive of women, but not for men... and to a point that’s fair, but there is no other place for us. There is a male eating disorder Sub, but it’s private and applying to get in goes nowhere.  I think where I differ from you is where you say this:  &gt; If I can be blunt, we’re not to blame for our negativity towards men. The ones at blame are the ones that are at fault for every single hateful comment in any community in existence- the ones who broke our trust in very intimate and very scarring ways. They are the ones that ruined things for you. Just as vocal homophobic Christians taint Christianity or preachy holier-than-thou vegans taint veganism.  While yes, you are not to blame for your negative feelings towards men, you *are* responsible for the the actions and words *you* say. If you propagate your negative bias towards men generally with your words and actions, then you are responsible for people pushing back on you.   As a guy, I know *never* to say things like, “Uugh women on their periods are the worst, am I right?” Because even if my experience of my mother beating and screaming at me and then blaming it on her period afterwards (repeatedly), does not allow me to say that because it’s ultimately not true. It may have been true of my mother (it wasn’t because she abused only while on her period, it was just a handy excuse)   I see you brought up sexual assault with men (I’m replying as I work through your comment)   In the end, I think we should be more aware that this is not a gender specific illness. While women are (unfortunately) the majority who suffer, we should assume that this is a women’s only space and that men here often share the same traumas as they do, and that language attacking a generalised “man” alienated us, your allies and compatriots, even more.",False,True

I’m going to start with getting the obvious and victim-shit out of the way, first. 1 in 6 women have experienced some form of sexual assault- and the overwhelming majority of the time, at the hands of a man. And in numerous studies, eating disorders have been very, very strongly linked to be caused due to this ([a source that references numerous studies and abstracts](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapediatrics/fullarticle/379204)). You are dealing with a lot of women who have had a *lot* of negative experiences with men, which does lead to continuing to land in toxic relationships with men. It’s a vicious cycle we all find ourselves in at one point or another. It’s stupid, it’s self-imposed; but when your ideas of men has been set as “toxic”, and your self-worth is in the fucking ground; that’s all you end up finding until you learn how to relearn what makes a “good man” and what you actually deserve. So. You’re going to see a lot of distrust and negativity towards men **in general** among these types of communities.   But now straying away from what is equally an excuse and a reasoning- I’d like to address that not *one* post in here has targeted men with EDs at all. It is an unsaid understanding that males exist and that they’re rarely going to be vocal about their struggles as it’s as ingrained in you as trauma is in us. It’s an unbalance that’s going to fuck us over till the end of time. I’ll be the first to admit that when it comes to discussing personal struggles and disorders- one gets very self-centered. We are, after all, mostly here to discuss our own struggles.   I would love it if men were more vocal about theirs. But I do understand the weight of it. And I do wish we had more positive things to say about men- again, *in general*- but we often do not and not many things here are going to be positive. But I can very much guarantee that if any male, DMAB or not- posted here, they would be welcomed with no issue.   There is a large separation between the Evil Men In General we are bitter towards and those who are here due to legitimate struggles with their own EDs. We do not target *literally* every man in existence.   If I can be blunt, we’re not to blame for our negativity towards men. The ones at blame are the ones that are at fault for every single hateful comment in any community in existence- the ones who broke our trust in very intimate and very scarring ways. They are the ones that ruined things for you. Just as vocal homophobic Christians taint Christianity or preachy holier-than-thou vegans taint veganism.   And i will take a moment to also address men are also victims of sexual abuse- and that statistics will never be accurate at the percentages as men are much, much less likely to report it or even be believed when reported. And I am absolutely sure that’d have the exact same effect on men with developing an eating disorder and even a seething anger towards women. That, indeed, does go both ways.   There are major flaws in all of this and our behavior- but again. This is where you’re going to find some of the most anger towards anything and anyone that hurt us. We are not trying to attack you. You are not who we’re talking about.",False,False
