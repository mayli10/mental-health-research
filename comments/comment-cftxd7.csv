He was in the hospital for issues with his heart and his water wieght about two weeks ago. He lost 40 LBS in a WEEK! I know it was literally all water weight but holy shit that drop triggered me more than anything else in my lifeeeeeeee.   He was already bordering on severely overweight without the water weight. I'm an average weight (bmi 22 i think?/120 lbs) so its obviously pretty much impossible for me to lose more than 40 lbs casually lmao so I feel as if I've lost this imaginary competition.,False,False
