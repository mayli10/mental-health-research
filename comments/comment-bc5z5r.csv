I did this EXACT THING today while shopping at Plato's with a friend. And I thought of this post while it was happening. I was like *Oh no... This isn't happening...* and then I was like *Haha is this rock bottom?!*   You are not alone. I tied my sweater around my waist and bought my stuff and then walked to the nearest subway to change in the bathroom (and binge the pain away).",False,False

I let an infection go for a few days and winded up in the hospital for 3 days due to the infection spreading to my kidney. Turns out the symptoms only decided to show after a month of the infection actually being in my system. They said if I waited any longer I would have had blood poisoning and could have died.   I'm not sure if you have the option, but going to an Express clinic takes a few hours but at least I get meds immediately now. I hope this might be an option for you because a few days suffering with that is absolutely awful. Best wishes OP ‚ù§",False,False
