We dont spend all day at rest and a higher muscle mass makes all activities burn more cals. Still seems worthwhile to me to consider. There probably is something additional going on with you. What you're experiencing sounds mega frustrating. I guess I suggested strength training bc it's likely more accessible to the average person than medical care, at least in the US, and its unlikely to do you any harm even if it doesnt help.",False,False

So walking for an hour is like 150 calories for me for example. But I don't even count exercise calories anymore, I just eat maintenance and exercise on top of it and still struggle to maintain. I weigh all my food and check it against the usda database. But I am legit hungry all the time, like I've been plateauing/not losing but I'm also fasting every other day and calorie counting. I am seeing a doctor about it and we are trying to treat it but I don't know how much better it will get. There is definitely something wrong with my system, a few things actually, you are right, but I don't know how much of it is related to this problem. I do have extreme reactions to a ton of random foods which cause weight gain (MCAS), hence the need to fast/starve to bring it back down. I am a special circumstance for that reason I guess.

There’s a lot of calculators/monitors out there that are not medical grade and are not accurate at all. If you’re exercising for a fairly short while (like a half hour) at a low intensity, some calculators overestimate to the extreme. The intensity you exercise at does have a decent impact on what you burn- but most of it is how long you exercise for.   Same with calories. Packaging and even MFP or lose it can be inaccurate and generous. In my experience, MFP is more often guilty of this than other apps I’ve used. Going by actual weight and verified sources is the only way to be truly accurate.   Honestly, it’s very, very unlikely you have to starve to maintain. Just like it’s very, very unlikely to genuinely maintain on a huge amount of calories without large amounts exercise to balance it out. You cannot create things without the necessary resources, just like you cannot destroy things without the necessary weapons.   If your body really is gaining that easily on so little, see a doctor. There could be something very wrong with your system that’s causing extreme reactions to something inside of you, or it could be something completely unrelated to food. They’re the only ones who can at all determine what the problem is.",False,False

They're really well known ED recovery accounts. One is a vegan who says she eats 3k cals a day. I really hate how misleading they are then. Like it's why I don't want to recover.

It's confusing because we constantly have this bullshit shoved down our throats about how we need to be eating at least 2,000 calories a day when in reality most people, especially women will gain weight eating that amount of calories. I'm somewhat tall (5'7) and I burn 1,800 calories a day. So you can imagine how a shorter inactive women who only burns 1,400 calories a day can so easily become overweight when they're being told to eat 2,000 calories.

I am hypothyroid and on thyroid meds because my metabolism sucks.  Even barring all that, I still gained a lot of weight on what most people would not. I've even read people losing on what I gained on. There is such a thing as a fast metabolism and I was not gifted one, and I never got the gift of hyper metabolism either. Like, no amount of exercise I could do would amount to an extra &gt;1000 calories a day that some people (cough Stephanie) can maintain on. And she doesn't do cardio anymore so it's not that, she just has a good metabolism.

There’s a lot of factors involved with what you actually burn. What do you consider losing a “decent” amount to be? Also remember that a combination of exercise and what it is you eat or don’t eat will effect how you hold onto water and how you build your muscle.   Dieting like a “normal” person and decreasing your intake to something “healthy” is very, very slow to what we’re used to, and plateauing is *very* common as since you’re eating more, your water weight fluctuates high a lot more often. Gas is more prevalent, etc. losing a half a pound a week is very average and it’s very normal to not notice it. It’s a slow and steady thing. Which is why a lot of normal people turn to crash dieting and cleanses- it’s just not fast enough. But it does work, in time.   If anything, look into your thyroid hormone levels. Tbh the only thing that’ll really “effect” your metabolism outside of exercise is the thyroid. Though only by a marginal bit, like maybe 200-300 calories worth if it’s very extreme.",False,False

Especially if they’re able to eat 3000+ calories, they’re likely doing a *lot* at the gym.   It’s dependent on your activity level. The way I am now, I’d gain quickly on 2000 calories. But when I’d work out even just a few times a week, I’d lose on the same amount.   🤷🏻‍♀️ most work for it. Or have hyperthyroidism. Even then, it’s not that crazy of a boost.   Doesn’t help a lot of “recovery” is overly focused on gaining weight. Last time I recovered they had me on 3000 calories a day with no activity except work so I could hit the 18 bmi quicker.
