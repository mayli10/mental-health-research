I'm just concerned about how close the diet is to disordered habits and how easy it would be to become obsessive over those low numbers. I don't want to see people slipping into an unhealthy mentality because they're encouraged to do something unhealthy physically. It's just a little too close for comfort.,False,True

I think I meant to expand on it but got distracted.   I just mean that disordered eating is anything that isn't just eating normally and not overthinking it, which who the fuck can do that anyways?     I feel like 99% of the people in the developed world have slightly disordered eating.  To have to think consciously about your diet and try to hit goals, one way or the other, fucking sucks and humans shouldn't have to do it, but we do now in the world we live in.  Doesn't mean you have an ED or you're making yourself sick, it just means that you have to obsess at least a little over something that kind of sucks to obsess over.  Also, an all liquid 500 cal diet for several weeks is defff not normal unless it's medically directed.",False,False

What makes it disordered is if it becomes a Problem- as in, when you’re supposed to be “done” with the diet, you can’t handle being done. You *have* to keep the numbers low, and not even necessarily to lose weight. To the point it leaks into every aspect of your life. It’s an obsession, not a “diet” anymore.   Otherwise fad diets like cleanses and fasting and shit have been around since the dawn of time and 99.99% of people can go pretty much straight back to normal eating when it’s all said and done.",False,False

If you have an angry/dependent relationship with food (like in most EDs), you'll be thinking about food 24/7.  When I was younger, I wouldn't really care about food. You know those lies of ""I forgot to eat""? That was actually me, but without lying. I would go 2 days without eating and not even realise it or because I was lazy I would just drink a glass of juice and that was my meal. I would NEVER feel hungry.  I think back then I could have sticked with that diet for months, especially considering I did pretty much that, but with alcohol and watermelon.  If the plan is to normally reintroduce food later on, it's OK, it's not sold as something you are supposed to continue forever. It's like fasting when you're OK VS fasting when you have an eating disorder. It's not the same mindset at all.",False,False

They'll try it for a few days and just go back to regular food. I mean 450-600 cals is not sustainable even to most people with restrictive EDs.

Usually the shakes are incredibly expensive and the people who do them cant stick to it so they just end up being out $80 and with big awful tasting shake mix. My roommate did that and spent so much money on it and it lasted maybe 2 weeks. But now theyre mine now and perf for restricting. Theyd only really work if you have an ed already or v strong resolve.
