All of it actually.   I was guilt tripped by a counselor that I was being lazy about my work and should not give in to a time consuming addiction, when I went to seek help regarding that in the first place!    As if I wasn't already guilty and ashamed and feeling shit about myself daily enough.    Well I was. I was already going through the same cycles for months and suffered quite a few losses because of it. And considered seeking help for months before actually finding the courage and right conditions to do so.  And what do I get? : A nice guilt trip and a patronizing scolding and a ""Why don't you just focus and be better"".   Thanks I am cured. /s",False,False
