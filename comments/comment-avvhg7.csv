My restaurant is rolling out a new menu and at 10 am they wanted to try to each new dish 10+ and mostly fried. I said I can't I'm fasting and income the comments ""that can't be healthy!"" ""When DO you eat?"" ""A few bites won't hurt!"" People acted like I was killing myself, I'm 5'3 and 125 so nowhere near underweight. Like man get off my ass. I know a lot of the stuff I do isn't healthy but fasting really has helped me get a grip on my will power and avoid binges. It's also shown me how little people understand about it. ",False,False

Before, counting calories used to be a disordered eating thing. If you told your family you were counting calories to lose weight, they would freak out and beg you to get help. But now we have apps for it, and doctors recommend it to help people lose weight. I'm wondering if fasting is going to be the new calorie counting. I already see a lot of people new to weight loss being recommended intermittent fasting. Fasting has the same reaction counting calories used to have, but its starting to be more common and accepted.
