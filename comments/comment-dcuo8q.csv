The cycle the author drew was basically like, self hatred, indulging (bingeing or drinking), the regret (purging, the hangover or what have you), the “I’ll do better/never drinking again”, the trigger, the self hatred, and over again.  Not sure if a lot of people can relate. I read the book before I had ever drank alcohol so it was totally foreign to me.",False,False
