I like to remind myself of my values. If I remind myself I value human character traits like humility or finding happiness in the success or good fortune of others, then a lot of negative feelings can’t be as present even in the face of my lower self esteem.  Just reminding myself something like humility and modesty are good values for someone to have seems to yield a lessened desire to be *the one* whos being seen in that way.    Telling myself to be happy for someone helps a lot and it altered my personality traits over time because I kept doing it. It helps with situational negative feelings a ton but I won’t pretend it at all works as an aid for increasing overall low self esteem. :/",False,False
