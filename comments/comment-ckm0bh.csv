Side note after I landed in the hospital for SH my doctors advice was, literally, ‚Äúbut you‚Äôre such a beautiful girl! Why would you do that?‚Äù Gee thanks doc now that I know you‚Äôd gladly dick me down I am FULLY cured. Because, as a girl, 1000% of my thoughts are about my looks and *that* must be the reason my lil pink, glittery feminine brain wants to hurt me. Thanks!",False,False
