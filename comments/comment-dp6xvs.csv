I make an active effort to hide my disorder, eating in front of people and eating whatever is offered to me. From an outside perspective, I've got a big stomach (as in I have a lot of room for food) and eat a decent amount of food. When I'm not in front of people, though, I don't eat. I get basically all of my calories from stuff other people give me, the rest of the time I just don't eat or eat very low-calorie. I'm underweight so they might be doing something similar.",False,False

Their secret: they modulate their caloric intake, either consciously or unconsciously. Maybe one day they eat 3,000 calories, the couple of days they eat 1,000 calories or less.  Or maybe they also have eating disorders.",False,False
