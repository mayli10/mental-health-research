I think my highest was only 40 days.   I relate a lot to what you said about not having many friends or serious interests. EDs take up so much headspace I find myself mindlessly distracting myself and eating alone so Im not tempted to binge. Like everything that makes me not boring are all my depressing personal problems that I cant tell anyone about.  As soon as we recover though we have the rest of our lives to fix that.,False,False

I don't have an excuse especially now as its winter break but it's not worth beating myself up over.,False,False

Hating the changes in my body as a result. Yeah, it's actually for my mom so she's been hogging it, but I think it's pretty brilliant the way they incorporated all the exercises into the game/the movements of the remotes/ring itself. What about you?",False,True

I haven't been to the gym in a long time - same reason as you, focusing on school, but not really seeing any results for it. I did get Ring Fit a week or so ago though. Do you like it?",False,False

Yeah I actively try to improve at my mentality because I know it makes things easier for my boyfriend too but it's so hard, especially since I have depression that feeds into it.",False,True

That game is fairly small/niche and not many people know about smaller indie games like that. I'm a big fan of the game myself so your reference made me laugh. Also I know it's hard to but try to think better of yourself, never feel inadequate for your partner in a relationship.",False,False
