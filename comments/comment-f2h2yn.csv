I know it seems hard but just push through. What helped me when I finally quit was to think “I’ve already gone 2 days, if I quit now I’ll be back at 0”.. then eventually “I’ve gone a week... a month... 3 months...” and now I’m here  I’ve been really having the urge lately and I looked up the date of exactly when I quit and realized it’s about to be 5 years and it’s really helping me to push through and not do it  You got this!! If you don’t do it today, you’ll be one more day into it. It’s easier to stay motivated thinking “it’s been a week” than to think “I messed up again and I’m back at zero”  Also, if you do end up doing it, it’ll be ok &amp; you can try again starting now to not do it anymore  Good luck 😘😘",False,False
