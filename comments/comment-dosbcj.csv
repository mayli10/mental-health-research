I appreciate it so much. Iâ€™m not expecting anything as I wasnâ€™t even expecting to be prescribed anything but i will stay optimistic and see where it takes me.,False,True

It's slow to start working, and the change isn't always obvious. Give it time, but don't be afraid to get a second opinion after a few weeks. Mental health professionals (mental nurse practicioners, psychiatrists, etc) will be able to give you a better idea of how you're doing and what modifications need to be made, so try to get an appointment if you can. Not saying that normal GPs don't do a good job, but it's also not their specialty.   From personal experience, the first thing you're perscibed is rarely the last. I had to switch to Prozac from another medication and it's been helping me with the depression/bullemia combination I've had for the past couple years. It doesn't prevent me from falling into the binge/purge cycle, but it makes me more able to say no and have a good day every now and again.   Everyone's experience is different with these sorts of things, so what makes me feel normal might not do the same thing for you. You just have to stay optimistic (easier said than done). There's going to be something that helps you, medication or not.",False,False

I thought it was a little strange as well but I was extremely anxious during the whole visit I feel like she just wanted to put me out of my misery. Thank you so much for sharing. Iâ€™m starting the first two weeks on 10mg and then going to 20mg.,False,True

Something to be aware of (doc may have told you already) is that with SSRIs it takes awhile for them to become effective. Usually something like 4-6 weeks. And even then, sometimes dose adjustment is necessary (and the range of possible prozac doses is pretty broad...Iâ€™ve been on everything from 20mg to 90mg). When changing or tweaking meds I try to track how my mood/symptoms are going so that I can see what effect (if any) the med is having (including any adverse effects).  Prozac is also a general first-line-of-defense med that primary care docs are comfortable prescribing. Hopefully it will work well for you, but seeing someone who specializes in mental health meds can be a good option if you and your doc arenâ€™t having success. (Itâ€™s a little concerning that they only talked to you for a few minutes before prescribing. Like I get that insurance companies make it hard on doctors but still...) I actually see an APRN now for my psych meds (advanced practice nurse) and am having a much more positive experience with her than with the fancy psychiatrists I saw previously. Best of luck! I hope the prozac works out.",False,False
