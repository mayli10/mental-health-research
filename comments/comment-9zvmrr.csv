It turned into its own ridiculous circlejerk faster than anything. Every second post is ""Does anyone else think [diet food] isn't JUST AS GOOD as [full-fat full-sugar high-calorie 'normal' food]? Anyone who suggests they ACTUALLY enjoy [diet food] is obviously crazy and deluding themselves! Everyone else must hate existing on a diet as much as me!""   All the ""I expected this substitute to taste EXACTLY like this normal food, and the fact it doesn't is some personal failing on the part of the recipe maker"" posts piss me off. They're not relatable, they're absurd. If you make a recipe where most of the sugar comes from banana, it's not funny if you get upset that it tastes like banana, you sound like a weirdo. If you make a cauliflower pizza base, don't be mad if it doesn't have the texture of a flour pizza base and tastes like cauliflower. Like... it's literally just a crab bucket now, anyone who tries to suggest a tasty recipe that might be able to satisfy certain food cravings in some people is just dragged down as being stupid, delusional, lying, faking it, etc. They want to believe everyone is just as bitter and weirdly food-entitled as them.  There's also a bizarre amount of misery and ""this sucks and will always suck and I can never ever deviate from my 1200 cal diet."" What started as a response to the overwhelming ""dieting is fun and exercise is great and if you ever struggle with it you're just doing it wrong!"" just went too hard in the opposite direction. As you said, a lot of the people posting there probably shouldn't be on 1200 in the first place - although if you ever suggest as such they're quick to jump down your throat. And on top of that, a lot of them act like they're never, ever allowed to have calorific foods in their diet any more, and if you try to suggest ways they can, they just shrug you off. OMAD, intermittent fasting, maintenance days - nope, none of those things exist to them, they can just never ever have paaaasta or burgers again on a 1200 cal diet. Apparently it's straight-up impossible to ever enjoy a premeditated dinner out with friends ever again - because you can't eat light for breakfast/lunch and check the menu beforehand? People make out like taking a little extra effort is going to kill them.   I think a lot of them just want to be miserable, hence the crab bucket.  Sorry for the wall of text lmao. I just feel like the transformation happened before my eyes and I wish there was like a... 1200isjerkyisjerky sub or something, but I know it would turn into the exact same thing. They honestly seem way more miserable than anyone here or in proED, which I think is why they're so defensive and angry about being compared lol. The only thing they have left to cling onto is that they're doing things the ""right way.""",False,False

It's a circlejerk sub (hence *jerky*.) Circlejerk subs are created in order to address and counteract groupthink (""circlejerks"") in the main sub by either breaking the circle by disagreeing, or parodying it by amping it up to 1000. Like an example would be when 1200isplenty got taken over by that one brownie recipe getting popular. People were right to be a bit annoyed by the spam, so they could ""break the circle"" by venting about it on 1200isjerky. *Jerking* posters by quoting actual posts is what circlejerk subs have always been about.  r/1200isfineIGUESSugh is more what you're talking about, people commiserating about how hard weight loss is without targeting specific people.  That said - both subs have drastically gone downhill and right now I can't stand either of them. The jerking is getting out of hand on jerky and their own circlejerk is worse than anything on 1200isplenty, and fineIguess is turning into a crab bucket. In the end the ED subs are always way more nuanced and helpful lmao.",False,False
