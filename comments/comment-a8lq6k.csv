I'm gonna keep this in mind when we go back - I'll probably eat a lot less anyway, but I've been trying to think of what to say to get them off my back before it goes too far. I'm gonna try to not let them get to me too much.",False,True

(Im vegan and get ""teased"" non-stop from friends and fam) It sounds like they were doing it light-heartedly. Probably because they wanted to validate themselves in eating the same amount as you as they are much bigger. Or they see you as much smaller and happy to see you eat so they feel the need to comment and encourage you in a passive sabotage way so that you feel good about eating that much (which wasn't a lot, it was salad!) so you will always eat like that (which you don't) so they don't feel so bad about their own size, if that makes any sense.       I think they saw you do something out of the norm for you and just commented on it. No need to beat yourself up. You do you- don't care what anyone else says. They probably didn't even notice it was all salad as they were focused on their own plates.       I know what it's like to get teased about your eating choices, trust me, it gets old real fast. But I've come to the point where I honestly do not care what people think about what I eat. It's not their business. It's not their body. It's not their problem. And by the next day, they'll have forgotten all about it anyways. I have one friend that says, ""you just don't eat"" when I deny a snack or food. I'm I'm like....uh, I eat, just not that crap.   It is frustrating, I feel your pain, but don't think too much about it okay? You are just fine :) ",False,False
