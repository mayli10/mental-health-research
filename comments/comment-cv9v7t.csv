I took it to the extreme and avoided all sugars--even natural from like fruit. The sight of food was appalling and thee smell made me cry. I was just afraid of ""contamination""and having the sugar go directly into my bloodstream or some crazy shit.   Now all I is candy. I want gummy frogs, fruit snacks, gummie worms,etc. The prob is that candy and junk food is so much more affordable than healthy food and so easily accessible. Then I go into a downward spiral because lets say I eat a small thing of fries and thats all I eat for the entire week...even though I know that I won't get fat in my head its the feeling of the grease and the cheap fast food that gets to me. Its a matter of convince I think like its easier to just go to McD instead of cooking, but I know I don't deserve to eat.   I love watching cooking shows and competitions and reading up on recipes as if I were going to actually do it lol.",False,False
