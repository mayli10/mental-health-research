I just wanted to start with that.  Honestly, the best advice I could give would be to just throw out your scale. Scales are incredibly deceiving. I've been living without one for three years and it's been great for my mental health.  That being said, I'd need more info to determine why you're not gaining weight faster but here are a few possible reasons:  1) Your body is happy you're feeding it again and responds by increasing its metabolism. This is actually a pretty common thing for many people and it's pretty normal and if this is the case your metabolism is going to regulate itself eventually over time if you keep going. I knew a girl I  treatment who are 3500+ a day and still lost weight until her body got used to eating again and her metabolism normalised and she was able to gain weight until she was at a healthy weight and able to go into maintenance.  2) your weight isn't changing but your body composition is. A lot of bodies will store a lot of water when they're malnutritioned and will get rid of it and replacing it with fat and muscle when they're recovering before starting to actually gain weight. Again, this is a normal and healthy thing for your body to do and will normalise over time.  3) you're not eating as much as you think you are. It's easy to overestimate the amount of food you're eating/underestimate the amount of food your body needs after severely restricting your food intake for a long time. I've been considered recovered for years and it still happens for me occasionally. Services disguising themselves as ""health"" or ""fitness"" tools suggesting a toddler's maintenance amount of calories for an active adult's weight gain aren't helpful in this process. Do you have a nutritionist to help you work towards a better perception of what your body needs?   4) Hormones. Your body has more energy to produce them and may be using some of the energy it has to sort those out again. It's just trying to get most things sorted out before trying to store extra energy for later.  In general, I wouldn't stress or worry too much. Your body probably knows what it's doing and has done a great job at keeping you alive so far. The fact that you're eating more and actually want to gain weight back is amazing! Everything else will follow. I am so proud of you and even though you may just be a stranger on the internet, my eyes are tearing up as I type this. Just keep going and try to listen to your body as well as you can, which is something that will also become easier over time.  Much love and strength to you. Please keep going, you're doing great",False,False

Plus, as you eat more, your metabolism will speed up to match that, so generally, you need to be constantly increasing for weight gain.",False,False

People recovering from a very low weight can sometimes eat 3000+ calories and still lose weight. It depends on your body, but I'd imagine you need a bit more than you previously thought. Try adding one more item to your plate at every meal and see how you feel from there :)",False,False
