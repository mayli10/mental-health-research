But really, I felt like she was asking how you feel. I see people say things like that a lot when they want to see how people feel towards a very specific subject. I don't think she was implying you should lose weight.",False,False

Seeing as how she knows you lost weight, maybe she is trying to gauge how you feel about it. Seeing as how she phrased it as ""so you think you should go on a diet?"" Rather than, ""well, are you going to go on a diet"" or ""maybe you should diet,"" it seems like maybe she can sense that something is up and is trying to figure out how you feel about having put on weight.  Obviously I wasnt there tho, but maybe something to think about!  Either way I'm sorry she said that /: I hope you stay as safe as you can",False,False
