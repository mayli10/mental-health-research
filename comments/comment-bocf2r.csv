There are often phone, text, and online chat options (a google search should give results for your region)  If you’re reaching a point where you feel unable to stay physically safe, I highly recommend staying with a trusted person who knows what’s up, or going to the emergency room. Asking for irl help can be hard, but in my experience it’s so much better to ask for help than to hurt myself or attempt to die.  Keep breathing in and out, one minute at a time. The most intense waves of emotion will slowly pass. The night will turn to morning. Tomorrow wants to meet you.",False,False
