When I was starting recovery I knew I had to eat but I didn't want to eat anything because everything was unappealing. I kept some ensures or boosts in the house if I really Needed to eat but couldn't bring myself to. I don't know if you were forced into recovery or if it's something that you want, but if it is something that you want, you need to start learning skills that allow you to nourish your body when your options are limited.  As you go through recovery, you're probably going to have to sometimes eat foods that aren't unappealing and you're going to have to retry foods to learn what you don't like and what your eating disorder doesn't like. My dietitian made kind of like, a hierarchy of needs when thinking about food. So first and most important is getting enough energy in the day. And then balance between the food groups. And then preferences, last.  One of the effects of an eating disorder can be no appetite. As you progress in your recovery, that'll change, but it requires eating enough food and sitting with the discomfort. I don't know if you've done DBT yet? But distress tolerance skills have been big for me there. It's really hard for me not to turn around and use ED behaviors when I'm uncomfortable after eating. I like ACCEPTS:  * Activities - Distractions that take your mind off of the discomfort. I like to watch youtube videos and talk to friends. In my program we do table games that really help me.  * Contributing - Doing something to help other people. You can make cards for friends, bake for someone, or volunteer. * Comparisons - Remind yourself that you have gotten through hard things before, and you can get through this, too. * Emotions - Do something that makes you feel happy and doesn't make you stew in the uncomfortable feelings. I like listening to Wham because they have a lot of fun music and it makes me happier when I feel shitty. * Push Away - This is literally just like, ""This is a problem for future me."" This would probably only work for you if you compensate after eating? You have to like, just put off the urges and put off the urges because eventually they'll settle down. * Thoughts - This is another activities one! It's about doing things that take your mind off of it and is more like, mind consuming like a crossword puzzle (Soooo many people in my inpatient unit did crossword puzzles it was something else). * Sensation - Try to soothe yourself. Take a hot shower, put on comfortable clothes, use essential oils, look at some art, use a sugar scrub. Soothe the senses.  Distractions have been really huge for me in my recovery. I don't think I would have been able to get through some meals and some days if I wasn't able to distract myself. I'm like, definitely not quite there yet, but after six months in treatment I at least know what I'm supposed to do. It's really fucking hard. Recovery does require you to step outside your comfort zone because what is actually you and what is your eating disorder is probably close to indistinguishable right now (At least it was for me - I had no safe foods, at all, and I thought I was just super picky).",False,False
