I’ve seen people end up in the ICU for weeks to months following elective skin removal procedures when they were in situations similar to, but not as severe as, yours.",False,False

He wanted to schedule it out for 3 months out but I rely on insurance and need this procedure before the tube or not at all. It’s terrible. I’m going to be hospitalized in less than 8 hours and idk what they will do. I can’t even eat, barely drink, but I cannot tolerate an NG tube again. I’m alone and losing my mind.",False,True

It doesn’t matter if insurance will cover it, it’s too dangerous for you right now. If this surgeon is proposing doing surgery with your current health conditions the way you describe, they are not a good fit for you, they don’t have good judgment, and they could hurt you.    After 200lb weight loss, the amount of skin that needs to be removed will be massive and you’re at a very increased risk for complications. Very close to, if not at, 100%. In order to heal, you need to have a positive nitrogen balance and be eating at maintenance. Based on your description of your situation, be prepared for dehiscence, necrosis, and infection if you have skin removal surgery while unable to eat. Hopefully you won’t throw a clot or have a cardiac issue.",False,False
