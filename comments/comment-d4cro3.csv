Like I said, it‚Äôs mostly just that I have better habits when I‚Äôm in ED mode.  My two options are basically ‚Äúeating disorder‚Äù and ‚Äúhorribly depressed‚Äù, so eating disorder feels way better.",False,False

Like it gives me the illusion that i have my life together and everything is fine while it probably is quite the opposite. Tbh i hope the majority from this sub will eventually recover but i doubt i ever will.  Despite how much i hate the fact that my body is physically aching from all the shit i do to stay on track, no matter how much i am destroying it, i atleast feel like i got stuff together and i know what to expect from the future....",False,False

But tbh, I attribute that to my bipolar disorder, more than my ED. I use my ED to control my mood swings, so sometimes I feel like I gain more than my ED than I lose - but in reality, I know that is just two disorders that keeps on fuelling each other.",False,False

I'm freaking scared that I waste my life thinking about calories, food, my weight, even though I know for a fact that I am not fat. I have a boyfriend who loves me to death, who loves how I look, a family that cares for me and a best friend who likes me just the way  I am. But I can't  enjoy any of this until I reach my stupid goal weight, which I'll probably never reach, because it's freaking low and what then? Everyone is going to notice and wants to me go to therapy and I know that I won't be happy at my goal weight either.     I'm 24, suffering more than 10 years now and I know my life is already ruined.",False,False

Focusing on my intake and my looks helped me ignore everything around me. I was obviously miserable, but I don't think it was because of my eating disorder, since I could only get better once I left the house.",False,False

Unfortunately I thought gaining weight would make me healthier and it just made me realize that my problems weren't caused by my eating disorder. Or, well, maybe they were initially, but now I could est healthy 24/7 and my symptoms won't go away. So I just do whatever I feel like in the moment. If eating would make me feel sick or would make me feel bad I don't eat. If I think it will make me feel good then I eat. I still suffer from my anorexia, but I think I've gotten to a point where it's a minor problem for me.",False,False

I hate being so obsessive over this stupid disorder. food rules/rituals/counting calories give me a false sense of peace that are completely unsustainable. the decision to recover isn't just one choice. it's consciously going against all those self imposed restrictions and fears three times a day, every single day.  but it's doable. hard, but doable.",False,False

When I‚Äôm not in ED mode I‚Äôm basically a potato of a person and I get trapped in an existential crisis.
