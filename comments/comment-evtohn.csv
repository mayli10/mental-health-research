That first one obviously came from the mouth of a garbage person, however the second one i understand. They might have been coming from a place of structure, meaning that sticking to a routine will help to normalize the act of eating. But thats just speculation, either way I'm sorry that things were said at you that hurt your recovery :( keep your eyes on what you feel is best for you.",False,False

How on earth do they see that as helpful. You could try to tell them their comments aren't helpful? And tell them they're being inappropriate? I hate that we live in a world that values appreance more than recovery from a  life threatening disorder.,False,False
