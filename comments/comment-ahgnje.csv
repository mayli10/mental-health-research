He’s been cooking a lot and it’s hard to know the calorie counts for everything he’s making and it stresses me the fuck out. ,False,False

My legs/feet get very numb, the cramps are crippling, the bloating is ridiculous, and the fatigue is debilitating.   The good news is that cannibas works wonders. Strong CBD with a little THC and I swear I can feel my muscles relax. The bad news? I haven't been able to have any because I'm job searching and despite the fact it's legal in CA, a lot of employers still prohibit it. So I can't have any until I pass the drug test and am hired.  I'm dreading this week. Please hire me so I can stop being in pain. ",False,False

And I'm pretty sure it's been the root of my anxiety, depression, and eating disorder. It feels hellish being in the same room as someone who I'm attracted to, who has been causing me so much distress and pain, and not be able to tell them anything.

Im not saying my aunt is a good person, she did a lot of stuff against us after my grandfather’s death, which is why my sister said “no one” ate for 24 hours- because of how grief stricken we are.  But I feel like a pig now because I did eat. I let go of any calorie counting and just ate and ate that day. It took me 2 days to realize he was truly gone, and even then I wasn’t driven to the point of not wanting to eat from grief.   And being compared to my morbidly obese aunt really sucks, but considering it was from my sister who thinks 12 hours is a really long time to not eat and is saying it for other reasons, it’s alright.  But I’ve lost my appetite, luckily. ",False,False

Finally messaged the guy who has been pursuing me, he asked if he could come over today after work and I agreed.  It’s a massive deal for me to have anyone over other than the two or three people I’ve grown to fully trust over the years, but an even bigger deal because it was pretty clear he wanted sex. Which is a whole issue for me for a variety of reasons. But I’m attracted to him and the not crazy part of me wants to sleep with him, so.  I’ve spent the last few days talking myself into it, convincing myself that if I get the lighting just right he won’t notice how ugly I am, just generally trying to convince myself that all my obsessing and freaking out is ridiculous and I need to just relax and learn to enjoy myself. And I cleaned my house, picked out the perfect outfit, put some stuff away that I thought might scare him off or stuff that’s just personal (stuff that’s really not a big deal, but except for those few people I’m extremely comfortable with, I really don’t like people in my space/around my stuff). Didn’t eat all day because I get super bloated whenever I eat even the smallest thing. Actually managed to get myself 100% on board with the idea of him being here.  ...annnnd he totally blew me off. So. That’s fantastic.   I am pathetic. My life is pathetic. Of fucking course he blew me off because that’s just how my life goes.  On the plus side, I was right, as always. People suck. The world is garbage. I’m better off locked in my house, not speaking to anyone, drinking and reading and watching tv. Life is much simpler that way.  (Also, fuck my scale/my body for my weight not fucking budging at all when I should have lost at least a pound since Monday. That’s also just fucking fantastic.)",False,False
