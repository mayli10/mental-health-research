Even though I'm sure I was just freaking out, for all I know that could've been the day I died. My boyfriend would've had to find my dead body, right next to him. Thank fucking god I decided to eat something, I don't think he would be able to handle that. I know I wouldn't, roles reversed.",False,True

I've never felt like I might die though. I'm glad you were able to take care of yourself in the moment when you were worried ðŸ™‚ That's a pretty big deal. Lots of people would just go to sleep anyway.",False,False

Thinking about the future with this disorder is pretty scary. I gotta remind myself that this could be how I die, and for all the shit I give myself I know that I'm slowly starving to death. Even a few nights ago I felt so bad, I was about to go to bed and thought I might die in my sleep, so I ate some peanut butter and had a glass of milk. I bet I was just overreacting, but I felt my body failing. Seriously, I wish you the best.",False,True

I mostly tried to rely on a healthy diet, but I'm always too tired to make food for myself so I decided to go for getting nearly all of my nutrients through supplements and eating whatever I can. I planned my supplements around eating a McDouble combo every day. It's cheap and it's easy and it's surprisingly healthy. I think it was over 60% cumulative DV according to Cronometer. There is plenty of overlap with the supplements I take, but I end up with like 95% of my nutrition needs met. Part of the reason that's low is because of the calorie deficit and not getting quite enough potassium. But McDonald's fries do have a lot of potassium so it's like the best choice I could make under my current circumstances. I'm hoping that this will help keep hair loss at bay so it can start growing back in thicker and that I won't struggle as much with lethargy or migraines. Time will tell. Well, it will take a couple years to know if my hair starts getting healthier, but I guess that's better than nothing.",False,False

I should try to take more vitamins, I'm not looking forward to the negative side effects of being underweight like this, gotta at least try to avoid them. Do you think taking vitamins like that has kept the bad stuff at bay (besides losing hair I guess)?",False,True

The multivitamin and shake together have enough D3 already, but I would still be low on calcium and magnesium even after eating the way I normally do and they didn't have a supplement with both that didn't have D3 so I got that one. I could have grabbed them as separate supplements, but that would cost more and I don't need that much of either mineral. I think I recall reading that a medication I take can cause low calcium so I wanted to be certain I was getting 100% of the recommended amount instead of like 80% or something, but I also didn't want to get too much calcium after eating because the upper tolerable limit is quite low. I'm hoping this will help me feel better. I was even careful to ensure that none of the supplements I took would conflict with my typical diet and put me over the upper tolerable limit for any vitamins or minerals. My potassium is still a bit low, but it's hard to get enough of that. Only 5% of people do from their diet alone. I get a really good amount considering how little I eat though. I can't imagine I need the full 100% DV considering how little I eat too. I'm sure having a little less than what someone eating a 2000 calorie diet would need is okay.",False,False

I should definitely start taking potassium because I can't file my nails or they shred, and my hair is getting thinner and thinner (I usually have super thick hair).",False,True
