I got outside and he asked me if I just ate peanut butter. I froze and he said I had a little bit on my lips. “How much did you eat, haha”  Not a good moment for me. I’m trying to stop “secret eating” and it makes it really hard. I wish I had an answer for you, but just keep doing what you are doing. Keep communicating, keep bringing food/meal prep. Offer to spend a little more time at your place or ask if you could stop by to eat at your place.  It’s tough",False,False

Or don't be afraid to reference a medical professional. ""My doctor/dietician has me on an eating plan right now.""  If you want to disclose the bulimia you can, but you don't owe anyone an explanation about your medical treatment, including nutrition-based therapy. You can even maybe mask it as blood sugar issues or stomach issues or something that is less stigmatized. ",False,False

I restock it daily but it has all of my food in it. Then I also keep non-perishables in a small crate in my car too. I bring this giant lunch cooler of food everywhere...to work, to school, to my parents house, to my internship. I play things by ear as far as how much food I'm willing to bring depending on when I'm returning to my home.   Can you ask him for a shelf in his fridge for just you? And also don't be afraid to start cooking or go and make yourself something to eat.   Its OK to tell people ""I don't/can't eat that"". Your health matters way more than making someone else feel comfortable and at ease. My boyfriend used to eat fast food for almost every meal and I would do it too. Eventually I just had to be like ""look I can't eat this"". I started cooking and now he rarely eats fast food and our fridge is always stocked with good things. ",False,False

I leave a lot of snacking foods at my boyfriend's place. Stuff that is clearly for me that he wouldn't eat himself, like eggs, pickles, rice cakes, ice cream, etc. This also helps me space out my snacking because I rarely snack at home.",False,False

It's gonna be hard, but if he's worth being with, he'll listen without judgment and take clear steps to help you.  I'd also consider bringing your own snacks and having them stowed away there for yourself - ask him not to eat them lol",False,False

First you should tell him exactly what bulimia is, and how frustrating and difficult it is to live with. Then say that in order to recover, you need to have something to eat as soon as you’re hungry so that the hunger doesn’t escalate and you find yourself binging again. then maybe tell him your preferred snacks and ask him if he can keep those around for when you come over?
