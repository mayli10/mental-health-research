There are plenty of calculators out there to help you figure out your TDEE, or if you have a sport watch or tracker of any sort really, you could see what it spits out for just a regular day and eat around there.

I think you could really slowly add calories into your diet (100 here and there) so you don’t start binging or get triggered by water weight/waste/increased hunger.   I think when I hit my GW I’m going to slowly transition to really high restriction (about 1000) and treat myself to eating out or having drinks with dinner more often. I’m really terrified of gaining weight when maintenance eating. ,False,False

Since you're eating more afterwards, some will be extra food and waste lingering in your body, some will be water which the body uses to digest that food, and some may be muscle and bone. One way to determine this is to see whether your measurements change with the weight gain, and adjust accordingly, probably minimally. I don't think you need to lose more!",False,False
