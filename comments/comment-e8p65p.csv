Often mistaken for chest pain. If I had to guess, you broke a fast with some relatively tough to digest food (any dairy in the mashed sweet potatoes?), and now you’re experiencing indigestion since your stomach &amp; gallbladder are freaking out.   Lay down on your left side, take a tums if you have one. Drink lots of water to help your GI system break this food down. Try breaking the fast with something easier to digest next time, like some saltines or chicken broth :)  Source - am med student",False,False
