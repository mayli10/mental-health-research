I'm French, and when I'm ridiculing myself in French/around other French people Im absolutely worse to myself, there are harsher words and things I can say to myself, my word carries more weight to myself because I, idk I understand it more maybe?? vs around English Speakers (I live in Australia) and to myself when I'm speaking English I'm more likely to bargain with myself and be more allowing. Not much more though.",False,False

Polish is my mother language and it’s definitely more cheerful. It’s very common to add diminutives to nouns so it’s kinda cutesy. Like you could say “Chce kanapke” which means “I want a sandwich” or “chce kanapeczke” which means “I want a cute lil sammich” which sounds way more positive. And it’s not an affectation that only women take on to sound more cute and childish or whatever, I see grown men talking in this cutesy way all the time. It sounds playful and fun to me. Language has a lot of power in shaping how we think and view reality so it’s great you’re trying to think in a language that’s more positive.",False,False
