Feel like a fake. My ED is like my kid. Other people my are need to go take care of their children after work. I have to go take care of my ED. Eat just enough of just the right stuff to make sure I don't faint. Make sure I can have the energy (or at least fake it) to manage a business.  Or I fail at all that and spend all my calories on alcohol and spend all my energy taking Excedrin and drinking water trying to make it functioning to my job. People envy that I have ""freedom"" from kids and how easy it must be to have ""no responsibility"" outside of work. I can't even do my laundry without almost fainting.  I time my eating to have the maximum energy at work, then there is nothing left. Being an adult with an ED sucks.",False,False
