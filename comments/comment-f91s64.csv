I feel tiny anxiety /panicky inklings all week and when I finally have the whole weekend to spend time with my favorite person in the world I ruin it when he touches me because I feel utterly disgusting. I feel like I’m not there and I wish I was there with him.   Long story short I know EXACTLY how you feel. It’s the anxiety, inevitable panic attack, then the guilt that I ruined the night with my bf bc I’m so insecure and disgusted with myself.",False,False

He knows about my past with ED but doesn’t know I’ve relapsed so I feel like shit because I want him to eat but at the same time I don’t wanna eat so basically what I’m saying is that I am a trash gf who doesn’t at all deserve a sweet, loving bf like the one I have",False,False
