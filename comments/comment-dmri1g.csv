I‚Äôm an idiot and have never heard of it. The charcoal thing is incredibly annoying - can deactivate any medication, absorbs the good stuff as well as the bad and is just ridiculous.

For some reason I can get myself to eat more calories/meals if the food I eat is ""healthy"". But like, if I eat the SAME amount of calories in junk food I have to restrict harder or fast or whatever. I've been better about is recently, but I also deep dive into diet fads, even if I don't try them out. I had myself doing fucking low-carb OMAD for like a month. I try to sate it by watching people like Abbey Sharp and Unnatural Vegan, who look at these fad diets, but through a more rational lens, and they always end up poking holes in it. Abbey in particular is a registered dietitian so she's a big help.",False,False

Otherwise I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm so much annoyed by wellness trends as I am fascinated by them.

That‚Äôs not even a thing, charcoal only works for ingestion of actual poisons and has to be consumed immediately to soak up the poison.
