I also have anhedonia, and have had for such a prolonged time that I worry I can't go on ""living"" like this.   I work full time and also study to further a career I don't care about. It makes logical sense but... I just work so I can one day get a nice home and a bunch of animals. I do my duty (and live in literal poverty) but I feel I've been deferring gratification my whole life. I see my family and ""have fun"" but for what? I don't feel present in my own life. I say I want to get qualifications and earn more but honestly, I don't care.  I was on and off SSRIs since my teens and I worry my synapses have been set to anhedonia as a default setting. Coming off them 6 months or so ago has been amazing, I get distant glimpses of actual human feelings! But I'll prob end up back on them to cope.   I'm so sorry, I'm 35 and still struggling so I can't say it gets better with age. Undereating numbs me in one way but there is that whole other level of numb lack of motivation.  For what it's worth I really hope you feel better soon. Go easy on yourself.   Apologies for the wall of text.  Edited to add: JFC my post sounds nihilistic as fuck  I'm sorry. I'm still here and I have periods of motivation.",False,False

I feel worse than ever after wandering around aimlessly between shitty jobs, schooling I donâ€™t care at all about, and a blossoming eating disorder that forms what shred of a personality I have left since being ejected from a neatly organized public school schedule.

Itâ€™s a situation that I wouldnâ€™t wish upon my worst enemy and yet Iâ€™ve existed in it for majority of my life. I donâ€™t even remember how it feels to be normal. To be excited about life. Moments come, but they pass just as quickly. Iâ€™ll find a hobby, get excited and drop it after a week. All I want to do is log my black coffee into Chronometer while I barely exist watching people eat crunchy stuff on YouTube.

That being said, as I've been in therapy for the Ed its really struck me how much they are intertwined, and also how I showed signs of all of it much earlier than I noticed or it became a problem.  I'm a bio major so I tend to look at things from a skewed perspective but with all the research coming out about the possible neurochemical underpinnings of these disorders I feel more and more like (for me at least) it's just different facets to a single biological cause, or at least very closely related ones. Like, events in my life and psychology and stuff triggered/played into a lot of my issues but it really seems like we just kinda got the shit end of the stick with how our brains are wired. My psychiatrist and I have a couple of pet theories regarding a lot of my issues stemming from a difference in sensory input and interpretation- I'm really sensitive to sound and have synesthesia, and touch-based OCD compulsions as well.

I always have been a generally anxious person, which eventually led to me being depressed, which i then think contributed somewhat to me developing an eating disorder, but again, who really knows which comes first, or if they're all somewhat intertwined in such a way that causation cannot be attributed.",False,True

I struggle with severe depression on top of my ed so like... other than one or two things to pass the time I don't care about anything but food. I also only eat once a day, REALLY late, before I go to bed so I can spend the day thinking about it. If I eat earlier then I get so apathetic there's no point to even being awake.  I think a lot of people can probably relate; however I will say that my ed got bad before the depression and back then while I was super focused on food, I did have other interests, they were just always second to food. I'd say that a more empty feeling other than food is probably related to depression while feeling like food just crowds other interests out is more an eating disorder thing, though obviously I can only speak from my own experience (and also, given how frequent anxiety, depression, and other disorders are comorbid with eating disorders, drawing lines can be arbitrary).  I can't offer advice or support other than commiseration. Like I said, I eat super late- about to start and it's 5 am. I wait this long to avoid being awake when other people are bc I'm too depressed to deal with them. If it helps at all, you're not alone. I'm sorry you are in such a shitty place and I hope you can find validation. It's awful that our perception of eating disorders often leads guys to be left out and even more alone. Your disorder is just as valid as anyone elses.  Hope you can find a better place. I'm 20 too btw so twins :)",False,False
