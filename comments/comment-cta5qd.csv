I would fast all day, break when I got home, and binge after dark, then shower and purge. I got to the point of eating while thinking about the high from the purge and not even noticing the food I was eating. That mental connection and the anticipation of the purge kept me stuck in the cycle because even the discomfort of binging and knowing it was the reason I was putting on weight could be ignored. I kept telling myself ""it's ok, I can get away with it and loose weight so I'm just gonna have...."". It took the shame away.   It took a few tries, but I finally broke the cycle. After a binge I lay in bed, feeling awful, full, fat, and wanting to get it out of me. Instead I just felt it and focused on binging. I was telling myself ""This is what binging does. Not the high after purging. This body is one built by binging and purging. This is not what I wanted"" over and over. When I started binging again I had that visceral image in my head and was more and more able to avoid finishing the binge. It didn't always work. I still purged a few times after, but less and less often. When I still binged and held off purging, I'd strengthen the negative connection instead of the positive post-purge connection.   I do fully feel recovered from binging and purging. But not all my ED components because it's so wonderfully multifaceted -_-. That being said, I think the b/p has the worst and fastest side effects, and getting away from it as soon as possible is your best bet!",False,False
