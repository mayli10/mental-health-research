It's great that you went to the party with your partner and I hope the food tasted good and you enjoyed yourself &lt;3 don't worry about the temporary gain; you don't need to compensate",False,False

Weight fluctuates all of the time depending on many things so I’m quite sure that 600g isn’t fat that you gained.,False,False
