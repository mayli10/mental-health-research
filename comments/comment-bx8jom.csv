That being said, you're entitled to be protected at any weight and regardless of what's going on. But maybe right now is when you need it most because you feel so poorly about yourself. MMB clearly likes you a lot so I'm sure he naturally wants to protect you as well and you deserve it! Let someone be on your side, even if the disordered part of your brain doesn't think you should be protected until you're at X weight.   Learning to love yourself and learning how to be loved might help you work on yourself and in time, achieve goals of having your own place and a steady job. But in the meantime, you're not crazy or unworthy.",False,False

I completely understand wanting to be small and protected so in that regard I don't think you're crazy at all. I genuinely don't get how my boyfriend can put up with my bullshit too so I feel compelled to lose weight to compensate for my flaws because to me, thin = good = worthy of love-despite him saying that he worries that I'm too thin. So in that respect maybe we are both sick in the same way.  Please stay safe though and I hope you guys end up much better than ophelia and hamlet.",False,False
