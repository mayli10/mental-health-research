Many docs, hell most people won't understand eating disorders. Also many people will think you have got just a problem with how do I say it in English. With literally understanding how to eat. I have gotten so many times the explanation that food is good for the body and normal people eat 3 meals and snacks in between. So if I want to beat this eating disorder I should just wat normal. So eat 3 times and be cured. But... Eating disorder isn't a literal disorder where you have forgotten how chewing and such works.     Its just the fact that treating your body as if you love it and not as if it has to be trained like a battered dog.   Many won't get that. Even you and me often will think we are doing good by pushing our bodies.      &amp;nbsp;  I can see why you would feel a bit embarrassed by the tube but it was defo a very visible sign you were working hard on learning to make peace with your body. Your mind and body in balance are so important, esp when you have to work so hard cause you are also a (grad) student. You deserve al the love and strength you can give yourself.    You know what you need, better than most docs. It's why you came to ask for support instead of just spiraling right?",False,False

I hope you're right. In the end I hated the tube but it really helped,  and the main reason it was removed was because I was as embarrassed to start grad school with tubes coming out my nose, but now I wish I wouldn't have rushed it gone at a slower pace. Because this is just intense.",False,True

I went through a really dark couple weeks after this appointment but I am okay. I took your advice and got a new doctor. next appointment is coming up in a few days. I a still furious with this man for putting me back in my progress.   I will not lie- this has me fixating on my fucking weight again.    I haven't done anything bad but I feel like I back slide just THINKING about it. And every little comment about my appearance by other people hurts.   &amp;#x200B;  Ugh.   &amp;#x200B;  &amp;#x200B;  Any ways thank you thank you thank you all. You're the best . :),False,True

Going onto another diet would be incredibly risky to all your work.. This doc clearly doesn't know what he is talking about.   Myself, I was over a healthy bmi for a few years before my body finally adjusted and before it even started evening out.      Would recommend that you do not try to remember a word that guy said. Forget him and his dumb head.    But do try and find a different doctor whom you can talk with.",False,False

If you're in grad school, your university should have a campus dietician. Would you be open to meeting that person and seeing if it's someone you could work with to develop a meal plan that you're comfortable with?

Please don't beat yourself up over it, his ignorance is not your fault. I think you need to try and get a new doctor because that was so unprofessional of him to comment the way he did.

That doctor does not know how to treat ED patients. The language used to discuss our situations is very important. You aren't a failure. You are still working to be healthy. You need to be upfront with the office staff and ask to see another doctor. A physician who doesnt understand how to treat YOU is going to do more harm than good. You are your own best advocate. You can do it.,False,False
