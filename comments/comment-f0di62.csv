Sometimes, as unrealistic as it sounds, I feel like the ""only"" Mom who deals with these things. I worry constantly about being judged and keep a lot of my struggle to myself. My little one demands to be carried at all times, and he's a big boy, so that helps with maintaining a bit of fitness.   Thank you. You helped me feel a little less lonely. &lt;3",False,True

My love for my child outweighs my hatred for myself just a lil bit more, so it makes me work but it isn't easy.   I'm sorry for your experience with your Mother. I had something about the same and it's a huge driver for me to not turn in to her. I imagine it'll be the same for you too &lt;3",False,True

My future children are the only thing that make me want to eat these days. This became a reality for me when I turned 18 a few months ago and realized that I could be trying to be a mother within the next 5 years or so. Hope you are finding the strength you need for your son ❤️",False,False

I'm a mother too and my story is very similar to yours. I had anorexia throughout my teens and early 20's. I was pregnant at 21 and although becoming pregnant motivated me to eat more and I was able to overcome the anorexia by focusing on my unborn child's health... I lost a lot of weight through morning sickness in the first trimester, then proceeded to gain weight further on in my pregnancy. I then lost so much post-natal (probably through breastfeeding and not making time to eat) that I was at my lowest weight ever by 10 months postpartum.  I had my son 7 years ago. When I stopped breastfeeding I began gaining again and I've struggled with bulimia since.   I don't have much in the way of advice for you I'm afraid, since I'm struggling myself and I have many of the same conflicting emotions around weight, my eating disorder and striving to be a healthy mother.   Tracking my intake on MFP, swimming 5 days a week, having an active job and walking at least 10,000 steps a day is how I try to keep myself on track. But if you're kid's not school age then it's hard getting that time to exercise.   Anyway, I wanted to let you know that you're not as alone as you might think and that perhaps sharing some of my story might help you. x",False,False
