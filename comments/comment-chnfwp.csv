That’s such a crazy-making cycle to be in!!!  As for recovery though- It’s totally possible. But you might need to ask for help! Recovery on your own can be really challenging. You might still have an ED mindset even when you’re “eating healthy and exercising”. In a lot of recovery programs eating healthy and exercising isn’t actually recommended! There’s a period of time where you just need to regain a neutral relationship to food and exercise. Including giving yourself permission to eat junk and not exercise at all.   Therapy, an outpatient program, a family member who can encourage and monitor you. Something besides relying solely on your own judgement.   Recovery is worth it. Having a normal life again and a healthy relationship with your body is so worth it.",False,False
