Both of them have lost a lot of weight after being healthy sized children. Honestly, I feel like my parents/environment caused them to feel the need to lose weight. My parents always comment on our eating habits and appearance, so I think anybody would become uncomfortable with their self image. For example, my youngest sister has a pretty healthy appetite, which is great since she is at the growing age. But whenever she eats all of the food on her plate, my mom always says something like wow your eating a lot. I notice that my sister immediately stops eating and says she's full when she clearly is not. I always try to feed her and let her know that the amount she is eating is not that much and that she should eat more if she wants to.   I guess my only suggestion is to try and encourage and treat your sisters better than other people did for you. Sorry for the long post, but I really hope you don't blame yourself for anything.",False,False
