My old place had no working elevator and 5 flights of stairs to get to my room. I fell *up* stairs and bruised my knees almost every day. And going down I had to have a death grip on the hand rail. Sometimes id have to sit halfway up and eat a couple almonds. Or even lay down sideways to let the blood come back to my brain.       I was given a tip by a pilot that helps with a sudden drop in blood pressure - clench/tense every muscle you can in your legs, arms and core whenever you stand up - it stops the blood rushing away from your head so fast and raises blood pressure - useful in extreme gravity changes when flying and also ... eating disorders. It's saved me from fainting several times. I think it called the Applied Tension Technique. It's probably common knowledge but totally blew my mind when I heard it.",False,False
