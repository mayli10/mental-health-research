My mom intrudcuded me to all the fad diets. Fasting, juice cleanses, paleo diet, she was always hip to new trends like Splenda etc. She never has had any female friends so she always turned to me as her ‚Äúbest friend‚Äù even though as a typical teenager I ‚Äúhated her‚Äù. She knew people at the local Y and somehow got them to let me have a membership when I was 13 when I believe the rule was 15+ to use the upstairs equipment.  She never questioned why I would go on runs before school (5am) and then go to the gym with her after school. I never ate breakfast and when I wasn‚Äôt on a diet I would pack very minimal lunches.   There were mornings where I would try on almost every article of clothing I owned and sob because I didn‚Äôt feel like I looked good in anything so she would just let me stay home from school. I cared so much about my appearance I would spend maybe an hour and a half every morning making sure I looked and felt okay about my hair, make up, and clothes. I would say more than your average teen. It didn‚Äôt matter if I was up late the night before doing homework I was up the same time the next morning dead tired because I had to have enough time to get ready and if I didn‚Äôt I would ask her to write me a late note or not go to school at all.  I vividly remember telling her in elementary school that I thought my legs looked fat when I sat down and she said to not say things like that.  None of this screamed ED. I started running track my sophomore year of HS and I fainted two different times and still no concern. Durning my teen years I weighed about 95-100 lbs (5‚Äô2).",False,False

My mom told me about a book she read where the main characters daughter died of e-coli from a burger and from then on (and tbh still now) I grew absolutely *terrified* of eating meat. So I stopped eating it completely. I wouldn‚Äôt even eat food that touched it or was cooked on the same surface.   And then I realized other foods could get me sick, too. Fruits and veggies could be contaminated from manure, bread could carry a mold that causes a flesh eating virus, cheese could give you such massive food poisoning you‚Äôd mess yourself in the shower.  So I stopped eating altogether unless I was forced to. And that kind of... stuck in the back of my head. Eventually my mom got me to start eating again (she threatened me to take me in to get me tubed and would sit with me for hours waiting for me to eat), but it‚Äôs like that damage was done. The fear of food was planted in my head.   Then a couple of years later, high school happened! And I had one (1) negative comment when I was a freshman and feeling nice in a cute skirt.
