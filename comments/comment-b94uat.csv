The first one, I was in high school and didn’t really know what I was doing anyway. I was trying to live off of 300 calories a day of turkey breast and raw carrots and celery and basically just broke down and went back to “normal.”  When I was 20, I had a long-distance boyfriend move back to my city and he encouraged healthy habits. He was a personal trainer and I couldn’t really be disordered around him.   This last time started when I realized I was close to my lowest adult weight and was like “hey I wonder how low I could push it”. It got very low. Then I started bingeing which I’ve never done before which pushed the relapse spiral even farther.   Getting rid of scales helps, being around understanding people helps, and buying roomy clothes that are forgiving helps. That last one is the most important. The second time, recovering wasn’t such a big deal because all my clothes still fit. I was stupid this time and only bought right clothes and now only like 1/3 of them fit and it’s making the relapse way worse. ",False,False

And did different things trigger relapses each time?  I’m sorry you’ve relapsed and I hope you’re holding up ,False,True

Currently relapsed to all hell. However, both previous times I went for years in between. First one was when I was 17, then 20, then 25. I’m 26 now, been in the muck for the last full year (March 24 was the anniversary, fml) ",False,False
