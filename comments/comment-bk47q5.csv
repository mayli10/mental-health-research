I suspect it’s just kinda difficult to build muscle while at a large caloric deficit (hence the weight lifting bros doing their bulk/cut cycles).  For electrolytes I go with Himalayan pink salt for sodium, nu-salt for potassium, natural calm for magnesium and calcium. It’s still kinda surprising to me how much I need (apparently the sodium is pretty critical). I really enjoy powerade zero, but it offers relatively minimal electrolytes (like, 1/10 or less of what I need). I was worried the sodium intake would make me feel bloated, but thus far it’s only made me feel soooo much better mentally and physically.  I hope you’ll find a routine that feels better! Pole dancing sounds pretty cool - a guy I went to school with does it for fitness and seems to love it.",False,False

It is collagen protein, so even when I was anaemic, I still had really great hair and nails. But most importantly: NO delayed onset muscle soreness (DOMS). Oh, and the powder is only 55 calories a serve and is sweetened with stevia.   I do IF and my only intake until dinner is a latte and I have protein shake in a smoothie with some frozen banana. The other product of theirs I recommend is their multifood. They’re pricey, but really worth it.  My trainer recommend their vegan aminos powder but I haven’t tried it yet, so can’t speak for it.",False,False
