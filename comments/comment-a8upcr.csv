Eating slowly gives you more chances to realise you're full and satisfied and don't need to eat any more. Everything tastes yummier when you can savour it too. I'm gonna keep practicing! I try putting my fork down with each mouthful, chewing until the food is basically liquid, then not picking up the fork until I've swallowed ",False,False

Eating too quickly doesn't let your stomach create the required acidity for digestion. As a result, your body will counter this by raising the acid level in your stomach, usually creating pain and burning sensations",False,False

Dude that’s a fucking lifetime of just chewing food.  So now I just keep the plate as far away as I can so it’s more effort to eat.

I have this thing where i feel like I have to eat my food as quick as possible, to ""get rid of it"". I guess it comes from years of bulimia/BED.
