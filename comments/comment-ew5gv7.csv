When im at work i can sit at my desk and just have to deal with the food thoughts but have no food to eat in the building or nearby. But all weekend at home all i can do is make myself snacks and cook and order seamless and take a trip to the dollar store to stock up on binge foods i said id never have again. I keep a yearly habit tracker on my wall and on it i mark the day in green or red if i stuck to my diet or not. And the weekends are always red. Fuck food i hate it.,False,False
