Avoid foods that cause you anxiety or make you want to binge and try not feeling like you need to restrict any certain food groups (also try and add things you like to your meals!) and slowly you‚Äôll lose the feeling that you need to binge. Things that also helped me where going to the nutritionist (to re learn how to eat), psychologist, journaling and medication.  I hope you ask for help and find something that works for you, Im sorry if this is not helpful, its just my personal experience. Good luck ‚ù§Ô∏è",False,False
