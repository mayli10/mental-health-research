I always say to my neighbors, ""keep the new Chinese Dream alive! (whatever it means since their is no true definition provided by the central government) It sounds great anyway.",False,False

She always guessed my size, so she would get me L or XL, when I was a chubby 6 year old. My skirts were always way too big for me and she still always bought the larger sizes.",False,False

I *do* need a small after all, would you mind fetching me the small size please???"" in an exasperated voice.

Based on your description we also have a very similar build. My sister has always been the ""thin"" one and I've always been considered, compared to her, the ""fatter"" (not fat, but fatter) one. Even though she's gained weight through puberty and I've lost weight (we have basically the same body now), I am still the ""fat"" one in every way.  Also my mom is Korean so I kind of get that part of it too (her saying ""Maybe they just don't have sizes for *athletic* girls"" or ""No you're too big for a small"" and other comments like that).  Hope everything turns out ok :') Thank you for sharing",False,False
