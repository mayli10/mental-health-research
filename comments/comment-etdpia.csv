Before my eating disorder even appeared in the distance, I NEVER GAVE A DAMN HOW PEOPLE LOOKED OR WHAT THEY ATE OR WHAT THEY DID GENERALLY. Now that I'm chilling with my ED, I hate myself soooo much, because I make these thoughts subconsciously...And punish myself for them...Because I'm of the people who understand the struggle and the bullying that comes with being fat...And obsessing over diets...",False,False

When I have a passing unkind or uncharitable thought I try to mentally tell myself, no, and replace it with a kind thought about the person or situation.    I'm not sure if it's working to retrain my brain but I feel better for recognising the thought and consciously rebuffing it. Cause I don't want to think of myself as an unkind person. I think sometimes the self loathing just overflow onto others.",False,False

This eds made me a judgmental bitch because every girl w bigger legs than me is fat and anyone with smaller is a bitch i wanna be. My obsession w my weight has completely bled into everything and now im highkey fatphobic. Binge watching supersize vs superskinny and my 600lb life and only human videos are crack and it sucks.

One of my colleagues is obese and comes to work with Dunkin donuts breakfast and drink, then typically has pizza and a side for lunch or a leftover Olive Garden meal, right after lunch gets a couple full sized candy bars, then will have another snack before leaving work. I feel so bad because in my mind I judge her and I shouldn't. She obviously is comfortable with herself and her choices and I shouldn't have any thought on them. I struggle because seeing her eat so much makes me paranoid about how much I am eating and then I have a hard time eating anything at all.
