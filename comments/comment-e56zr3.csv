I think some dieting ""tips"" that get passed around are covertly disordered, but I don't think OMAD is one of them. If people are making a conscious decision to overlook hunger because it's easy enough for them, then choosing to eat their daily caloric limit in one sitting, I can see a lot of them being able to transition back to normal eating once they hit maintenance (if they want to). Some people basically OMAD just out of habit/by nature, like if they skip breakfast then work through lunch. They're not doing it because they're trying to punish themselves or restrict dangerously below their TDEE, it just works best for how they handle hunger pangs.  Then again, maybe that IS disordered, just a different \~flavour\~ ðŸ¤·",False,False

For me it absolutely links up with my disordered tendencies, and I have a hard time imagining any other reality than that. But there seem to be people for whom thatâ€™s not the case - even people doing it at/near maintenance.   I compare it to...having 2 or 3 drinks can be totally fine for some people and totally dangerous for me (an alcoholic). They can take it of leave it. I canâ€™t. Iâ€™ll obsess and plan and crave until kingdom come. Similar stuff to how various ways of eating flip that ED switch in my brain.",False,False
