I would love to hear what you have to say about those 10+ years you consider â€˜recoveredâ€™ vs. the before and after that you \*donâ€™t\* consider â€™recoveredâ€™, if you donâ€™t mind sharing. How do you define it, what are some differences you felt/feel? How did you live your life in those 10 years - for instance did you live without too much thought towards food, or did you spend time doing food-related activities in a healthy way (like cook a lot, trying different recipes, blogging or something)?",False,True

While I suffered from other mental issues more deeply in the past, I think I forgot give them enough weight as time went on and those issues specifically improved and my memory faded a bit - this led me to become very frustrated with the ED aspects of my mental burdens because I thought I was so much â€˜betterâ€™/.  I had been thinking about that just before I posted this question, and your response makes feel more validated in the thoughts that I so often canâ€™t trust, I suppose ðŸ˜….  I am also grateful that you shared your experience with me.   Do you ever look at resources online to help with everything, like both professionals and people who talk about their recovery or that they \*are\* recovered, on YouTube? Other books, podcasts, etc.?",False,True

If you feel like it, I would love to hear some of the â€˜toolsâ€™ you learned, and perhaps especially the changes you felt upon completing treatment.   What about the other people you met in treatment? Do you know how their paths went?",False,True

I hope to be able to say that again at some point.    Even if someone has really normal eating habits now, you canâ€™t look at someone and tell if they have always had normal eating habits or if theyâ€™ve been disordered at some point",False,False

Like other addictions, there are different stages of recovery for EDs: precontemplation of recovery, contemplation, preparation, action, and advanced/maintaining recovery. A key thing about the stages is that you can go back and forth among the stages.  But to answer your question lol... I don't know. I'm weight restored from when I had AN. I'm physically recovered: I'm about 35 pounds heavier than at my LW 10 years ago, and I get regular periods again. However, mentally, I'd say I'm in the contemplation stage. I think about how much better my life would be, how much more time and mental energy I'd have, if I didn't waste time on counting calories and self-loathing. But the thought of trying stuff like not counting calories and intuitive eating terrifies me. Having my ED feels safe, I just try not to let it run my life  TL;DR: idk",False,False

This will always be a part of me.   I went through intense treatment and was eventually considered ""recovered,"" but it's always there deep down. Perhaps recovery teaches us how to replace ED thoughts &amp; behaviors with healthy and sustainable ones, and shows us how to cope with emotions without turning to food or lack thereof. Recovery gave me great tools and taught me a lot about the ""why"" of my disorder, as well as giving me the ""how"" to regulate my ED tendencies.   Maybe for some, full recovery is possible. For me, my ED oscillates in conjunction with what's going on in my life. I hope one day I can be the most level of recovered possible, and I salute those who have made full recovery!   Love to all...",False,False
