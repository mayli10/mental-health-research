Some lack the patience to give the time to understand what you have been through. Some would love you, but they can’t love themselves. Most people are too scared to love. They lust after people and seek company in people, but they never love that person. It’s just another port in their stormy life.   Love is as complex as the EDs we post about on these boards.   Anorexia is like a plan you made before a job interview, a big event or an intimidating experience. You have thought it through, your confident what you want, and you’re not intimidated by the situation. You put the plan into action. Suddenly like little threads it starts to unravel. You forget everything else and try to catch the thread. Losing all sense of proportion or scale in your life. Like you said above “anorexia just warps my thoughts and starving myself won't fix a single thing about my life.”  Unburden yourself worthlessstatue, these are complex things. I have struggled with it a long time. Things do get better and you do get better at controlling the confusing.",False,False
