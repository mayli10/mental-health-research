They are trained to handle mental health issues and this bitch ignoring your issues is messed up. ,False,False

I'm at college as well and struggling with a bad living situation, people knowing about my ED, people being weird about it, etc.  I'm so sorry you're dealing with this and I hope you can get some space to breathe and reevaluate.  I hope it gets easier.",False,False
