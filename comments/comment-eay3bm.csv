I also forget to inject a lot (i have a shit memory) so my a1c has been really high as well.... and YES i plan out my meals and meet my calorie limit but when my sugar is low i gotta eat/drink like 200 cals of sugar and it makes me so mad. I work an active job and lift heavy at the work and the gym as well so its easy for my sugars to drop suddenly gahh,False,True

I feel like under eating causes my hormones to go bananas, which makes my blood sugar harder to control. My last A1C was 6.9 so I’m doing fairly well and my dr was happy but it’s been lower in the past. I’m not nearly as severe with an ED as some. I normally eat 1100-1200 cals daily but I am a runner so I should be eating more. But I also struggle with binging after restricting for a while and then my blood sugar goes crazy. It’s tough.   The worst is when I’m at my calorie limit for the day and all is good, but then my blood sugar gets low and I have to over eat. Happens so often.",False,False

I'm not a type one but I know 2 that are. Both have disordered eating. Please whatever you do dont mess around with your insulin. That's dangerous and though ED's can cause long term health issues playing with insulin makes it 100x worse.,False,False
