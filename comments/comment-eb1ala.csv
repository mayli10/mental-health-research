I feel like as long as I am being responsible about my drinking (not too much in one night and not too often in a month) then it’s no harm and pretty insignificant overall. :)   I probably only drink about 1x a month though and I’ll just have a pint of beer and then some kind of monstrosity of an appetizer at a restaurant.   If you go out more often than that, maybe have a salad and a meal before so you don’t order food with it?:)",False,False

But you’re right about it being a huge part of so many social activities.   My wife and I have found that we can minimize the harm by strictly sticking to no more than 1 drink per hour for me and one drink per 80-90 minutes for her. The difference between sticking to those limits vs going over those limits even just a little bit is HUGE.   Pacing your drinking like that can be hard in social situations. One trick I’ve learned is to always keep a glass in your hand even if it’s empty because you’ll look like you still have a drink and don’t need another one yet.",False,False
