And maybe you won’t believe what I’m going to say because it’s hard to see through. But the right partner will not think this. A perfect partner is hard to find but a good person is one who loves you for you.  I thought I would always be alone. I found my partner after a lot of trauma. I was underweight when we met, I became overweight in our relationship, I am almost underweight again now and not once has this ever changed how he feels about me. It has been ten years now. Ten years I never dreamed I would ever have.   If the guys you like don’t see you for your amazing qualities then they aren’t worth your affection. If you lose weight and they take interest they are not right for you. (Or even good people) They will only see your body not your true self.   I can’t take away the thoughts behind this but I can tell you there are good people out there who will treat you how you deserve. Love every part of you. Don’t go chasing a guy who will only love you for your body. Find a guy who loves your body and soul!! Nourish each other with affection not idealism!!   And don’t feel like you have to be the perfect partner. Perfection in relationships doesn’t happen. Just be the best you can be with compassion.  Most importantly you come first, don’t change yourself for someone else. You ARE beautiful!!",False,False
