Is def doable to do 25 in 2 months.  Although I’ve been severely restricting to like less than ~600 a day with some exceptions some days (going either higher or lower).  I wouldn’t recommend this as I feel so dreadfully sick that I’m going to a facility to get help next week, but doesn’t mean is impossible",False,False

If you peruse other certain subreddits you might have come across the term snake dieting. It’s where I got my recipe for the electrolyte mix from - I think they call it “snake juice”.   1 L Water  1 tsp no salt (potassium chloride) 1 tsp pink Himalayan salt  Optional: 1 tsp baking soda.  It would cost around $6 for everything on the list unless you get a boujee pink salt that costs $10. The most expensive part is the no salt which is about $4.   By theory, you should drink about 1 L of this for every 1 L of regular water you drink on fasting days.",False,False

I can’t remember what they all were but there’s powder forms or tablets you can add to your water! The Nuun ones are good! Go to a grocery store or local health food/supplement store and look!

I know what it’s like to be there (I went from AN to BED 0/10, do not recommend) and it can be hard to not get fixated on. Just take a breath, and one day at a time.

Probably a good portion is water weight which will be gone quickly, as someone else mentioned! I like using losertown, it’s given me pretty accurate projections previously!
