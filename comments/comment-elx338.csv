Light walks are fine, but nothing beyond that.   I remember when I first discovered r/fasting, I was so inspired by people who did 28-day fasts that I bought a bunch of electrolyte salts and was determined to pull an extended fast. Legit passed out multiple times after barely two days because, well ... my big brain didn't put 2 &amp; 2 together and was taking HIIT classes + not eating + being underweight to begin with.",False,False

And fasting after eating (beyond your caloric needs) keto is much easier than one thinks - blood sugar levels are stable, there is less hunger etc. And after fuelling sufficiently (2000-3000 calories?) on fatty foods, my experience has been that the body is so satiated it genuinely doesn’t want to eat for multiple days afterward.  People with BN tend to fast after a binge, which tends to be laden with foods rich in simple carbohydrates - this causes your insulin levels to spike and your body isn’t going to be happy with trying to regulate blood sugar roller coasters when it’s bad to process a massive whammy of sugar the night before.   People with AN tend to go on prolonged fasts during/after a period of severe caloric restriction. There is barely any nourishment that the body can draw from, both internally and externally, so it would naturally be harder to cope with a physical stressor like fasting (yes, fasting is a stressor, not always a bad one, but a stressor nonetheless).   And not to mention the mental and psychological anguish that ED sufferers go through - about how fasting is used to control weight and “correct” binges... and ED sufferers already think of food constantly anyway, and depriving it of the one thing they think about constantly is only going to feed those demons.  Non-ED sufferers who fast for spirituality/religion/general health just don’t .... think of food that much. They go about their normal days, recognise hunger cues when they come (but the more stoic among them “take pleasure” in them somehow) but otherwise see fasting as much of a non-issue as waiting for the traffic lights then green.   I have very mixed feelings about fasting. On one hand,I am excited about the emerging science behind autophagy and agree that humans aren’t biologically programmed to eat 24/7. I have also seen how “normal eaters” fast and how much of a non-issue it is for them. But I have a history of disordered eating (though am in recovery now) and just don’t see extended fasting as that much of a healthy tool for me personally at the moment,",False,False

They have their methods of building up their fasting lengths. Also a lot of them fully nourish themselves, their bodies are healthy and therefore it's much easier to forgo food for x amount of days. Also they're mode ""educated"" cause they love to point to all the dude bro science. This means they know what to supplement with to prevent headaches and minimize nausea (salt potassium no salt whatever theirs a whole concoction witches brew these guys make). Dont feel bad that you aren't able to fast for long stretches of time. The modern human body is not meant to do that, also you have an eating disorder so your body is likely already not to happy about the current state of malnourishment.",False,False
