I was a prolific internet nude/men‚Äôs magazine model for years in a desperate attempt for validation and self-esteem, so I have thousands of photos of myself in various states of undress to scrutinize; I have photos from the same shoot where I look thick in some and borderline bonespo in others depending on the angle. When taking body check photos, I use the same angles so that I can more accurately detect changes in my body which helps, but I still don‚Äôt really know how I look to other people and my own opinion of my body can shift from hour to hour.   I have a super strong prescription and everything (including me) looks smaller when I‚Äôm wearing glasses rather than contacts... sometimes I think that my husband only sees me as thin because he wears glasses too, lol.",False,False

I hate pictures simply because i look fat in them, i mean because i AM fat but like isnt that BDD itself? but i've grown more accustomed to pictures as i've lost some weight. Like looking at pictures of me last year and now? it's crazy.  2. I wear glasses but i never tried that? like it never crossed my mind that i may look thinner? like i've looked in the mirror with and without my glasses unconsciously and apparently saw no difference i guess, i'd notice it",False,False

I feel like I react worse and disassociate more from my appearance in those vs a mirror. Which is probably insane, because when I look at my body without photos or mirrors, it somehow looks worse than the other 2. Idfk. Glasses though. Without them I'm basically fucking blind haha. I can be standing a foot (we've measured) in front of a body length mirror and see my skin color and a basic fuzzy shape. Like the physical representation of static electricity kinda, which makes my shape appear bigger than it technically is. I may be too crazy and blind for this question üòÇ.",False,False
