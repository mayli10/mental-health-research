I luckily didn't suffer any injuries, but I cut back on the running because it became overwhelming (relating to anxiety). I have developed anxiety though but I'm learning to manage it",False,True

I've never had much muscle to work with. I know regaining your period takes time, but since my experience with disordered eating was such a short stint, will it really potentially take years (I don't know your history, for example, that caused you to lose yours for 4 years) for it to come back? Do you know why a female's period would fail to ever return?",False,True

Sometimes it takes a while to reverse amenorrhea, especially with the amount that you're exercising. I didn't get my period back until about four years after weight restoring. Also, periods are affected by how much of your body composition is fat versus muscle. Look up the Female Athlete Triad. I'm not a medical professional, so talk to a doctor!!",False,False

It sounds like you could be in the area of adrenal fatigue too. You were working your body very hard and not giving it the nutrients it needs to maintain that kind of workout routine. I hope you’re okay ❤️,False,False
