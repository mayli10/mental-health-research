I avoid grains, sugar and added fat. Fear foods are things like pastry and full fat dairy. (Butter? What's that?) Liquid calories that aren't alcohol are the devil.   Weekdays:-   Breakfast is either instant oats made with water or berries and yoghurt.   Lunch is an energy drink or coffee with a bit of milk.   Dinner is...Too often something with shirataki noodles. Always some veg, often some protein (welfare-assured meat, quorn, tofu). I get through a lot of condiments. I always cook from scratch, thankfully I live alone!  On Saturdays I hang out with my parents and get drunk but thankfully they eat quite healthy so I can handle that at the moment.",False,False

On a good day I fast for 20-22 hours and give myself a maximum 30min-1 hour eating period where I'd have one main dish like oatmeal, cereal, eggs w/ toast or miso and rice, some fruit or salad. I try to stick to a vegetarian/sometimes vegan diet and mostly gluten free if I can help it.   I only drink water, lots of hot water and herbal tea.  No coffee for me because caffeine makes me nauseated as heck. I take daily probiotics in powdered form and it really helps me not to retain water and because I have a really sensitive stomach and it helps my digestion a bunch.  Unfortunately I spent most of October in a stupid state of binging and I'm really hoping it get back on track when I go home from school this Friday.",False,False

I don‚Äôt really eat breakfast, if I do it‚Äôs mostly fruit or a very small amount of eggs. I always have coffee in the morning. Lunch is one scoop each of raw, plain broccoli and plain tofu and 1/2 to 1 scoop of plain white rice sometimes with some soy sauce or black pepper (I eat at my college‚Äôs dining commons which is great bc they list all the breakdown for every single food item) and sometimes I‚Äôll eat another side of veggies, raw veggies a small thing of hummus, or quinoa/bean salad, etc. It depends on what‚Äôs offered. I‚Äôll usually have Vitaminwater zero with it and more coffee. Dinner is whatever I take from the dining common so a couple pieces of plain polenta, or plain black beans, or more broccoli/tofu. My safe foods are raw, plain veggies and fruit, plain rice or quinoa once a day is fine, a couple pieces plain tofu, hummus, dates and prunes. I try to make sure I get some protein and a little bit of oil in a day bc it keeps me feeling not hungry longer.",False,False
