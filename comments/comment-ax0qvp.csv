SO HELP MEâ€¦**  *Disclaimer: Since my quoted ""Accountability Post"" (this is 8Days or so later) I've posted on r/Fastient about that impressive Fasting-Tracking App, and I've commented here &amp; there at random, on other Redditors' assorted postsâ€¦*  **But THIS is my official** ***""next anything up on Reddit!""*** **AFAICâ€¦**  And I'm happy to declareâ€¦ ***victory.*** Over my raging appetite, over gluttony, over food! This past week, I've fasted for 96hrs and 68Hrs, each time broken when I caved and ate 1500Cals of mostly scrambled eggs inside a 1Hr-window, only to resume an extended fast again immediately â€” right now I've hit 15Hrs into my latest fastâ€¦ and I'm happy as a clam. My bp (just checked, at 3:30am) is 126/74, with a resting pulse of 42bpmâ€¦ that's the pulse-rate of an elite athlete, which I am *not,* but it's my normal, as a [male aged 61yrsâ€¦](https://imgur.com/j0zguij) And my weight is in the single-digits *above* my ideal, but it's *dropping,* with my current bmi below 21â€¦ These [Peloton Trainers](https://imgur.com/owueTeH) just popped up on my Reddit sidebar, and they all look half my age, but sincerely I don't feel any of  'em have got anything on meâ€¦  *So. Why shouldn't I be happy?* And if I seem to be bragging, please forgive me, but I've lived in misery the past 2yrs feeling like a shackled slave to Demon Food, locked in a daily, endless battle with that foe, a battle I've chronicled exhaustively here on Redditâ€¦ But this morning, I'm at peace. My war with food, amazingly, *somehow,* this past week has abated. Honestly, it feels *GONE â€”* I've acquired a serenity about food. My appetite is alive, but it isn't obsessing me, nor do I feel like a glutton chomping at the bit to get at food. **Food is not the boss of me.**  ***That's all, folks. Rant, Rave, or whatever this lil spiel is, OVER.*** **I just hope for anyone feeling as battered and beaten by FOOD as I've felt to know that victory is possible, and it can arrive out of the clear blue. So don't quit! Fight on, and you WILL win.**",False,True
