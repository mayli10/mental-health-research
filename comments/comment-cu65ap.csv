Food is my biggest addiction, but it's not like I can stop eating like you would do with drugs or alcohol because we all need food to survive, so I don't see a way out. For me food is just a drug to get by and numb the pain away for a bit. It sucks, I know.  Sending hugs. â™¡",False,False

I understand what you're going through completely. When I got pregnant a switch went off in my brain and I went from restriction mode to binge mode and I literally felt like an alcoholic reaching for the bottle at every single meal. Please have some love and forgiveness for yourself and try to separate from the disease. Maybe reach out to some OA meetings or if you can give therapy a go. Don't beat yourself up over the weight gain. It's not permanent and it's only a symptom.,False,False
