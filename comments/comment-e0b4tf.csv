I almost died from low potassium levels, and I had zero symptoms. I felt completely fine, and my doctor called me in a panic telling me to go to the ER immediately after my blood test results came back. Now I take potassium and magnesium supplements everyday, no questions. I also drink pedialyte if things are getting particularly bad.",False,False

Specifically ones with artificial colors. It's easy to throw up, and with a color you can easily tell when it's all out (ie - when you drank a shamrock shake , you can gage it by how green your puke is)  \+ Alcohol can burn just as much as spicy food. I'm fairly good at restricting on normal days, but drunk me loves food, so I will often make myself purge after that. It can be really acid and awful.   \+ I'm sure you all know this, but look up menus. I've purged a lot after going out to eat, and a lot of it could have been saved if I would have known the menu. I can eat large / high - calorie meals, I just need to know before hand so I can shift the rest of my day.   \+ I know it can be impulsive, but before you purge but I beverage (ie - a glass of water, gatorade zero (or not zero, props to you if you're getting past drinks with calories)) in the fridge and have warm clothes on your bed. After purging you'll thank yourself.  \+If you purge by vomiting, space yourself out. If you do it 1x a day or more your body will physically stop you.   Anyway, this disorder sucks. I'm so sorry you all deal with it. But if you do purge, please try to be as safe and gentle with your body as possible.",False,False
