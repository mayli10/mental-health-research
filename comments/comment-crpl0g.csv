People always reacted ""surprised"" by my weight, which just made me feel more self conscious about it rather than less trusting in weight as an indicator.  Thanks for your perspective!",False,True

I am not “little” in frame (regardless of weight) and so combined with my weight + slightly above-average height, I always feel just *big*. The women in my family (including the very thin ones) tend to weight far more than how they appear so weight for me doesn’t feel like a “true” indicator.",False,False

Just curious- are you shorter or taller?   I think part of it is because I feel invalidated because my weight isn't necessarily low for a woman, but it is for someone my height",False,True
