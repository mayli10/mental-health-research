Usually when I'm on the tail end of coming out of it. I'm still not logging properly yet but I'm not stuffing my face as much as I used to. I'll get to the point where I'm opening MFP trying to pull myself out like ""Huh, it's lunchtime already and I haven't eaten anything really... what did I even eat today... OH I had some crisps. Well that wasn't much- oh, I also had a bowl of cereal. Well, it was kind of small- holy shit and I had that muffin? And that full-sugar bubble tea? And that sandwich!? WHY DON'T I REMEMBER EATING ANY OF THAT??""  To be honest it's kind of horrifying. Like... I consumed all those calories and I don't even REMEMBER them, but my body does. I won't say I always prefer restriction but I do prefer being aware of what I eat and being accountable for everything I put in my body.",False,False
