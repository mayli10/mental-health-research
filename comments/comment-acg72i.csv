I hate trying to take photos, cause usually the longer someone takes photos for the better they turn out, but with me its the opposite. Like the longer the cameras on for, the worse I look. At some points I know its just because my subtle body language is setting it off cause Im slowly getting more tired of looking at myself, but it still sucks :/",False,True

I go through the same every day and it makes me feel legitimately crazy. Sometimes I‚Äôll see a photo of me or something and like it, but 5 mins later I look again and I look like a fat deformed monster. ",False,False

It tells me in really fat. The scale says I‚Äôm losing weight but the mirror says I‚Äôm gaining.   I know I have Body Dysmorphia. I just really wish I didn‚Äôt. People tell me I look nice but I don‚Äôt believe them because ‚Äúthey are only saying it to be nice‚Äù  I‚Äôve looked back at photos of younger &amp; healthier me and I thought I was fat in those times but no I looked good and I looked healthy.   In short I wonder what I ACTUALLY look like to other people. ,False,False

I just weigh and measure myself, and trust that over what I see in the mirror. I've been trying to work on it by looking in the mirror first, and trying to predict if the scale/tape will be a little higher or lower that day (I'm lean enough that a few pounds of water will show).   Also, pictures help. For some reason, I see things more consistently in pictures than in the mirror. ",False,False
