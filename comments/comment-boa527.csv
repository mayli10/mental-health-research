In the US if a restaurant has more than 20 locations (so pretty much all chains) its required for them to have posted calorie content as well as the macronutrients and serving sizes. Usually the menu only has the calories, but you can ask your server for the nutrition handout, and if they don't have it (which they should) it's all online!  &amp;#x200B;  I freakin love Golden Corral because its a buffet but they have all the calories above the foods w/ the serving sizes.",False,False
