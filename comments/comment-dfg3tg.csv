I reversed the calorie counting by matching my diet to people of similar size. I asked my friend for a list of what she typically ate in a day and when I was at home, I would eat the same things as my mum and have her portion for me what she would have herself.  now that i'm living alone at uni, I force myself to eat one meal where I don't know the calories of food I that I actually wanted to eat. every consecutive day is easier but the voice hasn't gone away yet. the desire to restrict is less though because I can't bring myself to go back to being hungry and tired all the time. (I fasted only once in my life for 36 hours and I was lying in bed feeling like my soul has gone elsewhere)  you don't need to wait until you're dying to start recover. normal people don't have those ""oh my God I gotta get help"" days at all",False,False
