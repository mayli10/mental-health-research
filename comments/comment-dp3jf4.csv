Lacking the weight and food stigma that we humans have though, I'm guessing they would stop those behaviors entirely as soon as their food stops being restricted by external factors",False,False

I don't think it was exactly like the human symptoms though), but I'm not sure there's any animal quite self-aware enough to be aware of the concept of 'fat' or experience dysmorphia or to recognise cause-and-effect to that extent. If any animal did it would probably be apes, but I think most non-human animals still have a much stronger 'eat to survive' instinct.   I imagine the dog is underweight and not eating because of either physical health reasons or something like anxiety and your classmates don't quite understand that an ED is a mental illness rather than just a physical one.",False,False

They dony really have a concept of consrquences like we do- they eat things without the ability to think About how it will affect them afterwards,False,False

An older and much less frequently used meaning is simply ‘loss of appetite/not eating’. I’ve seen this meaning used pretty exclusively to refer to symptoms of physical illness or side effects medications. And yeah, I’ve had papers from the veterinarian that tell me to watch for this in my doggo after a procedure. (Always good for a wry chuckle.)",False,False
