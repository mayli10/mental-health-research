And even if you were, there's nothing wrong with the sixties. Try to remember what you've gained in your life during your six months of recovery.  There are so many positives of being a weight that your body wants to be at: - being warm! - getting your bone health back - being fertile - not being constipated - having energy to care about other things and to engage with other people! - feeling more emotions rather than constant stress and anxiety over eating  and calories   You've got this. You're stronger than your ED ðŸ’•",False,False

That number only measures your weight, not ever does it measure your worth. It doesn't measure if you're kind, generous, a good friend, have a good heart, think of other people and all the other things that make us human.  We are more than our weight, and we are enough. Always.  Please don't believe the lies your ed tells you, don't let it trick you into restricting again.   You are very strong to be able to gain weight on your own, but there is no shame in getting help if you need it.",False,False
