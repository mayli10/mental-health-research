It took quite a few weeks until I was genuinely feeling hungry for food again. I still struggle with feeling hungry sometimes, especially when I’ve been restricting it messes it up. I’m not way recovered or weight restored but eating more regularly and properly for long enough does bring back hunger if you were wondering :)",False,False

I just get caught up in thinking about how I know that logically I should be eating except I don't want to. The physical feeling of hunger just isn't there to motivate me to eat. All I really get are the side effects of starving yourself like lightheadedness and feeling sleepy all the time.,False,False

The stupidest part is when you can't tell the difference between ""stomach empty, hungry"" and ""stomach hurting because ate too much"" so you just eat more, in case. lol.",False,False
