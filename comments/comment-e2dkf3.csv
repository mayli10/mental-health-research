She's one of those people who think it's a good thing to always be honest about everything which means that she always just blurts out whatever she wants without thinking about how it makes the other person feel. She did kinda realise the impact it had on me though, because during our break there was cake and I didn't eat it and she said 'don't listen to what I say, just eat the cake if you want to' but the truth is I don't want to anymore. My motivation for restricting is stronger than ever now :( super sad how one comment from another person can have such an impact",False,True

Itâ€™s horrible how often humans say dumb and hurtful stuff. What that person said sounded rude, both ignorant *and* judgmental (a common combo sadly), and also deeply flawed for assuming the 5% of someoneâ€™s life they can see is representative of the other 95%.    Iâ€™m sorry they spoke that way. My instinct is often to take comments like that into my soul and use them to fuel my fear/loathing, but I hope youâ€™ll find a way to say â€˜eff this bsâ€™ and let their words turn to dust. Your experience of life was and is valid. And a struggle is a struggle, no matter what any foolish outside observer chooses to mouth off about.",False,False
