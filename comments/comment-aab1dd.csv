Best of luck to you!",False,False

I have a lot of symptoms of iron deficiency: heavier periods, extreme hair loss, fatigue, bruising. I also gave birth in January which can deplete iron too.   I’ve been avoiding getting my bloodwork done because I know my doctor won’t be happy with me. But also I’d like to not die. So.   Thanks for the well wishes! ",False,True

I was covered in bruises and suffering from extreme fatigue so bad I thought it was cancer! My iron levels came back at 16. I’m on pills for it now and the bruises have gone and I’ve gotten my energy back :) good luck, hope you feel better soon!",False,False
