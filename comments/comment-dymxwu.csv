I love those little baby food jars! I only eat the savory ones (such as chicken-carrot-potato) though since the sugar in the fruity ones makes me nervous and my SO thinks it's hilariously disgusting! :D No gourmet food, sure, but to someone like me who is used to culinary delights like everyone's favorite ""lettuce with mustard"", they're actually pretty good!     One of the few perks of being my age (over 30) is that no one looks at me funny when I buy baby-food, probably because they all assume it's for my baby.",False,False
