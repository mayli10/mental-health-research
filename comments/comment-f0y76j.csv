I have beaded ones that usually last up to 3 months - 6 months depending on how good you take care of them.   After ANA, my hair really thinned. Even now, where I eat normally (but relapse here and there) my hair is still fucked up.   For 22 inches, I pay about $400. I live in San Francisco and thank goodness I have a job that makes it something I can do every three months.   Many of the clients that my hairdressers sees have very thin hair and or short hair. It really blends in when she does it.   While you have hair extensions in, treat your scalp with grape seed oil every two nights and take biotin.    My real hair is getting thicker so this might be my last round of hair extensions (I’ve done it for 7 months). Beaded actually weighs your hair down, but I personally wanted beaded because I just wanted it to stay put since I live an active lifestyle, and I find it personally easy to maintain.   Definitely look into it, it’s definitely give me some kind of faux confidence boost but it’s worth the money.   Insert Name Here hair extensions sell a lot of pony tail extensions you can try out. I just don’t find it worth it because I’d rather go to hairdresser, but it might be more convenient if you can’t find a good hair extension salon in your area.",False,False

It sounds like what you’re going through is trichotillomania, it’s an impulse control disorder. I  am not a therapist by any means so take this with a grain of salt, but have had it since I was a kid and it sounds so familiar.. sadly I can’t offer a lot of advice beyond finding something else to fidget with, like a toy or a fidget ring (if you look it up there’s a lot of “stim” things that are designed for neurodivergent people that work for this as well). Keeping your hands busy especially when you’re anxious helps tremendously. For hair loss related to nutrient deficiency maybe you could try with a supplement? I heard biotin helps a lot with hair growth",False,False

When I go out, I’ll use the Toppik hair fibers. My hair loss is because of my ED and genetics. I’ve been taking multivitamins and biotin like the highest mg of biotin. I hate my hair. I wish I could afford a really nice wig that doesn’t scream out W I G. I’m afraid to get my hair cut. I haven’t had it cut in 18 months :( it doesn’t grow super fast. I’m due for one. I just can’t afford it right now and I just can’t go to SuperCuts or those places.",False,False
