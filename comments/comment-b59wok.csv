I get that what he said doesn't really add more talking points to the thread, but his sentiment is important to understand. Making vague generalizations, or what could be construed as vague generalizations, only helps to alienate a certain group of people suffering an already isolating mental illness. It doesn't help that guys are also seen as more vulnerable for having any ED in the first place (not saying the same thing doesn't happen to women, but there is a different social dynamic and psychology between males compared to females). It's been frustrating because I've seen a couple of these kinds of ""stereotyping"" men comments on the sub. And sometimes, I see these ""to the men suffering with EDs out there, you're not alone"" posts, and it feels like such virtue-signaling. Not calling anyone out, and I know this'll probably get buried in the comments/downvoted to oblivion, but I had to get this rant out, because in the past 3 months, I've seen a bunch of similar posts/comments.
