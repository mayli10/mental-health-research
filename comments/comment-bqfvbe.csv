This post is horribly triggering and needs to be taken down. I found this sub in the midst of my struggles with BED and before I lost a good bit of weight.

I'm glad you feel this way too!

If someone is overweight enough, I imagine that that would cause the cheeks to get fatter, thus actually changing the shape of the oral cavity.  Sound resonates in our mouth.  It makes sense that we would be able to perceive a difference.  I‚Äôm going to look up two people right now, whom I‚Äôve never seen, and see if they‚Äôre as overweight as they sound in my head - 1: the lead singer of the Barenaked Ladies, and 2: Paul Parillo (Purillo?

I don't want to shame you for what you're feeling, but maybe work on not feeling repulsed by overweight people because it will only make things so much harder for you in recovery. Personally, I feel like my ED makes me only feel repulsed towards the thought of myself being fat, but I'm totally for body positivity and other people being overweight. I mean, I definitely have my own problems so dont take this comment as me judging you harshly. I just get really really defensive when people talk about fat people being disgusting and treating them subhuman even though I would treat myself like that when I was overweight.

Im not repulsed because ""ew, fat people"" - it's that I hate the sound of sluggish un-enunciated words, which is often exacerbated by obesity.
