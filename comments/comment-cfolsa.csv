But yeah, it's hard to know in advance what kind of treatment will be recommended. You might just end up seeing a therapist and dietitian, or being referred to a program if they think you need more support. Regardless good luck with everything!",False,False

Speaking as someone who was forced into treatment when I was 17, being extremely resistant to recovery got me exactly nowhere. No one can force you to get better, but it's definitely less awful when you cooperate. What happens after an ED diagnosis depends on your health, how well you are functioning, your parents, and what your doctor recommends. I second the recommendation to find a therapist who is at least familiar with EDs; they can help you navigate all of this. Good luck and I hope it goes well.",False,False

I was diagnosed by my doctor and I wasn’t forced to do anything, she actually said some really insensitive things because she didn’t really know what to do with a patient with an eating disorder, and then did blood tests to make sure I was okay and referred me to a dietician.",False,False
