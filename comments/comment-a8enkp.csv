I've spent most of my life at 190, then after my first bought with an ED I got down to 158 (which I was thin/slim at, size 4)... but I still wanted to get down to my UGW of 135.

Am 150 since my ‘diet’ began in July, gained 5 pounds of water weight from my period so I’m hating myself extra hard right now and restricting extra hard. My first gw last year was 150. Now it’s 120.

Mine is 118-120 lbs, which I've been stuck at for literally 3 months now. I'm about to throw my scale out in sheer frustration.    But last winter when I was close to 150 lbs, my dream weight was like 125 lbs. If I just got to 125 I would be so skinny, I thought. Well suprise, I weigh less now and I still feel fat as fuck.

I would have killed to be 125 for so long. That was my goal weight. Then 115, then 105, then 95.   For some reason my GWs drop by 10 pounds each time.
