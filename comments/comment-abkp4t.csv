And barring injury we need never quit it – there are kick-ass marathoners above 80yrs-old to be found. But this intuitive ease to the activity of running can hide its technical aspects. For example, running without food is perfectly feasible… I do it regularly (it's called ""fasted cardio""), but you don't just leap into it. You've gotta know what to expect and match your pace and distance with your established abilities… And keep it *fun* u/polyloneials!",False,False

I’m hoping I can be in decent shape within a few months for track because I really do love running when I’m consistent with it. Also I know exercise can trigger others but it really helps me. ,False,True

It's SO hard at first. If you were able to run better just a few months ago, you will be able to get back to that point really soon. Your body conditions to running really fast because it's so frickin hard.",False,False

Period. At a certain point it may even become dangerous.  Depending on your previous activity level, setting a goal of “run every day” may be setting yourself up for bad feelings. Maybe set an intermediate goal. Even a walk offers great mental health benefits. My mom is quite fit and trains for half marathons and she still takes a rest day once a week.",False,False
