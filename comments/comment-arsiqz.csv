Like even if I just pushed a binge back my 10 minutes because I was finishing a row of knitting, it was a win. Now I'm at the point where I can go about 2 weeks before the urge to binge just isn't bearable for me.  At first, I was really disappointed at how long it's taking me to quit this multi month binge, but I'm making progress.  I hope you find something that works for you. And, I really wish you got better advice than ""stick to your meal plan"". Is there any possibility of revamping your meal plan? If your not sticking with it, maybe it just isn't working for you.",False,False

Like for me one of the root causes is I feel like it's 'treating myself' (but at the same time it's also a punishment...It's complicated lol). So instead of binging I try and treat myself like see friends or buy a new book or something.,False,False
