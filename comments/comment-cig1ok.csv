Like the premade kind that's rolled up with wax paper? So the box is long and skinny and obviously no one's going to look at that twice as edible unless they're making a pie.,False,False

I cleaned my fridge yesterday and restocked my jello and also restocked the kids jello. My jello was hidden at the back on the middle shelf; theirs in plain sight on the bottom. And those little turds found mine and ate it even though theirs was RIGHT THERE. So guess what I have to buy later at the store??,False,False
