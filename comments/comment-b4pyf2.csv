Congrats on having the courage to talk to your doctor too.   I'm not smart, so I have a tendency to avoid doctors at all costs.

I went to the doctor yesterday to discuss it (and told her for the first time about being bulimic and how I was worried it might be affecting it).  She said that it should be okay as long as you have a period at least once every 3 months (otherwise the endometrium lining build up isn’t good for you)  I’m not usually super regular though, so I reckon if you’re concerned maybe ask your doc?
