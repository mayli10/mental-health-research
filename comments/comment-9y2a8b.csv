And every single time, people are just like ""wow! congrats""  I used to comment how dangerous it was, and people would just downvote me for not knowing their lives and if they're doing things ""safely.""  But that's not really a subjective question when you're engaging in such dangerous and unmonitored restriction.  I had to unsubscribe from progresspics because it was honestly toxic and fueling my ED a lot",False,False

I 100% do not believe any of that, it may very well be her but I am beyond sure that the starting weight was far FAR higher and that the timeline was longer.   Her transformation looks much like my own, I am 1 inch shorter and I was over 200lbs to start. To add I think she also looks larger in her first picture than I did (thought that certainly can just be peoples body holding weights different) what I can't figure out is why she would want to lower her starting weight? The transformation is already very impressive so why lie about that part?",False,False
