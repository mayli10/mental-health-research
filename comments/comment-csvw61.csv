The pill will give you a withdrawal bleed (as the drop in progesterone when you have the pill free week is what triggers the uterine lining to shed) but this is created by the hormones in the pill. It won't fix any hormonal imbalance you might have.  Give this a listen: https://www.instagram.com/p/B1X8j0hlnvA/?igshid=yph64bopw9vu  I've listened to other podcasts with Renee McGregor and it was super enlightening regarding EDs, hormones and periods.",False,False

It's not a 'real' period and doesn't mean you're not still doing damage by restricting, it's basically just a withdrawal bleed that mimics a period.",False,False
