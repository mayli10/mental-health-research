For myself, when I begin to notice my unhealthy habits of not eating, I isolate myself from family, friends, hobbies that I enjoy, and I’m “in my head” too much. To help myself, i inform someone who cares about me, and try my best to surround myself with family/friends who see my self worth that I struggle with seeing.    Ask yourself if you’re developing symptoms of bulimia. What are those symptoms, and how can you help yourself from relapsing? Remember you’re doing an amazing job taking care of yourself right now, how can you maintain that?",False,False
