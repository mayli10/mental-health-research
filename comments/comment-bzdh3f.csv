As for your question if someone is in the same situation... I am.   Not gonna binge tomorrow though, I am not gonna waste my money anymore. I've been on this binge cycle for over a week now. It started off as going out with a friend to watch a movie and well..eating in the cinema, then eating a large burger. Did I gain weight? No, I don't think so, but I haven't lost anything even tho I go to the gym almost everyday. Anyhow, I get you. It is fine and it will be fine. You will eventually lose those 2 pounds. But again - don't starve and take care.",False,False
