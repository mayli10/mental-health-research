Things like her BMI, average daily intake, whether or not the purges, how long she's been doing this, and if she has any underlying health conditions are all imperative to making that prediction, and even then, only a doctor really can. It could be something as simple as low blood sugar leading to low pressure and causing the fainting spells, or she could have damaged her heart and the lack of oxygen to her brain is causing it. Either way, she's in danger. Encourage her to be kind to her body but don't get too pushy. If she continues to faint I highly suggest you involve any adults in your lives if you're underage, and if you're adults yourselves I really, really recommend that she get checked out by a doctor. Fainting is serious, even if the cause is not. Hell, she could fall during a spell, hit her head, and die. This is serious and requires advice from people way more qualified than us. ",False,False

Eating disorders are related to many types of death and illness. heart attacks are common. Eating disorders are strongly correlated to many types of death.

So take what I say with a grain of salt. The fainting thing is usually caused by a lack of electrolytes and not necessarily being underweight. So maybe offer her some zero-calorie Gatorade or MiO Sport. But if she says no, leave it. Don't try to pressure her or force her to drink it. If she's anything like me, she'll hate that and want to cut you out of her life.",False,False

We don’t have the expertise or context to do so accurately and helpfully. Sorry that you’re in this situation.   If your friend has an eating disorder she must link in with medical supports no matter what, regardless of whether she’s about to “die soon”. This disorder is debilitating and dangerous to health at all stages and you have a degree of responsibility to inform her parents if you suspect she is at risk of serious health complications or do whatever you can to try and push her down the right path towards treatment.
