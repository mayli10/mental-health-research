I didn’t want to push anyone to suffer like I was. I did find an ana coach at one point though (years ago, I was 13/14). She sent me meanspo and pushed me starve even more. I blocked her though after her messages got creepy, demanding I send her “body checks” in my underwear. 100% just some creepy old dude trying to solicit nudes from a minor. Be careful who you talk to.",False,False

It's more like having someone willing to talk/ listen constantly, who'll understand the mess that is living w an ED. Plus, having friends can be nice lol, especially when they understand something we usually have to hide from most people.",False,False

I know that it was fucked up but I kinda miss it.  I still have a gc with people from mpa but we are just 4 and we are really friends. Friends who happen to have an ED. So we can always talk about it and try to not encourage each other and it's nice and I love them but it's not the same.,False,False

I wish I had someone I could text to talk me out of binging too.",False,False
