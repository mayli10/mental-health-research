Ringing in the ears, tunnel vision, and dizziness are all signs that you need sugar. Try a sip of ANY juice. I know the calories, I know the issue ok. But if you faint and hit your head, youâ€™ll have a lot more issues. You can track the calories. Just sip some oj or apple or cran. Not diet as that has no sugar my friends. I know. I wouldnâ€™t want to and Iâ€™d argue with myself about it and I might even fucking cry over that sip. But itâ€™s sometimes closer to life and death than you think. Love you all, be safe please.",False,False
