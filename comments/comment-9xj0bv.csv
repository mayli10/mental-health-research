I believe your body uses protein as needed, for muscle maintenance, healing, etc. But I think that need is pretty much constant. Having a low protein day every now in then probably won’t make any difference, but it’s important to make sure you’re getting enough on a regular basis. The mindset of “I had a lot yesterday so don’t need much today” seems like a dangerous one because it’s a slippery slope.  It’s the same as when we tell ourselves it’s okay to consume fewer calories for x amount of days to make up for a binge (whether real or perceived). It ends up becoming a habit without you even realising it, and next thing you know your calorie intake (or protein in this case) has decreased drastically and oops now you’re deficient.  tl;dr: your protein intake may or may not even out with high/low days, but there’s no reason to intentionally consume less protein and it’s important to be careful of the mindset of restricting calories/protein/carbs/etc even if it’s just for a day.   Also, not sure if this will be helpful for you and you may already know, but just in case: recommended daily protein intake is 0.8g per kg of body weight. That should help give you an idea of what your specific needs are, if you don’t know already.  (And my comment kind of reads as bitchy/condescending. Sorry, I really don’t mean it to be,  I’m just kind of brain dead right now and nothings coming out quite right.)",False,False

I would say I start to feel shaken/cold/weak if I’ve gone several days without any protein, but I feel great and able to low restrict when I keep my protein up. I’d say every 3-4 days I need so much is what it feels like for me, you’re fine. It could possibly trigger a whoosh too. : )",False,False
