You women need radical feminism, like yesterday!  &amp;#x200B;  Why are women now so comfortable with objecting other women? You accept it from your partners and now also partake in it with no problem being a perverted creep yourself? Wow, the world is so doomed. Sickening. Sex is great, porn is not. You should feel very shameful and guilty for even wanting to be a voyeur and watch stuff like that. I remember being 9 and walking into my dad's bedroom and it as on his tv screen and felt so much disgust and shame and betrayal. I knew it was wrong at 9, what is you people's excuse to go looking for it?   &amp;#x200B;   And also having no issue with the ''teen'' crap. This is what I don't understand the most about liberal feminists, too, you supposedly  hate  and disapprove the sexualization of children(girls especially) but then accept and also participate in watching it in shows and porn and movies? Disgusting. Our bodies and sex should not be a freaking commodity and it's absolutely gross that we're at a point where it is like watching disney movies. No shame, it's even now okay for children to watch and being taught to them it's okay in schools. Just sad. And you wonder why girls and men are all depressed, it's because you consume nothing but filth. That first feeling you get when watching porn the shame is your mind telling you how bad it is and to stay away from it. WE DON'T NEED TO OBJECTIFY EACH OTHER.",False,False

Not that it‚Äôs completely unattainable; but that it becomes something you‚Äôll never *feel* you‚Äôll attain. Modeling yourself for others is a very, very empty feeling obsession. Especially if you have a not so great past that has already twisted your perception of yourself. Don‚Äôt risk your mental health further. Or at least, that‚Äôs my personal advice and what I wish someone had told me before I had completely lost myself in SO after SO after SO and now I‚Äôm 25 with no sense of who or even what I am.   Remember he‚Äôs not the only person in the world who you can eventually trust with your struggles. I don‚Äôt think he‚Äôs necessarily toxic as I don‚Äôt know shit about him; but if he does make you feel you need to look a certain way, act a certain way, be someone you truly are *not*; then remember he‚Äôs not ‚Äúit‚Äù. You take care of yourself first and at your own pace. And if he is a positive force in your life- *truly* trust him. Trust he finds you exactly how you are perfect. Porn is a fantasy of fantasies. It‚Äôs non applicable to you. It‚Äôs not a reflection of *who* he wants.",False,False

I also dated a man who turned out to be a pedophile and that's the kind of stuff he would watch and apparently I'm still not over it so I'm just extra sensitive to that shit. Sorry &lt;3,False,False

He knows my extensive past/present issues with bulimia so I don‚Äôt know if he would even be honest if he did want something about me to change because he‚Äôs been a witness unfortunately to some extreme behavior of mine in the past and he wants me to be over that. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è,False,True

And porn is usually a poor reflection of what someone actually wants- even I look at much different porn than what my SOs look at (ie, I like lesbian porn the most and will watch it when dating a man, still). Usually, they like you for you. They like the body attached to what makes you a person. Which is healthy. Some people suck and project an ideal into others even when knowing full well that person can never be that.  So ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è you can ask. Just know if you do try to conform to what he wants, it‚Äôs going to be a lot rougher than trying to be who *you* want to be.",False,False
