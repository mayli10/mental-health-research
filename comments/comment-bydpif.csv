It's only natural that your body is asking for more food if you used to purge. If you listen to it and eat what you have to to feel full that is exactly what you need. Also, might not sound ""healthy"" but track your measurements, those pounds, specially with extreme hunger are most likely water weight. As for the gym, maybe try light exercise at home with an app :) everything will be alright. You're not gross for feeling hungry, and for  attending to what your body needs. I wish u the best",False,False

Starting to eat regular meals will help your appetite a LOT.",False,False
