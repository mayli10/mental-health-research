I want to feel safe and loved and cared about, and that’s totally a normal human instinct! Where it gets dicy for me is that I struggle to ask for those things in healthy ways or to let myself feel it and trust it when those needs really are being met.   It’s like on the cornerstone of my soul is stamped “Your needs don’t deserve to be met. You are not enough.” I keep looking for others to fill that void by reaching out for comfort in the only way I can come up with...by falling apart and by writing my anguish on my body. In truth, my comfort zone wasn’t actually comfortable. It was just a particular breed of agony with which I was deeply familiar.   I’ve made some progress from where I was (yay DBT) and I can sorta see now that my survival instincts were actually killing me. I like that I can express my desire for safety/love a little better and a little more directly. I feel like my relationships are becoming more solid and stable. It’s nice.",False,False
