I have a semi-crush on my roommate and he's been talking about a new coworker he's hitting it off with, and I was happy he was making a new friend bc his anxiety makes it hard for him sometimes. I went with him to a bar where a lot of his coworkers were meeting up and his new friend was there! Aaand she's rail thin. And skinny. And gorgeous. And the whole cutesy awkward self-deprecating thing men eat up bc they love insecure women (but only if their beautiful). And I just. Avoided her the whole night. Literally navigating myself to the opposite corner of the bar wherever she was at. I bet we'd get along, buuuut I'll never find out bc jealousy would eat me alive before I could make a connection",False,False
