OP, I hope you realise that despite whatever your ED made you say, you are still, at heart, a good person. I've been the little sister in this situation and my older sisters have never once acknowledged nor apologised for their roles in the formation of my ED. They actually sabotaged my recovery, too, and convinced my parents treatment was a waste of money. I so wish I could have had a sister like you instead.",False,False

My sister and I exacerbated each other’s eating disorders growing up, and even still there’s this competition over who’s the thinnest. The fact that your first instinct is concern for your sister’s well being - and not the possibility of her getting thinner than you - speaks volumes to me about who you are as a person.

Which sucks because I need constant positive affirmation and external validation, but I also feel really bad for making her feel bad. Idk why she can't lose weight. I don't want her to do what I do. But I don't know how to help her. ",False,False

Whenever I've encountered people who know about EDs but don't have one and seem on the precipice of disordered behavior, a quick reality check usually does the trick. You know your disorder isn't really about your body, it's a manifestation of other issues. You also know that since starting down this road, you've never been at peace with your body or your habits. You know what your disorder has made you do, the things you've missed out on, the health issues it's caused you, the cigarettes you smoked instead of meals and how your body has paid the price for it. You know it's hell on Earth and it's a hell you made for yourself. We all know that because we're all here. Your sister probably doesn't know that.  You might also follow it up with something about how it's fine and normal to be disastisfied with your body, but that it's not a moral judgment and no matter how your body looks it doesn't make you a bad person. I'd finish it off with something about how losing weight and being ""hot"" start with self-love, not self-hate. You love your body, you love yourself, and you can take care of your body.  I think Kate flowers on YouTube is a great example of this. She's beautiful and she eats really well and her philosophy is great. I think she said this: ""treat your body like a baby you're taking care of. You wouldn't give a baby cigarettes or alcohol, you wouldn't yell at a baby for gaining weight"". That kind of self-compassion enables you to engage with weight loss, exercise, and food in a healthy way where you can still attain your goals. Maybe you could even make a commitment to work with your sister on fixing both of your relationships with food and your bodies. She might be an excellent support resource for you and likewise you have the perspective to support her without enabling her.   I also recommend the following YouTubers: dudebabe, Daphne Fisher, and boo (former proed  mod) .   Good luck. ",False,False
