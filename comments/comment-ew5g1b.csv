They hurt. Theyâ€™re not perky or small or cute. They sag. Literally no purpose and I have to strap them down to my chest for safe keeping (they fucking hurt and Iâ€™m gonna whine about it) so my style comes off as super masculine. Guys I just want a real bra and that billowy thing shirts do with boobs not have my shirts stick to my torso displaying my rolls ðŸ˜­,False,False

I got so thin that they stopped growing, recovered, started growing again and now I'm terrified that if I don't get underweight again I'll have big boobs which for no real reason I hate and associate with fatness on me. Like I just want to stick with the runway skeleton barely any boob look pls :(((",False,False

They're not in great shape anymore thanks to constantly fluctuating in weight, which just makes me want to restrict even more to make them smaller because then they're at least not saggy AND heavy. But even if I do successfully restrict down to my GW, I know I'll end up binging for months on end and regaining it all, therefore making my boobs look even worse and then triggering restriction again.",False,False

A or even B would be a dream for me,False,False
