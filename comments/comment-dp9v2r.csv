Then I just feel stupid for ever having hope that things get better.,False,True

If you want happiness you have the right to try and get it. Please treat yourself with compassion the same way you would treat a friend who was struggling and already trying their best.,False,False

Fuck everyone else, just do every little thing you enjoy, down to the tiniest details. True friends will come when you do you just for you. I honestly feel done with dating. I wore sweatpants out in public today. I haven't done that since highschool. And you know what? I was COMFORTABLE. I was warm. Fuck attention from people that start out being attracted to you based solely off of appearance. I would rather pick a partner from correspondence than a photo. Dude, I hope you just take it easy, try to pamper yourself a little and show yourself some kindness. You are alive and deserve it. Don't wait for someone else to do it for you.",False,False

Noting I do makes it better. I've tried everything I can afford.   The thing is, I do know what will happen if I keep trying to date. I will continue to be rejected. Not only am I fat but I'm dorky and annoying. Men have always been embarrassed of me since I started dating. I've never even been in a relationship and all my friends at least live with their partners if they arent married and having kids. I'm too old. It doesn't help either that I basically look like a fat 12 year old. Just got told again today I look 12 for the millionth time by one of my patients.   I'm sad all the time. I keep crying at work. It's getting darker so I will just get worse like I do every winter. But the thing is, I know I deserve this. Just because I exist doesn't mean I deserve to be loved and to be happy. You have to be the kind of person that people want to be around and that's not me.",False,True

I'm crawling out of this right now and I just want to say you're not alone and don't give up. You never know what could happen tomorrow. You deserve a hug and some tea and a warm bath. ðŸ’“,False,False
