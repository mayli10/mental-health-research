Oh man you put it into words... Yesterday at the gym I was like ""oh I'll just do 20 minutes on this machine!"" But then I was only 15 calories off of a ""nice even number"" so it changed to ""I'll just get those last 15..."" But then my distance was so close to a nice round number too but then getting THERE I then had to get my calories up to another round nice number...  Why the fuck are numbers so... Powerful over me? Jesus typing this down made me realise how much arbitrary values control what I do...",False,False
