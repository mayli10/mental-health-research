Maybe one day I'll find a way to look back on what you've said to me and it'll probably make a lot of difference to how I'm doing that day. I don't think I'm anywhere near yet, all I see and all I am are my faults.",False,True

I've never seen you or met you, but you're here. You're on this subreddit, you know you have this disorder, you can't trust your opinion of yourself. It's just not reliable anymore. Call me a dick, but try to stop thinking about yourself. I don't mean that the way it sounds, but just attempt to distract your thoughts from lingering on YOU. What you look like, how you're acting, being overdramatic and calling yourself stupid or lazy for making a teeny little mistake that, if anyone else made, you wouldn't yell at them the way you yell at yourself in your mind. Take some deep breaths (literally because there's heaps of evidence to prove this will calm you down, nature and shit), and say out loud to yourself ""I didn't do anything wrong, I'm going to be okay."" It doesn't sound as stupid as you think it will once you say it out loud, because it's true.",False,False
