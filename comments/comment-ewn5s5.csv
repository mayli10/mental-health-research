Maybe It's because my whole family is self aware and has issues but every time I open up to someone about my ED I find out they also have or had similar issues with food. It makes me think if I'm really ""that special"", I know It's fucking stupid but sometimes it makes you believe ""if everyone is okay with it, why should I not be? Is it really a big deal?"", and IT. SURE. FUCKING. IS! And I need to remind myself that these people also need help and, instead of comparing myself, be aware that they also struggle and It's not something I should desire. These people might look like the whole world right now but THEY ARE NOT!!",False,False
