Pantyhoes are allowed to be kept on though, so I always wear skirts and pantyhose Thursdays, event though that is so not my style ..!

If you feel comfortable you can always make a new thread where everyone can make a list where they put why they're recovering so you don't have to do it alone c:,False,False

I am so friggin sorry that this happened to you, that is so so sooooo unprofessional.  As another commenter mentioned, if you can talk to her boss (if you feel comfortable doing that, I know it's a tough situation) or someone else in the program that you trust, that might help.    She was so out of line. Everyone's treatment plan is different, and professionals shouldn't be discussing everyone's like that!   &amp;#x200B;  Honestly, I had a relatable experience recently, I got weighed during my weekly follow up on Wednesday, and my ED therapist was like ""OH SO IT LOOKS LIKE YOUR WEIGHT IS PRETTY STABLE THIS WEEK HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT THAT?""  &amp;#x200B;  Like I feel shit, and you know it. Geez.  I know I didn't have the whole telling it to a group thing/the professional comparing you to others, but I'm really sorry.  &amp;#x200B;  You being in treatment is such a big step in itself!  &amp;#x200B;  I hope you have a nice day/night wherever you are!   &amp;#x200B;  Cheers",False,False

I would definitely report it, they aren’t supposed to say anything about what’s happening with your weight, and especially not anyone else’s! Holy triggering!",False,False

Jesus, I can't even imagine. There's multiple reasons that was awful. She's signaling out one person as being different from the group, she's making comments about the body that  aren't medically necessary, her comments are harmful to you especially since it's super common for Ed sufferers to feel they aren't sick ""enough"", her comments are harmful to the rest of the group as she's basically reinforcing their ED thoughts...just bad all around.  I think it would help to reaffirm why you're recovering. You're not recovering for her approval. Maybe even make a list of the positives recovery will have on your life.  I personally would probably also prepare a rant to tell her the next time I saw her on how dangerous and messed up her comments are. I doubt I would have the courage to actually say it, but it would help just thinking through it for me",False,False
