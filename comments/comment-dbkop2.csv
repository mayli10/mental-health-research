He returns from the trenches, but not the same. They say he has left a part of himself on the battlefield (he has left his left leg on the battlefield), he must have left his nerves and senses on the battlefield, they say. (They whisper how he is growing thin, how terrible to see such wasting [but of course that is the sacrifice of war, they remind each other] but how he shakes when he lifts a pale bony hand.)   [he cheated death in the trenches that day when the bombardment seemed it would never cease, but the skeleton that should have lain in the weeds amongst his brothers lingers instead in the hospital corridors and languishes in the shadows of the tree-shaded grounds]",False,False

I love to hear people on this sub drunkenly yell.  Anyway, this comparison is very apt. My ED is 100% the madwoman locked in the attic. And also, our whole cultural image of an a n o r e x i c is 100% a Gothic heroine. Spiritually lost slender young woman, imprisoned by some real or imagined force. A mist of undefined s i n seeping through her house, which sits on the ruins of her medieval predecessors (the holy anorexics?). What is her s e c r e t, what is her g i f t, how does Satan grant her the power to live on naught but gloom? How slender she is, how b e a u t i f u l, what a pale diabolic icon of s u f f e r i n g.   And then one day the tentacles fucking explode out of her chest.",False,False
