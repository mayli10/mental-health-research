I also do sugar free hard life savers (8 calories each) every once in a while. Also blueberries only have 1 calorie each!,False,False

I usually eat a square of dark chocolate every day. The lindt ""hint of sea salt"" is really good. 54 calories a square. Also bordering unsafe, although I haven't binged on it yet. Sometimes after I eat a single square I could finish off the whole bar. I think the salt makes me want more of it. Maybe I'll buy a different dark chocolate bar next time.   Sometimes if i'm really on a sweet kick but I can't afford the cals I'll weigh out a bit of whipped cream on my food scale and eat it straight. It's like 15 cals for 2 table spoons of that shit. And it's lightly sweet and it sometimes really gets the job done. Kinda piggish but it's worth it sometimes.   Bought those little packets of kids scooby doo fruit snacks, those are 80 calories a pop. But it's pretty calorie dense, it's like 8 fruit snacks a pack and it's very close to becoming a fear food for me, I feel like it would be easy for me to binge these. I could easily put away 4 or 5 of those little packages if I got out of control with it. Have only had like 2 packages of them since I bought the box of them, very weary with this one.  Hershey's kisses are 22 cals each if you have the self control to keep a bag of those around. Sometimes I can't keep them in the house, but other times it's a life saver to have a couple of those a day to keep the cravings at bay.  Would love to expand my horizons of safe sweets. I have such a sweet tooth problem.",False,False

Also love those ginger chews (15 calories each). Merengue cookies (90-110 calories per serving, which is about 15 mini merengues or 4 big ones).

Quest bars, halo top ice cream, rice cakes with sugar free jelly on top (it’s good!), oatmeal with a tbsp honey, Rx bars are pretty tasty, a granola bar every now and then, and my new favorite— Atkins diet candy bars. 1g sugar per bar, a shitload of fiber (like 4g net carbs) and pretty low-cal too, taste just like regular candy bars but it’s almost impossible to binge because your brain isn’t going crazy with sugar (but it tastes just like sugar, not the fake shit!!), so you don’t feel the need to overdo it.",False,False
