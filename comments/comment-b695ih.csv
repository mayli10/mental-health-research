I used to go without a bowel movement for 6 days, sometimes more. What really helped was drinking a keurig chai latte (cafÃ© escapes: 60cal) and/or reduced calorie hot chocolate (swiss miss: 35cal) during my recovery. It worked for some reason, possibly the heat? I don't know... But that really helped. What also helped was a digestive enzyme, milk of magnesia, and miralax. If you do experiment with the last two, PLEASE be careful, they can be highly addictive, especially for people suffering from eating disorders. Hope this helps, and be safe! ",False,False
