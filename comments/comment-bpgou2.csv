I hope you are feeling better  I mostly wonâ€™t order anything but water (or alcohol) when out if someone else is going to fill the cup bc I donâ€™t trust them not to absentmindedly use regular coke instead of Coke Zero &amp; I fear I wonâ€™t be able to tell the difference  I forgot about my paranoia the other day &amp; had my fiance try my Coke Zero multiple times to make sure it wasnâ€™t regular coke. One time I ordered a whiskey and Diet Coke at the casino and couldnâ€™t enjoy it bc I was scared it was regular coke but bc of the whiskey I couldnâ€™t tell so I just didnâ€™t drink it,False,False
