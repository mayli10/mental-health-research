And.. Uhh actually maybe I've been the asshole? I worked at a grocery store when I was 16 and one time this guy came in with like 32 cans of tuna and I was having a hard time getting them to scan and at the end I was like ""that's 32 cans of tuna"" and he was very aggressively like ""I KNOW!!!!""   In retrospect maybe he had an eating disorder and I made him feel self-conscious? Maybe he was just a grumpy low-income 50-something guy? Idfk. ",False,False

This is the most polite way I've ever seen someone say ""that guy is being an asshole.""    I get what you mean though, just because a person seems like an ass one time you interact with them, it doesn't define them as a person(or it shouldn't).  This has nothing to do with anything; I just genuinely enjoyed the way your phraed that.",False,False

I went to the store at midnight because I really needed some halo top.
