Opened up to a friend up this and she minimized so much . You DO NOT have a 'non-problem' or faking this ed or not as serious because your in normal bmi. I'll do some tough love on you real quick, your on this subreddit for fucks sake. You have a problem and thats okay! You tried to open up to people but the obviosuly are ignorant torwards it and thats on them.   &amp;#x200B;  You say that 'nobody' care if your not dying, thats false. I care about you right now and so many others with ed's and other specialists around it. People without ed's may not understand you ( yet, I have hope that you will meet someone who will actually listen) but there is always this community. You dersve better than doing a seven day fast but rather go do hobbies and things you actually want to do. Please dont let the ed pretend it in charge because ' it doesnt seem seirous' to other people. Fuck them and fuck the ed. You deserve to THRIVE in this life and I belive that you will  ( sorry that this naggy/soapy/etc I really feel for you an if you ever want to reach out feel free )",False,False
