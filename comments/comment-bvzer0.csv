I hope you start to feel better. I think you will, with getting more nutrients and being better to your body. It’ll take time, but sometimes it helps me to think about how much better I’ll feel physically and mentally once I’m out of this hell.    It might not mean much from a random stranger, but I’m really proud of you for going 5 days purge free! It’s so difficult to resist the urge. I’m trying to quit too. Good luck ☺️",False,False
