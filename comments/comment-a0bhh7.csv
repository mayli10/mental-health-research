Looked at the versa but all I wanted was the fitness aspects of it. Having an Apple watch or any kind of smart watch really would be too much. I also really needed it to be waterproof, as I'd be paranoid about ruining it if it wasn't.   It helps me feel better knowing how many calories I actually burn in a day. It tracks sleep as well, which is important for me to know because I like having those numbers. I'd definitely say it was worth it. Because it tracks so many things I can worry about a lot less",False,False
eagps4t,t3_a0bhh7,t3_a0bhh7,smallest_madeline,1,2018-11-25 16:13:48,/r/EDAnonymous/comments/a0bhh7/i_want_a_fitbit/eagps4t/,I think the Fitbit charge 2 (now itâ€™s waterproof and called charge 3) is the best fitness charger. I really donâ€™t need the bells and whistles of a Apple Watch or a Fitbit versa. It automatically tracks some workouts just based on movement (like dancing and walking) or you can set it to actually track a specific workout. I love all the data and information. ,False,False

I liked that it had an actual watch part to it so I didnâ€™t have to wear two things on my wrist all the time. And the heart rate feature was so useful during workouts. ,False,False
