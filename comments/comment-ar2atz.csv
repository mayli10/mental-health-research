It's part of the reason why I plan to go away and take a break because I don't think I can keep up with it for another two years and I don't want it happen in front of everyone... I think, I can lose weight while I'm traveling and I can come back as a super motivated skinny version of me but I have to become underweight because I'm taking time off. ",False,True

I also tried to make up for my weight with good grades. But this school year i just have no energy at all, i just exist. Im underaverage. My boyfriend shows no interest in me, i feel so unimportant.   But in my head, it would all change to good if i would just drop some weight. Like this would be the ultimativ game changer.   So in the meantime i will just exist. And wait for the better days, the skinnier days lmao",False,False
