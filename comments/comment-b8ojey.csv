The good news is that they didn’t find anything on the scope or the biopsies taken. So I have a good long decade before I ever have to even consider doing that again. Now that I think about it, they did have me on a low fiber diet starting four days prior to fasting and cleanout. This most definitely probably contributed to the uncontrollable aspect of it all.",False,False

But just as an alternative point of view, I had to have a colonoscopy recently and I just COULD NOT stomach the clean out solution. So they recommend I drink a bottle of mag cit, and take two dulcolax tabs. Then repeat in the morning. It wasn’t until the morning part, but I did indeed shit myself. This was also after a fast so if you’ve had some solid food you may be fine. I managed to wake up periodically throughout the night to go, but the risk is still there, though possibly low. I’m also a small lady so perhaps the big dose of lax really effected me.",False,False

You have involuntary sensors and sphincters to keep that from happening. Unless by edible you mean like edible narcotics or something lol,False,False
