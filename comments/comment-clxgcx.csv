It's fire and ice - wanting this, not wanting it. Needing the results, then hating them. Craving praise, then feeling hopeless and threatened once you get it.  If you can be honest with them, it might be worth trying to open up just to have something real.  I don't know if you're feeling how I felt, but it made me feel sad, alone, and lied to. The sick part of me didn't believe it, and the healthy part of me was hurting so badly.  Being high-fived for your own self-destruction sure is something.",False,False

I'd be pissed as hell if I lost 20 pounds starving myself for MONTHS only for someone to tell me ""you look amazing! keep doing what you're doing!"" It's almost as if they're encouraging you to be in pain, even though they're unaware of what you did to get to that point. Totally understand this and it's completely normal to feel.",False,False
