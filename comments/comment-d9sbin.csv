This happened with no concious effort on my part, it simply happened and I didn't realise until in retrospect.  &gt;I feel like the fruit gave me a way to satisfy my sugar cravings (that I prefered to eating sugary sweets due to lowered calorie content), without allowing me to consume *too* much sugar because of the high fibre content and the sheer volume of fruit I'd have to buy/consume. Because I started consuming less sugar, my sugar cravings eventually lessened until they disapated altogether.  Basically replace sweets with fruit and slowly cut back on the fruit over a few months, try and progress towards fruits that aren't very sugary like raspberries towards the end of this",False,False

NOTHING else helped. I know it sounds fake, but your palate will adjust after a while, no matter how addicted you are.   I will say, though, that I'd tried to go cold turkey in the past, and it never worked. I'd just try to soothe my cravings with refined carbs like baguettes and pasta instead. Cold turkey only worked after I started a WFPB diet, and couldn't fill the void with empty carbs instead (which inevitably led to me giving up, giving in, and eating sugar).   I hate to sound like a WFPB evangelist, but it really has changed my relationship with sugar (which I used to be addicted to, 100%). Now I don't desire it at all! Which is INSANE. But yeah, fruit tastes super sweet now, and typical desserts all seem overwhelmingly rich and even off-putting. It's been very interesting.",False,False
