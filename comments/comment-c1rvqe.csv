It's normal really.  They might not do this every day.  It's weird to think once food wasn't an issue, isn't it.",False,False

If you binged, it's because you're hungry because you restrict!  It probably wasn't even a binge because I've seen people at the night time wedding buffet eat and eat and eat and that's after they've had the huge sit down meal!  Well done if you didn't, but it's okay to allow yourself to eat more than usual.  I'm actually struggling with trying to gain atm and the reason is that eating considerably more has done something to my metabolism and I'm actually losing.  Not good.  This has happened in the past also.  I don't think one night of eating more will affect your weight if that's your main worry.  If it's what you consider ""lack of control"" that's the anxiety part, that's not true.  Seriously, I'm hungry every minute and think of food constantly.  It's only the fact I don't get invited to social things involving food that possibly stops me eating more.  &amp;#x200B;  I hope everything goes/went well.  Kick anxiety out.  You deserve to not feel how much you each makes you a greater or lesser person. x",False,False
