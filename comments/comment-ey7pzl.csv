Comparing myself to my Mum as she went through chemo for breast cancer was my lowest point.   Sometimes, I have to force myself not to look at bodies and scan my eyes over them in a comparative fashion. But then, sometimes, you're caught off guard, and feel like a miserly witch. :(     You're okay. You really are.",False,False

You're just very ill. And that's not your fault. When you have an ED, you look at the world through the lens of an ED... and sometime it makes us think really questionable or horrible things.  You didn't hurt anybody. Don't worry. It's just a thought. Just focus on taking care of yourself, okay?",False,False

You're not the disgusting person you may feel you are because of this. You are not deplorable because of this.

This isn't a thought process that you would normally have and you're aware of this due to the guilt you felt after the fact. It's sad when it gets to the points like these but it happens.   I'm going to be real right now, I've seen posts similar to this before on here where the OP takes the route of more of a joking tone and, while I understand that self deprecatory humor is a positive coping mechanism for most, there's a time and a place. But you recognized the seriousness of it and didn't make light of it in any way. Easier said than done, I know, but don't feel too bad about this, OP. We can't help what we think, only how we react.",False,False

Last year, my class visited a Holocaust museum. We had to watch the videos that the Americans took of the concentration camps. It showed the Holocaust survivors, and my brain just thought about how skinny they were rather than the horror that they went through. I cried so hard as well. I felt like utter shit and a deplorable human being. Just try to remember that it‚Äôs your ED talking and not you that had the thought.",False,False
