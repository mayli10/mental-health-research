I found it to be amazing and outweighs the cons of more bloating, calories etc.  It takes a while for the body to regulate after using laxatives for a very long time. Give it time, donâ€™t give in to the compulsion to take an entire box, drink plenty of water and try o develop high fibre foods as safe foods.",False,False
