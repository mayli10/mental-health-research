I know exactly how you feel.   I had to take a break from jogging because doing that while fasting was ruining me. I am on day 2 of rest and eating at 1200 and I am feeling better.  Am I worried? Yup. But I'm not gonna weigh myself until next week after I feel good enough to run again. I'm pretending I havr hit a pause button. If I weigh myself next week and I have maintained I'll consider it a win. If I have gained, then I will just try again. What else am I gonna do? But at 1200 cals and the loss of water in my muscles from rest...makes that unlikely.  I have too much to accomplish to get hurt now; and I bet you do too. Don't end up having to sit out for longer than you want because you wore yourself out. 2 or 3 days now to prevent an unavoidable week or more later is worth it.   You can do it. Be safe.",False,False

I'm happy I'm 162 this morning but not. Again 5 miles, again muscle exhaustion, again, again, again. I wanna stop. I wanna take a day off! or 2 or 3 but I'm terrified of being back to 178 or even worse.",False,True
