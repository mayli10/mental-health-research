There are higher-calorie meal replacement drinks that don't taste too bad (I drink Ensure ProMax and mix it with coffee for a mocha); the bottle is less than a full cup of liquid. Good luck!",False,False

Dried fruit. Maybe yogurts with higher milk fat?  Any drinks you like? Fruit juices or anything? Or even cream/sugar you can add to coffee or tea?

They are kind of expensive but Iâ€™ve found Kate Farms komplete meal replacement shakes to be pretty easy to drink. They have lots of nutrients and arenâ€™t too filling.
