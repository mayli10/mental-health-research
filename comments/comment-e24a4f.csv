Your body/mind gets so used to being hungry that you don’t feel as much pain from the hunger anymore. That’s why the first couple days of restricting are so agonizing but then it gets easier somehow. You can just kind of ignore it.,False,False

I used to abuse the fuck out of weed and I was at my lowest weight at the same time. When I went into addiction/mental health treatment, they kept asking me, “Doesn’t the marijuana make you want to eat?” Not even the munchies could get me to stop restricting at the time. I smoked to numb out the pain of the ED and it helped me forget how hungry I was.",False,False
