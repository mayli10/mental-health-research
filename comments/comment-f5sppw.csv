You're right in that I have to own my emotions. I acknowledge that this is probably a part of my continuing paranoia that I should get help for and that my sister probably genuinely is worried (however my mother has explicitly told me that she's jealous and angry at me and blames me for both her issues and my own). And about the clothes swap, yes it was 100% her idea first and I didn't tell her that my clothes were too big on me (I just said I was donating clothes and she asked to see them) but she's allowed to have her own feelings. I'll try to be kinder to her and trust her more.",False,True

This may sound harsh, but don't put your fears or whatever negative feelings about recovery onto others, you have to own your emotions. And when it comes to that clothes swap situation with your sister... I mean, really, how would you feel if the situation was reverse? If someone lost a bunch of weight and offered you their old clothes because you're ""fat enough to fit them"", how would that make you feel? If you think you'd be hurt and upset in any way in such a situation then your sister absolutely also has the right to be hurt and upset too, even if you mutually agreed to the clothes swap or even if it was her idea to begin with. We don't always know how we'll react once the situation actually arises. But her being upset or experiencing some jealousy in the moment doesn't mean so want to drag you down and make you fat and unhappy by suggesting treatment.",False,False
