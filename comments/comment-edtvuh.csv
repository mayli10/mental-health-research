You're quite literally filling your lungs with fluid. It's rare, but there have been cases of people being hospitalized from vaping. And you're so young too. Even if there's no nicotine it's still not a good idea. I suppose once in a while would be okay, but if you're using it to suppress appetite that suggests you'll be using it a lot. Also, be very careful to properly maintain the device. I have heard of vapes exploding on people and I have to imagine it was either because they were faulty products from irreputable brands or that they weren't maintained properly. My brother vapes and he frequently replaces the cotton and coils in his vape to keep it functional. I did try it once and it was kind of scary actually because sometimes the vape juice would end up somewhere it shouldn't be and it would pop similar to how sap does in firewood. You definitely don't want it popping while you're inhaling the vapor.",False,False

Black market, and cut with vitamin E among other things, THC cartridges (v hot right now, they have some for juul and they can fit in any vape pen basically) was the actual perpetrator.   My state banned vapes for like a month lol. Shit was lame.",False,False

If it's needing something to do with your hands: find an art/craft, get a fidget spinner, hell, paint your nails. If it's an oral thing, chew gum or find a distraction.  Most importantly, you're young. If you're hungry, EAT! Ik it's not that simple, it's not gonna cure you. List out some safe foods, and when you're hungry, pick one to try. Even if it's just a couple of bites.  It doesn't matter that there's no nicotine. The action of smoking/vaping alone is addictive.  Please get further help. You deserve it!!!",False,False
