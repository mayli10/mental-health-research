Also not keeping binge foods in the house (sorry if this seems totally obvious, it didnâ€™t occur to me that it would make such a big difference until I was in a house with no junk food in it). It also helped me to make big satisfying meals with healthy foods like vegetables and brown rice in spicy broth (spicy broth makes you feel really full and satisfied), whereas when I tried to heavily restrict always resulted in a binge. Also- hobbies! I took up jigsaw puzzles and sewing and it really helped keep my mind off food.  Additionally, remember that the binge cycle *will* come to an end and try not to hate yourself for fulfilling your bodyâ€™s need for comfort (when Iâ€™m stressed/sad my body always craves comfort from food, it might be good to assess your emotional needs and target the potential source of the binge cravings)  And most importantly, stay safe!",False,False

Therapy wasn't one of them. First, self harm. I would run at the gym til my feet bled. (Shit sneakers but you get the point). Second, sex or masturbation and immediate sleep. Third, ""poisoning"" the food. I would load the food with pockets of spicy sauce and didn't eat for days after. I get the binge and the purge and the endorphins.",False,False

I'm going through a lot of difficult things right now and binging is only making everything else much worse. I don't even care about finally attending college this January and that was something I was extremely excited about just a few weeks ago, before I started binging. All I want is to be left alone to restrict and offset all these extra calories. But it's so hard when all I can think about is food.",False,True

If I knew a surefire way to stop them that would be ideal but hereâ€™s some things I find helpful:  Cliche but distracting yourself. Things like fake tanning/giving yourself a mani pedi especially bc they take forever and they might make you feel a little better as a bonus!   Playing the sims or finding something interesting enough on netflix that I get lost in it, try a documentary or a show youâ€™ve heard raved about.   Most helpful for me has been just focusing on how Iâ€™m craving food and acknowledging how much I want to binge. I also remind myself how strong I am for having to sit through my brain screaming at me to do something I donâ€™t want to, not weak for having these thoughts in the first place ( sorry if Iâ€™ve articulated that badly)   My inbox is always open if you need to talk, hope you feel better soon loveðŸ’•",False,False
