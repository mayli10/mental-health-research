You are an amazing, beautiful, wonderful person who deserves to be happy and comfortable in their skin. You aren't going accomplish it with some fucking asshole who can't even remember to flush the toilet after himself stuck in your head.   If you don't have your health, you have nothing!! Don't ruin your health for the sake of your appearance. You are worth more than this.",False,False

Even tho I come from a place that praises being 'thicc' I was praised for losing weight because I look horrible when I'm fatter. I don't think it's an unrealistic standard rather that people really did think I looked better after losing weight even though it was unhealthy. Which is the worst part of it is that it's the truth.  I have to do it. I am out of control. I am fat. In a month I know I can lose 40lbs and then I'll go back to eating 1000 a day + working out. I know it's sustainable once I'm skinny enough for it. I have to get my strength back or I'll be pathetic and a failure forever and I'll feel worse about myself,False,True
