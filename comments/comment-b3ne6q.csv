After the first purge I binged and purged every single day for 2 months and could only stop it by gaining a little bit of weight back. Restricting after managing to quit triggered yet another b/p cycle that lasted for 4 months and only stopped 3 weeks ago.  Now my teeth hurt eating anything mildly cold because of the damage I've done to my enamel. I have at least 2 new cavities that I need to get fixed but am too terrified to. My face looks fatter and puffier than it did when I was 20 pounds heavier. My swollen salivary glands look like small golf balls under my jawline when looking from the side. My stomach opening has loosened and I suffer from heartburn when I eat a lot at once.  I'm not trying to preach or pressure you to do anything, but I know that before purging for the first time I read experiences like mine and just brushed them off thinking it wouldn't be like that for me. But it was worse, as all of the damage I described happened in just 6 months of purging. The first purge opens the Pandora's box and nothing is the same after it, so please really think about it before doing it.",False,False
