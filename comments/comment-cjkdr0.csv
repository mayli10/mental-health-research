You can always get back on the wagon, and it's going to be a lot easier to do it now than it will be one month, one week, or one day from now. You didn't break or fail at recovery because something that your sister said impacted you negatively. It probably is worth it to check the facts, understand where she's coming from, and maybe talk to her to avoid that kind of comment in the future. People without eating disorders just have no idea how badly that kind of statement hurts our recovery efforts. It's always coming from a place of ""You were scaring me before, and I care about you, and you're scaring me less now,"" but our eating disorders really rip it up. You've got people who maybe are kind of clueless, but who really care about you. If right now, you can't recover for yourself, try to recover for them. You're so worth recovery, health, and not feeling trapped by your disorder anymore. You haven't failed, and you do have to get back up and do your best to continue fighting against your eating disorder.",False,False
