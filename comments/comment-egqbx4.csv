I have to treat myself all the time because it's the only way I know how to be kind to myself.  And on that note, even at my lowest weight, I hated my body and would pinch skin thinking it was fat. Now I'm overweight and the self hate is just so much stronger. I have issues with being in pictures, going shopping, get into a horrible headspace around conventional beautiful women, even when it's my own sister.  I fast to try and make up for it but I always get hungry and then berate myself as I ruin a fast, or even break it, and generally do so with shit food. Then I obsessively look over the fasting sub and that makes me cry because how TF can people do do that and be validated for starving themselves? I swear to God, there was a post about people joining an EF after Christmas day. I'm sorry, how is that not just restricting because you binged? And why can't I manage it?  I have issues, I have a disordered relationship with food, and avoiding a label would not do me any good. I have to love myself at all weights, I can't sweep it all under the rug. No one will ever know this about me in person because I'm really fucking high functioning in one of the most competitive and demanding fields.",False,False

In the same sense I've seen posts on here of people asking for reassurance when they've eaten over their person allowed cal limit, but still under their tdee - despite still asking the question in this sub for reassurance, I know personally I also have a tdee calculator bookmarked to look at as many times as I want for reassurance that I still won't gain if that makes sense.

We‚Äôre all here because we know that we‚Äôre sick, but because of the nature of eating disorders, there can be a lot of self doubt about your own illness even though deep down you know your unhealthy habits are killing you. Also, even in people without EDs, it‚Äôs perfectly normal to want validation. It‚Äôs human to need comfort and reassurance. So of course there are going to be a lot of validation posts; it‚Äôs something a lot of us have in common and can relate to.   It‚Äôs perfectly fine to not relate to those posts, but remember that this community isn‚Äôt here to cater to your individual needs.
