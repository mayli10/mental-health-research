I love it (honestly) but it's also 100% compulsive and it's made my ED (and my knees) so much worse. So my relationship with cardio is shit basically. Weight training bores me to death but my brain loves progress in any form and so I get an absolute rush from being able to lift heavier each week. Also ngl getting a higher metabolism is a big motivation.  As for tips for hulking, maybe try to look at it as a reverse diet instead? You can look it up on YouTube (MissFitAndNerdy did a really good series on it) but it's basically a clean bulk that focuses on building as much muscle as possible while keeping fat gain at a minimum.",False,False

Every day I walk around 7 miles and besides noticing physical improvements, it really really helps me with depression and stress. My therapist suggested it to just get me out of the house for like 20 min since I was basically unable to get out of bed. Of course, I highly doubt she expected it to feed my obsessive/ED side and amp up my weight loss, but oh wellz üôÉ",False,False

I notice I bloat a lot less and seem to bounce back from binges easier now that I walk so much. Also, its just so easy to continue being on my feet and walk up to two hours sometimes. Other than walking, I do not like exercise at all. I don't like sweating or struggling or being awkward. Its uncomfortable, exhausting and makes me feel like shit most of the time. I'd love to get into riding a bike or having a treadmill, but that's it. Walking has been a huge improvement for my overall body image (Again, way less bloated, and I see results faster. Especially in my legs and backside which are incredibly stubborn.) and has had a positive effect on my Depression and stress. Its also just really nice.",False,False

I find that cardio encourages ED compulsions for me and perpetuates binge cycles, but weight training doesn't have the same effect and it helps somewhat with my confidence as I enjoy feeling strong and capable. I know there are going to be naysayers who think I'm not truly recovering because I still want to look good and be fit but fuck em, this is my own process, plus physical activity has been important to me since I was a little girl. I don't think I could give it up entirely unless I was very sick or injured badly. I don't see where the harm is if it helps me eat in a more balanced manner.   Currently I lift, do resistance training, bodyweight stuff, and yoga in addition to having an active job. I don't really have a set routine, I just do whatever I feel like that day. I feel as though that helps me avoid falling into obsessive patterns.   As with bulking, I just bit the bullet and jumped in. It may be helpful for you to know that a lot of the initial weight gain is muscle (newbie gains) and water. The higher intake sucked at first for me, I was stuffed and bloated all the time, but eventually my digestive system got used to it. Plus it's a great motivator at the gym because the strength gains are impressive. I've reached the point of where I don't even want to restrict and I'm bummed out if I can't get enough to eat in a day since I know my performance won't be as great the following day. If you bulk slowly at a small surplus, fat gain should be minimal while you get much stronger, and a leaner, more toned physique. Also it can be helpful if you have other activities that you enjoy or are interested in pursuing, it offers an incentive to eat and get stronger. For instance I'm looking forward to bouldering and mountain climbing this summer, and want to be in tip-top shape for it.   Hope this helps!",False,False

I‚Äôm just a baby powerlifter with a wonderful coach who knows about my disordered eating and is working with me on harm reduction in addition to programming my weight training.   It‚Äôs been a great way of refocusing my intense competitive energy from ‚ÄúI need to be skinny at all costs‚Äù to ‚ÄúI need to be athletic/capable and think of looking shredded as a sweet, sweet reward‚Äù if that makes sense.   He actually looks at my body check photos with me and points out where my muscles have developed and where fat has visibly been reduced. He doesn‚Äôt shut down my negative self-talk, but he makes a point not to contribute to it and instead highlights my lifting progress.   He helps me think rationally about my calorie needs and macros. He has never once shamed me for binging or needing to count my calories! We have agreed to move slowly to increased calories and someday (lol) eat intuitively.  He gently discourages me from weighing myself every day (or multiple times a day fml) and doesn‚Äôt push me to try to be in a specific weight class.   It‚Äôs a lot of work. I see my coach more often than I see my boyfriend. But this time last year I was EC stacking and heavily restricting and feeling like absolute shit all the time. I quit my job at the peak of my ED behaviors because I was fucking burnt out.   I‚Äôve put back on some weight and I‚Äôm not 100% okay with it. But I look JACKED compared to a few months ago. Did I weigh myself three times this morning? Yes. Did I track all of my food for today? Yes. But I am also eating much more protein and have real energy to get through the day. It‚Äôs progress.   Tl;dr good coaching is priceless. Getting muscular and lean has been more rewarding and doable than simply dropping weight.",False,False
