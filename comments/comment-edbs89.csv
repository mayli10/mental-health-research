Once I watched a girl eat a PB&amp;J and I think I almost cried.   Plus, when I was home alone, I used to literally stick my face into containers in my fridge and just,,, inhale it,,, the smell of food. I would bake my family brownies all the time just to smell. And, probably the most concerning one, I would get junk food like Snickers or cupcakes and literally squeeze them to pieces in my hands just to feel what they felt like, then throw them out. I'm an environmentalist too, so that's a pretty big low for me.",False,False
