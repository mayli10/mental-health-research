emc8pbl,t3_bjps6w,t3_bjps6w,Aleph0-4,1,2019-05-02 13:45:26,/r/EDAnonymous/comments/bjps6w/baths_are_the_best/emc8pbl/,"For those interested, here is the link I found for the study that was done [https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/23328940.2017.1288688](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/23328940.2017.1288688).   From what I understood, passive heating increased calorie expenditure by 84% for 'normal weight' men and 74% for overweight men from trying to regulate body temperature in the bath (40 degree celcius) and the effect levels off over time. So several short baths might be best.   Based on a TDEE of 1400 kcal, that is around 58 per hour, the increase would amount to 40-50 calories although we'd need to account for muscle and fat percentages.   At first, I was skeptical because popular science articles seem to sensationalise and exaggerate findings but 40 kcal for free seems like a good deal to me although if you didn't enjoy baths, exercise seems to be a much better option (increasing calories expended by 600-700% of resting rate).",False,False
