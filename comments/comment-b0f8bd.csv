The lady was really nice and she didn’t get angry at me for being late because I got lost in the hospital and she was really understanding and stuff   I talked to her for like over an hour about everything and she said we’ll need a second appointment to complete her assessment of me because even in that time we didn’t cover all of the fucked up shit that’s wrong with me.  She said she can’t tell me definitively or diagnose me until we’ve had the second appointment but in her personal opinion I do have an eating disorder, which feels validating i guess? I was worried they wouldn’t believe me or would laugh at me because i’m still so fat.",False,True
