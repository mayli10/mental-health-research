Ana, Mia, and Ortho all have aspects that are unique to them so less relatable.",False,False

I don't know of any other subs except for r/EDanonymemes  Tumblr recently started cracking down on ED stuff too.",False,False

It’s not like they can’t be spoken about at all we just have to unfortunately use other subs,False,True

The previous version of this sub was banned, along with most of the subs that popped out afterward to replace it. This one miraculously survived.   Most of the same people are here, I think, they just don't comment as blatantly because we all want this sub to survive.",False,False

Reddit really cracked down on this community a while ago, resulting in everyone being afraid to share their actual thoughts on anorexia. BED was not targeted as heavily.  This is still a great community, but it's sensored. Not by the sub mods exactly, but out of fear of being banned again.",False,False
