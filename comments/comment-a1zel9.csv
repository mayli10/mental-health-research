Second, IMO/IME restaurants are worse for this than packaged food, because serving sizes can vary so much more depending on who makes it, manager policy, etc.  Third, sometimes companies like this list the calories for dishes as an addition to a kind of ""base"" calorie. There was a big stink a little while ago when it turned out a fast food chain (don't remember which one, would definitely name n shame if I did) artifically deflated its calorie counts by not including the rice in the listed calories for their dishes. So maybe potentially in this case there is a base calorie count for the ramen noodles somewhere, and then each dish adds on an extra number of calories based on the broth, toppings, etc.  That said - I just Googled the dish, and honestly, 450 doesn't seem too far off...? Most of the volume seems to come from soup and most of the calories would probably come from the noodles. It looks like it's just a bowl of ramen broth, noodles, and a grilled chicken breast/thigh on top, right? It's not even breaded from what I can see. It looks like they're intentionally keeping this dish low as a diet option. The count does seem maybe a little low, but I would estimate 500-and-something, 600 max. Again, it's hard without a sense of scale, but I think the amount of broth and the presentation make it look like way more food than it really is. Plus our perceptions of serving sizes are often warped in one direction or another.  Anyway! I wouldn't worry about it too much, especially since you didn't finish it. Broth fills you up like crazy for a relatively small amount of calories. I would say 450 would be accurate enough to not worry about it, but add on an extra 100 if you want to be sure to account for percentage of accuracy.",False,False
