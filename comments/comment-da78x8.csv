You told him straight up it makes you uncomfortable, and then he did it RIGHT AFTER to test your boundaries, to see if you will stay firm or if he can keep pushing things further. If it makes you uncomfortable, tell him, in NO UNCERTAIN TERMS, ""this needs to stop. It makes me uncomfortable. I laughed it off because I didn't no how to react, but I am not okay with it. If you do it again, I will stop talking to you. Please respect my body and my wishes for it."" If he does it again, call him out on it. He'll probably say he forgot or he thought you were joking- that's not true. If he respects your wishes that's good- maybe he really was confused at first. But if he doesnt respect your wishes you need to cut him off because he WILL try to escalate things further. Like, trust me, I've been there, things will be escalated and it would be really shitty to have something happen to you   You deserve respect. Please don't let this guy treat you badly just because you are insecure. How you feel about your body does not need to be how other people treat your body.  I hope nothing I said came off as harsh- I'm just being protective. This world has too many girls get assaulted and then re-assaulted and if I could help you prevent that I want to.",False,False

This is exactly the same story women in shelters tell. You're not stupid or anything, you're just in a shitty situation.

Also, it's never a joke to grab someone's boobs, especially if they already said not to. It's literally always assault, legally and objectively. He is sexually assaulting you on a regular basis and has refused to listen to you. Stop. I know it's super easy to say to yourself ""it's not a big deal"" or ""I should have done something to make him stop earlier"" or ""he's a nice guy, he didn't realize"". That's bullshit though. He knows what he's doing, that's why he's doing it. He even told you he wants to fuck you. This dude is like 1 drink away from being rapist. I'm not fucking kidding here. Run. Run away. Don't walk.

Listen to me. It LITERALLY DOES NOT MATTER if he's nice or funny or listens to you or is the only person you talk to. None of that matters. It might not seem like it, but this is a person who doesn't respect boundaries. If he doesn't respect boundaries that means he doesn't respect the word ""no"". GET FAR AWAY FROM HIM RIGHT NOW.

A friend would respect that you don‚Äôt want to be touched. Also weird AF to be grabbing at your ‚Äúfriend‚Äôs‚Äù boobs and butt. I have male friends and we will lay on each other‚Äôs lap, or give a back rub and even kiss each other on the cheek affectionately but I couldn‚Äôt even imagine one of my guy friends groping my tits or smacking my ass like a side of beef. That‚Äôs not friendly behavior.   You are within your rights to drop him like a hot potato immediately, right now, but you might find that hard because you feel it‚Äôs your fault for not being forceful enough. That‚Äôs not your fault at all. He should have stopped and apologized the first time you said you didn‚Äôt like it.
