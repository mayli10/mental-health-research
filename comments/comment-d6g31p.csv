I can weigh in the 120's and look fatter than someone my height that's in the 140's or 150's. Maybe they have more muscle, or no loose skin (After 3 kids, I do) idk whatever it is it just sucks. I feel like I'd have to get down to 100lbs to actually look thin.",False,False

I have a high body fat percentage and zero real muscle definition, plus i bloat so easily. I know the more common insecurity here is the thighs, but for me it's my calves that seem perpetually swollen and make me stand out next to people who are close to my weight or even higher. Also my shoulders and hips are wider than average (that is, the average around me currently). I tend to buy men's shirts because they just fit them better, which i'm fine with honestly, but it never fails to make me feel bulky and huge when i'm surrounded by so many petite, narrow shouldered girls (like i am now).",False,False
