I feel every word of it to my core..      My bf had a really normal and happy upbringing too. We were recently spending time with my hyper critical mother which eventually left me in tears in the car home, and trying to explain to him why the things she says are still so painful. How unhappy i was for my entire teenage years and regardless of how much ive changed and grown up and improved myself its all stripped away and i feel like a sad, self-conscious, chubby, worthless, oversensitive little girl again. I feel like its so ingrained i will never really escape it. He couldnt really respond so we just sat in silence. I felt so ashamed having to put this on him because it was almost like... he didnt have the software to be able to process this situation. What do you say to someone from a dysfunctional unhappy family when youve had this picture perfect healthy upbringing? I hate that im like this.        I see all this insidious fucking bullshit every day, on reddit, at work, people i care about... and i cant fucking say anything i cant do anything because its just everywhere and so accepted and expected that i just look like a crazy bitter bitch. I just try not to care anymore or I fear my presence in general is just becoming depressing for the people around me. It kind of makes me want to die too... not even out of being actively suicidal but like...what else do you do?",False,False

The description of your childhood is so close to mine. I was a C cup when I was 12 and a 32DDD by the time I was 14 and I learned from such a young age that my only worth to most men was my body and sex. I grew up feeling so ashamed of myself ... I remember crying to my mom when I was 13 because a man cat called me and she told me I need to not wear such tight shirts if I didn‚Äôt want to be sexualized. I felt so ashamed and dirty because I had just put on a shirt, I was a kid, it wasn‚Äôt even that tight .... I obsessed about that for months feeling ashamed of myself. I think my ED is mostly an extension of that shame.   I‚Äôve had many conversations with my boyfriend about this because even though he tries to understand, he can‚Äôt. I sometimes feel resentful of him because he tells stories from his childhood of his parents supporting his interests, of him being carefree and having fun and enjoying being a kid and being a teenager. And I can‚Äôt relate because when I look back on that time all I can remember is overwhelming shame and insecurity, how I gained weight in high school and even at a BMI of 23 or so people were making fun of me for being fat and my mom was telling me to eat less and criticizing what I wore. And I think about getting harassed and being molested at 15 and again at 17 and all the time thinking it was my fault for being so fat and ugly, for being curvy and having an ‚Äúadult‚Äù body, for flirting with boys I liked, just anything I could use to blame myself really. And I think about how fucking common that story is, how my best friend went through the same thing and so did like most other women i know and I feel so fucking sad and angry.   It should not be fucking normal to go through this. When people dismiss women‚Äôs issues and act like it can‚Äôt be all that bad I just wish they could go and experience all the pain that I and so many other women have. My boyfriend doesn‚Äôt understand why I get so mad when the first comment on every stupid fucking Reddit post with a woman visible in it is ‚Äúfuck she‚Äôs hot I would do her‚Äù or ‚Äú10/10‚Äù or ‚ÄúI‚Äôm gonna fap to this‚Äù. He says it‚Äôs just immature guys and I should ignore it. But I‚Äôve been trying to ignore those immature guys for like 15 fucking years. And those immature guys have harassed and assaulted me. Comments like that are what made me develop an eating disorder in the first place. They fucking hold weight for me.  I guess this comment got a bit off topic but fuck. I get so heated about this. Thank you for posting this. I want so bad to make things better for the next generation of girls. I teach preschoolers and some of them already show signs of worrying about their appearance which is fucking disgusting. They pick it up from their moms and female relatives. A girl flippantly said she can‚Äôt eat candy because it will make her fat. I asked her why she thought that and she said her mom said that about herself. It just makes me so sad. She‚Äôs 5 fucking years old.   The way that society is set up just fucking gets me down because I sometimes feel like people especially men don‚Äôt even fucking see women as people at all if they aren‚Äôt attractive / fuckable. And they‚Äôll say as much, even in Reddit comments. (I.e. asking if she‚Äòs hot anytime anyone mentions a girl in any fucking capacity). It weighs on me every single day and I just want to die sometimes to get rid of that weight on me ",False,False

From what I've seen, boys tend to more commonly idolize superheroes and athletes and musicians, all people who tend to have nice bodies. And body dysmorphia is pretty common among dudes who work out. It's a common topic in bodybuilding and other fitness subreddits/forums. Not to detract from what you're saying, but I wish this got more attention because it's not just a female issue.",False,False

People even refuse to believe it, refuse to listen, refuse to even acknowledge that there's a clear bias against women in regard to appearance. I don't know why it's denied, but I've been assuming it's partly not recognizing it in themselves, not recognizing it in others, or simply not believing this is the type of society we live in.   &gt;almost all women characters are played by extremely thin actresses. The heavier girls play characters that are ‚Äúdefined‚Äù by their heaviness, I.e. there are running jokes throughout the movie or tv show about her being the ‚Äúfat one‚Äù or how she has to have this huge boisterous personality as a form of apology for being so big  There's also this weird thing where unattractive (define it in any way you wish) men can get whatever physically attractive woman they want in fiction, or where all women must somehow fall into a similar box of attractiveness, regardless of their race, profession, or even simply what's expected in terms of variation of physical features.   It's so frustrating, and to some degree, it's like you're damned if you do and damned if you don't. If you 'give in' to the pressure, you're vain and stiff and upholding the expectations, but if you don't, you're rejected and shat on. It really makes me glad to see what has changed in children's media, and hopefully it will lead to children growing up with even slightly different (and less restrictive) ideas for what they should look like. As much as Steven Universe gets flack, the main cast all being as varied as they are is a good thing and other cartoons with human/humanoid characters should definitely take note. ",False,False
