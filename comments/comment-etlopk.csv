Gray day at work, got to play lava monster with the kids for the first time since November (I work as an after school care aid, grades K—5) love the kids. Mild overeating today. Feel stupid for doing so but can’t fix the past. Sang Frank Sinatra’s my way on the way home from work. I lot of if unfortunate events have happened to me this semester, most of which I brought upon myself but goddamnit I got a 4.7 GPA and nobody can take that away from me. Been doing too much bench lately, want to do pulling exercises in the gym tomorrow. Thinking pullups and rows. I am the master of my fate and captain of my soul.   Tonight I will not use screens past 9:00 pm as screen uses degrades sleep quality.  Wish you all the best. -qwerty",False,True
