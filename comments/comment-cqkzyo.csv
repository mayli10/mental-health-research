Are you me....he’s not my bf but we fuck and act like a fucking couple..... and we actually got into a fight because we were drunk one night and I convinced him to put me on his ig story...and I actually felt cute in the boomerang(?) video thing? And within the hour he deleted it and I didn’t find out till the next morning and I was so sad and embarrassed. When I confronted him he said he didn’t wanna do it in the first place. Like wtf. Just say no and tell me that I’m an ugly fat fuck!!!!!!!   I’m sorry he doesn’t take pics of you!! Boys don’t get that these little things make us feel really good especially when our appearances matter so fucking much to us! It’s so corny and I feel like I would actually hate it but Im secretly jealous of girls who have bfs who post pics of them :-(   But yeah boys are clueless and no matter how many hints we drop they will never fucking get it.  (If I was at your art show I would take pics of you and your art! I bet it’s great!!),False,False
