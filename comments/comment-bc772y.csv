They weighed me again about a day later when I got up to my room and the guy was like that can’t be right we have to zero the bed. I told him it was probably right and that I always gain from the fluids and he was like not THAT much and i asked him how much, he told me 12lbs. It was right. It obviously came off quick but still I could literally feel my stomach jiggling.",False,False

Back pain whole nine yards. Honestly tums and digestive tea seriously worked the best for me. Carbs bloat me specifically the worst, just don’t try to suck it in with something tight just wear something loose for a bit. Good luck hope you feel better soon",False,False

I didn’t look the same. It all depends on how much sodium you’ve taken in as well.. my binges usually carried a fair amount (bagels, protein bars etc). Not only was I bloated, dehydrated, full &amp; heavy the next morning but I even tasted salt in the mouth, no joke. I would chew gum &amp; it would taste disgusting. Nightmare.  Remember that when you eat a lot of salty processed items, your body freaks out &amp; holds on to water because it thinks you’re going to dehydrate. You can lose it by 1) sweating 2) peeing 3 waiting it out.",False,False
