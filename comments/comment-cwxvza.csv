I asked to borrow my friends draw strong shirt and couldn’t get them past my thighs. Most embarrassing moment ever.  I always offer my friends to wear my clothes and they politely decline and I can tell it’s because they know it won’t fit.   I always want to be the friend who is too skinny for other people’s clothes.,False,False
