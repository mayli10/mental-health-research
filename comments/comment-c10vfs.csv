I tried really hard to drag myself out of my bad mood but just couldn’t get back into it. I think I put on a good enough act to make future SIL’s day special though. I definitely broke down after dinner when I got in the car and still feel like shit now but I’m not going to let myself give in to her negativity and delay the puppy again, as I’ve been doing for years. I want to start moving my life forward and doing things that make me happy",False,True

Now that I have that information, I give you full permission to give yourself permission to ignore every negative thing she said to you about getting a puppy. I’m sorry she made you feel bad. Honestly, it sounds like this would be really good for you. Please don’t let your mom discourage you. I know she means well and you love her, but parents are human and they don’t always have the best advice even though we sometimes think they do.   How did the rest of the bridal events go?",False,False

Dogs are pretty much my whole life and I get so much satisfaction from training them and being around them in general. I wish she could understand that",False,True

I have devoted my life to my family and I wanted to do something that would make me happy. I decided I was finally going to get a puppy.   Hey, this was a great idea.It's shitty that your mom puts artificial restrictions on how to succeed at what she's trying to chew you out for not doing, just so she can act like you don't have a damn good point.  Making friends over dogs is the fucking best wholesome shit. If that isn't good ""socialization"", I don't know what is.  I hope she lets you get your pup soon. Keep at it, okay?",False,False

It sounds like your mom is just worried and wants to protect you from disappointment. However, there is potential for literally anything in life to have a disappointing result and if you lived your life thinking that about everything, you’d also miss out on a lot of rewarding stuff. It seems like it could be good for you to have a little buddy to take care of and it could also help you socialize.  I’d just take your mom’s words with a grain of salt. Is it possible that maybe she just doesn’t want a dog in the house?",False,False
