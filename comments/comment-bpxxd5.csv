Most meds nowadays are weight neutral. Hell, I even lost 35lbs while on abilify (which is an atypical antipsychotic). Some meds may increase your appetite but since I imagine you are counting calories anyway you wont just gain weight outta thin air.   Meds I've been on that havent personally affected my weight: prozac, zoloft, abilify, effexor, paxil, wellbutrin, pristiq   Weight loss: trintellix and lexapro. I was so sick on them I couldnt eat and felt like i was gonna hurl all the time. Trintellix was esp bad and I'm pretty sure i had a mixed episode on it (not bipolar, just treatment resistant depression)  Weight gain: cymbalta. I'd get dizzy and faint if I didnt eat enough and always had to carry an emergency granola bar. Gained 40lbs. It did save my life but i was on it for longer than I should have been and also was on 90mg, a pretty high dose.",False,False
