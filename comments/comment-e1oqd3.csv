Can speak from experience.)   binges always hurt my stomach and lead to purging so it might be helpful to try OMAD or have smaller meals a couple times a day w some snacks to up the calories, just to try to gain a healthy amount? Idk what your situation is like with your parents but the best solution would be to try to set boundaries with them regarding your health and weight rather than to try to worry the doctor in such a short amount of time. Best of luck ðŸ’–",False,False
