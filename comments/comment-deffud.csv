Typically they wouldn't cause your poop to change color unless the brand that you had was purple. 20mg of any of that isn't going to cause severe issues, especially over 48 hours. If you can think back to what you ate and drank, that'd be a good idea. Poop being maroon can mean blood in stool, so if you're unsure that it's something in your food, please call your doctor.",False,False
