I couldn't afford therapy because our insurance didn't cover it. None of the insurance policies in my hoe country cover psychotherapy. I had to ignore my problems until I moved out to Germany and now they've gotten worse. Fortunately, my German health insurance covers mental health treatment. So, I'm using the benefit and finally going to a therapist.  It sucks that therapy is so expensive in some parts of the world. People dying out here wtf",False,False

Thankfully, I don't struggle with binging anymore, but out of all of my Ed behaviors, it was by far the worst in every way. I remember so many times just crying because I was eating food I didn't even want trying to cover up hurts I wasn't even completely aware of. What I did, was try my best to fix the things in my life that were causing the hurt and the stress, and subsequently, the binging. And, make sure you're not restricting. I used to restrict/fast all day because I felt bad about binging, and then over eat at night, which would lead to another binge. Also, find more coping mechanisms. I made myself a list of things that made me feel better when I just wanted to binge. I made sure my list was long enough that I could access mostly any of those coping mechanisms at any time. Here are some examples TV, Art, Music, Cleaning, call or text friend (you can ask to vent to them too, if they're close) editing your social media photos in cool ways (concentrate on editing colors, not your shape.) Journaling, and honestly any other hobby you enjoy.",False,False
