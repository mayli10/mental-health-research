It‚Äôs mostly just checking how much circumference you have on your wrist and how hard/bone exposed. It‚Äôs also really fucking obvious because there‚Äôs no reasonable explanation so bad habit,False,False

Wrist wrapping, shoulder touching, clavicle touching, turning sideways when anything reflective is nearby*  I do all this but what is wrist wrapping?  I googled it and looks like just normal tape around the wrist.  What i thought it meant was that when you wrap your thumb and middle finger around your wrist.  I do that all the time.    *Continuing to wear clothes that are ill-fitting (don't want to go shopping)*   yes..",False,False

Having to perform ""rituals"" (peeing beforehand, heating the food several times) at meal times to make the experience perfect   + Refusing to get drinks of any kind as a casual thing.  + Complaining about sleep problems (being really woken up, having trouble falling asleep...)  + Having dizzy spells  + Being able to smell food from a mile away   + Moving constantly (pacing instead of standing while waiting to cross a road, fidgeting when you have to sit down to watch a movie or a show  + Constantly drinking tea",False,False
