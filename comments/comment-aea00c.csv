Not perfect - but the thing is most of the time if I have ED thoughts I don't act on them. I do like the ""thin privilege"" I get with the size I am, probably more than I should, but I figure you gotta work it if you got it. I'm at a disadvantage in other ways (female in a male dominated field, for instance) so use what you got, right?  I think somehow you have a false impression of what I eat; I'll eat basically anything except meat or fish. So the variety is there, and I feel totally fine eating at maintenance. I need to eat enough to run and swim fast. That motivates me. I also HATE bingeing and know restricting sets one up for bingeing, so that helps me eat at maintenance.   126 vs 115, yes and no. I don't like that 126 rounds to 130 because that seems like a big number (sorry if that's triggering or hurtful; I am speaking as honestly as I am able), particularly since I've never weighed that much - so it feels a big number for my body. On the other hand, I'd be scared at 115 lbs that I'd be losing bone density and setting myself up for injury. If I got to pick I'd say 119 lbs, because in my little magical thinking world this is ""less than 120 pounds!"" and apparently I think 4 pounds is magical insurance against the worry I'd have at 115.   You can see from what I just typed out there that I still have the the thoughts - but I'm not acting on them. And that's critical. ",False,True

Do you feel mentally recovered at all? Your diet seems pretty restrictive but do you still feel ok eating at maintenance? Does being at 126 stress you out compared to 115?,False,False

Supported me by unconditional love. Cooked things for me when I asked them to. The single biggest thing was my aunt. When I just needed to be in a different place, I spent the night at her house. When my coach decided I was going to take a day off from running, I called my aunt and asked if I could spend that night before and that day with she and my cousins, because for some reason I knew I would feel relaxed there in a way I wouldn't at home. She said sure. Later, I did that at friends' houses. So that helped, to be in different spaces sometimes. And same thing -- my aunt's family, and my friends' families, let me bring and cook my own food and eat with them if I wanted to. They didn't ask questions. They listened if I wanted to talk about ED stuff, but mostly they interacted with me like they would have interacted with any other relative/friend.   Friends - always invited me to do stuff, even if it involved food. They let me participate as much or as little as I wanted. To continually be included felt good. ",False,True

I was set on running thirteen miles a day. When I lost weight to the point of getting threatened with hospitalization, I finally agreed to run less. I hired a coach and put her in charge of the exercise. She was also in consultation with my MD. My coach helped me stop overdoing it.   I did not take a break. They told me I had to and I refused. It wasn't a ""burn calories"" thing for me; it was the one thing that killed my anxiety. I just could not and would not give that up. The run coach was able to communicate that to my treatment team in a way I could not. She is a runner, as was my therapist, and they were able to say ""this is doing something for her and it's tied to her anxiety.""   I made the choices my recovery process in a way that I think a lot of people don't get to do. My parents weren't keen on hospitalization either for a variety of reasons and they weren't going to force it until it was necessary. My lab work always came back fine; I never fainted; the only medical issue I had was low weight. One bad blood test or one fainting spell and I would have landed in the psych ward. Somehow I avoided issues with the bloodwork. Don't know how. ",False,True

Gained the weight back, didn't deal with any of the mental issues. second occurrence was junior in HS; 110 lbs to 93 lbs. Gained the weight back. Dealt with the mental issues. college and grad school: some issues w/ binge eating (no purging)  What did I tell myself - ""if I do not gain this weight on my own I will end up in the hospital."" I wanted to avoid that at all costs, and I did. I wanted to stay in high school and kick ass academically and in road races. As I gained weight, my treatment team (which was my run coach and a medical doctor and a therapist) convinced my parents to sign waiver forms so I could race. There were other ""deals"" like ""take a day off and you can run an extra 30 minutes tomorrow."" (The standard rule while gaining was I got an hour a day).  I had a very individual, never in hospital recovery program. It was basically ""do whatever the hell you want as long as you gain weight."" What happened was I saw my run times improve SO much so quickly that I was totally on board. That was just able to really quickly overshadow the other stuff.   I also never struggled with the ""I'm going to get fat"" thoughts. I am not sure I ever thought that. I think I had a MUCH easier time gaining the weight, at a half a pound a week, than other people do. No one pushed me to try foods I wasn't ready for, they were happy just to see me gain weight and trusted I'd branch out and eat other stuff. Which I did. It took some years but I did. The thing I had to ""work on"" was how to handle anxiety... I had to work on coping skills like journaling. But the short answer is ""I just didn't want to get stuck in a hospital"" and ""I can run a marathon when I'm at a healthy weight."" Which I did.   sorry that was long. Thanks for the congrats.
