I'm pretty sure *most* of us on here are at an average weight but are all still struggling with an ED. Weight doesn't determine the presence or severity of an ED (even tho the media makes it seem so).,False,False

Itâ€™s an umbrella term for eating disorders that donâ€™t strictly fall under criteria for ARFID, AN, BN, or BED. In some cases, itâ€™s behaviors that are unusual or intermittent. In other cases it describes rapid fluctuations between different sets of extreme behaviors, which seems to be what youâ€™re struggling with. Itâ€™s also the most common diagnosis for ED patients, and a good number of those with that diagnosis are of a normal weight. They wonâ€™t turn you away over your BMI.    This is my personal experience, so it may not apply to you, but when I was like this my behaviors were waaaay more extreme compared to the times when I had strictly BN or AN and I definitely got up to more dangerous shit with EDNOS. Itâ€™s nothing to fuck around with.    Tldr - get help this shit serious",False,False

I don't want to diagnose you, since I'm not a professional, but it really sounds like you have some strongly disordered eating tendencies, and possibly a very serious eating disorder. You don't have to be underweight to suffer from these issues, and it sounds like it's really hurting you a lot. I hope you are able to find someone who will help you recover. ðŸ’•",False,False
