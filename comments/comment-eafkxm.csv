I‚Äôm sorry you have to dread Christmas.   Yeah I have tried no bringing my card with me before too and that does help! But things will be soo stuck on my mind :( I‚Äôll just waste hours and hours thinking about calories or a particular dress I need to go back for.   I think that I don‚Äôt feel enough at all :(,False,True

Like, every time you buy food you‚Äôve done half the work towards eating it (like you‚Äôve done the biological equivalent of ‚Äúthe hunt‚Äù or ‚Äúthe gathering‚Äù) so you‚Äôre buying more and more food to feel like you‚Äôre eating.",False,True

Like I‚Äôm normally so careful with money and freak out about spending it, but lately I just keep buying and buying low cal food. And then I tell myself I have enough and should stop spending. Then I buy more. And I‚Äôm seriously struggling money wise right now so what the fuck is wrong with me?  Sorry I‚Äôm rambling lmao but I‚Äôm glad it‚Äôs not just me",False,False

I've stopped carrying my credit card with me, which has solved a lot of the binging and impulse buying, but that doesn't stop the feeling of wanting more stuff. At the moment, I watch those 10,000 calorie challenges when I want to binge, and add clothes to my online wish lists when I want to shop. It's kind of working for now, but my family always cooks too much on Christmas Day then goes shopping and buys too much the day after, so I'm TERRIFIED for that lol",False,False

I find some new ‚Äúsafe foods‚Äù and I just buy them. Lots. I basically have a grocery store in my room right now. And I‚Äôm restricting a lot so they‚Äôre just sitting here not being used for ages. And I‚Äôm really super broke so I don‚Äôt know why I‚Äôm fucking doing this! Smh.,False,False

Then I‚Äôll finally get whatever piece I was desperate for and get over it pretty quickly. I actually only have like maybe 8 pieces of clothing I truly adore and I kind of wish I just had the courage to purge all but them!!   I have definitely reduced my clothes recently but I feel infected by wanting more üò¨,False,True
