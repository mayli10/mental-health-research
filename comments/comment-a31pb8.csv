I think it might be because of stress because I have finals next week but I’m also kinda paranoid I’ve made myself infertile for the rest of my life (I don’t even wanna have kids?!?) ,False,False

eb2oc0c,t3_a31pb8,t3_a31pb8,snefferu,1,2018-12-04 09:59:13,/r/EDAnonymous/comments/a31pb8/lost_period/eb2oc0c/,"Interestingly my CW is my period threshold. The first time I went under 43kg my periods stopped, though I’d rapidly continued losing. They didn’t return until a year later when I got back up to 43. The second time I was on the pill anyway but I had no periods for about 5 years (the same length of time I was around 37kg). The third time i already had no periods since I’d just had a baby, but they didn’t come back until I was over 43kg.  I’m currently dipping under and over 43 (I’m trying to fight it and get up to 46) and my periods have gone weird. They’re late, they’re early, I get breakthrough bleeding.   I’m not sure if it’s due to my weight or if I’m in early perimenopause (I’m only 37 but apparently underweight at age 18 and at age 35 is highly correlated with early menopause, and I was underweight at both those ages).

I believe it has something to do with protein and fat intake, but I could be completely off base.",False,False
