But the way I try to see it is they made it to do something nice, mission accomplished. They did their good deed and can feel good about it, and I (you) can appreciate the thought/effort that went into it. Whether the food itself ultimately ends up in your stomach or the bin is irrelevant.  (This is the same way I deal with guilt over throwing out food I’ve bought: it’s already been produced, packaged, shipped, and sold. It can now either be “wasted” by me eating it and feeling like shit over it/potentially gaining unwanted weight, or it can be wasted by tossing it away. Doesn’t really matter because either way, it was “wasted” from the moment I bought it.)",False,False

For the last 3-4 months, I’ve been home alone (unemployed) while my husband works. I make him breakfast and lunch, and am able to restrict until dinner.    Good news, I just got a job and I’ll be starting soon. But I’m worried that when I’m getting up to go to work before him, he’ll make sure I eat breakfast and take a lunch. I literally cannot waste food (regardless of whether or not someone made it for me) so I don’t know what to do :/",False,False
