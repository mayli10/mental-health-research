I have a 14 year old son. He and his friends all have gone through a period of not wanting to eat or eating only veg because they wanted to look right. 2 of them lost weight, 1 was slipping toward ED (he isn‚Äôt losing more weight currently, but the mindset still shows). I‚Äôm friends with several of the boys moms and we did not judge them. Society is becoming as hard on males as it is on women about looking a certain way.   And they have been exposed to us, as parents battling our own weight issues. So I don‚Äôt blame them for questioning their bodies at a time that is very insecure already. I was lucky with my son for now at least. I kept reminding him he was already thin and if he wanted to get taller he needed calories. I also provided him with healthy food and home cooked meals for nutrition and to respect his feelings.",False,False
