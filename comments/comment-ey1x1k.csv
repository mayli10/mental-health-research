I've never gotten any negative comments about my weight or body either, it really makes me feel like my personal disgust with myself isn't valid/justified sometimes. I feel as though if I were ever bullied for it I'd instantly burst into tears, since I've never needed to build a thick skin towards negative comments. Makes me wary about getting close to people, particularly romantically. I see so many horror stories on here about SOs saying really insensitive and awful things.",False,False

Plenty of people are bullied for their weight and DON'T develop EDs; whilst bullying may make an ED worse or increase the likelihood of developing one, it doesn't cause them.

For me the restriction started as a teenager as a way to try to control an experience of reality that I didnâ€™t know how to deal with. Nobody had ever taught me how to cope with distress in healthy ways. Restricting made me feel powerful and clean and like I was doing something really well. It was a way to shout back at the tapes in my head telling me I was bad and wrong. It was a way to punish myself so that nobody elseâ€™s hypothetical disapprobation could touch me. Feelings about my body were in the mix, but they werenâ€™t the only driving force, and those negative feelings about my body came about without anyone directly criticizing my physical form.   So, the core of my ED was more about having problem with knowing how to live, and that problem happened to manifest itself through food and my body.",False,False

Your issues are just as valid as anyone elseâ€™s. I have taken shit for my weight (albeit undeservedly) from family and boyfriends but ultimately that is not what causes my disordered eating. It really does come from my inner dissatisfaction with myself and my urge for some sort of control in life. Anyone can relate to that. ðŸ’š,False,False
