We just want people to keep to the rules of posting because we don't want this sub to get banned like the last one.  Kudos to you for surviving med school so far! I'm just beginning that journey haha. That being said, we tend to try to avoid diagnosing people/offering medical advice and try to encourage them to instead talk to their actual doctor. There are so many factors that couldn't be conveyed over the internet, so better that than accidentally give wrong or harmful advice. Otherwise though, I hope find some comfort in this sub; I know I do!",False,False

New users are always welcome (I think I can say this safely on behalf of everyone) and even though it’s sad to see others struggling too, we’re happy to grow our community to be aafe and supportive to everyone. It doesn’t matter how new you are to the sub or your ED history. There’s no “us vs them” mentality, I think the OG’s are more cautious seeing as we lost our original community.  The aim of the sub is to be primarily emotional support. As a fellow meddie, I think it’s okay to share harm reduction advice with some links to evidence-based literature etc.",False,False

I haven’t been at this sub in some time as I’m trying to recover (but I’ll try to mod more!), but I’ve noticed an influx of newcomers and members who’ve not read the rules properly.    Please take the time to read the rules, for the sake of the sub’s survival, and for the sake of each other. It also helps the mods so much when y’all report, so thank you to those that do.",True,False

Are new users a positive thing or negative thing? Are og:s glad that the sub is expanding? Is it ok to be active and comment a lot if you're new here or will the og:s feel offended? Also, I understand that this is a place where it's free to vent out your feelings but if someone literally asks for advice it's ok to give that as in medical advice? I have one year left of med school so I actually have some knowledge a strong reflex to answer/help but as a new user felt insecure so I don't want to comment too much/offend the og:s etc. I feel like my questions seem dumb written out but I'm going to post anyway since I think other new sunscribers might be wondering abt same things. :).",False,False

It seems at least to me that especially in non-English speaking countries - like where I live - and their ed forums get incredibly toxic real quick. I don’t know if people in here are just more shittier or if it has something to do with the language - English is def more polite one - or that people just don’t know how to have a conversation on the internet lol  So I love you guys and I need you guys, let’s keep this place safe and report that kind of behaviour",False,False
