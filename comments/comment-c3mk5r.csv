More than that though, I know my chest bones/sternum would freak a lot of people out even though my lower half still looks normal-thin :/",False,False

Big blue veins sticking out from your arms, legs and stomach.  I repulse myself yet always want to cover my ass and thighs thinking they're too big even though I know that can't be the case because its so damn painful to sit.  Still I cover what my ed tells me are ""PROBLEM AREAS"".   Crazy.",False,False

And then you lose weight and build resentment towards everyone to “get back” at them for something they never felt. So much unjustified effort and misery,False,False

I was at a party recently and noticed some people were looking at me in this odd way, couldn't place it until a really drunk woman grabbed me and said ""Look at those bones go!"" and touched my hipbones through my dress (I was so fucking uncomfortable lmao), and I realised people were looking at me with concern/pity. I've gotten too bony for polite public consumption but I still can't see it clearly despite knowing I'm underweight - when I tried on the dress I told my SO I felt like it made me look chunky around the hips and stomach and he said ""I'm sorry but you're absolutely tripping balls."" I remember being 15 and underweight when this all kicked off and still feeling like everyone's concern over my weight was some kind of collective inside joke whose punchline I wasn't in on. Really illustrates the bizarre double-vision of ED brain - feeling too big despite all evidence to the contrary.",False,False

I get filled with anxiety at the thought of a beach or water park vacation because I’m stuck between “people are going to think my stomach and thighs are fat” and “people are going to know I have a problem and be grossed out by my spine and ribs”,False,False
