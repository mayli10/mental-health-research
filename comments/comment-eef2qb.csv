Maybe browse forums for type 1 diabetics to see what they eat when they experience hypos? I’ve mostly just heard to combine carbs with protein/fat to make the absorption slower but tbh when I experience hypos I’m just worried about not passing out lmao,False,False

I was diagnosed with diabetes type 2 in June but I’ve been off any meds for it for 2 months and have had low blood sugar a lot of the time I’ve checked, so I’m guessing it must be from under eating and not related to my diabetes? My blood sugars have been under control with lifestyle for months  Idk I am obese but restrict heavily, and have lost a lot of weight since August. But I figured because I was obese I’d be less likely to have hypos? But my blood sugar monitor keeps saying I have them lol. But I never feel too terrible though. A few instances I have felt really bad and shaky, but most other times it’s just the general fatigue I always have.   Anyway sorry no advice lmao, but I’m in a similar boat. I do not want to eat more to increase my blood sugar, and I have no had any severe effects from the low blood sugar so of course my disordered mind is telling me it’s all fine?  I guess just monitor it super carefully. And keep an eye on your body for the signs and maybe eat some fruit if you feel it happening and just log it all and make room in your daily limit for it. I don’t really have good advice lol sorry.",False,False

I've had two hypos in the last two days, which has never happened to me before.",False,True

Sometimes a handful of almonds(I know they are high in calories) and they metabolize slower and help you keep level.  If you go with carbs they break down faster and your levels will go wonky again.  I would do some more research into helpful hypo. foods.    Be careful.  I know you know the things but ED brain removes ALL FUCKING LOGIC.  I know there are diabetics with ED that abuse their insulin so they don’t eat and it can make you go blind or kill you.  Not the same, but I would be worried about similar things happening.",False,False
