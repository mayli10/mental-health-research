I was able not to gain in the past by slowly increasing my calorie intake to maintenance. It's better if you add extra calories (100-200 kcal) per week to maintenance until your body gets used to it. It has to be gradual otherwise it'll shock your metabolism after your restrictive diet of 600-700 calories. I also didn't gain weight after by lessening my intake of fatty/greasy food. I would eat it occasionally, but not everyday. For example, today, I'll eat junk food, the next day, I'll try to eat clean, and the following day I'll eat junk again, and so on...  &amp;#x200B;  Hope you're well. Take care!",False,False

I calculated it for a sedentary man at the lowest possible weight for your height so lowest tdee possible for you and it’s well above 1700 calories. It’s is biologically impossible for you to gain,False,False

But when you do eat normally again, start easy, your body is not used to it. Talk to a proffesional to get a special diet so you can work yourself up to normal again.",False,False
