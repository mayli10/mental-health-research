I get what you mean by feeling lazy and dumb and procrastinating. I feel like that 24/7 and part of me feels like it's add/adhd but my parents never let me get diagnosed for that or other mental illnesses as a teen. I'm glad to hear it's helped you!",False,False

I'll break down the costs, Victoria Australia  GP: free/bulk billed. necessary to get a psychiatrist referral  Psychiatrist: I think you can only get private psychiatry here. if there was a free one through the hospital system I think there'd be a an unreasonable wait time. $400 for the initial appointment. like fuck. there was a rebate of $228 so it cost $172 which is a lot of money.   Medication: we have this thing called PBS - Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme - where most medications in Aus will be cheaper if you have a Medicare card which all citizens (and maybe permanent residents?) have. but. here's the kicker. for ADHD meds, you're only eligible for PBS if you have Medicare AND you got diagnosed between the ages of 6 and 18 (inclusive). I was literally 4 days away from not being 18 anymore the day I managed to slot in an appointment. the ritalin I got put on was $18 for a 100 tab supply, 2x a day, and the price is similar PBS/no PBS but other medications like Vyvanse are $75 difference between PBS/non PBS ($40 vs.. $113!!! for a 30 day supply). and just because you didn't get diagnosed as a child. ummm ok  anyway so all up right now I have spent nearly $200 to get diagnosed. there are going to be more costs. another follow up appointment (and probably way more since they're titrating my medication to see if it works well) with a gap after rebate of $140. and more medication costs of about $20 a month possibly for the rest of my life.  but I'm so happy I went and sorted this out. my whole life recently (past 5 years ish) I thought I was lazy, dumb, just a waste of space but it turns out there was something legitimately wrong with my executive functioning. it wasn't all my fault. and I cleaned my room today because of the meds and I'd been putting it off for 2 MONTHS  because I was dreading having to focus on the same thing for a while. my head feels emptier, calmer, organised. I don't feel frantic. I just feel so content, able to idk HANDLE shit. this diagnosis and treatment brought me a lot of peace ❤️",False,True

I was sat in a room with nothing but a screen and a lil clicker thing. I had to put everything I had that I could fidget with (phone, keys, etc.) on a lil table and they had a head tracker thingy as well as a regular camera monitoring me to see how much I paid attention. The ""test"" was that every 5-15 seconds one of four shapes (red square, red circle, blue square, or blue circle) would briefly flash on the screen, and if it repeated I had to click the button. It took 20 minutes and it was torturrrre even the little clicker was like, specifically designed to be impossible to fidget with (I still managed by playing with the cable lmfao). I was legit trying my hardest to answer correctly but I have never fucking been more bored, man. I s2g I was paying attention for *maybe*  5% of the screening.  And dude same I took some Addy for funzies (and just to see how it'd affect me) after I got the screening results and it hardly made me stimmed at all I juat got really calm and relaxed. And this was like, a high fucking dose too lmao.",False,False

I got 7/9 inattentive and 6/9 hyperactive, but he said the hyperactive was probably on the milder side. so curious about the squares and circles thing you talk about!  and like just as an aside, I really wanted to be on the drugs to see if I could get a hyper focus exhilarating high and smash out my uni work (as it's a stimulant) but I guess it's bringing me to equilibrium since it calms me down, my head is so clear (not 70 thoughts going at the same time! what!!). very interesting. but I know the drugs are working even if I'm not getting a speeeeeed effect because my appetite is gone...",False,True
