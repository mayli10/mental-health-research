I developed my issues at a young age. I was always caught in the mindset that everything that was wrong in youth- social ineptitude, never feeling good enough, loneliness- was because of how I looked.   In my older years I had a moment of clarity. Something happened that forced me to look at reality. My world had always been very big and scary  to me, who felt small and vulnerable in my surroundings. I didn't have to worry about my past, present, or future because anorexia made my world small. I was coping with my life by only having one thing that mattered to me.   Now, as a young adult, I have developed bulimia. I know now that my problem (again) is coping with my feelings with an unhealthy relationship with food.",False,False

I have so many emotions my tiny pigeon brain is practically always on the verge of bursting, but my ED is like emotional novocaine. It shuts everything up and completely numbs me out.  Can’t think about how stupid and useless I am if I’m too fatigued to think about anything but food! Don’t need SH if I can accomplish the same thing with purging! Why would I think about killing myself if I have being a skinny queen to look forward to? Nobody ever hated themselves the morning they lose an inch off their hips! When the only emotions I let myself have anymore all revolve around food and body, it’s so comforting that there’s *always* a very simple solution: when I’m anxious about eating food, I just don’t. When I’m sad that I ate something, I can purge. When I’m angry that I gained weight, I know how to lose it again. My other emotions were always complicated and messy; my ED makes my feelings so clean and straightforward.  Wow sorry about the rant my feelings are clearly not as docile as I thought they were",False,False
