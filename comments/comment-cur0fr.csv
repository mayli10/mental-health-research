One year I went from being a classic anorexic to a mild anorexic and then to a normal body, because I got depressed and started eating again. And after you gain 10 lbs, you just get even more depressed and even less able to control your diet, and then you’re in this awful feedback loop that is so hard to escape. I escaped eventually, but man, things sucked. I wouldn’t go outside at almost any cost. I cried all the time and self harmed and not just bc of the chemical depression. And tbqh, one of the reasons I escaped my weight trap was that I found it difficult to eat bc my body made me literally nauseated. God, when my body isn’t where I like it to be? I’m just bitter and miserable and want to die.   Obviously, I’m not saying being thin makes your life great, and I’m not saying it’s good that I value thinness so much that it makes such a big difference to my mental health. But being underweight provides a baseline level of stability for me. For various complex reasons, I literally despise weighing more than 105 lbs max, and I am incapable of functioning when consumed by that kind of hatred.   So yeah, I know the feeling you describe, and it’s fucking atrocious. I’m really sorry you’re going through this.",False,False

Began with restricting/purging, tried to recover, got BED instead. Worst trade deal of the century, maybe ever.    I freaking WISH I was as skinny as back then, when I cried myself to sleep over being ""fat"". I've been dealing with binge eating for 6 years now, and I pretty much gave up on any attempts to get better. I tried every single thing I could and struggled for a long time, but eventually I stopped resisting. I don't have what it takes. At this point it feels like it's just meant to be. The goals of ""recovery"" or even ""weight loss"" are too far away now for me to even consider. I have to avoid reflective surfaces in order to not get an anxiety attack, I have completely isolated myself from everyone, and I rarely leave home. Self harm is the only thing that helps me, albeit temporarily, relieve the intense feelings of anger and disgust I feel towards my body, so that's what I do most of my days.   Binge eating and weight gain ruined all of my chances at ever getting better. They ruined my life. Thanks, shitty brain. Thanks a fucking lot.",False,False

TW numbers idk how to mark spoilers on mobile.  I used to weigh between 91lbs and 98lbs effortlessly when younger, hit 18 and drank too much and got lax with eating and ate what I want and got up to about 130lbs which isn’t a massive gain but I felt huge in comparison.  Recently got back down to 120lbs and I know that being in the 90s is unhealthy for my height but I still don’t feel like me anymore :( no matter how much I restrict I can’t get lower recently, feel so uncomfortable in my body and always feel fat and think I look massive even tho that’s like, not possible.  I hold my jeans up and I’m like how do I fit in these I’m huge... sorry bit of a tangent but I relate so so hard",False,False

It was only like 8 pounds but holy hell it makes a big difference. Brought me from p underweight to just about a normal weight.   I don’t look sick anymore which like yay great but bring on the fuckin invalidation. Also my boobs are huge and I hate them.,False,False

Think of it like this. I'm a bad driver, I admit it. I was going too fast once time and took a turn too fast on an icy road, ran up onto a curb and bent my rim, which cost me over $100 to repair. I didn't think ""I fucked up and bent one rim, so I might as well bend the other 3."" Instead I thought ""FUCK I have to spend $100, I better be careful so I don't need to spend any more money.""   And your body and health are more important than money, so it's even more important to try to take care of it :)",False,False

Life is so complicated now...use to eat/measure everything that went into my mouth each day.  It was the exact same this - nothing complicated.  I was super thin and happier then.    Now I just want to eat everything cause I figure 'why the hell not?'.  I'm not thin anymore...(like pierrottriste commented) I cry every day now.    Now I'm gaining weight - stomach is huge (it really is huge...not 'all in my head'!) - everything is different.  HATE the mirror.  And I'm still suppose to gain 'lots more'...which is happening cause I'm eating lots of crap.  My doctor informed that I'm to go to hospital this Monday.  I've been there twice now and each time I come out of there as a whale.,False,False
