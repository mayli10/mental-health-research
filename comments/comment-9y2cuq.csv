I think it’s organic and fair trade too. Different vessels have different levels of caffeine, but also typically have sugar in them. I love the unsweetened versions in the glass bottles, but I also don’t eat much sugar and don’t like/refuse to drink things with fake sugar in them so my tastes might be way off! ",False,False

Just something I haven't heard of, la croix gets boring after a while....    So don't want to drink diet coke or monster , not sure why I would be ok with mountain dew....

It's really dangerous to consume caffeine on an empty stomach as well, as I'm sure you know. But to answer your question, Diet Mountain Dew has a fair amount of caffeine and has 0 calories. It probably won't do much for you if you're used to Monster but it does have a higher caffeine content than Diet Coke.",False,False
