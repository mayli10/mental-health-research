If they feel able to help and feel outpatient care is an effective route for your situation, it might just get folded into the therapy you have now. That’s what’s happening for me currently. If they feel their training and experience aren’t sufficient to give you good support, they might refer you to an ED specialist. If you’re mentally or physically in a precarious place, hopefully they’ll create a safe environment so you can talk openly with them about what the best options for you are. Since you’re legally an adult, they shouldn’t be able to tell anyone anything without your written consent, nor be able to force any action unless they have reason to fear for your immediate safety.   My philosophy with my therapist is they can’t help with what they don’t know about. It can be scary to disclose something when we’re not sure how they’ll respond or what the consequences (both desired and undesired) might be. I’m fortunate to have a therapist that’s very good at responding in a gentle, non-judgmental way, and that makes it a lot easier. I hope your providers offer a similar sense of safety &lt;3",False,False
