That habit is way worse for you than any amount of extra weight, even if it doesn't feel that way. I know it's really hard, but try to remind yourself of that - you've already dropped an unhealthy habit even before the new year! Go you!!  As for your counting issue, I get it. I *so* get it. I need to lose weight too but anytime I count I go crazy. So I don't. I try to eat healthy most of the time (which if I get too obsessed can also lead to a different disorder oops, but for now it's working). It sounds like you have that option too - you can try to just follow your dietitian's meal plan without counting. If you've already memorized all the calories, try asking for a new one and keep yourself from adding everything up on that one too. Exercise without numbers - no treadmills, ellipticals, stationary bikes, fitbits, steps, etc. Just walk, or lift, or run outside, or take a workout class at the gym, or do yoga. If you're at a deficit from your eating you won't even need to know the numbers from exercise, and it'll turn into an enjoyable habit rather than a guilt-ridden punishment or chore.   I know this is an ed sub and you and I and all of us have ed's so any attempt to lose weight ""healthily"" without taking the enormous time and effort to recover first will just be another slippery slope to the same or a different disorder, but since you have the support of a dietitian already, and maybe with a therapist and GP, you can do it. I believe in you with my whole heart. I know you can beat this, not necessarily now or next week or even next year, but you *want* to and that's enough to start. No zero days, remember? You're already at one.",False,False

So I've already given my body a break. I havent been tracking. God how I hate tracking. I have a healthy plan from my dietitian but I get compulsive about needing to count. Every. Single. Time. It's like I cant not do it and just eat healthy. It's only the last two weeks since I quit purging again that I know I've gained and I'm too afriad to weigh myself. I kinda had one half ass purge before the holidays but I stopped after one go. I binged 3 more times and didnt purge. ,False,True

Those are not your only two options. You can simply track to maintain for a while, and give yourself a break. Weight loss is most sustainable when attained with healthy methods- perhaps while giving your body this break, you could work on this, too.   &amp;#x200B;",False,False
