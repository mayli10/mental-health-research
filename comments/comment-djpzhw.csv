I might allow myself a 97 calorie shot of gin but otherwise I get soda water and pretend to drink with my friends.  Its kinda fun...sometimes.,False,False

As a bartender, I can promise you that much. Diet coke vs regular coke is such a fear for me though I dont even drink it when I'm out because I cant tell the difference when its mixed with alcohol. Super terrifying. So I definitely understand where you're coming from. Also, mistakes can happen, especially if we're busy, so if you taste tonic totally ask for a new drink.",False,False

However I do work at a bar and my bartenders are familiar with my catch phrase “I’ll have sugar when I’m dead” so I can have more confidence then the average.   If you really are paranoid you can go up to the bar and ask to try a sip of the soda water first and watch them use the gun. Then determine if you like it then ask for a vodka soda.,False,False
