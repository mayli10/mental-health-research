My grandma used to tell me that she used to be incredibly skinny and misses that time, as she met my grandpa back then.  My mom was BONES at my age, and now has quite literal BED(which gave her diabetes) she constantly talked about food(back when we talked lol haven't seen her in 4 years), she said she used to avoid food and felt horrible.  My sister literally got hospitalised twice when she was 14 and 16.   My aunt oNlY eAtS nAtUrAL aYuRvEdA shit and seems to REALLY hate herself if she deviates from the diet even a little bit and then isolates herself.",False,False

I think you’re right about the times being different. My grandma was a stay-at-home mom and cooked my mom and my uncle all their meals while they were growing up. After women started entering the workplace, I think they had less time to cook for the family so that’s when people started turning to the convenience of fast food. Just a theory tho.",False,True

I’ve always wondered about maintaining and all that. Also, I think times were different back then. It’s so weird. I remember I was uw in high school and couldn’t fit into a pair of shorts that my mom wore in her twenties!!",False,False
