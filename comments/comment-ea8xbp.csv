Cut to now, not rowing anymore (but maybe starting again soon) and 9kg heavier. The knowledge that I've lost a lot of muscle too and I've probably gained even more than 9kg of fat depresses me. I guess I'm back to restricting.",False,False

I hit 85 last year and every since a Christmas cruise last year (2018) I've been binging interspersed with short periods of restriction. As a result I'm up to 104. Yesterday I started back on restriction for real because I can't continue like this. I try to remind myself that yes I've messed up and gained but it's within my power to lose the weight again as long as I stay motivated.,False,False
