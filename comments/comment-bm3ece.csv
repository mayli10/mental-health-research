Personally I was always fine until I was underweight, then I felt sick constantly.",False,False

It's so easy to slip from bingeing to restricting to purging to fasting, without your higher-level consciousness being involved in the decision, and at a high weight, you can restrict heavily without really having a major resource crisis for quite a while.",False,False

So to answer your question (kinda), don’t worry, you’re not going to die. And it’s so great that you posted here because you are definitely not alone in your struggle.   It sounds like you are experiencing depression. Is there a friend or family member you can talk to? You don’t have to really get into it if you don’t want to, but please let someone know how you’re feeling so they can step in if needed.   I’m not sure where you are but see if there’s a hotline you can call to get some help. You deserve to feel content and confident every day. There is nothing wrong with you.",False,False

Fasting depletes magnesium, potassium, and sodium stores which can lead to issues with energy, feeling dizzy, nausea, and a bunch of other stuff. The fasting sub has more information on this in their wiki/about. Worth a read to get yourself educated on harm prevention measures.  Honestly though it sounds like you could also be experiencing severe depression rather than physical inability to get up and move. Highly recommend contacting a mental health service in your area ASAP to get an assessment. If it’s this bad then you may need medication to get you up to a baseline where you can live and function enough to start getting better.  Finally, try not to punish or deprive yourself like this. Binging sucks and feels awful and hating the body you inhabit is truly a miserable feeling. But you don’t need to punish yourself. Choosing regular meals of vegetables, lean proteins, and snacks like fruit and plenty of water are a much better way to recover from extended binging.   I’m sorry that you’re struggling so much right now and I hope things improve for you soon",False,False
