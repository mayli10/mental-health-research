He never fully understood my eating disorder, he would say stuff like how he admired my self control etc. He was never particularly comforting. Maybe that's why I started resenting him more? Idk, either way he understands better now.   He says that he doesn't have an eating disorder, he's just being healthy. I can only hope that is true.",False,True

I never intentionally hurt him. I've tried to tell him that I love him no matter what his weight is but I don't think he believes me. He just said that he wasn't happy with himself when he was fat and he is glad I encouraged him to diet. I'm not sure what else I can do to improve the situation",False,True

I’m not saying this to be mean - it’s just frustrating because my ex-boyfriend used to do the same thing and then was like ‘why aren’t you eating? what’s wrong with you?’ when my response was to just starve so he would shut up.  if you really care about him, you need to re-evaluate the way you act around him and treat him.",False,False
