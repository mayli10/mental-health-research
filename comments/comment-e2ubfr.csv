So fucking painful when it does happen cause the pertinent body parts are NOT warmed up, and meanwhile I'm bloated as fuck and the scale hasn't changed which I'm pretty sure makes no sense with the LAWS OF THERMODYNAMICS but I'm no scientist.  The worst part is that today I kept smelling body odor...I rarely sweat to the point of BO and I have a good odor neutralizing deodorant so it's never an issue, so I thought it was someone else all day.

It’s contraindicated with cardio because each increases heart rate, and cardio burns a similar amount of calories.
