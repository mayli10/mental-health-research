My therapist knows I'm not ready to recover, so instead of working towards recovery we work on harm reduction. Her only request is that I'm honest with her, which I am.   I do find it helpful to talk with her about my ED, even if I might never recover. Sometimes its nice to just have someone to talk to without worrying about triggering them or saying the wrong thing.  You could tell your therapist that you're not ready to recover, but you're willing to discuss your ED, and be honest about it with them. I guess it really depends on how comfortable you are with your therapist.",False,False
