I was never underweight but was moderately to severely anorexic based on how bad my symptoms were.   I never felt like I would be diagnosed as anorexic because I never was underweight. Thank god i had a great treatment team who validated my ed and were able to treat it.    Any one who doesn’t believe a person can be a “healthy” weight and anorexic is wrong, and perpetuating the cycle of body image issues, and would rather a person get sicker and sicker before they’re able to diagnose and treat something correctly. It took months to convince my insurance to cover my treatment even though I wasn’t underweight, and after a therapy season who’s notes were going to them to build my case, I pretty much said I would never stop until they believed me, no matter how much it costed. They quickly approved any treatment I needed.",False,False

In the DSM-V, the presence or severity of anorexia isn't only determined by BMI, but a multitude of things such as its effect on your quality of life, how much you restrict, medical issues associated with your ED, etc.  Even tho my BMI was normal, I was diagnosed with moderate-to-severe anorexia because of the severity of my restriction &amp; other physical symptoms like shortness of breath (which got bad enough to land me in the ER), low blood pressure, intolerance to cold, severe migraines, etc.",False,False
