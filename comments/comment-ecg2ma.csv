The reality is (and I know you know this) if you keep going at &gt;1000 a day you will not only lose your hair and feel weak all the time, you will eventually die. If you fear weight gain, no one who eats 1200 calories a day is “fat”, but plenty can thrive at that calorie level (some need more, some need a bit less, but you’re not going to blow up at that level). Restriction almost always leads to binging, which leads to self loathing and self destruction. If you can make yourself spread 1200, even 1100 calories of healthy foods (think several 200 calorie meals, up to 400 if needed when eating in public) throughout your days you will not only feel better but you will be less tempted to binge. I know this from many years of experience. This may not help you now and maybe your headspace isn’t where you can try to think healthily but just know that people love you and you deserve to thrive and feel good about yourself.",False,False
