At one point I had 20,000 calories of various Oreo, Ritz, Cheez-its, chips bags that I bought on sale or clearance. All stuff I'd never tried before. The sight definitely comforted me because I knew I had food available if I ever felt too hungry. I'd go through a bag in a few days but not open anything else until it was finished.",False,False

But my mom used to find it and get mad, so I had to stop. I grew up in a house with three brothers, so if mom bought a bag of chips or something, instead of everyone getting some it was a race to see if you'd get anything at all. So I started portioning out my 'fair share' of Oreos, dorritoes, home made cookies, ect, into Tupperware and hide them in my room or in the garage.  Now, I still hide and portion food, but my hoards don't get as big before I toss them, eat them, or someone finds them and eats them without asking. ",False,False
