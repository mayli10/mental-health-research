They don't don't usually look like the guys in the videos, so why should I? (And on the occasions I do meet guys who look like the guys in the videos, I hope the fuck out cause that's way too intimidating lol)  And plus, you're not just in a sexual relationship with your boyfriend, you're in a romantic one. He cares about *you*, not just your body.  I do tend to trigger myself with the porn I choose to watch though, because my thought process is: I don't want to be triggered by guys hotter than me, so I seek out videos with guys that look like me ---&gt; I have bdd and think I'm much fatter than I am, so rather than find videos with guys that look like me I find videos with fat guys ---&gt; I get triggered by the guys being described as chubby or fat and also seeing them being fat and thinking I look like them.  One thing that's helped for me but may not help for you is that the way I want to look and the type of guy I find most attractive are very different. So I'll avoid any porn that might contain a guy I want to look like, but that still contains guys that I am attracted to. I don't get to have my self-insert character, but at least it's not as likely to trigger me. That said, if the sort of girl you find attractive is also the sort of girl you want to look like, that tprobably won't help.  Another thing is that when I'm feeling really bad about myself, or in the sort of mood where I think I'm gonna trigger myself easily, I'll only use written smut. Especially since most writers don't go very in depth describing the characters physically, it's easier to avoid visualizing them in a way that's going to fuck me up.",False,False

Girls are tiny in porn because a lot of men have the fantasy of dominating and vice versa with men being really big in videos. I think if porn were more diverse it would be just as consumed, or if all porn were bigger women and men. I think it would just cater to different fantasies then or would take better story writing to portray the same dominance and the porn industry is unimaginative and just goes with what’s tried and true.",False,False

I'm sure that doesn't make it easier, because who of us doesn't sit there and trigger themselves when watching sports or movies, but I think because it's sexual and meant to be self-inserting that it makes it worse.  You can't let it get to you though. You probably don't look like the girl, but I'm willing to bet your man doesn't look like the guy either. Just like in modeling or bodybuilding, they starve down and dehydrate to shoot a video where they look extremely vascular and defined and perfectly in shape for an hour and then they continue on with their days.",False,False

Probably the hottest guy I ever dated. He and I had everything in common except he turned my interests into action. Very admirable fella. I didn’t understand why he was with me.  One date, he took me to see Terminator Genesys. An hour into the film, we smelled fire and he pulled me out of the theater. We were reimbursed for our tickets but we didn’t finish the movie, so I went over to his house the next weekend. He excitedly informed me he found a torrent for the movie and pulled out his laptop. When he opened his torrents to start the movie, he accidentally showed off his porn library. In seconds flat, he clicked out of it and said, “Now where is that Terminator movie?” Very smooth.  The titles of every single porno were “small titty babe gets pounded,” “petite girl wants her daddy,” “two skinny girls, one camera,” etc.  I realized he was with me because I was the skinniest girl in our major. It was a... bittersweet feeling. The whole event inspired me to take action in my life more. I turned my interests into action and lost a ton of weight.",False,False
