I‚Äôm in Canada as well and I recently did an intensive day hospital program in my city. I wanted to do inpatient but the social worker who assessed me was like ‚Äúday hospital‚Äù.   Im so sorry about your experience with your assessment, that‚Äôs absolutely horrible to be told that you‚Äôre not ‚Äúsick‚Äù enough. I often felt in my program that I wasn‚Äôt sick enough,especially as I wasn‚Äôt even offered inpatient and I felt I needed it.   I always felt like others who came down from inpatient to the day hospital were treated more specially than people who didn‚Äôt do inpatient  (could be my bias though, but it certainly felt like it!). üò§  I‚Äôm being referred to another program in another city now, as I feel that 2 months in the day hospital was not enough and I‚Äôm sliding right back into my ED.   I know there aren‚Äôt a lot of ED programs in Canada, especially not government funded ones, which sucks. Is it okay if I message you? I might be talking about a similar or the same program that you are, but maybe not! If the program you‚Äôre talking about is the one I‚Äôm being referred, I might think twice!!  Cheers.",False,False

Initially, because I'd been diagnosed with borderline personality disorder, which I don't have, I had to do DBT before I'd be eligible for the program available at a nearby hospital. Then a year later after doing DBT with a therapist, they said you have to quit smoking pot for a month before treatment to do the program. I agreed I can't smoke pot in treatment, but they weren't very receptive to anything I said and both my ED and pot were how I coped with stress -eliminating one without introducing healthy skills wasn't really a great idea IMO. I then tried a privately run treatment center and got the same response. I actually tried unsuccessfully to stop smoking pot this time. They called me back at the one month point to see how I'd done. When I told them I hadn't been able to, and I said I guess I was SOL on the treatment front, they spoke to the treatment coordinator and informed me that as long as I'd be willing to quit cold turkey when I got there they'd have a spot me. I don't know if they'd have the same response to alcohol use given the dangerous withdrawals? They may have changed since I tried to secure a spot and the website states they do deal with co-occuring disorders including addiction. I'm going to feel silly if this is where you planned on going, but it's Homewood health.   I know in my area (I live in central canada), there's a publicly funded concurrent disorders program, but getting in is nearly impossible-they stopped accepting referrals -including the 2 years I tried to get help. This was the program recommended to me by the E.D program director at the hospital lmfao.",False,False

I wish I knew a better solution, if you are dedicated to recovery for one or both I'd say try maybe try going to one of the programs just for some stability? I don't want to fearmonger as all programs are different but I will say I spent a lot of time in the system via civil commitment when I was younger for chem dependency and AN among other things and it was my experience that there are very, very few decent facilities with staff and procedures actually meant to effectively treat both. There were none in the state i was committed in or near, and it was a constant issue in my court order as I needed to be placed in a facility that claimed to do both and most could not. I also was very medically underweight and physically unstable as it sounds you are and not ALL substance abuse programs will deny you, but I will warn you many places explicitly said they would not take me for that reason alone (at rehab facilities). Eating disorder IPs said the same about not being able to handle my ""severe"" drug issues. But you may have better luck with an ED program that maybe staff allow you to go to NA/AA in the community? ED programs have better structure in my opinion and I've definitely seen addicts and alcoholics in those programs so don't be discouraged. I was particularly bad on paper and had a well documented track record of failed rehabs of all sorts and a lot of staff/psychs/therapists who genuinely hated me and wrote me to be far more unstable, volatile, and aggressive than I was so programs would just read and see I was apparently like King Noncompliant and deny me. I actually only got off civil commitment on a technicality, I was count ordered to complete residential but by the end I was denied by literally every residential and they basically just sent me home. Lol. Treatments can save lives but many have abusive, immature, highly unstable staff themselves and toxic environments- don't feel you have to stay if you hate it or staff are legitimately abusive (extremely common in these facilities sadly).  If you're really wanting to improve I'd say try to go to any program and maybe be upfront about all your issues (like tell rehabs you are AN and need help/actual ED inpatient procedures). Again, not to scare you but I spent most my civil commitment in the chemical dependency side of things as that's where I started and in the time I spent in CD only facilities or even dual diagnosis but not ED specific is that they did not have the tools, training, or skill to deal with EDs effectively. Some not at all. All I've been to don't routinely check trays, don't weigh you that much and do it in normal clothes don't care if you water load or hold shit, don't lock bathrooms for purging unless they have a reason. It can be a horrible environment, I struggled badly being around no other ED sufferers and having no structure to help in place, only staff who don't understand and often make horribly upsetting comments any ED facility worker would never dare. In my experience if you say you have an ED or they know and you display behaviors a lot, they will put only you specifically on ED meal restrictions like locked doors and checking plates (though funny they never did anything if I just tossed it anyway)- think about whether that could help if you do go. Having total freedom is hard but being publicly ostracized by your peers and staff for being the only ED patient with their own rules no one else is forced to follow can be even worse- remember a big part of ED IPs/residential is the strict fucking meals for everyone. Singling out people causes issues fast but I have never seen a rehab with proper or even basic ED meal procedures.   If you go to rehab and engage in disordered behaviors quietly, most staff are not looking and don't care. They don't see or care if you eat, I was extremely underweight diagnosed with AN and staff didn't have the tools to address that or do anything. You will get a LOT of insensitive comments if they don't see many serious ED patients. If you lose a lot of weight and are literally dying they will likely send you to like an actual hospital ward (which I was threatened with) but otherwise I did as I pleased, I could just not come to meals or throw out the whole tray in front of a psych associate and they would not do anything. No ensure or shit. If you can't hold yourself accountable, it can be dangerous. At one point a facility that knew I had AN put me on like all isolated meals as a punishment for something really dumb so I had to eat all meals away from staff alone in my room... yes, the exact opposite of what ED programs do. I and my mom complained especially because I blatantly threw all the food out in that situation out of anger and like the hospital dietitian and my social worker but the lady literally replied ""it's really like the only leverage we have here to make her do what we want"". Only in evil places like that do first world citizens reach such a point of having literally nothing left that purposely tormenting an ED patient to make them behave nice in group is considered ok. Sorry I'm rambling, obviously I had a very bad experience but I thought I'd chime in since I saw firsthand there is a huge lack of trained staff and facilities that can ethically even claim to treat Ed and addiction. Weird since they have so much overlap in both patients and psychology.   Oh and one maybe actually helpful suggestion: in one facilitie's attempt to address the nonexistence of one program to treat both, I was at a rehab residential that would make weekly outpatient appointments at an ED specific facility and have a staff member take me. Don't know if that could work with your insurance/country/location, I do happen to have a lot of ""prestigious"" ED outpatients near all my residentials so if you go IP in bumfuck nowhere they probably can't do that.",False,False
