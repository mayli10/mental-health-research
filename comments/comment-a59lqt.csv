If I have Lean Cuisine it’s “oh those have so much sodium you shouldn’t eat those”. Yet she sticks her face in it and says “oooh that smells good!”  If there’s a catered lunch and I don’t have any or have very little it’s “aren’t you starving? It’s so good!!  You never eat any of the good stuff!!”  Heaven forbid I have an off or cheat day.  Then this woman has the gall to point out what I’m eating isn’t very healthy.  Anyway, I feel your pain.  I don’t know where these people come from.  Zero manners.",False,False

I’ve been around people like this and it’s terrible. Like get woke so we can swap memes or just shut up!!,False,False

I also rarely drink much alcohol. This is my vice and I think it’s a better vice to have.”  If that doesn’t shut her up, put laxatives in her coffee. 🤷🏻‍♀️ Just kidding.",False,False

I don't understand why people do that. I mean, in what way could it possibly be taken as a good thing to do? I can't see how it could ever do anything other than humiliate someone, or at best, not do anything at all if the person on the receiving end is apathetic.",False,False
