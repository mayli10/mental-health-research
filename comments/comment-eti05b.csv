Would it help to come at this sideways? Like, thinking about what ultimate outcome you’d like. Things like...educational goals, careers that sound fulfilling to you, friendships and relationships, traveling and adventures... And then thinking about what path forward offers you the best chance to get there. It sounds like you’re in a physically precarious place, and at that point hospitalization really can offer the best shot. It’s safer, and can get you out of danger far more quickly. I know our brains scream “I can do this on my own!” But at a certain point, all available data suggest otherwise. Which is a really hard place to be &lt;3   Is it theoretically possible for them to put you on an involuntary hold? Maybe. All my personal experience is on the being-suicidal side of things, so your situation is a bit different but I suspect they’d need a court order to hold you over 72 hours, and taking away a patient’s autonomy is usually something kept as a last resort. I don’t know if talking to the hospital directly is an option, and often it’s hard to get a straight answer anyway because they haven’t assessed you yet. I think there are subs devoted to posing legal questions, so there might be someone in your locale with an answer (I’ve never used those subs so I don’t know how friendly they are).",False,False
