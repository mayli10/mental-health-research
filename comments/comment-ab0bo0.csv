Keep one in my purse, one are home, one with work stuff, one in car cup holder.  Crazy how fast I go through em.  Dentist told me to chew Mentos or Ice breakers.  These 2 have Xylitol as the first ingredient and are good for ""acidic saliva."" ",False,False

But I am the kind of person who spits gum out the minute the flavor is gone (so usually after 10 minutes). This means that if I'm bored, I can blow through a pack in a couple of hours easily. Sugar free gum, when chewed in large quantities, has a laxative effect, which I did not realize until I was in a car on an 8 hour road trip and 2 packs of gum in.   The only problem is that my poor intestines are used to a full package of dulcolax at a time. This means that I spent a nice long road trip with my bf's family looking so bloated that you'd think I was pregnant, and with the worst gas imaginable. You can only blame the smell on farms or roadkill so many times before people get suspicious.   Good times :)  I haven't touched sf gum since lmao",False,False

I feel extremely attacked, especially since I’m a) trying to recover and b) thinking I might be developing a quite bad intolerance to sweetener and caffeine ☹️  The starburst gum is the best though. Three flavours in one packet and they taste just like the real thing and mmm I wish I had some right now they’re so good!",False,False

Extra spearmint is my fave. I know I need to cut back because I basically chain-chew when I’m stressed or need to stay awake to work or really want to suppress my appetite. It’s so hard though. The stuff (and, i guess, the process of chewing it?) is so comfortingly pleasurable to me ",False,False

I can't chew a lot of it in a day though because it really burns.  There isn't much choice in the UK and being a big fan of gum I like to buy US imports from UK online shops (hella expensive though).  I like the Project 7 gums for their choice of flavours - I like the S'mores, birthday cake and cookie dough the best.  Most time I chew Extra peppermint or the bubblemint because it's cheap.   Tropical Twist is nice and mild for a change.  I don't really chew gum to stop eating though.  It's been a habit since being a kid and when I started on meds it really helped because I get dry mouth a lot.  Big Red's still my favourite, even if it gives me mouth sores.  Cinnamon's from the gods.",False,False
