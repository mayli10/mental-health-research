On top of that, binge food is usually things like cakes, cookies, ice cream, etc. Empty Calories. Like yeah, that's TOTALLY going to help starving kids in Africa from not dying of malnutrition.  Maybe she should put her money where her mouth is and donate the extras she has in her house to people in third world countries. I mean, after all, do you really need a fancy smart phone? Sell it, buy a cheap flip phone, and give the money to people in Africa. What's that? You don't want to? But it's *extraaaa* and it's *wasteeee*.  This is a stupid argument anyway, with as much logical backing as socialism. Good for pulling on heartstrings, but not much else.",False,False

Why would someone even do that in an ED support forum that they want to be involved in, of all places?
