I was just fixating on every single calorie and food ALL of the time, it was all I could think about.  Someone here posted how it is important to remember that you have so much more to offer than just calories and weight. You deserve to be happy and enjoy the time you have left in school to learn and grow your mind.  I decided (yesterday) to delete MFP and stop tracking my calories, and i already feel so much better.  I know it is hard to get out of that mindset but food should be thought of as fuel so that you can live a happy and healthy life.  I hope you can find even a moment of joy today.  ",False,False
