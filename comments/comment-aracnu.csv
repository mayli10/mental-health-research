I haven’t found it triggering at all but I know it’s not the same thing.

I like that I can leave notes on everything but I doubt my shoppers like reading that I was each chicken breast individually wrapped and only a certain weight. I can choose exactly what brand and replacement I want if it’s not in stock and if they don’t have a replacement I want I can opt for them to not get anything instead.   Looking up the labels on options that are available at each store means it takes me an hour to shop for a weeks worth of groceries but I really like it. ,False,False
