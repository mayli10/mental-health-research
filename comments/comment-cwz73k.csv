So like, I’m not even vegetarian, so my dinner should have been 1c. Pasta, 3oz ground beef, 1 tsp of oil, 1c veggies (tomato sauce and others, for pasta), and a medium piece of fruit. Instead I had 2c of kale slaw, 2c of heart of palm, an artichoke-garlic dip that has olive oil in it, and the meat-tomato sauce. So in my opinion I totally ate food and calories, but in my team’s view it looks like I filled up on veggies to avoid the more calorie dense parts of the meal. But I’m just so excited to eat veggies. And my stomach only fits so much.",False,False

But, I've found sticking it into nicely flavoured meals takes away the sharpness it can sometimes have. Or pairing it with something a little sweeter, like peppers, that can make it a little less jarring.   Add a little dressing to it in a bowl though, like balsamic vinegar, pepper, salt, garlic and oregano were the ingredients I used in the cafe today and it definitely made it feel easier to eat.",False,True
