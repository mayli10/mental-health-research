It’s so important to start a relationship without big secrets,False,False

We all want to be desired by our partner, but it's really easy to slip into ""they think I look perfect, so I better keep doing [unhealthy behavior] if I want to keep their interest"" / ""if they think I look good now, imagine how hot they'll think I am if I [reach unhealthy goal]"" / ""they say they're concerned, but that just means what I'm doing is working!""   I find that's the hardest part of being in a relationship -- even harder than the ""should I let them in or keep it a secret"" question. Really think about how that might make you feel, and be prepared to realize later on that it's more triggering than you anticipated.",False,False

""Your partner is an extension of you. What you do that hurts yourself, will, in turn, hurt them.""   I like that a lot.   I don't want to hurt anyone and I feel like I always do in the end.",False,True

I would hate to knowingly put someone through that. And to also possible ""inspire"" them to eat irregularly or feel guilty while eating. gosh, i would hate myself even more.",False,True

I’ve dated hiding it, I’ve dated being upfront and recovering and then inevitably relapsing, I’ve dated someone else with anorexia.   It ended badly and my disorder was a key player in each, and, every, single, instance.   You’re destroying yourself from the inside out. You’re obsessive. You’re unhealthy, physically *and* mentally.   No-one wants to see someone they care deeply about go through that. And if you’re not willing to recover and move away from your ED, you *will* hurt them.  Your partner is an extension of you. What you do that hurts yourself, will, in turn, hurt them.",False,False

I met my wife when I was my sickest - she’s basically always known that this is a part of me.   I guess it depends on the other person, how they handle honesty about this stuff, how they deal with and understand mental illness, etc and the interpersonal dynamics.   Sometimes the timing is just right, I think it is extra heartache to add isolation on top of this illness.",False,False
