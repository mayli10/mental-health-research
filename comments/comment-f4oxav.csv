I have always known Iâ€™m not and never have been overweight, but I really donâ€™t like how my body looks unless Iâ€™m thin. I mean I guess itâ€™s my sense of aesthetics and wanting to be proud of myself. Having an average body isnâ€™t something to be proud of for me since Iâ€™ve always had an average body. Itâ€™s still an unhealthy mindset for sure, but well I donâ€™t think you have to have body dysmorphia to prefer being thin.",False,False

Standards are so warped and extreme across the board, people in the healthy weight range are feeling fat, or who have never been overweight- they're being made to feel like people who are overweight/obese, psychologically  Society are doing the same thing with relationships- setting standards too high and bullying anyone isn't on board, tying relationship status with respect like your job title (e.g. GPs) and then using it to setting up expectations and make demands interpersonally  On Valentine's Day this year single-shaming was through the roof- single people are driven into hiding/silence. It's never going to be an even playing field- equality surrounding your relationship status is never going to exist amongst people (not in my lifetime)  They can frame people who aren't in love as evil and ascribe all of these traits to them, extrapolate and talk about what kind of people they are- it's to protect high/extreme standards- it's to defend and enable corruption  I think the sports culture triggers mental illness in people- e.g. people with addictions who are breaking down in therapy, they want to get away from what the majority of people think, and having to deal with them point blank- anyone who is obsessed with climbing the ladder, or staying at a low rung forever  They're effected by the gripes and insecurities of the collective and they develop mental health issues to deal with them- if they lived somewhere else they wouldn't be as mentally ill- you can develop mental health issues from having clashes with the public",False,False

I teeter between an UW/normal BMI but I canâ€™t get over my fear of wearing dresses because I wore a dress a year ago and someone took a picture of me in it (in a well-intentioned way) and I thought I looked fat. I feel bad because I have a really nice dress in my closet right now but when I put it on in the morning I think about that picture and I cringe and change into trousers. Every time.,False,False
