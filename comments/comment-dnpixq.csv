We have to re-trigger ourselves EVERY day. Every meal is like the battle an alcoholic has when they have to turn down a drink or when a smoker is offered a cigarette and we have so many more opportunities to screw up. I'm not saying that it's just as/more difficult than quitting smoking or drinking bc it's a different kind of addiction but it's just... I can't cut food out of my life (even if I try lol). I am always, always going to feel this way and it just feels like a matter of time before I slip up again :(  Sorry I kind of went on a rant there. I guess I just meant to say you're not alone.

I don't know what to say to help you other than I think the other person is right, if you try and overcompensate by eating too little you'll just binge more, exactly as you said. For my recovery after a binge/low period is to just try and get back to ""normal"". Like, an amount I'm comfortable eating at (so it's not too restrictive) where I won't gain (usually around maintenance). Then when I get back to that base level I find I'm less likely to lose control and binge, even if I'm eating ""more"" than I think I ""should"" (reality of course is that when I eat at maintenance I'm eating far less than when I binge).
