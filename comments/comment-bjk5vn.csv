And as far as laxatives go, it could be a lot worse than tea. So credit where credit's due there! And taking laxatives isn't inherently bad, but with how ED is it can be easy to spiral into becoming dependent on them. Drink the tea as you need it, just be aware of how much you're drinking and try not to go overboard. üíó",False,False

I got this tea actually cause I‚Äôd taken a full pill, instead of my normal half pill, and had gone about 3 days without pooping (primarily because I was fasting, but the imods really didn‚Äôt do me any good).   I appreciate your concern üôÇ I am sure I‚Äôll regret using the tea in the future, but for now it makes me feel a lot better.",False,True

Popping in to say as someone else who also has ibs, I cannot suggest enough that you should be super careful using laxatives. I've abused them for years and the shits you get with a combo of ibs and extensive laxative use can only be described as nightmarish lmao  Although I have ibs-d, so it'd probably be different if someone has ibs-c. Still! It's really important to be careful when using laxatives, you don't want to become addicted to them.",False,False

They work great until your body gets used to it and you have to take more and more and more for it to work. I used laxatives for about 4 years and I developed IBS, which basically makes me bloated ALL THE TIME whether I eat or not. It wasn‚Äôt worth the temporary mental relief I got from taking laxatives everyday.   Not saying not to use them!! I still rely on them to make myself feel better, but I‚Äôm a lot more careful. Please just don‚Äôt get too carried away!!",False,False

I just have to say, as someone who has fought through the absolute depths of hell of lax addiction, keep an eye out.    I didn‚Äôt even realize I was becoming physically dependent on it and then all of the sudden I was completely unable to go without it.

I seriously have had some bad/nightmarish experiences with this stuff.

He called it ‚Äúscreamin‚Äô moves‚Äù üòÇ   If I need help, I started using this stuff called California Dieters Tea and I found it to be better (for me) than SM, so if you‚Äôre looking for an alternative, check it out.  üòä.",False,False

I‚Äôve been using it for b/p lately, which is a habit I really need to kick, but I started off using it cause I was so constipated from a long term fast.
