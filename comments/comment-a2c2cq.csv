I understand the difference between validation and consideration, but you seem to be willfully ignoring the way they are intertwined and related for the sake of your arguement.   Telling me that another commentor’s post was better than mine is subjective, and somewhat irrelevant. I am firm in the way I want to protect the vulnerable people in this community, and firm in the way I am kind to others. I consider it kind to address problematic behaviour, and unkind to allow it to consintue for the sake of respecting a person’s mental illnesses. I have been kind throughout these interactions, of that I am certain.   So, now you’re throwing things at me that I’m “hostile,” “overly emotional,” and trying to tell me that I’ve made assertions that I have not.

In your original comment (not the one in this comment chain) you posed your claim  &gt; If you were like “so, I secretly kind of hate on X race of people in my mind” should we support that too, because you’re suffering from a mental illness? Obviously not. That’s not what this community is for, please don’t use us this way.   And my response to that was to use the story of my brother to illustrate a more constructive response then to just shut someone down and say ""you're wrong and you're an asshole"" immediately.   I do think you are taking OPs original statments out of context, and having an overly emotional response. You are also using commiserate/validate as interchangeable terms and they are not.   To Validate means to ""recognition or affirmation that a person or their feelings or opinions are valid or worthwhile"". Validation can look different in terms of addressing intrusive thoughts. We can validate that yes- others have these thoughts, but no we do not think it is ok to continue to engage in them.   We can also commiserate which means to express or feel sympathy or pity; So we can show sympathy to Op- Yes we think you should work on overcoming these intrusive thoughts but we understand your struggle.     u/desperate_housecats was able to break down their own issue and reflect on the reasons why they engage in this destructive though pattern. They were able to both validate OPs thoughs and commiserate while also being able to explore the parts of their dissorder that negatively effects their own thought patterns, which can potentially help OP.  This was a better way to word the issue then how OP put it. You have made a few assertions that OP is willfully being intolerant to overweight people, which I don't believe is true. OP has several times apologized and has admitted the thoughts are wrong.   OP needs to see is some thoughtful respones like u/desperate_housecats has.

Perhaps I picked the wrong thread to chime in. My initial comment was just meant to distinguish that there is a difference between “I engage in hateful behaviour, but I am trying not to,” and “I engage in hateful behaviour, and am looking to see if others think it’s okay that I continue to do it.” I have no intention of attacking OP’s character, and I suppose by commenting in this thread, it implied that I agreed they are an asshole. This specific behaviour is bad, but I have no idea about who they are as a person, and have no comment there. In terms of having sympathy or for a person but not condoning the behaviour, I believe that’s what I’m doing here? And um... best of luck to your brother, I guess?

That is where that peice of it came from.  You are right that OP could have worded their inital post in a more compassionate way. Words matter. After reading OPs responses I do think they are an empathetic person. I think they can learn from their mistakes. I don't think they were looking for validation in the way you are describing. I think they were looking to see if they were the only ones who struggles with this, not to be told ""this is ok, keep up hating fat people!""   Validation and comiseration are different and I think comiserating on a common issue is absolutely fine as long as we can agree that it is wrong to continue to engage in that behavior/thought pattern. The definition of comiseration is actually a form of showing sympathy. I can show sympathy for OP while not conding the behavior itself.   There have actually been comments from overweight users on both sides of this argument. Its also important for users who may feel attacked by OPs post to realize it is not about them-its about OP and their own character flaws. I use to be obese myself and I actually enaged in this particular behavior more when I was heavier. It took a while to get myself out of that toxic head space.   As for trying to compare this situation to someone who is racist and saying what if that was what OP was saying- I have a personal anecdote. My brother is apparently racist. I didn't realize how much until recently after my mother passed away and I've been having to help him a lot. He has his own menal illness (he is an Iraq war vet with really bad ptsd and drug dependence issues. He also gets really bad panic attacks) He had a shit lot in life and really has been fucked over. This does not make his racist thoughts/opinions valid at all. When he says stuff like ""95% of crimes are committed by blacks"" or ""blacks are racist against me in the neighborhoods I've lived in"" instead of reacting and telling him he is an asshat, I try to explain the systematic socioeconomic reasons why black people are often charged for crimes at a higher rate than white people. Its probably going to take me a long time to drive the point home, but I think I can help him with love and patients. ",False,False

We see people lose weight all the time.  We hold them up as models, but we don't watch as they regain (mostly because they're too ashamed to be seen).  But this is the truth about weight loss:  It's not often sustained over the long term.   Even weight loss surgery doesn't help everyone.  I forget what the recent stats about long-term success.  50%?   So, for these reasons, people who got burnt out on trying said, forget it, I'm just going to have to try to make myself healthy as I can at this size.  (And, sure, lots of people who are obese don't ascribe to HAES and don't ever exercise, etc.)  Anyway, I hear the OP's position: It is part of our evolution to put others down so that we have a better spot in the hierarchy.  (Survival and all.) And really obese people are at the bottom of the totem poll these days, so it's very difficult NOT to follow the herd on this one.
