Jealousy is super normal and natural emotion. But when it takes over to the point if checking phones and getting angry. Fuck man. That shit gets toxic real quick.   Thanks so much for adding this. It‚Äôs definitely really thoughtful and something I didn‚Äôt think to add‚ù§Ô∏è,False,False

This is all probably really hurting him too. It hurts to feel jealousy and anger. I‚Äôve definitely felt it my fair share,False,False

My partner snooped my phone back because I had done it to him before and we had to both decide we wouldn‚Äôt do it again. Now when I feel bad about jealousy or wonder what he is doing I ask him to reassure me he loves me. This has made me feel a lot better than deciphering what he does online.   If the relationship is toxic in a lot of areas and you‚Äôre unhappy but only with him because you feel alone I‚Äôm so sorry, shoot me a DM üíï  you should never feel alone or obligated.",False,False

I‚Äôm 100% okay with being jealous or my partner being jealous because we can then talk about it and reassure each other. The feelings are totally okay, but we have made it clear we aren‚Äôt okay with us using our jealousy to make rules or expectations in the relationship.   I have in the past snooped my partner‚Äôs phone before and I know it was the wrong thing. I realized when I got that urge what I was really feeling was insecure and worried. So now I go to him rather than dig around if something is on my mind. I haven‚Äôt done it since I promised myself I wouldn‚Äôt and it‚Äôs definitely the better route to go.  Sorry if that‚Äôs a kind of random response. Just your comment got me thinking, and I mean to say I totally agree with you!",False,False

I have spent too long perfecting the art of treating my self like shit and I‚Äôll be damned if I‚Äôm going to let some one else do it for me.   Also have you ever been angry or jealous or mean to someone? Bet you felt like shit after. This can‚Äôt be nice for him either. Not that I really sympathize with him tbh, just another perspective. You deserve to feel so loved and appreciated ‚ù§Ô∏è",False,False

I don‚Äôt know your relationship, and obviously you will make the choices that are right for you, but maybe you should talk to him about how unhealthy that is. From the little you‚Äôve shared it sounds like there‚Äôs some toxic behaviour going around. Contrary to how most of us are raised, jealousy isn‚Äôt a sign of love. I‚Äôm not saying he‚Äôs necessarily bad, but jealousy isn‚Äôt a kind emotion for either party. Just food for thought.
