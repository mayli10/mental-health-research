I've struggled with anorexia since I was 15. Around August of this year, I decided I truly wanted to recover. And I did. I worked so hard, I challenged myself beyond what I treatment team expected, I gained the weight, I embraced to process. I did so fucking well.  And then it just... died. Something in me just couldn't do it anymore. I always relapse, every time, without fail. This has happened before, this cycle of dedicated recovery, and it always ends the same way. I've come to believe that I simply can't exist without anorexia anymore. It's a part of me. I can't get rid of it.  It hurts that it was all for nothing. I really did try. I did so much hard work to get better. I thought this was it, that I was going to really Recover this time and never go back. And yet, here I am.",False,False
