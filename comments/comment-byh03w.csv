My brother believes in starvation mode, doesn't really count calories (doesn't necessarily overeat, but he is not losing weight either), belives some weight loss ""trainers"" online in facebook groups and foods that can and cannot be eaten (which in itself is bullshit since those dudes list are just bizzare). Also, when some relatives were over they also talked about ""muh slow metabolism and starvation mode"" crazy.",False,False

Do you mean, even if you're thin? Because keto isn't necessarily a weight loss plan. Plenty of normal weight people are keto, and you can eat keto at maintenance. The reason why keto is the go-to suggestion for PCOS is because keto lowers insulin levels and high insulin causes your ovaries to release more testosterone.  This is a weird topic for me and I don't really know how to approach it, cuz I lost 200 lb on keto and have kept it off while remaining keto at my lower weight, but I also developed ED habits at the same time so idk what worked for me and what didn't. Maybe the reason I lost all that weight is because I gained an obsession. All I know is I have only had 3 binges in 4 years since I went keto, and one of them was after I drank an entire 2 liter of non-diet soda that I thought was diet ðŸ˜±ðŸ˜±ðŸ˜±, so I wasn't in ketosis anymore and didn't even know until the next day when I went to clean up my kitchen and realized the bottle wasn't freaking diet. Most of the time I don't have an appetite. But again, I just don't know, because I also have severe issues with eating even remotely close to maintenance cals.",False,False
