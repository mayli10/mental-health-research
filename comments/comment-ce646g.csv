That's a good plan to have just in case.  I'll save your comment.",False,True

Anyone who calls another person fat for fun is just pathetic. I‚Äôd just be like ‚Äúyou‚Äôre a very sad person.‚Äù Because bullies usually wind up being major losers in life. Last time I saw a childhood bully she was taking my order of fries at weinersnitchels ü§¶üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è  I really hope it works out for. Mean spirit ppl don‚Äôt really even deserve a response to their existence.,False,False

Something similar happened to me and they moved the guy to all different classes and a different lunch period so I'd have as little interaction with  him as possible. I hope that's an option for you.",False,False

You must be so embarrassed"" works pretty well. Turns it back on them being a dick rather than slinging insults back, and sometimes that'll make other people call them out too.",False,False
