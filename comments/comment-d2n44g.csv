My go to supplements are vegan gummy multivitamins and calcium/vit d. I find I’m not consistent if it’s pills but if it’s chewable I’m more likely to stick with my regimen. I used to do wheatgrass and I’ll occasionally have kombucha so I really do favor getting things in more naturally bc the vitamins are more bioavailable.,False,False
