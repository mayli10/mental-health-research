I mean... what you're talking about is the concept of ""raising awareness,"" aka. exposing people to issues they may not have thought about themselves so that, if they want to, they could change their behaviour based on what they've learned. We do it for lots of other societal issues, so why not disordered eating?  &gt;I get where you're coming from, too, and I do try to give people the benefit of the doubt, but it actually IS important to raise awareness of the prevalence of invisible eating disorders and to educate people about how comments on people's appearances or eating habits can contribute unknowingly to those disorders.  &gt;I understand when people are ignorant to issues like this outside of their own lives, but that doesn't at all mean they should STAY ignorant or that it's wrong/childish/etc to want people to be educated on things they don't have direct experience with. That's how you grow empathy.  So you raise awareness by ""expecting"" them to do something? Or maybe you raise awareness by actively informing them?  &gt;I don't think this is practical advice when ""the world"" (aka. society) is a massive contributing factor to developing disordered eating. That's kind of like saying that it's a gay person's responsibility to manage homophobia because homophobes can't be expected to know any better. We HAVE to challenge society's attitude towards eating if we want to fully manage our disordered eating.  Again: you don't challenge anything if you just stay silent and expect the world to change for you without you doing anything.   Second, the comparison with homophobia is a meaningless one, as homophobes are precisely trying to hurt and fight gay people, whereas these people are just completely clueless.   The right comparison (well, it wouldn't be right in that case too, but let's just go on with it) would be if you got offended for an unwantingly homophobe comment from a very old woman born in a remote tiny village in the mountains of Nepal, who has never ever seen a gay person and doesn't know what it means as a concept, and of course doesn't know you're gay.  Yes, the world doesn't owe you anything. If you're an adult, it's your responsibility to try and get what you want.",False,False
