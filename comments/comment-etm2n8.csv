I’m also ftm struggling with an ed and it’s not true. I lost a significant amount of weight and my dysphoria didn’t go away. If anything it got better ever since I started testosterone (which made me gain a little).  I don’t really have any safe food to suggest (I’m sorry- that brand of plant based seafood isn’t a thing where I live, and I know because I’ve been wanting to try it fr years. Maybe try snacking on seaweed? I like those nori snacks you find in Asian grocery stores but idk if it would work for you) but my best advice is to distance yourself from your mother and her toxic and frankly transphobic talk, and try to confront her about it if you have the energy to do so. You have all my empathy and support ❤️❤️❤️",False,False

Your shit is just a knock-on effect from that, and sounds to me almost like Munchausen's by proxy.  Have you found that actual sardines are reasonably safe for you? Where I am sardines are reasonably cheap if you aren't trying to base a full diet on them.  I notice you mention a vegetarian meat replacer. Do you find meat replacers just taste better? Is there an element of orthorexia?",False,False
