I guess the problem with not counting is I may be underestimating how many I‚Äôve had. When eating lots of rich food it‚Äôs natural to feel more satisfied on less, so even though I felt like I‚Äôd gone all out maybe I actually consumed fewer calories than normal?   There‚Äôs a similar problem with weighing myself, I could stop doing that as well but then there‚Äôs a risk that I would keep losing...  Not easy is it! Argh üòè",False,True
