Like obviously binging never feels good after the fact but there was something uniquely punitive about my dorito binge experience that I just could never repeat it. That’s my advice, but we all know that sometimes no amount of reasoning can stop us.",False,False

The creators of Doritos purposefully made the taste, color, and even the *shape* to get us to eat and not stop eating them.   Fuck the man, man. They treat us like cows, fattening us up and stealing out cash.   Fuckin disgusting how *food* is manipulative. Don’t fall for that shit!!",False,False
