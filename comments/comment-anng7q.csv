My stomach was mostly 'flat' before, but I think that was because I had a combination of very compact fat+muscle and also hip bones that are evident at all weights.

I do a lot of exercise so I have a lot of abdominal muscles so increasing my exercise won't get rid of it. I think the only thing I can do it lose another 10lbs. ",False,False
