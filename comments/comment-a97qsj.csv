Even if you meet this demand what about the next one? The one after that? He's going to keep upping the ante each time you comply and he's going to keep pushing you further and further down this path. What do you think the chances are that he's told you this to punish you for spending time with your family instead of him?  I get that the idea of having to move out and disrupt your living situation is scary, I'd be scared too, but I think you need to rip the band aid off. Otherwise it'll happen later on down the line and hurt even more.",False,False

Sis leave now!!!! That's textbook manipulation,False,False

It's just a question of who's going to officially say that first, you or him.   His ultimatum sounds like the kind of thing someone would do if they desperately want the relationship to end, but don't feel comfortable in the role of officially ending it.  Honestly I would help him out by officially ending it.",False,False

Giving you ultimatums about your weight is not okay in any way. I’m really sorry you’ve experienced this with multiple SOs, but no matter how many people have been sending you these messages it’s not okay and not a healthy relationship. You deserve someone who is loving and supportive no matter your weight. You shouldn’t have to starve yourself to keep a relationship. EDs and disordered eating are hard enough without an SO forcing you restrict and making your relationship contingent on the scale. Try to take care of yourself. Good luck and stay safe ",False,False
