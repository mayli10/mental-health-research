I think I'm going to do that now..   I often look at reverse thinspo for motivation, particularly because I have BED so I can see how far my life can go south if I allow my BED to take over my life, but the issue with it is that I'm no where close to these obese extremes, so it's hard to see it as realistic.

Paid more attention and noticed she always makes a giant plate of food, then just sorta pushes it around and only takes a few bites before making a big show about how full she is and throwing a napkin over it.  Not sure how I feel about it but I needed to get it off my chest. It's kind of sad if true, she's almost 50 and starting to have issues with chronic pain and arthritis.
