A bag of regular popcorn is like a good 3-400 calories but feels like air so you don't feel that heavy full feeling I know is scary.   Also peanut butter is good too. Very dense and so is avocado. All really good if volume overwhelms you,False,False

I just want a cute butt and nice boobs. I'm a solid B cup and I don't think I'll get bigger but I kinda like the extra padding and I'm really tired of my hookups being like ""why are you so bony"" and I have to reply ""sorry, I look better with my clothes on""  I do eat peanut butter weekly, I just keep a jar near my desk or bed and I'll snack every few hours. It's just not enough to actually make weight gains. I hate how losing weight was so easy and gaining weight is so hard. Which I know seems like such a first world problem for the sub so I kinda hate talking about it because I know others are jealous but seriously I just can't keep it on. Granted, I do have to force myself to eat so it's probably just the disorder combined with a really broken body.  tldr: drunk and word dumped",False,True

I'm hoping I'll make the switch to solid food eventually, but this was my third relapse so I'm sure the pendulum will swing again.",False,True

I also wanna recommend nut butters! At times when I simply cannot tolerate a real meal, a few spoons of peanut butter fits the calorie bill without the feelings of fullness that can be so disconcerting.   As an aside, you are super badass for embarking on this endeavor.   Also, I feel your TL;DR on a visceral level. May we both have good luck in restoring butt and boobs! ",False,False

Protein powder will probably not give you heart issues or testosterone. If you've ever eaten any protein-enhanced food, that probably had protein in it. Excess protein can cause some issues but really this is when you hit the body builder 50% protein level and probably won't be of concern. I'm not a nutritionist though, but I've eaten a lot of protein powder, quest bars, ect.   If you want a shake, Ensure makes a good one. It was recommended to a friend of mine who had extreme weight loss due to acute illness.   Keep in mind protein is filling, so if you buy the powder consider boosting the value using bananas, avocados, fruit ect. (You could also make fruit smoothies)",False,False
