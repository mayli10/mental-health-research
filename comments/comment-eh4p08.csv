If I donâ€™t think I look â€˜rightâ€™ today, then no one can see me and I wonâ€™t leave my apartment. If I have to for work, itâ€™s definitely a terrible day with extra self-punishment.  Thanks for your post, it helps me feel less of a monster in the way I think and feel - and truly captures the sickness in this illness.",False,False

In the 3 bad years of my ED I went from up and down from a BMI of 25-18.5 Itâ€™s like clockwork - when my BMI is from 21-20 I get treated better than before. When itâ€™s from 19 and lower I really notice a difference in compliments and the way I am treated.  Itâ€™s why itâ€™s hard for me to accept weight gain... even if I accept the way I look the way I get treated will change.,False,False

If I donâ€™t look good I can barely function that day or will have a breakdown because I refuse to go out.  Guess thatâ€™s what growing up ugly and not getting romantic attention till 18 does to you. Think Iâ€™m forever trying to prove to everyone now that I am attractive??,False,False
