The fact that actually being healthy and exercising through this pregnancy is triggering me is hard to deal with. Like I sometimes it feels like I'm more looking forward to having my body be my own again to starve and hurt than I am about my baby girl being here. That's terrifying. So yeah, I'm right there with you. Being a parent and having an eating disorder is fucking hard and fucking devastating. ",False,False

I obviously don't do it in front of her but I feel awful when I let her watch her favorite shows to distract her from what I'm doing -_-. ,False,False

Donâ€™t think for a second you arenâ€™t worthy! Your baby loves you and cares about you because thatâ€™s behaviour heâ€™s learned from you as a loving mother. Youâ€™re deserving of help and you owe it to yourself to get it. Youâ€™re stronger than you realise! Take it one day at a time mama but you can absolutely do this ðŸ’—,False,False

And it's okay to take that help a little bit at a time. I'm not saying you have to go inpatient because I totally understand that's scary and is the worst nightmare for a lot of us but at the very least getting a therapist specialized in either eating disorders or trauma is a good start. If anything that work might help you reduce the harm to your baby or your self. And he needs a healthy happy momma and you deserve it we all do deep inside even if we don't always feel it. ,False,False
