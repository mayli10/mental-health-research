It sounds like you should just avoid her content and save yourself the headache. But just because her content is a special trigger to you, doesn’t mean she should not be able to produce it anymore. A person, no matter how public is never required to disclose their illness to anyone. She doesn’t owe you “admitting” that she is sick. She does not promote harmful ideas, eating habits or whatever. I perceive her content as pretty positive and lighthearted to be honest.  Also: why the hate that her content is pretty centered around food? there are many YT channels specifically dedicated to food even more than hers. Food can literally be a wonderful hobby. Not everyone has an ED and not everyone struggles. Those people experience a huge fucking privilege but enjoying food and being interested in it is literally the opposite of harmful.  I get that content that is specifically triggering to you personally can be aggravating. It is to me too but a trigger does not mean generally harmful.",False,False

She tries way too hard to be Different and Weird, like the hot water thing looks like something I'd find on a safe foods subreddit but she passes it off like it's just one of her Quirks, and has to mention it every video.  I hate watch her at this point, and to trigger myself, there's something really grating and overbearing about her even if she wasn't triggering.",False,True

I mean you can't really evade triggers no matter how hard you try to ban shit, anyway. Nor is it anyone elses responsibility to. I really get put off by phoniness. Tons of YouTube girls are like that. I think it's the Ed need for validation.",False,False

She seems a bit like she's trying too hard to be quirky, or maybe it's just that I find her persona to be really forced. Personal opinion, but I also think that she has an ED, and is purposely being triggering.",False,False

I do think it’s pretty sick that she’s allowed to make triggering content that’s triggering precisely because she is disordered without admitting that she has a problem?? Like I think it’s fair that she makes the videos she does but kids shouldn’t look up to having your entire existence revolving around food and appearances as a normal and cool thing.  It’s like all those YouTubers that ~used to~ have eating disorders that are now extremely into exercising/bodybuilding, “health” and intuitive eating... like sis just say you’re orthorexic now lmao",False,False

I tried commenting that her content was worrying and her weight was concerning but a lot of people said I was ""hating"" and spreading negativity. This behaviour is not normal and I don't think ignoring it or encouraging it is healthy!   Food should not be a hobby, and there's definitely something going on since she's severely underweight and has a food related career, used to do modelling which is notorious for creating eating disorders, and is THIS obsessed with food.",False,True
