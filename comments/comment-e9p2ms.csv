Don’t beat yourself up for it. Besides, mental hunger/boredom eating also often means that your body does genuinely need food, especially if you’ve been restricting.  Maybe you can snack on fruits/veggies instead? Or make sure that you have an adequate breakfast with protein in it (to increase satiation) – I know it’s anxiety-inducing to eat more early in the morning, but it’s really helped me reduce grazing/overeating/bingeing later in the day. Good luck!!",False,False
