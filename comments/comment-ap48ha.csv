If it‚Äôs the latter, happy birthday to you ‚ù§Ô∏è I hope you have a great day!!   And don‚Äôt worry about being older than some other people at college. I‚Äôm turning 26 soon and I still didn‚Äôt get my degree. I dropped out when I was 20, started again, couldn‚Äôt take it, it was a whole thing. And I used to beat myself up about it so bad, until one day I realized it doesn‚Äôt matter. I‚Äôm starting fresh again this year and I feel good about it for the first time. Some people have other stuff going on that makes getting a degree in the same time as others harder. That doesn‚Äôt mean you‚Äôre falling behind, life is not a race and time doesn‚Äôt matter at all.     What I would post on peach:  tonight I woke up because my dog got sick and while I was cleaning it up my first thought was that I‚Äôm getting in extra steps now, and how cool it is that I don‚Äôt have to start at 0 in the morning and then I got really sad about that. I hate my ED so much. I know that sounds dumb because who doesn‚Äôt?, but I used to like it somehow, it was comforting and familiar and something I could rely on. But now I‚Äôm so tired, I don‚Äôt want to restrict and then binge and then fast and then start all over again anymore. I don‚Äôt even feel like I‚Äôm in control anymore (never was, but FELT like it). I know this won‚Äôt stop after I reach my ugw, because I‚Äôll always have to count calories and there‚Äôs no way intuitive eating won‚Äôt make me fat. I just want to eat without logging every tiny bite but I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll ever get there and it sucks. ",False,False
