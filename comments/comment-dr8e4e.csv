Your program/campus should have mental health support services and many folks find them vital to surviving grad school even without dealing with other pressures. I highly recommend them. I'm also here if you wanna vent.,False,False

Restricting made me lose all my brain power and my thoughts were just consumed with food an exercise. I'm also in a competitive masters program so I know how hard that is.  It does take some time, but your brain does come back online. I think you're thoughts are getting the best of you- if you've made it into a masters program you aren't dumb and masters programs are hard!",False,False

There's a strong possibility that you're in the adjustment period where most people are finding it challenging to meet the new expectations and the demands of the program. Feeling like a program is above your abilities is really common among everyone.   It likely has nothing to do with your abilities, calorie restricted or otherwise.  Just another case of imposter syndrome. &lt;3",False,False

I know it’s hard but upping your intake really will help a lot.",False,False
