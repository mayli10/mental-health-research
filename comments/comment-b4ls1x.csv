Fast forward people loved that I was the term ‚Äòthick‚Äô, and complimented me a lot I never had a problem with food or my body....  Then my sister from a different country came and started telling me how fat I was, and how my clothes looked better on her (she was 17, I was like 14), I started wearing jackets and jeans only. I stared comparing my body to other skinny girls and something I‚Äôll skip lunch or dinner, I even tried to fast for 3 days. I wasn‚Äôt serious into this until I moved with my grandma due to family issues, she stared bullying me on how big my butt was and how fat I was for my age, I‚Äôd sometimes cry when she wasn‚Äôt in the room. I tried to restrict but it wasn‚Äôt working. I remember I binged and I wanted it out, I remember when I was really sick a long time ago and threw up everything before.... that‚Äôs when I attempted to make myself throw up. at first it was really hard but then it was getting easier, I loved with my uncles so sometimes I would have to vomit in the shower (gross ik) I even had times when I was in the process and vomit came out my nose. Well that‚Äôs my story I haven‚Äôt been diagnosed and don‚Äôt plan to be because I‚Äôm not the weight I want to be yet I‚Äôm still fat (oh and I‚Äôm currently 15)",False,False

When I was 16 years old I got my first job and my first paycheck. I had expendable income and the weight gain started. That's when it all began to go downhill.

I'd always been the chubby kid and I always hated the way I look. Either my mom put me on a diet when I was a young teen or I got my mom to put me on it. I don't remember. Probably a combination of the two. It didn't really work, as I have always been possessive over my food and wasn't willing to give anything up.   In college I ended up binging a bunch and gained a bunch of weight. Afterwards I felt like I had spiraled and kept trying to restrict until I figured out how to do so. It flares up again whenever I feel like things are out of control.  I've watched this happen and known what would happen in the end. I've been in therapy for anxiety, depression, and ADHD but I haven't brought up the ED behavior because I don't want to get better. I've known the road I'm on since the first time I tried restricting. I just didn't care enough to stop myself.  After typing all this out... It's *really* always been about control. Even when I was a kid, food was the only thing I felt I had control over so I obsessed over it. The obsession has just changed forms now. Interesting how that works. ",False,False

Getting close to college I looked chubby, but was never overweight. My mom kept pestering me about weight loss and how I looked fat so I lost a bit of weight. When she started to tell me how good I looked I was like, hey why not lose some more? I had always had extremely low self esteem so I thought losing weight would be a quick fix to that.  I guess that's when it started, I overexercised, restricted, and the weight flew off. When people told me how good I looked, I realized I couldn't stop. So I lied to myself, and told myself I was eating enough when I was barely eating over 1000 a day (and promptly exercising most of it off).   However, I was in denial for the longest time, because even at my LW I wasn't underweight. I only looked extremely thin because I'm a giant lol. It only clicked in my head that maybe I have an ED when the orthorexic/anorexic phase turned into a binge/fast phase a couple months ago.   Now Ive gained soooo much weight and have started seeing someone about my ED but kind of regret it. I'm not ready to change, and am still planning on losing all the weight I've gained+more.
