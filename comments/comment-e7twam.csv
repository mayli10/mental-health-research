'how are you still eating??? i can't even look at food', 'this isn't fair, how are you thinner than me when all you do is eat', 'guess who's back in the kitchen again??'. like. i'm sorry my appetizer and glass of wine doesn't keep me as full as your two appetizers, cocktails, entree, and dessert.  but i am really sorry about that. it honestly reflects more on him and the fact that he's so bored he has to stand around amd watch you eat.",False,False
