I have a few kids who will comment on the snacks that the other kids are eating and say that they're unhealthy (which is true, but not something that kids need to be worrying about) and I have one girl in particular who says she's fat a lot when shes just normal kid chubby. I plan on being a parent in like 10ish years, and I really hope that I'm recovered by then. If I'm not I'll try my hardest to hide my behavior from them. I think one of the most important things to teach a child is body positivity, so basically just not talking about the negative things about your body's appearance and instead focusing on all of the things that your body can do for you. I do that with the kids I work with now and have heard them repeating some things on the playground like ""my strong legs make me go up the stairs so fast!"" and that makes my heart smile",False,False

He always says ‚ÄúNo momma, you‚Äôre BEAUTIFUL‚Äù üò¢ I love that boy so much. I‚Äôm kind of obsessive about feeding them. When I‚Äôm restricting I make them the most gourmet meals- everything I want to eat but can‚Äôt. But, if they‚Äôre not hungry I don‚Äôt pressure them to eat like my parents did. I don‚Äôt use treats as rewards, I always tell them how beautiful and smart they are. I think they‚Äôll be ok if I stop saying shitty things about myself when they‚Äôre nearby",False,False

I‚Äôm trying to get to a better place for that now.   I try really hard not to let my son see my ED behavior. I do struggle with talking to him about food though. I‚Äôm not good with making healthy choices in moderation so it‚Äôs hard to teach, Like we got in this habit when we leave the gym I let him pick a snack from the vending machine. Well, he goes for this cinnamon roll that is 450 calories (it says it on the front of the package and I have trouble evening touching the things). I‚Äôm struggling with educating him on why he can‚Äôt eat one of these 6 days a week. ‚ÄúBecause it will make you fat‚Äù is what comes to mind but that isn‚Äôt the right explanation for a 5 year old. So instead I say he can get one once a week because moderation and all that, But he is 5 so it is all ‚Äúwhy, why, why‚Äù. It is a struggle. And then I always wonder if I am giving him an eating disorder. My mom taught me mine so I‚Äôm scared of that. Though she outright taught me to purge so I certainly would never do that.",False,False

My mom (who was an otherwise very good parent) unintentionally taught me some disordered behaviors that lead to a full blown ED... I‚Äôm terrified of doing the same. I agree with the other commenter on my approach. I am very careful about how I talk in front of my daughter, provide healthy food but never restrict her portions, don‚Äôt engage in any body shaming of myself or anyone else, and hiding the overt behaviors of mine. I want to at the very least set the stage up for her to have a healthy relationship with food. I do worry that if I can‚Äôt turn this around she may find out anyway when she‚Äôs old enough to catch on to more subtle things. I plan on being honest in a way that is developmentally appropriate so that I acknowledge the ways I struggle and that it‚Äôs not healthy. Still, I worry she will model my behavior anyway, and that she has the genetics in place that make mental illness much more likely. It‚Äôs hard and I never thought I would still be having these issues as a parent. PM me if you‚Äôd like to chat further, I know how lonely this can be. ‚ù§Ô∏è",False,False

Its a struggle, that's for sure. One of my top concerns/obsessions is making sure I do my best to make sure they have a better relationship with food than I do. I don't weigh myself in front of them. I also won't talk about my weight or calories in front of them. I try to keep some of my weirder behaviors hidden. Like during lunch, I'll do dishes and pick up while they eat. At dinner, I plate all the food in the kitchen before calling the family to the table, so they never see me measuring/weighing my food. I use smaller plates, or even on of theirs (which they love because we ""match""), so that my food never looks TOO different. The only ""odd"" habit they see is my walking/pacing. I have issues leaving the house, so I usually choose to burn my calories by walking /running around the house. They think it's fun now, but I'm sure when they're older they'll find it odd ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è.",False,False
