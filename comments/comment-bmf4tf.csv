When we were at a work function, I took two slices of pizza to be polite (pizza is just a warm cheesy sandwich, fight me) and my coworkers found it so weird that I wasn't making the most of it?! They talk about going out for a meal or getting a takeaway. I can't remember the last time I had a takeaway.   I'd much rather spend my money on luxury items: I like nice holidays, shoes, handbags, upmarket brand make-up. I don't have a lot of items, but when I *do* buy things, they're nice. That's way more interesting to me.",False,False
