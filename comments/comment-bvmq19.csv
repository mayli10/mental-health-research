I feel the same way re: limiting. I used to *love* thrifting and it felt good to reuse old clothes rather than buying something new. Thrifting is still a possibility (I bought a nice 2nd-hand shirt today!), but it’s a lot harder than it was when I could fit into nearly anything and feel like it looked good. Now, maybe 1 out of every 20 items I try on actually works. This is a pain in the ass and demoralizing, but I try to remind myself that not everything *needs* to work. Likewise, I’m still getting used to the extra weight and given my slight (or not so slight? I can’t tell) dysmorphia, it’s gonna take a while for me to be able to estimate size and visualize what might look good.  The other thing that has helped has been finding examples of women who inspire me both in their work and in their style. For instance, someone I’m really fond of is Rachel Goswell of the band Slowdive. She’s doesn’t look the same as she did when she was a teenager because she’s not a teenager anymore. But she looked great then and she looks great now. Having stylish-looking women who inspire me on a multitude of levels helps to remind me that the whole preoccupation of forever looking the same as I did when I was a deeply anorexic 16-, 17-, or even 23-year-old is seriously misogynistic and, frankly, fucked up! I wouldn’t expect anyone else to weigh the same as they did when they were a teenager and I wouldn’t care because I would never even think of it. So why do that to myself, you know?",False,False

Your comment really helped put things into perspective.   I relate to the whole once-androgynous thing. I miss wearing oversized t shirts and skinny jeans, but now those things make me look huge. Having to change aspects of my style based on what flatters my new/old body feels so limiting..",False,True

I was really resistant to the idea of getting new clothes for a long time for a long list of reasons including:   1.	Cost $$$ 2.	Sentiment attached to particular articles of clothing 3.	My identity was tied up with a more androgynous, MPDG-type style and this, I’m still convinced, is much easier to achieve when you’re w/o any breasts or hips to speak of 3.	It felt like giving up  But as I started to slowly add more pieces that I liked and that actually fit my now-larger body, I felt more confident and at ease. It made me more comfortable because I wasn’t doing my old body checks and because I was maintaining and could finally eat w/o feeling like I was going to burst a button.   It’s been freeing and ultimately empowering to wake up in the morning and go, “Hey, what blouse do I want to wear to brunch?” w/o feeling like I have to be careful about not eating too much at brunch so as not to cause any gaping or some other catastrophe. I can wear my blouse and eat brunch too.  I know it can be hard (and expensive!), so baby steps if need be—nothing in recovery needs to be a race. Just attempting recovery is hard work! And honestly, you can wear those black pants forever if you like—it’s your prerogative. I just want to let you know you’re not alone and that there are ways out / around this.",False,False
