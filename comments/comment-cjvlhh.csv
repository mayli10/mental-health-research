You can always opt for sashimi or edamame if grains are iffy, and japan's also known for their high quality fruits and veg produce :) Hope you have fun!!",False,False

I hate myself for worrying about this but I know my brain and it can't turn off even when I'm on holiday. I figure Japan is one of the safest places for food for me, but it's good to get confirmation. I'm a little weird about grains but I should just get over it - and fish and veg are definitely safe! And thanks for the sodium warning!",False,True

It all tastes amazing and calorie info is on EVERYTHING and it's easy to spot on the packaging.  I love the onigiri in the convenience stores personally, made fresh everyday and super yummy. Serving sizes are much smaller than average US foods. There are bomb gummy lollies that come in small packets, and there are a fair few konjac jelly and drinks which are like 5 cals each. Fish and vegies and grains are safe foods for me, so I was in heaven.  Fear not my friend!   fyi: I don't know about your normal sodium levels, but I personally rarely have salt (I just don't have a ""salt"" tooth) and I found japanese food (esp pre-packaged) to have higher sodium than I was used to.",False,False

All I can suggest is avoid bread but that's not really helpful,False,False
