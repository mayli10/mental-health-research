This is how I go , it was a mix of I was trying diet and work out but then “Reward”, myself later and soon the diet and work out was out and I was just bingeing  and ironically I was even stealing money from friends for junk food like soda, brownies, burgers, etc.  The bingeing initially started out during the day then it progressed into my overnight. I sleepwalk but instead of sleepwalking it was sleepeating I called it. Waking in the morning with my face in a plate of food (most likely pancakes) cause ironically I guess you could cook in your sleep. I broke 3 weeks ago tho when I woke to a trail coming from the kitchen. The bowl from the pancake mix,  then a trail of pancakes, my whole side of my couch and arm of couch full of syrup and me face in the plate as always. I woke up, saw the mess felt defeated and cried. I was seeing my doc that day so I mentioned it alittle and he sent me that day urgently to another doctor who prescribed me Topomate for the cravings and Vyvanse. Now, they consider me a extreme case and medication is not for everyone ! When it comes to any eating disorder you need therapy and support .  Anyhows, I hope this helps!",False,False

If you are concerned about your behavior then you should try to make an appointment with a therapist or meet with your primary care doctor to get a referral. Yes, binging and then fasting is disordered eating, so you should get that checked out.",False,False
