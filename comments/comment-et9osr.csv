She went 21 days only drinking water, tea and black coffee. She has done many 21 day fasts. She basically fasts for a month, eats OMAD for a month, does another fast. She has lost a lot of weight doing it, but to me, it does seem like she is slightly obsessed with her weight/calories/restricting (or fasting as she calls it). That is what brought me to ask at what point is it a mental illness vs very in control and conscious eating habits I suppose.",False,True

Is an eating disorder.    At the end of the day, if they can go right back to eating healthy foods they love after a fast, they probably have extreme but safe diet method.

Things like that. Now me on the other hand, when I fast it's definitely part of my ed because of my mentality and the fact that after the fast I'll immediately go to extreme restriction or binging.

OBSESSING over the whole thing is the key difference, along with spiraling tendencies and body image.   If these people fast for days on end, then eat a larger amount and then fast again when they find appropriate that's fine. You can even structure your life around it - like moving family dinners to an earlier time to keep them inside your eating window.    But what happens when, let's say, a social event falls within your fasting time? Do you stay on track but still participate because fasting is more important to you than eating right then? That is *still* healthy.     Now if you isolate yourself, avoid situations that might ""threaten"" your eating habits and feel emotional distress because of all of this but still try and try again because your body image is so negative you think you ""have to"" do this - that is when disordered behavior starts.",False,False

No. The heightened popularity of it right now doesn‚Äôt help either. Many of these under informed people will unknowingly walk themselves into having an eating disorder.   The biggest difference between healthy fasting and unhealthy fasting has to do with the mentality and the level of interference it has on the person‚Äôs life. If someone can involve fasting in their lives while also maintaining a happy and healthy life, then it‚Äôs okay.

In many of the posts there is calorie counting, eating only once a day/very very specific foods only. It seems to align so much with having an eating disorder. I was curious other people‚Äôs take on it, especially those of us who have been or are currently diagnosed with an ED.  There are times I look at their photos and read their posts and wish my disordered eating was as perfect as theirs and had a cute little name to go with it ‚ÄúWater fasting with OMAD‚Äù instead of ‚Äúrestricting and refusing to eat more than allotted caloric intake‚Äù when essentially, they‚Äôre doing the same thing.",False,True

I think the line is that some people do fasting and then return to normal eating as if nothing happened.   Fasting has been done for centuries and does have proven effects, but starving yourself is disordered eating, usually, and can definitely set up to develop an eating disorder.   Those of us with diagnosed eating disorders are to see anything that isn‚Äôt listening to your body as disordered.  Normal people don‚Äôt have to, unfortunately.   It‚Äôs very strange and a very hard line to draw.",False,False
