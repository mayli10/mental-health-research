But I like the way I make it :  1/3rd cup of egg whites 1/4th cup of oat fiber 1 tbsp of cocoa powder Two tbsp of sugar substitute Splash of vanilla Pinch of salt Pinch of baking soda  I got this recipe online, and it's great with sliced strawberries or bananas, but it tastes best with a topping.",False,True

You see fiber is a big molecule and flushing it fast before the bacteria can break it down will ""exfoliate"" your intestinal wall, that is not great.

It can give you serious long term gut issues. Reduce the fiber at least to 100gr. 30 is the minimum so a bit more is fine but above 100 is dangerous.,False,False
