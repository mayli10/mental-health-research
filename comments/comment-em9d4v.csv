Like getting sober made me conscious of the calories and absolute junk I was putting in my body . I think drinking and EDs are so similar like there both so obsessive like I was like when can I next get fucked up now it's when can I eat   But Like at the end of the day there both trying to cope with stuff like feeling not good enough and it's shitty,False,False

Always hated being fat. Never had the willpower to pursue a diet longer than a few days. Hating my fat turned into hating myself around the time I dropped out of college. I know I have a bad relationship with food, I bounce back and forth between fasting and eating an entire fridge; I'm not diagnosed though because I'm terrified of therapists, so I constantly feel like I'm just faking it for an excuse to keep being sad and mopey when I'm alone (this feeling exacerbated by how fat I still am).",False,False

One of them was just a gossip game where you had to pay real money to see what people said about you, and there was a thing with my name and the question was ""Should they wear tight clothing"" and someone replied ""no"".   Up until that point, I was fat and while I was somewhat bothered by it, I didn't really care. After that, something inside me snapped.   I also really want someone to love me.

My family used to watch a lot of weight-loss programs (e.g. Biggest Loser) and so I began to think ""number going down on the scale = good."" I also started fixating on the nutritional content of food and making sure I got my daily macronutrients in. Also, most of my family is overweight/obese so I was conflicted because I was the thinnest in my family but usually the biggest one in my friend group. I was never really preoccupied with my body image but I always knew in the back of my head that I'd want to lose weight one day.  Fast forward to last year: I became depressed and used restriction as a form of self-harm and a way to get people to notice that I wasn't doing well. This eventually led to me downloading a calorie tracking app, which really appealed to my obsessive mind. I became addicted to seeing the number on the scale going down and challenging myself to stay under my calorie limit. Oh, and I also came out as gay a little while ago. I think the gay community is still at a point where there is so little representation (especially for POC) and the representation we do have is primarily model-looking men that have their whole lives put together. Coming out definitely made me more self-conscious but in general, I think my mindset and patterns have set me up in a way that made restriction really easy to fall into.",False,False

I gained 60 lbs during college, and then dropped it over a year with obsessive habits. I instantly got attention from people as I went, especially from men I was into, and that just made me double down. It didn't matter that girls/enbies/straight guy friends told me I was attractive, *no*, only the approval of judgemental gay men matters apparently.
