I also have the same problem but I noticed that drinking more water automatically makes me feel much more full, and kinda (in a way) stops me from eating more and more because I feel bloated already. Or if you feel like you can’t stop, take a walk for a bit, it helps calm me down. I’m sorry for this :( hope tomorrow will be a good day",False,False
