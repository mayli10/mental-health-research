I think what makes EDs so insidious in this respect is that unlike many mental illnesses, there actually *are* physical metrics to lock in on, and there’s a tendency to use those to judge who is ‘worse’. Worse...what? I mean, it can assess physical damage but it’s ultimately a mental illness, and there’s no blood panel for suffering. If you are struggling, you are struggling. If you are hurting, you are hurting. That is real.   I mean, someone else having a compound fracture doesn’t invalidate my stress fracture. It still needs healing and I still need help to make that happen, and I wouldn’t wait until it turns into a full fracture to get help. Yet I totally fall into that perspective with my mental health issues - gotta reach ‘enough’ suffering firsttttt! (Spoiler, there is no reaching enough-ness in this paradigm)   There can be enough compassion to go around. Enough help. Enough hope. And you are already deserving all of those. We all are &lt;3",False,False
