Considering the comments I got (*over 40, all thirsty dudes*) it's obvious that I have nothing to feel self-conscious about, but maybe that's not a good thing since I am underweight. I do want to gain weight for health reasons, but unfortunately that doesn't seem like something that will happen. To be fair, what I was focusing on would improve with weight gain, but that's not what most of the people who commented were focused on. One commentor literally said ""My jaw just hit so floor so hard that it broke the floor"". That was obviously nice to read, but it definitely didn't help with my desire to improve my health.",False,False
