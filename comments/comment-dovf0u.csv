Right now I drink liters of hot tea, wear thick socks, and a warm coat but I'm going to start implementing all of the other tips now as well, so thank you so much . :D   My library at school is so insanely cold, but of course if it were too hot you probably wouldn't be able to concentrate properly?",False,True

So thereâ€™s obvious stuff like wool sweaters that will keep you warm but are kinda bulky if you try to put a jacket over it, so I really like thin cashmere sweaters and zip ups. Itâ€™s pretty expensive though so I recommend goodwills/thrift stores for all your fall and winter clothes! So Iâ€™ll put on a cotton long sleeve, a cashmere sweater, and then a coat with (faux) feathers if itâ€™s snowy or just a wool sweater and be good to go! Be sure to cover your neck also :)   I also have a little portable heater that has been saving my life for the last 3 winters. Just be sure not to keep it on when you fall asleep bc fire hazard! Lastly, I carry hot tea with me EVERYWHERE in a thermos. Thereâ€™s nothing like warming up with herbal tea in your early morning uni classes",False,False

I can't afford heating so I've been writing down ideas for the cold weather. They're not going to keep me warm the entire time but they're 'rescue' warmth ideas to help beat being cold all day.  - Baths!  - Yoga/exercises in small bursts through the day - Work/sit/read in the library (free and warm) - Cup soup, coffee and hot drinks - I have a 'nook' big enough for my bed but not too big where I can sleep and keep the warmth in with a curtain (once I make a curtain)  I have also got out all of my winter scarfs, socks and hats. You lose most heat from your head and feet. I'm getting all my long sleeve tops and leggings washed and clean too because layers are great.  Ooo, someone I know has a weighted blanket and I was thinking of getting one to help me sleep - I've just realised how good it would be for staying warm too.   Good luck my freezing friend! I can already see my breath in my home so it's going to be a loooooooong cold winter.",False,False
