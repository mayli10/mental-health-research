Is there a town nearby you could explore tomorrow? Or try signing up for a program at the hotel/ in town to have something to do with other people for that social interaction. And pick a day to just invite yourself along with the people you know. A few days or activities isn't the same as following along all day all week; I'm not sure why anyone would feel inconvenienced or annoyed!,False,False
