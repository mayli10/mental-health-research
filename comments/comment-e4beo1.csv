Most of the time they don't even realise but sometimes they kinda sorta do know that what they're doing is not totally healthy but they still want support so they present it as a normal diet. I see little ""weight loss tips"" being shared around that are just rebranded pro-ana tips. I see the way people talk about their bodies and their newest fad diets and the way they feel about eating etc., describing binge cycles without knowing that's what they're describing, exercise purging, etc. It's just like... once I see it I can't un-see it and I just feel so immeasurably sad, that these supposedly ""healthy"" weight loss circles are basically promoting and echo-chambering the same pro-ED stuff that runs rampant in other less critical circles  I desperately want 2 be thin but this is why I feel like I can't actively support anyone else trying to lose weight intentionally... everything is so messed up that I almost feel like it's impossible to ""diet"" without something going wrong somewhere",False,False

I keep hearing people say that everyone is disordered but what's the reference point? From the sounds of it my reference point just straight up was never healthy. So idk anymore.   I think it could be that we start noticing it more. Like when we say ""aw man why is *everyone* thin but me?"" Statistically in America at least, that can't be true. Like I know most people's eating habits can't be healthy if we ended up with 1/3rd obesity but disordered? I don't know. What counts?",False,False

I'm surrounded by people talking about dieting, ""cleansing"", needing to make up for food eaten through exercise, what foods are healthy or unhealthy. It honestly does my head in.  I had two colleagues loudly have a conversation about bananas being fattening after I had recently been discharged from hospital. I just want to tell everyone not to worry about dieting and that their weight is the least interesting thing about them.",False,False
