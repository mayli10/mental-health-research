I want to lose weight and I don’t ignore other aspects of my life in the process. School is important to me as much as weight loss. I don’t know. People don’t just get it. I am more productive this way than if I was just gaining weight and crying about it which I refuse to ever do.",False,False

You’re not alone I think it’s because they care that they want to encourage you to get better/improve on what they think will be beneficial for you in their minds. Meanwhile I’m trying to chase something that makes me happy, so it’s like, oh you don’t want me to be happy? But they do want that too. Just in a way that makes sense to them. I’m sorry OP. You’re not alone",False,False

We are afraid for them, and also afraid for ourselves should they slip away from us.   It can be very hard for people to see that for the moment the best help they can offer is to do nothing except perhaps to listen. I think it’s the most challenging form of support to offer - even as someone who has lived with mental illness and experienced the profound value of non-judgmental listening.   I hope you will find people in your life who can offer that to you &lt;3",False,False
