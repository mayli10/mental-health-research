I suppose I’ll see how this goes a little longer with them but if I’m making 0 progress over the next like 2-3 months then I’m going to need to do something else. It comes in waves of how bad it is and right now it’s just fucking awful. Thank you for your response. ❤️,False,True

Take it easy, it's all fairly new and recent, I'm sure your dietician isn't expecting you to have followed it completely anyway. Don't beat yourself up about it. You're doing great to fight the good fight.   What I would do is check into a facility or hospital or programme of some kind. I found the only time I could get myself to eat is in a medical setting where I was being watched and forced. It will suck at times but you will feel such a great sense of relief somewhere along the way because you are going to be feeding your body and giving it what it needs and deserves.   you got this, stay strong xx",False,False
