A good one which included All vitamins, amino acid and so on, like PULVE or whatever. You would drink 3 per day. Get all your cals and nutrition without to deal with 'eating right and healthy' now. Then you could try to fix your food issues with your therapist and start eating Solid food again?  Just a thought. Good luck. ",False,False

All I can offer is solidarity because I’m going through a similar thing and I don’t know what to do, either. I weigh less at 21 than I did when I was 13. Recently, the realization that I typically fit only into the smallest sizes of junior clothing had me a little shocked. I am essentially the size of a middle schooler. Still, I want to be even smaller. It hurts knowing what I’m doing to myself but I can’t stop.",False,False

It's definitely easier said than done to say to don't worry about it, but really, panicking probably isn't going to help. If you focus on one thing at a time and sort out what you want, it'll probably come easier to you to find a solution  Obviously I can't just tell you to just eat, but maybe slowly raise how much you intake every day or every other day, something like that. Push yourself to stop looking at a scale, and if you can't do that, then just try and write off whatever you see in your head.   People *will* get suspicious and that'll be more of a mess than if you let yourself recover. Trying to hide an ED and getting to lethal weights will set everybody off, and I'm assuming you'd rather deal with this yourself than have a lot of people bombard you. So, do some damage control before any damage starts.   You clearly want to get better, and while I don't know you, I do too. I probably haven't offered you the best advice, well nothing that isn't obvious anyway, but at least keep my words in mind. You are great no matter what weight you are, and you deserve better than stress and an ED. ",False,False
