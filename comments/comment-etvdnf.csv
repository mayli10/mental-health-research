I love you however you are, I just love you.” And it made me so sad that I just can’t see myself how he sees me (but also very happy that he loves me and isn’t mad).",False,False

The restrictive behaviors and their physical side effects...my brain somehow uses them to try to make me feel ok...feel good enough or like I’m special or deserving of care/love/attention. When someone looks thinner than me (and plenty of people presently do), that whole house of cards starts to crumble. I’m not exceptional enough, not the ‘best’, not worthy.   There’s not a lot of logic. But there’s a whole lot of emotions and emotional needs coming out sideways.",False,False
