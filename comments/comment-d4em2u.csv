Only eating cereal bars as meals and I found myself bingeing after a few days of eating only cereal bars. The past 2 weeks, these are what I’ve been eating and I think it’s been working well for me.   Breakfast: protein porridge (approx 450 calories), I find that eating something high in protein for breakfast stops the constant thoughts of food.  Lunch: half an avocado with 2 slices of sourdough, drizzled with rice malt syrup (lower calorie alternative to honey). Since it’s low in protein, I’ll sometimes eat a yoghurt bar. (Total: approx 450 calories) 4pm break time: banana Dinner: lots of vegetables, eggs, fish (High in protein) (total: approx 500 calories)  Night time snack: protein yoghurt + blueberries (approx 130 calories)  Total: 1500-1600 calories, some days higher if I’m hungrier but I try to not go below 1500 calories because I find that if I do that, I’ll have the tendency to binge the following day.   I find that having high protein meals work the best in keeping me feeling full. Also note that I’m very active and I exercise 5-6 times a week. Hence, I do have a higher TDEE relative to others. Not sure if I’m gaining weight by eating this way but I haven’t weighed myself in 2 weeks (first time in ages!). I hope you find something that works for you!",False,False

It even lets you add any dietary restrictions and all the recipes look bomb af.  Ultimately, I think you should aim for intuitive eating but maybe this is a good starting point? You can always follow the meal but take it as a minimum and increase your portions / add in more snacks if you feel like it ^^",False,False
