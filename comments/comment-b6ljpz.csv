My friends and I went out to celebrate the end of every semester during college. After second year finished a friend of ours was dropping out and it was a guy we admittedly found annoying at times. We all got so drunk that night he started crying at the bar and told us how he hates his life. That college was the one good thing he had because he got to see us. Spoke about his life at home, relationship with parents, an extremely strict and religious father. We all reassured him we'd keep in touch.     He contacted me the next morning talking about how embarrassed he was. That we wouldn't want to talk to him after that. Needless to say, that made us realize we should all tolerate him a little more. If it wasn't for that night, I probably wouldn't keep in touch with him to this day. My only advice is, ignore it and pretend like it never happened. Everyone understands more than you know.",False,False

But also it can be kind of nice to have people care about you.   Maybe just tell them from now on you'd prefer they didn't talk about it unless you bring it up first. Like ""pretend it didn't happen unless I ask you for help""",False,False
