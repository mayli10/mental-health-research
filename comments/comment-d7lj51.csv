It made me a lot less restrictive in what I eat and how much I eat.  I feel better about what I'm eating when I know it's good for my body, and good (or at least better) for the enviroment. That said, I'm obsessive af about eating healthy.",False,False

On one hand I definitely care about the environment etc but on the other hand I think it's just an excuse to eat clean and restrict....ugghhh.,False,False

I think it can be helpful to help recovery (and I plan on staying vegan for the rest of my life tbh) but it can very very easily be used as another tool to make your ed worse. In some ways it’s made mine worse because it’s easier to restrict, and it also made my purging habits worse because I would feel guilty if I ever ate something with animal products in it so I’d have to purge it ASAP.   If you think you’re in a healthy mindset, then sure, but you have to be ready to make substitutions for things that aren’t vegan. I honestly think that’s one of the only ways to make veganism healthy when you have a restrictive ed. Like if you’re scared of eating cheese, then I feel like you can’t just use veganism as an excuse to not eat cheese. You should still be eating vegan cheeses, vegan meats, vegan sweets, etc if you want them. Otherwise veganism is just a tool to make the ed worse. Idk if that made sense but hopefully it did?? Like I don’t think anyone with an ed should go vegan without sticking to similar foods that they would eat as an Omni person, so the vegan people that claim to be recovered that only eat fruit and veggies probably aren’t really free from their ed at all.",False,False

Can't help but feel like this is a better alternative to where I'm at right now which is b/ping some days and fasting others to make up for binges i couldn't purge. I'm sick of it, restriction does less harm to me mentally. I'm in such a terrible phase of my ed atm. Desperate to make a change....",False,True

I get where you''re coming from, I guess this is my ED brain talking. I can't really decipher the difference between my ED voice and my own these days. Ahhh.

I’ve been vegetarian for almost 8 years but I’ve slowly cutting out dairy and now using it as an excuse to eat lower calorie things. Dairy free meat and cheese substitutes have less calories. I guess it depends on how you go about it and your calorie intake when you make the change.,False,False
