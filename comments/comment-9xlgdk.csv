It's my favorite total relaxation.  I also like cleaning the house while jamming out to upbeat music.   Building elaborate homes on the sims 3 is nice sometimes, too, if I'm looking for something immersive to just take my mind off everything. I follow architecture plans I find online and get super detailed with it.   Crossword puzzles or a good book. (YA novels are great for this, because they're so easy to read and usually don't require a lot of thought/focus on details to get sucked into the story or plot.)",False,False

I have ADHD so taking an epsom salt bath is just fidgeting in a hot salty puddle for me, I don‚Äôt find it relaxing. I have to be moving and my self-care reflects that. Busy hands make my mind quieter. If that speaks to you at all, I‚Äôve included some of my go-to self-care strategies.   -	Change your sheets and make your bed -	If there‚Äôs daylight outside, open your curtains/window to let the light in -	Organize your junk drawer -	Take out the trash -	Tidy the room/area you occupy most often -	Take a shower -	Shave body hair (grown-out underarm hair for me is a pretty reliable indicator that I‚Äôm not taking care of myself, so shaving my pits and washing my body instantly makes me feel fresh and clean)  -	Brush your teeth -	Drink a glass of water -	Put dirty dishes in the dishwasher OR wash them in the sink if you don‚Äôt have a dishwasher -	Change into clean clothes -	Wipe the smudges from my glasses  Some people are pros at more relaxing types of self-care than what I‚Äôve listed. I wish I could relax. Napping ends up being me laying in bed for 45 minutes until I give up and get up to work on the mental to-do list I‚Äôve been formulating instead of sleeping. Meditation is similarly ineffective. My brain never shuts up until I make my body move to match it. That‚Äôs where I‚Äôm coming from with my list of tips, please don‚Äôt take it as me saying ‚ÄújUsT tAkE a ShOwEr YoU‚ÄôlL fEeL bEtTeR.‚Äù Stay safe.   NOTE: I have a history of cutting too. When the urge gets really strong, I stick a hair-tie on my wrist and snap it instead of cutting. There‚Äôs a brief flash of a stinging pain without the potential infection or bleeding of actually breaking skin. Just a thought. Ideally none of us would hurt ourselves ever, but if you feel you have to refocus yourself through stimulus I‚Äôd suggest something like that instead of cutting. I hope it‚Äôs ok to say that. Love to you and all of us here.   ",False,False
