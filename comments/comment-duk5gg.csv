In the earlier years of my disorder, I completely saturated myself in eating disorders. I was obsessed. I was constantly reading books, memoirs, blogs, research papers, anything I could get my hands on. I was obsessed. I needed to know everything, to trigger myself. It was a piece of the obsession. Also, a comparison thing, a competition over trying to gauge if I was “sick enough” which of course is a really twisted, bullshit concept but disordered nonetheless. My obsessive desires and interest in voraciously consuming  ED literature, documentaries etc. has waned over time though.",False,False

I was obsessed with books and media about addiction as well. Once I was diagnosed as bipolar, I realized I identified with the highs and lows more than anything. As far as ED books, the book that helped me get sicker became the blueprint for working my way tword health. Not sure if this helps but you're not alone friend!",False,False
