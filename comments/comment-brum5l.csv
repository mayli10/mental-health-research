And there was a dude in the thread who said **""at least the heroin-chic look of the 90s was achievable just by losing weight,** these body types aren't even possible for most women without surgery""   I wanted to tear my fucking eyes out lmao  Sure, you don't need to tone and be genetically fortunate to look ""heroin chic"" instead of like a weird potato with stick limbs, everyone's bodies actually just snaps into the same shape once they reach ""underweight"" on the BMI scale yup that's it bud",False,False
