Having an ED is so private and isolating. Your response is the most connected to someone I’ve felt about my ED in so long. Thank you for taking the time to read and respond.   I am so glad you could find some inspiration from my post. I really just needed to talk to someone tonight and you really made me feel heard.   Please take care of yourself too. ❤️,False,True

Idk if this will mean a lot coming from a stranger on the internet, but I'm so proud of you!! Recovery is difficult as hell and you're so strong to be able to do that! I'm so so glad it made you feel good &lt;3  Second, you are right! Tomorrow is a new day. What's happened has happened, we all make mistakes and no one has 100% good days every day. There are good days and bad days but at the end, every day is a day you've made it through and that is strong as hell.  This may sound stupid but your post was really inspiring to me. I think it's amazing that even through typing we can see you fighting back against Ed and all of its bs. You won't be stuck in the cycle forever. You've already made steps through it! Especially what you did in January- that is a huge step forwards. Talking about your feelings here is a step forward as well, and so is taking this episode as what it really is- a lesson.  I feel kind of like I'm reiterating everything you said but man that really hit close to home. You are so so deserving of all the good in the world, and it is just absolutely amazing to see you treating yourself with love. This will probably sound weird but one day I hope to be like you, not letting Ed consume you, and learning from it when it does. I can't really properly express just how amazing that is.  I hope you feel better and find light in your life soon, you truly deserve it. It's tough as shit getting through some moments, but look at you! You're doing it. You've been happy and you will be again. Thank you for sharing this. We're always here for you no matter what. Take care and keep being your wonderful self &lt;3",False,False
