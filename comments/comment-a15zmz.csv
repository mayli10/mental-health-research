I found it helpful to read about all the changes my body was making while I was pregnant. I gained 60 pounds, and 1 week after delivery I was down 30. You're body will have extra fluid, as your blood supply increases while pregnant and all the amniotic fluid builds. If you focus on eating healthy foods and staying appropriately active you won't gain any more fat than what your body will need for breast milk,  and nursing burns calories if you're going to go that route. I kept reminding myself that everything I ate was for the baby. They didn't ask to be conceived and it would be unfair of me to not give thtat innocent life the best start possible, which meant i had to eat. Make sure you take your prenatals, and focus on the fascinating miracle your body is performing making a person from scratch! I'm here if you ever need to message to talk or ask any questions!!",False,False

Try to focus on nutrition for your baby and not think about the weight gain, I know it’s easier said than done though! Try not to panic about the gain, my gains were alarming every time but it always comes off afterwards. A lot of it is water, extra blood, amniotic fluid etc and any fat that goes on is stored for breastfeeding and comes off quick as you BF.  Please talk to your midwife and health visitor about your ED so that support is already in place for after the birth. Pregnancy and childbirth can send your hormones haywire and make you more sensitive emotionally. I relapsed after the birth of my first baby. I recovered after finally confiding in my health visitor and family, and receiving the support I needed. Good luck!",False,False

I fell pregnant in the middle of an intense relapse. I'm 5'5 and was 100lbs at the time. I reached 156 by the end of my pregnancy but I had so much love for my unborn child that I ate, and I ate and I ate. Probably more than necessary but I couldn't shake the starving thoughts so I just ate to get rid of them. Didnt work but it was worth it in the end. My son is healthy and happy. I gave birth at 37w exactly, and he was 6lb8oz. No NICU time, no issues besides jaundice that cleared itself up. It was a struggle to stay healthy for 9 months, and I relapsed a month after he was born because i found out I was cheated on by his father while I was being induced, and the mom guilt is destroying me. I wish you a happy, healthy pregnancy and right along with it, I wish you recovery mama. Being a mommy is a blessing. ",False,False

The fact that you are being mindful about your mental health now is a great head-start for after the delivery. I was not so self-aware and ended up relapsing for the first time in a decade around 3 months postpartum. My daughter is 10 months old now and I have lost all the baby weight plus a shit-ton of pre-baby weight. I’m in therapy and on anti-depressants, but it took far too long for me to ask for help and now my ED is firmly entrenched once again. Don’t be me. My advice to you would be to stay very aware of your mental state and check in with your partner often about any sudden dark turns in intrusive thoughts post-delivery. If you are not in therapy now, I HIGHLY recommend finding a therapist that you feel comfortable with that can help you process the postpartum hormone changes and emotional side-effects of sleep deprivation.   Stay pragmatic about your pregnancy weight if you can. If you are staying active and mindful of your diet, the baby weight is exact that: the weight of the baby and associated support-systems. That weight will leave you when you deliver. That may comfort you if you are finding it stressful to imagine pregnancy weight gain. It’s not permanent and it’s not even fat, it’s baby and extra blood (like 50% more blood) and a placenta. Pregnancy forums are FULL of women who eat everything in sight and then claim “baby weight”. They are incorrect. Your body does not suddenly defy the laws of the universe. Don’t stress when they post about “OMG 10 lbs GAINED AND I’M ONLY 6 WEEKS LOL” because that doesn’t have to be you if you don’t want it to be.   Okay all that said, having a baby is still the best thing I’ve ever done and you are going to love it. The whole “love your baby at first sight” is bullshit, so don’t feel bad about not immediately loving a goopy floppy screaming potato. They get so much cuter when they can interact with you and you will definitely find your relationship with them growing once there is reciprocity. My daughter laughs and smiles and calls me Mama and it makes the darkest day brighter. Being a mom didn’t fix my brain but it is a rewarding life choice for me and I am excited for you to experience the highs of parenting as well! Best wishes!",False,False

Throughout I logged everything I ate/counted calories, that is up until about my last month to month and a half as I was just way too tired and my brain was just a constant fog and I never remembered. I was followed closely by my doctor who was aware of my medical history and I definitely started to freak out about gaining more than I did with my eldest. I gained a total of 30 pounds over nine months, but now that I’m 4 weeks out I’m already back to my prepregnancy weight. I have plans to proceed with some weight loss but decided not to log/count anything at least until the new year as I need to focus on maintaining a good milk supply to feed baby. I also have not been cleared for exercise yet, which stinks, but mommin’ alone is a fairly good workout!  Don’t fret about it and if you need to, just remind yourself that pregnancy isn’t permanent. I had some horrible cravings I caved into that I can’t even believe, but I don’t regret any of that now.  Many many congratulations to you!!",False,False

I had a 17.5 BMI when I got pregnant the first time (not tooo underweight, but underweight) and had a BMI of 16.8 the second time. Both times I got pregnant we had sex one time unprotected (was between birth control the first time, second was just heat of the moment) and I got pregnant so obviously I was VERY fertile even underweight   Both of my pregnancies were healthy with no complications. I did eat whatever and whenever while pregnant though. My kids were both born 4 weeks early but were perfectly healthy, I think my small body just couldn’t handle being pregnant anymore ",False,False

Congrats on getting pregnant.  I’m afraid I won’t be able to get pregnant due to my ED I’ve had for 7 years. I’m not yet recovered and I’m not looking to get pregnant this year but I’m thinking about the future. Does anyone know if it can affect fertility? I’ve read that it can. In my case I’ve been at a low to relatively healthy weight due to restricting &amp; bulimia for the majority of those 7 years. I just worry that I’ve messed up my body too much to even get pregnant or have a healthy baby. It makes me so sad to think about.   ,False,False

Dietitians are often disordered themselves. One that has a focus in pregnancy may be best.  Overall, take advantage of all support that you can access. Do you see a therapist? That may also be very helpful during these times.  Not speaking from experience, but it seems to me that the belly progress photos have more negatives than positives.",False,False

I think you may find it useful to speak with a dietitian about optimal nutrition, and calorie goals. EDs can wreck havoc on intuitive eating.   If you decide to not count calories during this time, be very wary of under-eating. Maternal nutrition during a pregnancy has life long (and even generational) effects on the child.

I lost all the weight at like 3 months post partum even though I was eating like a pint on Ben &amp; Jerry’s every day and a ton of candy/ snacks &amp; cookingrelatively unhealthy &amp; eating out a lot. I didn’t count calories though  By 5 months post partum I was down to 107 and didn’t count calories but was mindful of what I was eating  I got pregnant when my son was 11 months and stayed at 107 lbs until the second trimester, I weighed 129 the day I had her so 22ish lbs with her. I was back down to prepregnancy weight within about 1.5 months.  Stayed there for about a month, lost about 5 more lbs the next month. The lowest I got down to was 96 which was my lowest weight since like 4th grade. Now since then I hover about 97-102 depending on how bad I’m eating  I wasn’t strictly counting calories for when I first had her I was probably eating like 3500 calories a day and still losing weight because of breastfeeding her &amp; my son and I pumped on top of it to save milk  Now if I eat about 2200-2400 (I do count now) calories I lose weight/ stay around 97-98 lbs. if I eat like 2800-3000 I seem to stay around 100 lbs so I try to aim for 2200-2400 since both of my kids still breastfeed  Breastfeeding definitely burns calories &amp; helps you lose weight. Some people say it doesn’t but that’s probably bc the increase in huntger has them eating way more &amp; they probably aren’t choosing the right options and way overeating calories  If I didn’t count I could easily consume 4000 calories a day and possibly still be hungry. During our week trip for thanksgiving I was averaging about 3500 a day and could have eaten more but was already freaking out I was going to gain weight so I could see why breastfeeding could prevent some people from losing",False,False
