My brother is getting recruited by colleges right now for sports so all i hear is “your brother got a call from x” “your brother won this award” and it just makes me seethe with rage, like, you guys are acting like im nobody right now and when I was growing up you forced me out of the hobbies I wanted to do which could’ve gotten me recruited as well and now im an untalented person with low self esteem and now I feel like I have to go so much out of my way to get noticed. Now that hobbies arent something i can really do anymore I feel like I have to be a powerhouse in my career instead or something. God i love my brother but i hate going home and hearing everyone talk about only him",False,False
