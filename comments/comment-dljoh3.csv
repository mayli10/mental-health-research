I would only allow myself to eat 500 calories and somedays it would be apples and lettuce or other days I would waste it in a bar of chocolate but that’s everything id eat.  Now i’m obese and it’s hard to control myself. I’m 5”6 and weight around 75 kilos. My highest weight and I feel like a whale,False,False

I used to go full days eating nothing until dinner and by then my stomach didn’t want a lot of dinner so I ate maybe half. It del so good to be able to do that and now like you said I eat and 3-4 hours later I’m hungry again. I’m wondering if I have to retrain my body to be able to do it?,False,False
