The side effects are dependent on your chemical and emotional state. For me, I would be imbalanced and binge and purge non stop, but now with Prozac, I am much more level so any binge issues are really hormonal. Its great and has a really positive impact. I would recommend it. As for my first statement about being dependent on your state i was given the example from my psych to think of a depressed person who now has the energy to do things they avoid so it could mean now you have your appetite back etc. ",False,False

I actually lost weight in the beginning because it made me slightly nauseous.   But it helps SO much with binge eating for me. I am no longer an animalistic ravenous monster. I still comfort eat and over eat but that‚Äôs way more manageable. 10/10, highly recommend. ",False,False

Weight gain is a side effect of a side effect - ADs can cause your appetite to increase. I was on a whole lot of different ADs over many years, and I typically had no problem with the appetite thing.
