Because, like, i (subjectively, sometimes objectively) binge and them try and compensate through hundreds upon hundreds of star-jumps, but i'm always so scared it won't ""work"" and i'll just gain. I also squat really often so thanks for making me hyper-aware of my huge thighs and ass lmao",False,False

Anything in the middle is awful. High waisted jeans/looser mom jeans/slightly cuffed jeans are your friends. Solid. Color. Bottoms.   I can‚Äôt do hightop shoes but I love low converse, ankle boots (that hit where your calf tapers in to your ankle- not any lower or higher) and high heels with skinny ankle straps. Stay away from crew socks and midi dresses at all costs.   Also pro tip coconut oil with highlighter on your shins and center of your thigh slims your legs in pictures.",False,False

Didn‚Äôt go to the gym for a year after inpatient because 1) worried about gaining muscle and 2) it was so beaten into me in treatment that I should not be exercising, like was not even allowed to walk to the subway when I got to IOP. But I went to the gym and hopped on the elliptical for just 30 min and the difference in my mood and self esteem was so huge?? It actually gave me energy to complete other tasks.

It's completely temporary and is NOT bulk, I promise.  Growing muscle generally requires you to eat a lot of protein and eat near/above maintenance calories. If you're doing neither of those things, you won't really grow muscle, and you definitely will not get bigger!  For me personally, gaining muscle while losing fat has made me smaller than ever at my current body weight. I've been fatter than this while weighing less in the past.",False,False
