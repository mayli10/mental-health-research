And taking care of kids almost certainly has some calorie burning associated with it (depending on their age/activity level/whether you're cleaning and stuff)  The scale probably has some extra on there for food weight/water weight. Salty things are my weakness so after binging I tend to retain some water until I drink enough too pee it off. The scale can be a cruel liar.  I understand you're probably feeling pretty discouraged at the moment, but the worst thing to do is spiral and punish yourself. The best thing to do is to have some water and/or a cup of tea/coffee if that's your thing and forgive yourself for the past couple days. Give yourself a little bit of nutrition if you need it. And give yourself the kind of love you deserve (which is a lot of love)!   2 days won't make or break your progress, it's all about getting back on track and forgiving yourself.",False,False
