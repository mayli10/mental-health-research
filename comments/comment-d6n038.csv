I know this feeling so well oh my goodness. I moved to a college town where a cucumber is like $9 and it took my restricting to an entirely different level. Grocery shopping somehow became even more guilt and torture than it was already... your mind can always always find a reason why you don‚Äôt *neeeed* this thing. You do!  Prices they put on these things = random, no sense, often silly. Food we require to live = the opposite ü•∞",False,False

I've been there but seriously do not say that.      Four dollars and forty cents is 2 bus rides where I am from. Literally my fare going to and from the grocery store. Your parents work hard so you can focus on learning in school and growing up to be strong!! Please don't beat yourself up about it. If it will ease your guilt, maybe go to the grocery store and buy some bulk items (oats, rice, frozen vegetables) and make some cheap meals for the next couple of days to cut down on food expenses. I find dates to be a good substitute for bars because they cost way less and have similar textures/caloric values!     It's OKAY to spend 4.40 on food. People spend way more on an uber to get to a bar so they can get pay to get drunk and uber back home. That is not necessary to survival, but food is.  Give yourself a break &lt;3",False,False
