There also seems to be the early shoots of hope for a better you.   Recovery is a personal thing and unfortunately, it’s not sign posted with directions home. Even for some who make it home. Home is not what home was when we left. I won’t pretend it’s not something that is filled with peaks and valleys of emotional highs and lows. Draining you mentally and physically.       Just remember these rises and falls can come from leaning into the emotion. You can let the emotion overwhelm you. Let it breakdown every decision, positive response or confident thought for the future before the future has formed itself.    Recovery like I said above is a personal thing. If you have relapsed. You have relapsed. Take the power away from it. Strip away the emotion and you will take away its power. You relapsed but you posted and are gathering the strength to return to treatment. You learned and you are growing from this.  Never stop reminding yourself. Though now you’re afraid of KCALs and Food you won’t always be afraid of KCALs and food. You won’t always have a breakdown over fucking strawberries. Everything you posted above is past events. You know it happened. What your feeling now is the present. What’s before you is your future. You control your future not your ED.   Recovery is terrifying. It terrified me. It broke me down, but I learned if I create the terror. I can control the terror. I can overcome the terror, fuck the terror.   What has happened has been and gone. Tomorrow is not what happened today or yesterday but your perspective and your prerogative. Swans may be born grey. In time they become unrecognizable. Reborn in brilliant white feathers.   With time you will shed your old grey feathers for your white brilliant new feathers  and find your happiness.",False,False
