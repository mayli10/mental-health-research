I didn‚Äôt feel hunger and lost track of how many days went by. I wasn‚Äôt going to the gym, but walking around a ton to class and such. Long story short, I ended up in the ER due to very high blood pressure and tachycardia. I was sleeping basically 1-2 hours a day max and I remember they gave me IV fluids and I started fading into sleep saying ‚Äúwow what did they gave me? I‚Äôm going to fall asleep.‚Äù My dad: ‚Äúit‚Äôs just salt and water.‚Äù I insisted no way. Lesson learned, electrolytes are soooo important!",False,False

Personally I only drink water and diet soda. Or if I'm really miserable I'll sip 5 calorie broth. (In my experience eating just makes me hungrier.
