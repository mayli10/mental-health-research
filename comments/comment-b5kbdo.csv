After b/p for 3 days in a row and wasting a shitload of money I realized I was slowly gaining and it wasn’t worth it :( I lost weight after the first day of b/p and that made my brain think “green light” but it was a fluke and so not worth it   Sometimes you just gotta be full of regret and try harder tomorrow. I’ve psyched myself out of b/p many times - planning it out gives you a dopamine rush but then if you chug a bunch of water and think about it you might decide it can’t be as good as you imagined it would be.",False,False
