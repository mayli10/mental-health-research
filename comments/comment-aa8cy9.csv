She is really emphatic about how much she wishes people would read Wasted in the context of the afterword, and expresses some regret about the ambiguous way she ended the book so many years ago. It is amazing to hear her speak out about living a life that is not centered upon a former ED identity.",False,True

It's saying: Don't look to someone else to validate or understand you. Don't look to someone else to save you. We are all essentially alone in our interior existence; our pain is our own, and our joys are our own. This life is yours alone and ultimately, the only person you are hurting with this disorder is yourself. It's not that others don't care about you, necessarily, but the fact is that no one will ever be as invested in your own life as you. Therefore, it's your responsibility alone to deal with it.   The quote struck me because I think it gets at the heart of something I see expressed here quite frequently (and have felt, at times, myself) -- this constant anguish of invisibility, ""is my disorder valid if it doesn't fit this diagnostic criteria, or if I don't look a certain way,"" or more generally, the notion of ""does my pain and suffering even matter if no one recognizes it?""  I believe there's power in being seen, supported, and loved; I also know how terribly demoralizing it is to lack any of that external validation. But what I think Marya is saying here is that you need to take ownership of your own life, and not blame or expect others to do it for you.   There's no nobility or higher purpose in self-flagellation... so like, do that if you want to, no one can stop you. But at the same time, if you want to be happy, you've got to work for that yourself. No one will eventually show up to drag you grudgingly towards a fulfilling or pleasurable life, it's got to be something you actively want and decide to struggle towards.  IDK, this is something I think about quite often. I don't think people like to admit to themselves that sometimes eating disorders serve to subconsciously manipulate family/social relationships, in ways that can bring care, love, attention, or sympathy. As someone who lacks those structures and is likely to die alone (lol but really...) it's painfully clear to me that recovery is a choice I have to make 100% for and by myself.",False,True

No. I contain my strength and my struggle, I own it, I'm responsible for it, and nobody else's opinion matters.  When I discovered how easily quotes like this are turned around, they lost all ability to motivate me to any behavior instantly. ",False,False

Wasted really got me out of my self-pitying ""I'm just a sad girl who doesn't eat, feel bad for me"" mentality. Triggered the heck out of me in the process but still such a great book.
