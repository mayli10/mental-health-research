I can maintain without much effort or issues at 18. 17 takes less drinking/going out and more control but is doable long term for me. 16s takes effort and I notice symptoms of being underweight. As a teen 16 wasn‚Äôt as difficult though. 15 sucked and I don‚Äôt recommend it.,False,False

I personally function fine in the 17s and high-mid 16s. It‚Äôs pretty much if I‚Äôm not actively restricting, it‚Äôs all not a problem. I‚Äôve got the food and energy for my body to actually function properly. I only ‚Äúfeel‚Äù it when I‚Äôm fasting/heavily restricting. I‚Äôve never hung in the 15s or 14s for long because that tends to be when other people start intervening.   I personally prefer being low 17/high 16. I‚Äôm actually more comfortable there. Especially if I‚Äôm exercising regularly (enables me to be better with eating enough tbh), things aren‚Äôt bad at all.",False,False
