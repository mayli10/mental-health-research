I literally said to my boyfriend that I want her body - I guess drugs make sense but I kinda always felt like Miley wasn‚Äôt the type to do that after all the crap Disney put her through. Or maybe she is the type BECAUSE the crap Disney put her through. *shrug* I‚Äôm still out here hoping for ‚Äúsuper fit‚Äù too lol.,False,False

For many models/actresses who got into the business young, this has been their weight their entire adult life. My understanding is part of what causes problems in people with EDs is the act of losing a lot of weight rapidly and constantly being at a deficit, so for someone who‚Äôs always been underweight and is just maintaining that, the risks are reduced. Combined with that is the fact that they (often) have nutritionists or chefs, so they‚Äôre not malnourished the way people with EDs often are.  And then of course they have stylists and aestheticians and makeup artists and things that make them look healthier as well.   And then the reason it‚Äôs not okay when someone with an ED does it is because part of recovery is learning to be okay with a non-underweight body, and being weight restored is supposed to help us fix our relationship with food.  I think it‚Äôs less about a health concern (although there are health problems that come with being malnourished and losing weight quickly) and more to do with the idea that weight restoration is an important part of mental recovery.",False,False

As for celebrities, I imagine money makes a huge difference. They can afford the best healthcare, plastic surgeons, personal trainers and nutritionists, etc. etc.    I imagine that all of this can help significantly. Plus a lot of health issues can be covered up with make-up and drugs. We only see the fraction of their lives that they want us to see.",False,False

And yes, Hollywood, practically everyone does drugs unless they claim they're sober and even then. I used to live there and drugs are just a thing you do, no different than clocking in at work every day. Chris Brown is a meth addict and he actually got cheek fillers because his face is so drawn now lmao. Bieber smokes meth too and his skin is just abominable. Selena Gomez destroyed her kidneys with coke. All these hospitalizations for ""dehydration"". Their skin really shows it without makeup.",False,False

I wonder if it‚Äôs just because we only see them digitally. Sometimes I look really average or kind of bad and then I can take a really good selfie where I look a lot better in every way.   I have seen photos of Rooney Mara before (she is one of my top thinspos) and she looked really unwell without her makeup done, a cute outfit, and her hair styled.
