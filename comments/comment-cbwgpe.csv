Civil War Sickness. Feels like the verse about recovery might be relevant here.  &gt; (you ask me what it feels like. i tell you: salt. i tell you: rubber. my body is a field of tumors. i may die from thisâ€” the soft, the heave, the leavening bread. i tell you: full. i tell you: hurts. i fight from both sides. **when you ask me what it feels like, i have to answer twice.**)  You know this can't go on, just as you know that it'll leave a terrible hole if/when it stops. Try to hold onto why you told her, okay? Loss of control is terrifying, but hopefully your doc and dad will keep the process as gentle as it can be under the circumstances.  Proud of you for doing the right thing before you could stop yourself. Right now your brain is going full fucking Chernobyl, but that's to be expected. I hope soon you don't have to deal with this alone anymore.",False,False
