Stuff around 50 cal or less, only eat one serving every hour or two, and it gives me plenty of wiggle room for actual meals too. Just my experience though and YMMV",False,False

I straight up can’t binge. I’ve tried. I just stop when I’m full. I can’t help it, I definitely don’t look like it, but I restrict and it has nothing to do with binging or fear of binging. It might for you, it might fit others too, but it’s not fair to paint such broad strokes.",False,False

Restricting is a high because I'm denying myself the instinct to eat and eat.,False,False

Ever since I was a kid I've been like that,  definitely picked it up from my parents, they just like to graze all day and so now I do too.

I genuinely have no idea how I had a period of restricting because otherwise I'm constantly overeating. I can't stop and idk why,False,False
