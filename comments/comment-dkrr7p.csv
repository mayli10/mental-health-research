It really made the product seem sketchy. I couldnâ€™t find ANY legit reviews on this thing. Iâ€™ve been googling over and over and everything is fucking sponsored or fake. This is kind of an obscure sub to find this in but thanks.",False,False

I'm sure I'll use them up eventually (except the BBQ one. Gross). I got them on sale for like $5 each so it wasn't too bad, that's like the price of Grill Mates when it isn't on sale. Not too big of a waste!   I think the Nacho seasoning is vegan so it would be a good option for any vegans who miss cheesy flavors. Imma put that on popcorn forever now aha. That one is probably worth the money but the rest really weren't. For the taco one I'm just gonna buy the 50Â¢ packets at the grocery store when I'm out and refill the bottle lmao",False,True

I kept seeing ads for these here on reddit and they made it sound so amazing, ""just like bacon""!!!! But I kinda balked at the price ðŸ˜‚ Your reviews helped my wallet, doesnt sound like these live up to the add hype. Think I will stick to my mesquite grill seasonibg for savory smokiness.",False,False
