Doesn't add anything to the discussion beyond ""I disagree"", which doesn't help assess the merits/drawbacks of the suggested approach.  If you want to grab a shovel and do that digging, it'd get your msg/reaction across more clearly. I couldn't guess what you're specifically objecting to even if the prize were a hundred grand.",False,False

In my experience, we don't recover on our own. We just get better at hiding it. I think it's best to bring it up to guardians immediately. Sometimes students can work through depression or anxiety on their own or just with the support of a guidance counselor. EDs are not like that.   Definitely do not tell the student what signs were noticed specifically. That's literally giving them a checklist for what to hide better.",False,False

Walking on eggshells does not help an ED. Especially when the person with the ED does not want to change. It's like trying to change an alcoholic that says everything is fine.,False,False

If you challenged them about the sign, they'd be more likely to reflexively lie than anything else, imo.  I'd reach out to them as a person. See if they're okay. Trying to ""confront"" the eating disorder only adds stress to someone who's going to fight to keep the maladaptive pattern that often exists to relieve already-overwhelming stress.  The best thing a teacher could do would be to address the insecurity, loneliness, pain, underlying medical condition, or whatever else is behind it. The worst thing would be to cause the student pain, and/or loss of control over their circumstances, that incentivizes learning how to hide it better.",False,False
