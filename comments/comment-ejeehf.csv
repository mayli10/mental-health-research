Not when we only hear one side of the story at least. Sometimes, people reach their breaking points and might say hurtful things. It doesn't mean that he is a toxic, horrible person because of that. Even the kindest of us sometimes snap. It's not necessarily the person suffering from mental illness who's at fault for their closest ones snapping. It's just that mental illnesses do not only hurt the people suffering from them, but also the onlookers - family, friends, significant others. It's difficult to see something like that happening to someone you love. That's why, I wouldn't be surprised if my boyfriend would snap at me at some point. I would be hurt but not exactly surprised and not angry at him. It's just really tough for everyone involved.",False,False
