I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôre right, I‚Äôm by far the smallest person in jiu jitsu club, I‚Äôm the only person from our club even in that weight class. They can be jealous if they want, if they don‚Äôt want to be overweight then they should lose.  You‚Äôre a sweetheart üòò",False,False

But it really seems like they are jealous. Going up a weight class would probably disadvantage you initially at least if you're comfortable where you are at...I don't understand why they are so fixated on your weight. And cutting weight can be really body positive if someone is overweight. Some people just don't make sense! Chin up! I bet it was triggering, but I'm sure they were just trying to put you down to feel better about themselves. You're perfect üíñ",False,True

I felt really judged, honestly. I'm restricting and have been losing like crazy for 2 months.   A girl goes up to the weight classes for the jiu jitsu tournament and really loudly says ""who the hell weighs less than 115 lbs? no one weighs less than that!"" (less than 115 is the lowest weight class they have for competitions)  and I was just like ""me. I do.""   and then 10 mins later she's talking about how won't do competitions because the cutting weight part isn't body positive and she's ""all about that body positivity.""  ok, where was your body positivity when you were making fun of people who weigh less than 115 and claiming we don't exist? Then her and 2 other girls were telling me I should try bulking to get into a heavier weight class.  ugh, the whole thing was so triggering.",False,False

I am really math oriented so I immediately understand how so many factors play into weights and proportions but I STILL feel fixated on the numbers too and setting these ‚Äòcut offs‚Äô.   Honestly a lot of people don‚Äôt actually understand how different weights can look on different people, so I always remind myself that. I‚Äôm really into strength training too and follow some ‚Äòstrengh fitness influencers‚Äô who will post themselves at similar weight with different body compositions which actually helps me a bit. I have a number fixation in general so I found shifting it to slightly more healthy measurements than weight, like body fat percentage (this might still not be the right move for everyone though) and my lifting numbers really helped me a lot! Now I am really happy when I can go into the gym and lift X lbs more than a few weeks ago and it really helps occupy that fixation for me.",False,False
