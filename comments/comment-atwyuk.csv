At 17 I can see ribs and spine clearly without having to pose which seems to require much lower weights for smaller people.  Still rather be their size than mine though :( Giant skeleton means I’ll never look genuinely small.   In your case, male fat distribution and vital BF levels are also very different from women and really exacerbate this effect. I’ve been in treatment with guys I thought were wayyyy skinnier. You don’t see nearly as many so it’s hard to get a reference point to judge. ",False,False

I already had ribs permanently showing and a bone sticking out of my arm joint at a BMI 19, where as really short people can be a BMI 16 without ribs even beginning to show.",False,False

It was designed as a measure for populations and is still moderately useful in that capacity. Using it for an individual requires evaluating it in the context of other information like body fat percentage or waist girth; this doesn’t make it utterly useless there either.    “BMI is inaccurate for muscle” in an excuse fat dudes use to feel better about themselves. For all but the highest classes of competition in strength sports someone &gt;25 is gonna be a little portly, and even those athletes will acknowledge they’re making sacrifices to their health to maintain those weights and compete at those levels.   With height it’s a lot worse. A 5’ girl at 17 BMI generally looks *much* healthier than I do at the same level at 5’9. Similarly, a 19 BMI 6’5” dude is probably a lot ganglier than you’d think from the number. This is just the square cube law in action. ",False,False
