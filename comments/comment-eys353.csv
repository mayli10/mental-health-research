fgjo0e7,t3_eys353,t3_eys353,ThatChicBitch,1,2020-02-04 14:26:09,/r/EDAnonymous/comments/eys353/does_anyone_here_not_want_muscle/fgjo0e7/,"Yeah. I'm horribly fearful of gaining noticable muscle. It got to a point when I was so anxious about it that I started doing more yoga/soft ballet  types of exercise and cardio by walking a lot instead of squats/leg lifts and jogging in place. I'm *petrified* at the thought of my thighs getting bulky or my arms. I can handle thigh fat because that can be lost easily over time but thigh muscle doesn't just go away.   One of the many downsides to this way of viewing things, though, is that it's really not safe when you think about it. Not just from a health standpoint but a physical, life endangerment one. My ex was super into fitness and gaining muscle and I always felt bad when we'd playfully roll around, like trying  to grab the remote out of the other's hand, because you could just see the concern in his eyes when he was able to see that I genuinely wouldn't be able to overpower someone of his size if they weren't just playing around. Of course, Mace is a great thing to have and I always carry it on me whenever I go out but it's still a bit of a worrying thought.",False,False
