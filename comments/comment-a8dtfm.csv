We met and talked, and I explained what happened to me and why I reacted that way. I think he hadn't understood the depth of my sutiation before. I cried a lot. Told him lots of things, and most importantly I explained that I don't need nor want him controling my health, what I eat and what I don't; he is free to walk away if he thinks I'm disgusting or weird or simply too much.  But I will not tolerate him hurting me. That joke hurt me a lot, it ruined my day. If he does something like that again we will spot seeing eachother.  Thanks again everyone.",False,True
