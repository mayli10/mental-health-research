Always seeing just low numbers can be very discouraging and would increase the probability of future relapses, as in ""I'm only at day 3 now, it wouldn't matter if I binge and start at 1 again tomorrow "". So instead, because you already made it to day 36, continue counting at 37 tomorrow. That way the number represents the total amount of days and is always rising, which positively effects mental strength",False,False
