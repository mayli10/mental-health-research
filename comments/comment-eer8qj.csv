Just taking a few days of sample, but you didn't eat for two days, then had 3000 calories. That's basically 1000 per day, average. I would say that in this case you're experiencing reactive eating - an overeat stimulated by restriction. I do the same over a scope of a few days, restrict in the day some, ""overeat"" in the afternoon. Or, when I got my wisdom teeth out, I ate \~200-800 for a week or so while exercising via 5-6 mile walks (not allowed to do vigorous)... then struggled to eat anything less than 2500 the next week, every day. Eating basically high fiber, high protein meals, lots of water, lots of veg, I felt controlled by the need to eat and would put down meal preps meant for lunch and dinner over the course of a few hours, all while feeling uncontrollably hungry. Was it because I was weak willed? Sure! A stronger willed person maybe could ignore the body's need to it. Is it shameful? No. It's the body's will to live and survive overriding your own desire not to eat.   It's counterintutive, but sometimes eating regularly and letting some overeat occur for a short time can stop a binge/restrict cycle over a long time. It's hard! But you shouldn't beat yourself up. You didn't do anything bad.",False,False

My brain and also my health-conscious parents keeps reaffirming to me that it's a self control/discipline thing and that if I just change my mindset or *just don't* then I'll be ok. And trust me I try.  I don't know what's wrong with me I just feel so disgusting :(,False,True

Three months sounds about right. It starts in October, when the weather is getting a bit colder and there’s candy everywhere. Then into November, with Thanksgiving. Then the entire month of December is basically Christmas. We’re set up for failure. America is designed to have those 3 months be shit food months so that gyms can sell memberships in January.
