If your ID says you’re 30 but your face says you’re 40 people are going to wonder how you’ve aged so poorly.,False,False

I love my gray hair because it started turning when I was so young that I don't associate it with aging. Idk. I also like that the other women my age look so much....more adult-ey, not old, but....like... Grown ups? It's crazy what weight can do to a face.",False,False

I apply 70-100 SPF sunscreen multiple times a day and often carry a parasol if I'm walking for very long outside. I avoid going outside at all, honestly, because I'm afraid sun exposure will age my skin. I refuse to do muscle relaxation exercises in class that involve face massage and pushing the skin down, anything that might cause wrinkles. I'm 20 and I apply anti-aging products. I am terrified of getting old.",False,False
