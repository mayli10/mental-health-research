I accepted but only drank half! And I've been eating much more slowly and thoughtfully and not taking seconds if I'm not actually hungry. Not a bad start.   The counting and obsessing is so real. I just can't go back to that, no matter how tempting.",False,True

I'm proud of you for continuing to choose recovery. Weight lifting/body recomp is always good, theoretically you could stay at the same weight and look leaner. If you want some workout ideas feel free to PM me, I have a 3 day set I do (like arms, legs, abs) that have really toned me up and that are NOT overexercising as long as you have a snack before and after the workout",False,False
