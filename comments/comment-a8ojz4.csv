I've been on the meal plan for two weeks now doing well and last night I went to the sub, download the Zero app and set it for a 120 he fast.  This morning I woke up, went to the fridge and saw all the healthy meal prep in my fridge, the bushels of spinach and radish, the chopped garlic I so carefully peeled and remembered I have a daughter. She needs me to be healthy. I'm on a path of early aging and a higher risk of reproductive cancers and I need to nourish myself! So I stopped right there and then, made myself a veggie and turkey egg white scramble, coffee and took my vitamins.   I'm so proud of my daughter. She's 10 and so healthy, happy, active and not an ounce disordered. She woke up, made herself pancakes with chocolate chips, some bacon and hula hoops to Christmas music in between some math practice and cleaning her room. I'm proud of her awesomeness and I need to take care of myself for her. ",False,True
