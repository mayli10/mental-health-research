Try to remember that if he wasn't attracted to you, he wouldn't be in a relationship with you begin with.   When it comes to his preferred porn try to not view it yourself. It doesn't sound like your doing yourself any good by it.   I also suggest telling him that you know you shouldn't but that you are testing him with photos out of insecurity, since it'll probably help you stop.   Your relationship aside, you have some work to do with your self-image. Try to see if you can get access to therapy. It has been a great help to me personally when it comes to changing the way I view myself.   I hope it was helpful and it's brave of you to share this.",False,False
