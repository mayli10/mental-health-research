You don't have to open up about your ED in detail, just tell her that while you understand that she thought she was helping, you have some food issues that can't be fixed just by forcing you to eat more. And by doing that she wasn't helping at all.  You can tell her how you feel for leaving like this, and that you don't want your friendship to be over just because of this. Let the conversation be about friendship more than ED, if you're not confortable. You don't owe her an explanation if you don't want to.",False,False

Sadly I am a joke.   Reaching out and explaining stuff also means to open up more about my eating disorder and about my long history with it. And I don't really want her to know these aspects of me. I gave her some very vague and mild information about it and even that shocked her deeply.   In the past I ghosted friends that would ask too many uncomfortable questions about my weight/eating habits and I don't want to lose another friendship.,False,True

I’m sorry. Maybe you could try reaching out and explaining that while you understand where she was coming from and appreciate the gesture, it actually did you more harm than good?",False,False
