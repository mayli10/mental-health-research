Loved her so much but couldn’t deal, it was too damaging to my own mental health. I was about to tell her I couldn’t handle seeing her anymore until she got back into treatment (which she was working on) but then she died (OD) so. I imagine we would’ve reconnected on better ground.   I’d suggest talking about food and weight less but it already sounds like that’s not a focus. It sucks but perhaps some space is in order",False,False
