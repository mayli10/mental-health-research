According to Google, 'Snake juice is made up of water, salt, potassium chloride, baking soda and magnesium sulphate salts.' It tastes kind of gross (or at least the halfassed version I make does), but it keeps you upright lol",False,False

Like I'm just so full of food that I can barely execute functions without sounding like I'm breathing hard. It's painful mentally, and for some reason I can easily sleep after a huge binge.  I guess it's just the body's way of dealing with the circumstances.",False,False

Like opening-your-eyes-underwater-ish. It stays that way for a cople of hours or so. It's one of those weird ED things I never expected and don't fully understand, so I can relate in that sense.  I do lose all hand-eye coordination when I'm purging a lot, though. It feels kind of like drunk texting (like I'm doing now lol, so sorry if this doesn't make a lot of sense) where your fingers just don't move the way you want them to; maybe it's an electrolyte/dehydration thing. A lot of people who are into fasting are all about that snake juice shit, and honestly it does seem to help a little. So maybe you could try something like that?",False,False
