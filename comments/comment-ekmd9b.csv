I openly weigh myself in front of her and she always weighs less because she is shorter. She uses this as an excuse to not work on her body.   Its annoying because shes had 2 kids and weighs less than me and she actually thinks she looks comparable to me. Which my ED isn't crazy enough to tell me she looks better.   Wish i had her confidence 🤷🏿,False,False
