I’m pretty sure only ED specialists will notice or think twice about their patients’ low weights",False,False

Last time I went I was 8ish lbs down from the previous year, and she just said, ""you've lost some weight, was it intentional?"" and it wasn't, so I told her that. It wasn't from restricting on purpose, but it was from being broke and doing more healthy cooking at home instead of eating out X)   If I'd said yes, I think she might have been concerned because I'm supposed to be \~recovered\~ but she just wanted to make sure I wasn't dieting. Which I wasn't--then. Now I am, oops.  Will definitely depend on the doc's personality and whether you've had weight-related concerns before.",False,False
