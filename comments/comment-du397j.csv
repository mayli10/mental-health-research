When i was an overweight BMI, I restricted so good, ran 3+miles and was losing weight like a boss... once I hit a normal BMI at a certain weight it all stopped. I can barley fast and I can only run a mile but I do improve my time for that mile... ive been going between the same 15lbs all year.... guess thats what I get for losing 60lbs in 3 months last year üòí  Now Im too weak to run sometimes and just bike on a stationary bike for an hour. When I can I run my mile in the morming before the exhaustion of being a single mom working full time with 2 kids hits me.  Its depressing because if i just aye more I could run and id probably be skinny by now.   Good luck, keep those calories up and I really do find it helps to run in the morning.",False,False

I eat a banana before I go (half if I'm running less than 7k) and generally eat a pretty substantial meal when I get home. Overall at the moment I would say  depending on the day I'm either high restricting or not restricting at all as I also think running is really good for my mental health, it just feels good to be able to zone out and zoom along so I've had to make sure I have enough fuel in the tank to actually get outside. I'm also trying to improve my times and it definitely helps to be more mindful about food for that purpose even though it's a struggle most of the time. If it's any motivation, I PRed on my 10k this morning (55:53) and it felt amazing!",False,False

I run, but not so much since I‚Äôve been restricting harder and my times were going downhill before I stopped. I miss it though.

Restricting kills my times. I was at a 19 BMI earlier this year putting out &gt;2 hour street half marathons. I couldn‚Äôt even be bothered to do anything more challenging because I just thought I‚Äôd die. And dying in the middle of the woods during a marathon doesn‚Äôt sound like the type of death I really want to have.   So I gained 10 pounds, got my period back, and last weekend put up a sub 3 hour 20 mile trail run.  I also got shin splints, 5 muscle sprains, a hairline stress fracture, and a partially torn ligament while restricting.   I still hate all 10 of those pounds tho. Sigh. And my maintenance calories are reeeeeeeally high, so it feels really shitty. But I love my sport. And my family. So I keep the pounds and the food.",False,False

You‚Äôre less likely to get injured than if you added a mile in like a week.   I won‚Äôt get super into it on this comment but you want to know more about the muscle fibers thing dm me. We went over if a bunch in one of my Uni classes and it was really interesting. Or just google ‚Äúmuscle fiber types physiology and anatomy‚Äù maybe. :)  I actually like 5-7k most! I can do a lot further but I think 45 minutes is best for me. Usually I like to just have a time (45 minutes is my favorite) and I just go and whatever I get is what I got. I don‚Äôt like keeping track of the mileage as much. This helps me to not beat myself up when I don‚Äôt do as well as a prior time, because often my run times vary due to what I ate before or my physical state and what not. My weight always has to go down down down every time I look at it, so I try to avoid creating that pressure with time so while I do check mileage right after a run, I try not to compare it over a large scale.",False,False

Don‚Äôt feel bad, a lot of speed is actually built on practicing sprints and weight lifting. If you‚Äôre looking for small improvements in time though like say, shaving off a few minutes for several miles all together, I think it will come with time. :)   I got really fast though after I started doing my entire run uphill. After that, you could put me on a flat surface and I was really fast. But you really do need to focus on anaerobic exercises to gain speed because the muscle fibers which that develops will increase how much explosive power you have and therefore, speed. Running hills can help develop your hamstrings and you can also try running with some artificial weight on you.   Just be careful if you go uphill to not overdue yourself. I injured my leg that way. Start slow. Maybe try a bit uphill then go down, then flat, repeat.   In short though I did gain speed once I incorporated hills (even on my deficit) but not really without hills even though in this case my mileage increased and so when I did significantly less miles I was a tiny bit faster just because I could push myself a bit more since I knew the run would be shorter.   Sorry if this has some run on sentences üòÇ  Also, 40 minutes for a 5k is not a bad time at all!  Consider how far you‚Äôre going, you have to be a bit slower so you can go for so long.",False,False
