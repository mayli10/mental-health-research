Only at the end did I have 2 things slightly off, potassium and lipase enzyme, but my body was super f***ed up by then regardless.  Any decent ED trained doctor does not think that ""normal"" labs means you're all better. My stuff is all normal now, but I still have to eat Minnie Maud cal #s and stay restful, or my body goes into freak out flu symptoms mode. And my team still sees me outpatient every week.  Good luck and keep on keeping on with recovery! &lt;3&lt;3&lt;3",False,False

Not invalidate you for treatment. That’s just your ED taunting you. :]",False,False
