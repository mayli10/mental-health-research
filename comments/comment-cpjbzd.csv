It was hard for them to adjust but they seem more understanding now that they realize I am not going to tolerate it. I try to be compassionate/understanding and still get frustrated but weâ€™re in a better place than we were. Lmk if you have any questions, I hope you are okay! Itâ€™s so hard to deal with those comments!!",False,False

Set a boundary now and you can avoid an emotional outburst against them later.,False,False

Just say you are on a path to getting healthier even if itâ€™s a lie and that you donâ€™t want to hear about anything related to diet, weight, etc. Tell them what the consequences of violating these boundaries are (whatever you feel comfortable with) and reinforcing them. Sorry for unsolicited advice; i had to do this with both my immediate fam and my fiancÃ©â€™s fam.",False,False

I've avoided family &amp; friend birthday parties &amp; get-togethers for a year now because I have no patience with people who make these comments to me anymore. That and I also don't want to answer the question of why my last relationship failed. People suck &amp; most of them think they're being friendly, but don't think about what they say before spewing their stupidity. It's none of their business! I have a HUGE party I can't get out of coming up in a few weeks &amp; I'll definitely give anyone who asks me these types of questions a piece of my mind!",False,False
