Right now the fridge has some dog food, a carton of lite milk, and...an empty carton of lite milk. In the pantry is some cereal, some condiments/spices, a bit of flour, and some oil. Oh and the vegemite :)  &amp;#x200B;  I'm semi-recovered and my main meals are sandwiches and cereal. I just can't afford anything else, honestly. and we can't buy in advance because my gf binge eats basically anything, like the other day i got my favourite juice (3 1.25L bottles) to have first thing in the morning, maybe a glass or two. As a treat and to keep me hydrated in summer because for some reason I can't stand drinking water, no matter what. But all were gone in 2 days :( though thats not really binge *eating*.",False,False
