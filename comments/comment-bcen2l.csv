This happened to me and my problem was pretty severe anemia. As the other commenter said, you literally donâ€™t have enough blood volume for your stomach and your extremities at the same time. Take care of yourself and get it seen to ASAP as your iron levels can plummet fast when youâ€™re restricting. ðŸ’•",False,False

I have read that explanation too, but it's odd that I get purple nails and start shaking, while people around me eat and they are fine xD.  I'll probably expose that to an expert and figure it out from there.",False,True

This might be why your extremities are getting cold/turning weird colors, because some of your blood is moving to your core. It's the same as how your blood flows to an area of the body while you're exercising (like your arms get more blood flow while lifting weights). I'm not a medical expert, but I don't think it's very unusual/concerning. It wouldn't hurt to bring it up to the doctor the next time you see them! If needed, they can do blood tests to find out more information.",False,False
