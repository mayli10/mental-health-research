We are not separate people. They were all ‘normal’ men before they developed the ED. Does that mean they all made fun of ED’s / fat people before the switch? It’s unfair to generalise a whole gender into one behaviour.   I can totally see where you’re coming from in terms of women having to focus on looks more then men. That makes sense to me. I’m not sure that’s what was being discussed in the original post, though. Or at least that wasn’t what I got from it.  As for the tacos, the possibilities I can think of probably are, he either   1) uses the caloric surplus to gain muscle if he is a gym goer, which also makes one look less fat 2) you binge at times when he doesn’t 3) he stops there and barely eats anything for the rest of the day. He has a few extra hundred calories than you and therefore theoretically would have a proportionally bigger appetite  4) you restricted a lot and lowered your metabolism that way ",False,False

The science you're talking about is not the issue. Like I said, men do have higher TDEEs and such but that doesn't mean it's any easier for men than women to be a healthy weight. You don't really think that 1,500 calories is the same to a 5' 3"" girl and a 6' guy, do you? You would likely be much more satisfied on 1,500 calories than a guy would, so naturally it's no easier to be healthy despite the higher TDEE.   As for the fat part, I think that's an interesting point because to me women can be considered more attractive for longer than men as fat increases. For some reason once a man reaches an unattractive point it's little more than a laughing matter whereas once a woman reaches that point (which I would argue is higher) she definitely receives a much harsher attitude from others. So it's not even but each has their own ups and downs. ",False,False

But to generalise that to all non-ED men is ridiculous and downright harmful. Somebody in the comments pointed out how unfair it is that men have higher TDEEs. Do you not think men also have a greater appetite to accompany that higher TDEE? There's nothing fair or unfair about it, and on top of that we have no control over it whatsoever. To make it seem like men have inherited some goldmine is wrong (at least in this context).   This sort of post would be fine if it was just venting to a friend, but this is a large community that, despite the several period posts a day, has some guys on it.

From what I can see, she’s saying:  - Men are inherently fat shamers, have high body standards and make fun of fellow men with ED’s  This behaviour is absolutely not gender specific, these apply to both genders  - Men don’t have to do anything to look good  Why do you think we develop ED’s too? It’s insulting. We may burn more calories but we also have to eat in a surplus if we are expected to gain any muscle for aesthetics, or we are skinny and unattractive. By the same token, we also have to reach much lower levels of body fat in order to get that sexy jawline / elusive six pack that women desire.   Also yes, obviously the taco thing was exaggerated. But I think the much more likely explanation is that men generally do not turn to food as a form of escapism. It’s just less likely for men, they are more likely to turn to video games, alcohol.
