I would bring safe lunches to school and drink my coffee with some coconut milk creamer, until I met this friend who skips lunch and drinks black coffee.

I've considered myself 90% recovered for the last 7 years (to be honest, I replaced the ED with a drug addiction during that time, but i digress--i'm clean now for the record) and then we had to get a new housemate and i realized pretty quick that she was purging in the bathroom a few times a week and just like that I was back in my old mindset and trying to compete with someone who didn't even know that i was onto her. i finally had to tell her to stop or move out (and she did stop.. at least while i was home), but here I am still obsessing about restriction MONTHS later.  I hope you're able to get through this and i would recommend talking to your friend at least to tell them how those kinds of conversations are triggering to you. It's a step in the right direction at least, even if it doesn't fix everything. stay strong, babe. you're better than this disease.",False,False
