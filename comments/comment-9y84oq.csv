I think it’s best to start with something small and healthy, or even just a drink you wouldn’t usually have during a fast! (Like for me, I’m thinking of a meal replacement shake!) And just remind yourself during that time that you do have to eat at some point, and it is definitely okay to eat after fasting for any extended period of time, and just keep reminding yourself to try and push back that little voice that won’t be having a bar of it.
