I had to delete my Instagram because the models would make me feel absolutely terrible about myself. Itâ€™s hard to remember but the photos they post are edited and theyâ€™re very posed. Itâ€™s this ultimate perfect version of what theyâ€™d like to be seen. Itâ€™s no fair to yourself to compare your body to their photos that arenâ€™t truly representing what they look like, either.   I hope you feel better soon, friend! ðŸ’–",False,False
