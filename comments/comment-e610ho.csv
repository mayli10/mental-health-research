He sounds abusive...forcing you to strip naked and be weighed? And then berating you? Sounds more of a power play than genuine concern. He’s manipulating you into becoming depending, malinger you think and feel less than worthy because you have an eating disorder. If he loved you he would never take it out on you. I advise you seek counseling with him or a divorce...I’m sorry but I deal with childhood trauma as well and have been in a relationship in the past where my partner used that against me with the same tactics and made me feel so unloved and isolated. I didn’t have a kid with him though and wasn’t legally bound to him by marriage. You need to seek outside help because this is NOT NORMAL BEHAVIOR THIS IS ABUSE. I truly hope you find help and are able to find a way out. I know you love him and your son of course but he isn’t helping you - you said so yourself that that episode made you want to restrict even more so. This is just another form of trauma being inflicted on you, someone who is already emotionally vulnerable. You’re strong though and you will get through this. Main thing though is getting outside help. He cannot be your only support system. Tell your mom, a friend, a therapist - it’s a huge violation of human dignity to force you to weigh yourself in front of him naked in case you’re lying?? Relationships are formed on a basis of trust AND then accusing you of putting a potential child’s health in jeopardy??? You breastfed for a year which most mothers don’t even do. He is abusive, cruel, and wrong. I’m so sorry you have to go through this. Much love ❤️ hope it turns out all right.",False,False
