A person with an ED usually wouldn't want to one-up someone else with an ED. ED's are a lot more secretive than that. If she did have an ED, she probably would have listened to OP's story while silently castigating herself for her ED not being ""as good/valid"" as OP's ED. That being said, she would also know from empathy what to tell OP, or at least, know what not to say that isn't super triggering like that. ED's manifest a lot more internally rather than externally.   What is more likely is that she just feels the need to one-up everyone.",False,False

You may be her friend, but she is extremely toxic towards you. She is insanely insecure and she knows exactly what she is doing to you.",False,False

Which doesn’t excuse their behavior but it might not be intentionally malicious.  u/dreamingofskinny it doesn’t sound like you’re being overly sensitive or competitive. This friend sounds competitive and insensitive. It is not very friendly for someone to make such outlandish and suspicious claims of ‘success’ in direct opposition to issues they know a friend is struggling with (like employment or weight).   I’d want to celebrate a friend starting a new, awesome job even if I was struggling to find employment, but a friend bragging about turning down a job in YOUR field they weren’t even qualified for is very odd. Bragging about unbelievable weight loss right after you confided about ED is very odd. I’m sorry your friend isn’t being very supportive.",False,False

She's not being a good friend. Do you think she has an ED herself, or do you think she's doing that to make you feel bad? Because if she doesn't have an ED herself, she's doing that with malicious intent. And, even if she did have an ED, she knows how triggering that is.",False,False
