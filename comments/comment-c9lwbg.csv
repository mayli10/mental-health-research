I've thought about reaching out to him and asking him to help me but I just can't.   I am already such a big disappointment. He always tells me how much he loves me and is proud of me so I dont really want him to know how fucked up i really am.   He commented once on my weight so I always make sure that if he is around I am always munching on something. Even though I HATE eating around people. What we do for love ..... üôÉ,False,False
