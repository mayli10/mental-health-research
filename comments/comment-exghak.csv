My first suggestion is to research gastroparesis because it may be a condition you will have in the beginning of the process of stopping binge/purge and eating a bit more.  I have found the longer I can go without b/p, the easier it is to continue (I know, catch 22). But even just a day turns into two days. For me, giving myself permission to b/p every other day and really working on that small goal has been helpful. For digestion, making sure to eat foods that are lower in fiber is necessary to alleviate some of the digestive issues. Seriously, supplements might be a requirement at first because it is hard for my system to handle anything fruit/veggie-ish.   I wish you the best and am so glad you are making those difficult steps toward a healthier way of being.  Be gentle with yourself! It is quite a struggle at first ðŸ’›",False,False
