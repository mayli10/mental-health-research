I have a baby face, and if I gain weight, my face just gets chubbier. I have a strong jaw, and the only way my face looks more feminine is when I'm really skinny. Still working on trying to like my face as it is... It's hard.",False,False

I have no idea how to free myself from it either though...   For me I try to find one small thing that makes me feel good physically, whether it be a sport, drawing, or dancing/singing for the sheer joy of it, and slowly focus on that as opposed to body checking. I find it easier to accept myself when I'm focused and can't see what I look like and just feel good in my body with what I'm doing in that moment. I give myself something to look forward to that isn't related to my self image or to food and that makes each day a little more bearable.  Stay strong tho sis, I think this is one of those things that we can only get of free of with time and gradual recovery unfortunately",False,False
