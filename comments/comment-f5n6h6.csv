I moved schools a lot so developing friend groups was hard. My last highschool I kind of gave up. Got a friend group, but I left school for months due to personal reasons. I came back to nothing. The people who still interacted with me didn’t seek me out as often. Felt more like a burden on them. So, I sat alone at lunch, and just did my own thing. I talked to teachers more than students. When you constantly think about food and calories, you don’t have time to think about what others may think or how alone you feel.",False,False
