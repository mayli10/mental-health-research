I find I have a hard time accepting slip ups but I keep telling myself that they're only okay as long as I continue to move forwards, whatever the pace.",False,False

It makes many feel scared and like they are loosing control. I absolutely believe that if you feel like you need more time to reflect you should. Don't get stuck in one place, try to move towards recovery, small small steps, but try to keep some momentum. For example you can read up on inspiring stories or reasons to recover etc to motivate you to take steps in the right direction.",False,False
