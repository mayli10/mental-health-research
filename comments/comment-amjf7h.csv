My GI doc told me that the body will actually start taking energy away from other organs in order to survive. So depending on how long and hard you've been restricting, that could definitely play a big part in your current GI issues  Ofc there could be other stuff going on as well, but either way, restricting isn't all that good for your body",False,False
