He didn't have anorexia, but he was trying to cure my brother's autism through various diets (keto, gluten free, sugar free, no high-fructose corn syrup, no dairy, etc.) He made both my brother and myself participate without participating himself. Now I've got an ED and my brother has bulimic tendencies. Shit, this makes a lot of sense.",False,False

I asked him the same thing and he said that me being informed is an attractive quality because most people arent aware/dont care about what they put in their bodies. Specifically I was checking for high fructose corn syrup which is something we both avoid because its terrible for you lol so I think he just liked that we feel the same way about the same ingredient,False,True
