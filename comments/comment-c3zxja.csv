Even though we had sex last night? Then they broke out the conversation this morning. So I'm moving in a month from ~~our~~ their apartment after living together for almost a year.  Now they're trying to get me to eat today and keep asking if I want to eat [insert food I usually love here]. I'm genuinely not interested or hungry. I don't care anymore that not eating will upset them now since no matter how much I ate before to make them happy it clearly wasn't enough to prevent this from happening. And now I'm just trying to not spend the entire day crying in bed since I need to focus on this move out so I can leave as early as I can.,False,False

They did order me a new one.) and we are supposed to wear black bottoms and even though leggings are ok, I don't have any in a size that fits.

I enjoy social eating but damn I'd rather have a normal day tomorrow and indulge in pb&amp;j  Also, I was talking about food and veganism with my boyfriend earlier and how it would be so easy to do, and he said 'Honestly, I believe it. You already fast, so going vegan would probably be even easier for you'. I felt so validated. My family would disapprove and see it as unnecessary and etc. The only reason I haven't started a vegan diet is because I have half a cow in my freezer that I need to use up over the summer.
