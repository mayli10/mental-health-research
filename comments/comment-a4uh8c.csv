It was more so just me crossing my legs in a normal fashion so much that I pinched a nerve. I had numbness and tingling in my ankle all the way through to my big toe. After 4 months, the tingling has gone away and most of the numbness but I still can't really move my big to upward anymore. I cross my legs out of habit. Never really realize I'm doing it until the tingling starts to kick in. ",False,False
