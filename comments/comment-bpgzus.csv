We would always eat meals together and then do things, and typically we hang out for full days at a time. Even now we hang out for full days and our eating schedules and amounts are so different it's hard to find a balance that fits my needs/habits and her needs for recovery",False,True

In my opinion it's best to just not bring your illnesses up at all since I feel that it just can't be constructive. Eating disorders are very competitive and that can have major consequences for friendships...   I think you should support each other without actively discussing your food issues, maybe just do normal friend activities to distract from said issues? It's hard but in my experiences the ED struggles should be kept away from some friends.",False,False
