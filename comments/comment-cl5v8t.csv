I read somewhere that it causes a spike in cortisol levels, and fat in the belly is stored instead of burnt.  I don't know if that applies to you, though.",False,False

It might be bloat, constipation, or a number of other things that distend your stomach that isn't actually fat.  I do a lot to have regular BMs (can outline if you want), I drink a lot of water (no more than 1L per hour, pee should be light but NOT clear), I take electrolytes, I take a multivitamin, and I make sure I get probiotics.  Taking care of your organs can REALLY lead to some size slimming even though it doesn't actually lead to pounds lost.",False,False
