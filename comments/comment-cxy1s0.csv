And itâ€™s our worst nightmare (food).   The other time I was home I wanted one hard boiled egg and she was forcing me to eat two because the eggs were small...like MOM I CAN DECIDE HOW MANY EGGS I WANT?!!!!,False,False

Like I'll be 25 in less than a month as well but the way she dictates when and what I can eat makes me feel like a 12 year old again!   I would move out in a heart beat but I'm poor and in an LDR and the only way I can afford to see my boyfriend is if I'm not also paying rent   But fuuuuck dude it sucks and I'm sorry you have to deal with it too,False,True

Iâ€™m literally about to drive home to my parents house in 2 hours with a bag of my safe food and canâ€™t wait for the questioning and berating. Why are you eating that?! Why does it take you so long to make your food??? We have bread here why did you bring your own? You donâ€™t need to measure that out you donâ€™t always have to follow a recipe?!   Seriously leave me alone Iâ€™m 25....,False,False
