I love having an espresso in a chai tea with a splash of oat milk. 10-ish calories, flavorful and perfect for a cold day.   &amp;#x200B;  I love coffee, but I don't have a lot of money. I buy alright beans and grind them up in my vintage coffee grinder (like [this](https://www.google.com/url?sa=i&amp;source=images&amp;cd=&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjniJCO0Y3fAhUDUlAKHQmECA8QjRx6BAgBEAU&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FManual-coffee-grinder-vintage-manual%2Fdp%2FB00GOJGT9C&amp;psig=AOvVaw2Z6cNYbwMYOMo2onqxm9OR&amp;ust=1544269159960679), burns calories). I have a little french press (NOT glass this time, because I keep fucking breaking them), but when I'm lazy I just dunk a coffee pad in hot water like a tea bag. Honestly still tastes great. Besides chai, earl grey is also strangely delicious with an espresso in it.",False,False
