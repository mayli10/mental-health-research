But even just thinspo and those recepies can change someones life (it gave me ed). Please, its not okay to have that kinda content.  Way to attack OP and make them feel bad for a blog you never even saw. How do you know OP didn't have ""fitspo"" over traditional thinspo. Maybe just photos of models. Maybe they had unique recipes stored there. OPs blog didn't give anyone an ED because that is not how mental illness work. You may have been predisposed to a dissorder, but coming across thinspo blogs is not usually an accident like the Anorexia After School Specials depict. Chances are you were looking for it and that is how you found it.  The gas station selling cigarettes did not make anyone addicted to nicotine.",False,False

BUT GOOD NEWS MAYBE? they reactivated me out of the blue. when I got terminated I was in the mood to pitch a fit so I sent in an appeal or something (totally expecting it to be ignored because they have so little tolerance for thinspo blogs)  I never got a response but one day I decides to go to my old url for shits and giggles and it actually went to my blog. and I was able to log back in and everything.  so maybe try to pick a fight with tumblr staff and send an appeal because I think that might have worked for me. I was so shocked. I thought when blogs were terminated everything was deleted but I guess not,False,False

Tumblr is garbage now esp after the nsfw ban and the ugly new color pallet (that shit burns my fucking retinas) ,False,False
