Apathy towards eating, losing interest in something that used to be fun for you (cooking, baking) and finding the effort required by eating to be a chore/gross sound like extreme apathy. You could definitely still have an eating disorder and this would probably quality as disordered eating but from what you've said it sounds more like the root problem/cause is your lack of any motivation to eat rather than a newfound motivation to restrict, if that makes sense.  If possible I would push the issue with your therapist. I know you've already said that you would like to address it but it's ridiculous that they won't so feel free to get pushy because they SHOULD be listening. Maybe they're thinking along the lines of ""well this is a symptom of what you're already here for, so let's address the root cause first,"" but they don't realise that by dismissing your concerns they're not helping the situation. Focus on the fact that you go MULTIPLE DAYS without eating. Repeat to them that this is causing YOU concern and so it should cause THEM concern, too, as your therapist(s).  If they keep brushing you off then maybe look into a therapist who specialises in disordered eating, again, not because this is necessarily an eating disorder, but because they might be more conscious and empathetic to this issue. Not always, though... I'm sorry you've had such awful luck with bad therapists.  Maybe you could also see a dietician? Check out reviews for dieticians/nutritionists in your area and see if any of them seem like they're also familiar with the psychology of eating. They may, in the meantime, be able to teach you easy recipes that hit all your macros and are more palatable for you to eat right now.",False,False

Get some blood work done to see if you have any deficiencies and check your thyroid levels. Write down what you eat in a week and show it to your doctor.   Did something happen three years ago? A change in appetite can be explained by anxiety or depression if the cause isn’t a physical medical issue.   Don’t let people dismiss your concerns. People in medical professionals are way overworked, encouraged to rush through their checkups so they can squeeze as many patients in a day and maximize profits for the practice/hospital. You need to seriously advocate for yourself. Bring it up to your therapist again. After all, you are paying them to help you and if you think you need help with your eating, your therapist should be helping you with that. If they try to move onto different subjects, redirect them, be like “no I really want to talk about my eating because it’s the predominant issue that’s giving me anxiety and making me worry about my own health.” Don’t be afraid of being labeled as a difficult patient. You deserve help.",False,False

Maybe you should go see a doctor and get some tests done, there might be an underlying issue. And since you're not really eating it's worth checking if you have any deficiencies.",False,False
