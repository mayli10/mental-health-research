There is no metrics or degree of suffering when it comes to an ED.   Like you I have had issues with food since I was 13. I reacted a point in my late 20’s and early 30’s where I endangered my employment and put my life at risk. At no point did I think my behaviour was anything other then normal, mundane or ordinary. I wanted to reach a number. A weight goal. Fortunately or unfortunately I never reached that point. If I had I would have done irreversible damage.   I am nowhere near that point in my life but I do still find myself sheding weight drastically from time to time. I don’t have a normal feeding or sleeping cycles. I appear healthy. I seem well adjusted and happy. I am not.  For a long time. I thought I had achieved a less chaotic life balance and relationship with food. I was wrong, I was very wrong. The price paid to find out where I am as person was losing a loving relationship.    Even if you’re not showing signs of muscle wastage, food phobia or erratic eating. You can still have a problem with food and how you are living with it. You don’t have to be in position of physical, mental and emotional turmoil and pain to say “I need help with this, can you help me.” It helps to discuss the small things that make up the big thing.   Be honest with your doctor and therapist. They are trained professionals, they will know the scale of the problem. If there is a problem. Talking even a few words helps. Just part of good mental health and wellbeing.   Hope my sharing helped. Thanks for sharing your story.",False,False
