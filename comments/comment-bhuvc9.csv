I can totally see my sister saying she weighs something and me thinking, ""No way, you'd be dead!"" Not because she doesn't look thin, but because that number in my head doesn't register as normal just from the limit of my own experiences. Especially because I'm so much taller than her, so my healthy is way above hers.   I don't know your husband, but guys are stereotypically awful with numbers, and I bet his thought process was similar. Just out of his frame of reference, not that you're not thin!",False,False

I look like I weigh more than I do and it kills. Also, I sent my boyfriend a picture from the beginning of April to now (were long distance atm because I moved states this month) and there is an obvious difference between the two, his response: “Did those send in order?” Fuck. Me. We’ve FaceTimed and such and he’s seen my body too, so he really thought I gained weight and that my tummy is as big as it was. Triggered the fuck out of me. They’re so fucking stupid sometimes LOL, no harm was meant, just sucks ass.",False,False
