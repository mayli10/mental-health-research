I'm not sure how the chemical reactions in your body manage that, but I feel like that means you burn a couple extra calories in a day.",False,False

I guess my question is in this particular case with Wellbutrin, are you starting at step 1 (i.e., your body is “exercising” and burning fat via the effect Wellbutrin has on your system), or are you starting at step 3, where the heart rate is increased but no fat was burned? Elevated heart rate is a symptom of exercise, but also of anxiety/stress, anatomical issues, chemical imbalances, and some of those burn fat while others don’t.",False,True

The fat becomes CO2. The heart rate increases and the CO2 is filtered out by the blood. It then returns to your lungs where it is expelled.,False,False

Elevated heart rate is a good way to estimate efforts exerted when working out, because it’s a symptom of exercise, but the elevated heart rate itself isn’t what’s burning the calories (the exercise you’re doing is).  Which is why when people want to be even more accurate with how many calories they’re burning, they measure O2 output instead (since most of the fat we burn gets expelled through breathing). Which is why I was curious about this- my HR is up, but I’m also breathing more heavily and sweating more, which are other indicators that my body is working harder than before.",False,True

So even though I did OMAD, it was always huge take outs (think, like, a pound of chicken tenders), so I gained like 20 lbs on Wellbutrin.",False,False

It’s most effective on appetite and tends to raise energy level, so not unheard of for people to start eating less and exercising more.",False,False
