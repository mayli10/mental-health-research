It's puzzling though because despite being in such a huge deficit for so long I wasn't losing any weight (if I was I would have been underweight) so I think it's due to muscle gain while simultaneously losing fat, (body recomposition I guess?¬ø) or my body is like nah girl you need some body fat we ain't losing more.",False,False

But ""relatively normal"" eating looks different to different people.  I'll try to describe what it looks like for me here.  I've always tried to be conscious of what I eat and pick lower-cal options.  I also HATE spending money on food, and this in itself is enough to keep me from purchasing and consuming high-cal food 95% of the time.  I eat ""normally"" when I'm with my boyfriend, meaning about the same amount he does (!!!) and let it be a cheat time for me.  If we go to a restaurant I usually let myself have whatever I want, regardless of calories.  This all helps me stave off real binges, since I know at least once a week I'll have a couple of nice meals with foods I don't normally eat.  I'll also let myself enjoy free meals at work and things like that, but try not to go *too* crazy.  (Although I often fail...)  When I'm on my own, I probably eat between 600‚Äì1000 cals a day.  I know that's not normal at all, but it offsets the higher-cal meals and my weight has stayed pretty constant for maybe six months now.  (btw, I literally do not exercise at all...)  I stopped tracking numbers because it is triggering and instead I just focus on eating safe foods.  I still do not purchase bread products, anything with added (real) sugar, or any dairy other than nonfat Greek yogurt.  If I have breakfast it's probably one piece of fruit, one cup of yogurt, or oatmeal.  For lunch I usually have around 200 cals of fruit and yogurt, or veggies with hummus, or maybe a small salad with some meat.  For dinner I eat a lot of cooked veggies and one or two eggs, or tofu, or a little bit of meat.  Usually it all fits in a deep cereal bowl.  For dessert, I might have some more fruit or a sugar-free popsicle (or two).  Overall, I try to listen to my body's hunger cues...for the longest time I thought they were broken, but I promise it gets easier with time.  Since I am maintaining I don't feel the physical side effects of restricting so I'm less tempted to stuff my face, and that is a huge plus.  There are some foods I still have a hard time with, and I know I am still undereating most days, and I still do binge from time to time.
