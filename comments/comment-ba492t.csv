If you‚Äôre willing to work on it, you can move past this. It will never be 100% recovery, but you don‚Äôt have to live like this. I can‚Äôt tell you that calories and your UGW will stop nagging in the back of your head but I can tell you that it‚Äôs possible to not restrict yourself to death. You can and you will recover. You will be strong and take control again but you have to be willing to. ",False,False

I also love someone who has horrendous uncontrolled ADHD, insomnia, a twisted spine, almost no short term memory and hes not easy. You know?   Love doesnt care about our faults or struggles.

I am talking exclusively from my own experience, but whenever (in past 2 years of being bulimic) I thought I've finally hit the ultimate rock bottom, it managed to become even worse probably 2 weeks after that.

I feel like I won't be able to take a step over my fear of being a failure by eating, by gaining weight and actually seeing my ribs slowly disappear under layer of fat.  I fear seeing myself become fatter than I already see myself.  I am so done with seeing blood after purging because I have scratched my throat 3 times today. I am so done with being deadly pale and seeing my hair fall out all the time. I am so done with my 60 year old's knees and poor circulation in my body. I am just so tired of looking so tired every single day and waiting from morning to evening to purge whatever I managed to binge in 10 minutes.  I would like to die, or to get better. I don't expect much. Maybe just to stop stepping on a scale every single morning? Maybe to get a freaking break from food for once? Maybe just to stop being so moody and desperate all the time?",False,False

This could be a sign you‚Äôre ready to make a change, even if it takes quite a while. This happened for me and I couldn‚Äôt take it anymore. Since then I‚Äôm a lot better than I used to be even if I‚Äôm not ‚Äònormal‚Äô with food, and it‚Äôs made my life so much easier even though it SUCKED at first when recovering. Try starting small, just watching recovery channel videos for motivation or positive talk, then maybe SLOWLY in tiny tiny increments upping calories a bit on restriction days for small victories or adding one new food you usually avoid during restriction even if it‚Äôs the smallest little bit, or even get a therapist or nutritionist. I did the latter and it was pretty helpful at least in getting out of rock bottom and to a less shitty place.

My behavior has gotten better and I don‚Äôt b/p as much, but I have never felt worse about my body. I will relapse hard one of these days, it‚Äôs a matter of when.  I hope you can find recovery. I hope you can learn to love yourself and your body, learn to appreciate and enjoy food instead of using it as an escape, find love and really believe it when they say you are beautiful and maybe even see yourself the way that the ones that love you see you.  It‚Äôs hard, it really is.  It‚Äôs okay to give up for a day;  lie in bed crying it out. Cry until you can‚Äôt anymore and then get back up and try again.  It‚Äôs not okay to give up for good. Try your best to get back up like it‚Äôs a fresh start. A week, a month, a year, just eventually. I can‚Äôt wait for the day I can get up and look at myself in the mirror and love that person. I think it‚Äôs worth more than the suffering it will take to get there.   I guess this isn‚Äôt just for you, but for everyone and myself. I can‚Äôt tell you what to do, but just know many of us are working towards the same goal.  You are you, but your ED isn‚Äôt special, and that‚Äôs a good thing. Because even though you are different, you share the internal conflict that so many of us go through every day and so many people have gotten better. I think you can and I wish you luck!

I'm so tired of worrying about how much I ate or how bloated I am before a date, during the date and then when they want to be intimate.
