I‚Äôve been making a glass of oolong tea and adding about 4oz of regular almond milk to it (30 cal). It reminds me of milk tea with the subtle sweetness of the almond milk, similar color too, adding a low cal sweetener is also an option. It‚Äôs super easy/quick and has some caffeine from the oolong (more than green tea). :)",False,False
