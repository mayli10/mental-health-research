The only thing I notice is usually they at least tend to function a bit better because they don't restrict, so when the bmi isn't too low (16-18) they're usually pretty healthy individuals.",False,False

Always getting sick, sometimes having very low energy. Low strength, limited muscular development despite regular exercise. And worst of all every time I see them get sick, it takes so much out of them because they don't have any reserves to draw from so everything just atrophies and it takes them forever to recover because again they barely eat anything.  One thing I came to accept during my recovery: having some body fat is freaking healthy, for both your body and mind, on so many levels, and in reality outside our ED world, most men and women prefer the opposite sex with higher body fat anyway. It's the fitness industry for men and the beauty/fashion industry for women that has diverted our focus towards low body fat which just isn't healthy for most people to try to maintain, and ironically, also makes them less attractive in most cases on average.",False,False
