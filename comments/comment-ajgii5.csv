For real though, I'm really sorry you had to go through that. For some light at the end of the tunnel, at least in my experience it did get better. I rarely have these interactions with my family anymore. Granted, I don't live in the same city as them, but when I go back for holidays it is always better than it was in high school.   &amp;#x200B;  My mom was typically the instigator for comments like that, dad and brother would just hop on the joke train. I had a few straightforward conversations with her and let her know how those comments would make me feel. She would shrug it off in the moment and minimize my feelings, but eventually the jokes stopped. I think maybe they just use deflection and bad humor as a way to salvage their ego when they know they've overstepped a boundary. Talk to them frankly and wait it out, I hope it gets better for you!",False,False

Lots of people have this problem where they just WILL NOT accept that they've done anything even mildly negative and will push it back as much as possible, it's childish.  &amp;#x200B;  If you think your mom would be responsive to it you can try to explain how it made you feel cuz it's always good to communicate if possible.",False,False
