These are not (not!!!) ways to restrict further. Apologies for the long read, and apologies for anything you might already know.   If you‚Äôre restricting, make sure to take a daily multivitamin for women (gender identity aside, take the right nutrients for your body) and an iron supplement. Most multivitamins only contain enough iron to make up for deficiencies in a normal diet. If you‚Äôre purging already, please please do your best to stop, and if you‚Äôre considering it - don‚Äôt. It will ruin your teeth, your gastrointestinal tract and digestive system, fuck up your metabolism long-term, and becomes less and less effective over time - not to mention it can potentially be fatal (so can restriction, but less immediately). Make sure that you‚Äôre getting enough calcium and magnesium as well, because osteoporosis (basically, low bone density) is really not a good thing for you and can mess up your skeleton.   Fasting, especially for long times, is dangerous. Don‚Äôt start fasting, and if you already are, please try to reduce it. Restriction under 1,000 calories a day, especially for someone still growing, isn‚Äôt safe either.   Don‚Äôt overdo it on caffeine, as restriction already messes with your heart function. Don‚Äôt try those ‚Äúskinny teas‚Äù; they‚Äôre just caffeinated laxative teas and the majority of the weight you might lose will just be water. Don‚Äôt buy sketchy weight loss pills online, especially if the ingredients are in a language you can‚Äôt read or of something you don‚Äôt understand (chemical names). On the subject of water, don‚Äôt restrict your water intake (you really *really* need water to live) and likewise, don‚Äôt drink too much water either to try and ‚Äòflush your system‚Äô.   Be kind to yourself. Our bodies do weird shit like growing out first and then up, in spurts - so your BMI / weight will likely fluctuate just due to the fact that you‚Äôre still growing some. Also, female bodied people are *supposed* to have a bit of extra padding in their teen years as their bodies develop into sexual maturity; you aren‚Äôt going to look the way you do now as you will as an adult, so be patient with your body and give it time.   Photoshop, flexing, lighting, filters and posing can greatly alter the way people look in photos without having the edits be obvious. It‚Äôs no longer only true that ‚Äúthe girl in the magazine doesn‚Äôt even look like the girl in the magazine‚Äù; the girl on instagram or tumblr doesn‚Äôt look like that in real life either, at least 99% of the time.   If anyone messages you asking to be your ‚Äúana coach‚Äù they are not your friend and they are not helping you. Your friends should validate your struggles but encourage you to be healthy. If some creepy person tries to tell you that you‚Äôre somehow older than you‚Äôre age, block them. Even if you are ‚Äúmature for your age‚Äù, that only means that you‚Äôre mature for a 13 year old, *not* that you are capable of being in a relationship with an adult. There is a good reason why these people can‚Äôt get dates their own age, or worse, they don‚Äôt want to - so stay away.   Finally, your worth is more than your weight. You are more than a number on the scale, a number on a BMI calculator, or a percentage of body fat. What people remember about you is not how you look but how you smile, how you phrase the funny comments you make, and the kindness you spread in the world. You‚Äôre still young, too, so give yourself a chance to grow before you decide that you dislike who you are. If there are parts of you that you don‚Äôt like, trim the tips of the branches; don‚Äôt cut down the whole tree. Your purpose is not to look beautiful (although it‚Äôs perfectly okay to enjoy beauty!), to take up as little space as possible, or to trim yourself down to fit a mold that isn‚Äôt real in the first place. The best thing that you can do for yourself is to be healthy, and that includes being kind to yourself. If permission to do so is helpful, here it is: you are allowed to love yourself as you are, even if there are things about yourself that you want to change. You are allowed to be kind to yourself, even when you struggle, and especially when you fail. Having flaws is a part of being human, and no one is complete without having had them. You deserve to be loved and to receive kindness and respect from others. Take care of yourself as best as you can, because ultimately you are the only person who can prioritize *you*. You deserve to live and to enjoy life.   If there is ever anything that you need, even just an ear, you are welcome to reach out to me. If you are ever considering hurting yourself, now or in the future, please count me as at least one person who would be devastated to have you go. You are worthy of enjoying your life, and you deserve the life you were given.",False,False
