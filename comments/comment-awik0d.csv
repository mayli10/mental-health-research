If you talk to him and make sure he understands that YES it is a big deal if he eats your safe food, then even if he doesn't understand why it's a big deal, he should be able to keep his hands to himself. And if he still won't then you have a different problem.",False,False

Like, completely switch to fat-free stuff and if he dislikes it, he can buy a regular one himself... Do you still get mad at each other for eating the not safe foods?   And I really don't understand the whole ""don't eat out of the pan, ew"" or ""don't use my fork, ew"" thing.. like.. if you guys are married you kiss each other and most likely do some other way grosser things than that lol... what's the big deal? :/    ",False,False

I‚Äôm fortunate in that my partner is super considerate about it, since he knows my issues, but I feel bad about it sometimes. Like he doesn‚Äôt eat too many fruits or veggies, partly because he‚Äôs kinda junk food-prone, but partly because those are ‚Äúmine‚Äù, so I have to make sure we have certain options that are ‚Äúhis‚Äù lol. I have the apples, he has oranges. I have lettuce, he has tomatoes.   He says he doesn‚Äôt like apples and will occasionally take a lettuce leaf but like ?¬ø is it because i have issues and he‚Äôs trying to be nice or is that actually what he wants?? I‚Äôm always telling him he can have the fruits and veg and edamame and whatever else, but I‚Äôm scared he doesn‚Äôt take everything he wants just to make sure I‚Äôll eat as much as possible...

I can‚Äôt tell the difference between the fat free and full fat other than fat free doesn‚Äôt leave an oily residue in your mouth. You can eat the WHOLE can and be at 200 cal. *And* if you make little kiss shapes and freeze them on a plate you have frozen fluffy meringue things that are bomb.

He asks before touching anything at my place if I don't tell him I bought this for you. And he buys and keeps at his place safe foods for me. It is consideration and respect, to care to make your loved one comfortable.  I would suggest that when you are calm talk to your husband and tell him how you feel and how you too can solve the issue. i.e. buy whip for you and extra for him, and to not run of of it.

For my husband he wont eat things if he has to search to find them, so shoving stuff in the back of the cupboard or fridge/freezer works well for me too.   The other thing I've gotten better at is just using my words ""Hey babe, I bought these sun chips because I want them for some lunches, please don't eat all of them. I bought you these sun chips and pretzels because I know you like them.""  And then I catch him into my sun chips and have to remind him PLEASE DONT EAT ALL OF MY SUN CHIPS. Sorry. Panic.
