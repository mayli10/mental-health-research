When I first did it was just a last resort because I ''overeat'', so I would just restrict because I was scared I won't be able to puke. In those 2 weeks, I would purge a few times and the only reason why I didn't do it more is that I just didn't eat that much or binge. Today I purged 3 times because in my head I was like: Well, I can eat and then just get rid of the food.  It is this circle of restricting/starve - binge - feel bad - purge and then repeat. So, my advice is to get help before it becomes addictive.",False,False

Fast forward 5 years, I am suffering from full blown bulimia, it all spiraled out of control, everything got worse, I can't stop and my chest is hurting right now. So please please please get help, it doesn't matter the weight, I wish I could have stopped before the addiction set in so bad. ED's are ED's nonetheless and a good psychiatrist/therapist will take you seriously. Please.",False,False
