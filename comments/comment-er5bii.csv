I know at the stage you are at that hearing or reading online about recovery and that you can recover sounds cliched and can seem unachievable but it's not. I'm not going to lie recovery is hard. You will be triggered at the smallest everyday things, you have bad days and ups and downs. I didn't address the full extent of my eating disorder had on my life until years later. I'm still seeing therapists about long term affects from compulsive control issues I've since shifted into other aspects of my life.  I would recommend seeking help if possible from firstly medical if it has taken a toll on health, nutrition, weight you hair/teeth/gums. Also I would consider potentially therapy or trying to deal with the root of it- it's generally from trying to control some aspect of life that is outside your control and compensating for that. If you do start to recover be weary you aren't switching that compulsion into other areas like relationships  grades, achievements or anything that can become unhealthy.   In the crux of my ED I didn't care if I died and looking back 7 years later I'm proud of how far I have came. I don't know your exact situation but I can relate some things.   You are not stupid, you are not worthless. You are smart, you have a network of people who care. You are worth so much. You have programmed your own mind to be so harsh on yourself and discipline and punish yourself so critically. It's so hard to escape those thoughts but I swear no one else thinks this of you. You are your own worst enemy.   Everyone has binge days, you don't have to purge when you have a bad day, try to find a way to do a healthy amount of exercise or do something to take your mind off it. Try to eat in front of people or I used to play this silly game where I would sit  down with people for lunch and try to mimic how they eat (without them noticing) it helped me to not be paranoid about my eating in front of people and normalize it. You can also assign a ""safe eating space"" e.g the family kitchen table so you don't feel as inclined to binge in secret.  I don't keep a scale in my house so I can't obsess over my weight or try not to weigh myself more than once or twice a month.   If you ever need to talk or need some help/advise just reach out to me.   Apologies if this post doesn't help. Just trying to share some things that worked for me.",False,False
