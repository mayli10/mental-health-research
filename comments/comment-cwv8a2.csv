I’m looking forward to hearing what ppl think.  I was quickly scared out of c/s-ing. Not only did I put on around 8lb in the first week (likely water retention), but it felt so instantly addictive.  At first I found the used bags *repulsive*, but before I even knew it, I would be squishing them around in my hands. What? Who am I? Eating huge amounts of food and not having to haul around a distended belly, it really felt like I was on the edge of the rabbit hole.",False,False

I will literally go through 2 packs in like 15 minutes but I think it ends up triggering me into wanting actual food. I pretty much have an easier time fasting when I don't put anything in my body unless it's coffee or water. My skins definitely taking a hit from all the disordered eating, however. I constantly have bulimia face/swollen glands which does not help my self image. thanks for the response, btw!",False,True

I think it’s more of a disordered habit. This is kind of gross but chewing 5-6 (sometimes more) pieces of gum at once helped me break the habit. I figured out my fucked up brain just likes the action of chewing and my mouth just needs to be occupied.,False,False
