I was so very, very wrong.  I've ended up developing an exercise addiction, meeting my step goal 2 or 3 times over, sometimes even 4, being obsessed with my heart rate and have fallen back into calorie counting.  Please be careful with it. If you do notice yourself becoming obsessive, try and take a step back before it becomes all consuming. EDs aren't fun anyway, but boy this takes it to a whole other level of nightmare.",False,False

One thing it DID do was make me more aware that I was burning way more calories a day than I was estimating all along, which in turn made me realise why low restricting was making me bingey and feel absolutely dead, so it really... Helped make higher restricting less scary? And helped with guilt when eating more than I'd planned?  But also it's been HIGHLY addictive, I'll drag myself out of bed at 11 o'clock at night in a not safe area if I don't hit my step goal for the day for example...  Two sides of an argument, I guess? I panic now if I leave the house and accidentally leave it on charge, even if it makes me late I have to go back and get it, which I know is maybe a sign it's unhealthy... But there's two perspectives!",False,False
