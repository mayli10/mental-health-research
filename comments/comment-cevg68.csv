Or at the very least I don't think any of my ED treatment had anything to do with my recovery. In fact, I didn't recover until I quit all eating disorder related treatment. I do think some of the treatment I've had for other issues (therapy, IOP, PHP, IP) was more useful in reducing ED symptoms though.   As a caveat though, I entered ED treatment when I was 17 and I was extremely resistant to recovery until I was about 21. I quit all ED treatment the year I turned 22 and managed to do the rest of my own. So part of it may have been an issue of motivation and commitment.",False,False

I don't think the ED IP I did (5 times, as both a teen and an adult) ever helped me, except in the cases when I was also dealing with severe SH and being in the hospital kept me physically safe. I briefly did an ED PHP, but they refused to give me meal support because I didn't have an anorexia diagnosis and they instead offered to let me eat my lunches in the lobby. I declined. I do think therapy (general, not with an ED therapist) has been helpful. I've been in therapy for a variety of things for 11 years and had some mediocre therapists but also some good ones. I've been seeing my current therapist for over 7 years and having someone who knows my history that well has been immensely useful. She's not an ED therapist but since my ED doesn't exist in a vacuum and is definitely connected to other things, she's still helpful when I am struggling with food things. I've also had good experiences working with dietitians. So basically, long term outpatient care that is a mix of ED-specific treatment (nutrition) and general therapy has worked best for me.",False,False
