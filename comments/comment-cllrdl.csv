They are different. For instance, like you say, women are valued more highly for their appearance than men. Men are valued more highly for their productivity, wealth and power. Different issues, and I don't understand how you can quantify the suffering the ideals imposed on the different sexes, and then come out with the result that you suffer more.   We are all in the same fucked up ED-boat here. To me it seems that you do more harm than good when you promote this one-sided view that really serves no other purpose than to make you feel like you're not responsible for your situation. We are suffer. It SUCKS for all of us. Let's help each other out instead of pointlessly pit the sexes against one another in this way.",False,False

Just look at the responses to the picture of Jason Momoa when he was on vacation.   Men generally weigh more than women, and carry more muscle in relation to their height- both are factors which influence BMI. If you're using their BMI to rationalize this idea that women somehow always have it worse than men when it comes to body image, it might be worthwhile reconsidering your position on the topic.   I have had women with a higher BMI criticize my body, but I'm not going to drag that into this debate since it has no relevance to the conversation at hand.",False,False

The way women are sexualized and viewed in society is just different than how men are seen. In general, women are valued more highly for their appearance than men.   I have compassion. I know that while the pressure isn‚Äôt equal, it‚Äôs still there and still harmful. But just because there is a pressure on men does not mean that what I feel as a woman and my own personal experiences with men holding my body to a completely different standard than their own aren‚Äôt real, valid, and harmful.   In my post I stated that I know men face pressure to look a certain way. But just because that is true doesn‚Äôt mean I‚Äôm not allowed to talk about the hypocrisy and pressure I face.",False,True

At the same time though, it‚Äôs just not the same as what women face. My own experience with men has been that they judge me harshly for my body and my appearance, yet they just do not feel the same pressure or hold themselves to the same standards they hold women. The amount of men I‚Äôve heard criticize and critique a healthy woman‚Äôs body, including my own, is disgusting.   The thing about BMI being off at the high and low ends of weight definitely makes sense though. I thought 165 seemed pretty low for 6‚Äô4 and was surprised when the calculator I used said 20.1. 18.9 definitely makes more sense, but again definitely isn‚Äôt ‚Äúseverely underweight‚Äù.",False,True

Believe it or not, men actually face an enormous amount of social pressure to look/appear a certain way- it‚Äôs just not discussed publicly and especially not within female-dominated areas, such as this sub.  Body dysmorphia manifests itself in a broader way for men, and can easily be passed off as ‚Äúnormal‚Äù behaviors- ie, ‚Äúhe has a hearty appetite,‚Äù or ‚Äúhe‚Äôs just bulking.‚ÄùThings which would be immediately recognized as patterns of disordered eating among women (BED) are completely passed over for men.   Aside from eating patterns, there‚Äôs a massive rise in steroid use, SARMS, and other PED‚Äôs that men use in an attempt to fit an ideal physique as the result of their body dysmorphia.   I was socially ostracized, isolated, and left on my own when I developed an eating disorder. There‚Äôs just as much pressure on men, and even less of a support network available.

Maybe that helps you feel better since it‚Äôs closer to underweight and not just him feeling insecure about being smaller than the ideal?  I get your frustration though.

I feel like there's much more of an emphasis on, and a feeling of entitlement of critiquing feminine appearance that just isn't there as much for men. May have to do with (I'd say probably has to do with) the oversexualization of women in society. I could write much more about my feelings on that.  What's more, the expectations on women I feel are just more damaging in general. The pressure is to be delicate and thin for a lot of women, while the usual pressure on men is to eat healthy and become big and strong. Which lifestyle is going to leave you feeling more like shit? One where you're starving yourself or one where you're eating enough to pack on muscle? The answer is obvious.   Of course there are specific instances and individual experiences. There exists anorexic men as well as women with very healthy body image. I'm talking about averages and broad societal attitudes and pressures.",False,False

To play devil's advocate here are some things to consider.   1. Society does dictate body standards for men too, not just women. Arguably the pressures aren't as big but they're still there. Specifically men are often supposed to be ""big and strong"". This puts societal pressure on short and skinny guys, similarly to how non skinny girls feel societal pressure.    2. the BMI scale at the high and low ends of height isn't quite accurate. I'm not talking about fatlogic ""muscular people can have obese bmi"" stuff, that is usually bullshit. Instead, I mean that on the low end of heights, bmis are a bit too low, and on the high end of heights, bmis are a bit too high. This is because the mathematical formula for bmi was made simpler, to make it easier to compute historically, at the expense of accuracy in the height extremes. So a very tall person with an 19.0 BMI might be in the normal range of bmi, but actually they are at the same health level as someone with a 18.0 BMI. I inputted that guy's stats (6'4"", 165lbs) into this ""better BMI calculator"" https://tall.life/better-bmi-for-short-and-tall-people/ which takes into account the fact that bmi is higher than it should be for tall people. It reports a bmi of 18.9, compared to the ""normal bmi calculator's"" 20.1. I know 18.9 is not ""severely underweight"" as ED people think of it, or even according to the bmi scale, but maybe this puts things into perspective a bit.",False,False
