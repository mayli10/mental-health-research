I think she's always been fairly aware of size and shape as well - I've had mental health /ED issues over the last 18 years and she prefers it when I'm weight restored back to my set point. We then weigh about the same, but because of the above boob/height situation I look curvier and she looks like ""thinny twinny"" 🙄  So while she doesn't have an ED, she feeds off mine in that me being healthy makes her feel better - does that make any sense?

People always call one “the one who’s good at drawing”, “the one who’s good at math”, “the funny one”, “the nice one”, etc. The “prettier” one, the thinner one, the more popular one. You’re directly compared to someone else every day. Makes sense a lot of twins would want to be the thinner one. ",False,False

I’m a dancer and she’s pretty sedentary, so that already contributes to our differing sizes (not that there’s anything wrong with that) and she’s on ADHD medication that makes it easier to retain weight. Sometimes she takes my clothes to borrow them and I feel so awful about it bc they either don’t fit or are returned to me super stretched out. It’s not like either of us aren’t at “healthy” weights but I wish I could help her see that her body is beautiful even when I hate my own. It’s hard when you love someone so close to you but can’t seem to make them see what they’re worth :(",False,False

I think it's definitely related to the ED although not necessarily the cause of it. I feel a lot of pressure to not be, I don't know, the loser twin? because people generally consider her to be the 'smart one' (even though we're doing equally well in uni and equally hard degrees lmao), so I feel like I have to make up for it by being the 'pretty one'. Which is a shitty mindset to have and certainly fucked up my self esteem.",False,False
