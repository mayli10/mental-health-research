I used to live off ginger biscuits and warm tea for awhile because they were the only thing that didn't make me nauseous.  Maybe talk to your doctor about it though if you're really worried about it. Mine took about a month to go away. It takes about 4 weeks for your body to adapt to new ssris,False,False

I was prescribed Mirtazapine first and it really kicked off my binge/purge cycle.  I am now on Sertraline instead and it's so much better.   I know someone who had the exact opposite at Mirtazapine works for her.   It's ok to say a medication doesn't suit you, there are almost always other options",False,False
