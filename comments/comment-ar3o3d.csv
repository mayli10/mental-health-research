I know my boyfriend worries about my eating habits and how I have to control everything I eat, and I know it puts a strain on my relationship with him (which scares me because I love him so) but I can't help but see numbers in every little food item.

I'm actually typing this on my way to the gym at 7am. I hate that I hyper focus on the weight gain which is wrecking havoc on our relationship because it makes me depressed.

Since I am in college I do have to spend a lot of time studying and all, so my boyfriend and I got a lot of fast food.  Now I am losing it all as fast as possible.  I hate that I let myself gain so much weight but I also hate that I am obsessed with losing it.  It is constantly on my mind.  At first I didn't mind the couple pounds I gained, but it just got worse, and one day I looked in the mirror and felt *awful*.

It's a combination of being nervous and not wanting to be bloated on dates, and then just being too happy to eat. Having other things fill my mind and engage me other than thoughts of food.   It's pathetic, but honestly eating is usually the highlight of my day, dinner particularly. It's like I don't get a lot of joy elsewhere. I notice sometimes that when I have an unusually good/busy/productive day, I tend not to eat or snack as much. Relationships and social interaction definitely keep my mind off food.  The really weird, slightly messed up thing about this is that I associate romantic happiness with a feeling of hunger. Because most of the dates I've been on, my stomach's been growling furiously by the end of the evening. I can't eat when I'm very stressed or anxious, or when I'm in love, apparently.",False,False

I felt horrible and wanted to ‚Äúself-recover‚Äù so I gained like 20lbs over the course of 5 months. I maintained that weight for a while. Then we moved in with each other .

At first I was super insecure and I restricted to deal with it, lost a lot of weight, and then as I got more comfortable I started eating a lot and gained weight. I think this was both because of my emotions and simply because when we hung out I had to eat like a normal person.   Also that position of vulnerability in a relationship makes it very easy for even small things to have a disproportionate impact on my self esteem, which really fuelled my ED later on. Like when I told my SO I had an ED, he took it very well and didn't say anything insensitive or anything, but I still felt the need to lose a ton of weight to 'prove' to him I really had an ED.
