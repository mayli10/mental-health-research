Usually only one thing luckily but still... I wish I was like those people that were motivated to restrict harder after noticing significant progress.,False,False

He doesn't have a history of an eating disorder but his dad was bulimic.  Anyway, he won't ""allow"" me to eat certain foods like ice cream, cakes, cookies, etc.  He knows it triggers my binges and then unfortunately it ruins my mood and the rest of the day so he helps me with that.  Like we'll be at a restaurant and I will say I want a dessert that is well over 1000 calories but he'll snap me back into reality by saying ""no, you're not getting that"" or whatever.  On the surface it sounds controlling but he knows me and how food fucks with my mind.  Sometimes though it still doesn't work and I will get the food in secret and binge on it while he is away.  I hate that about me, lol.    Secretly I do think he doesn't want me to get fat, either.  I am at a normal bmi but he does have disgust for obesity.  His standards for how I should look motivate me, though.  I have had boyfriends who wanted me to eat and eat so I get ""thicc"" and it just damaged my self-esteem and triggered depression.",False,False

I always feel like I need permission before I can eat or someone like my hubby to really talk me into it. So weird!! Like, Iâ€™m so aware of it even in the moment that Iâ€™m hoping for permission and I already feel like I CAN, but I just wonâ€™t let myself unless I get it ðŸ™ƒ",False,False

So I just keep vacillating between restricting and binging.   I wish I were easier to just...eat. Normal amounts. I donâ€™t know how non disordered people do it??? In my post recovery/pre relapse period, I binged. Now that Iâ€™ve properly swandived back into all of my self destructive behaviours, I can only restrict or else I eat fucking everything. Itâ€™s terrible.  Sorry for the rant I just have nowhere else to place these feelings ha",False,False

So heâ€™s helping me decrease that habit because it makes me feel horrible, which I think is similar to how your boyfriend helps you with the bingeing? Iâ€™m just trying to say that I understand, I guess. ",False,False

Once I got my mind set on changing that, I was able to reverse a lot of the weight.  &amp;#x200B;  I've found myself at a plateau where the only way I get below it is by restricting completely (fasting.)

If my boyfriend doesn't tell me I'm not allowed to have over a certain amount of junk food, I'll eat some, then too much, then get triggered and binge.  No, he's not abusive nor says my food choices are unhealthy or anything, in fact, I think he wants me to eat more (he said like a month back that not getting to go get sushi with me or whatever was hard on him)..he just knows this is what I need so that I don't enter a binge cycle, and he knows that bingeing is a lot worse on me than not being allowed to try a bite of my sister's homemade steamed buns or whatever it is.   He's a recovered bulimic. He's not trying to limit my food; he's trying to help me recover from BED. He knows I can handle about three bites of junk food a day before I get triggered and binge, so that's what he usually says I'm allowed to eat. I'm certain if my tolerance was higher, he'd allow me up to that too.",False,False

I've always hated eating alone so it's sort of like permission in the sense that I feel I can't eat unless others are eating with me. Or else? I end up binging.,False,False
