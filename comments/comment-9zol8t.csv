But it's not that ridiculous - butter has no carbs, a small amount is really filling when you're eating it like that, and it's really not as high cal as you think. A whole tablespoon is 100 calories, but that's a LOT of butter when you're eating it by itself.  A weirder one is boxed mac and cheese. It's like a ""safe binge food."" If I know I have to eat, or that I'm going to eat either way, mac and cheese doesn't upset me as much. I love mac and cheese, I don't have to guess calories, and even the whole box is only ~1300 calories, which is pretty minor as far as binges go. ",False,False
