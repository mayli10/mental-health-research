But OMG YES THE HAIR ðŸ˜­ my hair has suffered so much bc of my eating disorders, idk whatâ€™s been worse for it, my restrictive periods or my bulimia.

However, I 100% disagree that you are  a worthless failure. You deserve happiness and EDs are such a mindfuck, this isnâ€™t your fault. You are just as valid a person as anyone else, and you matter.

Never had a dental problem no dentist has ever said anything. All my vitals are fine never had any medical problem at all. I would seriously be relieved to have anything, for my hair to fall out, my teeth to fall out, I stopped caring for my teeth I stopped doing anything to protect my health. I want something to go wrong I don't care how bad how gross or trivial I want something to show me this is real and I am not making it up to show that I've been doing something just some tangible evidence that this has been a thing that has existed. I feel like a fat worthless failure because i have 0 self control and if I didnt purge I would probably have no problem at all whatsoever. Lol I just want to see validation even if I lose my teeth I don't care what it is anymore ",False,False

I have had bulimia off and on since I was 18, but in total this is probably about a year? idk, it's hard to tell  Anyway, since I started purging, I have a single spot of decay in my mouth that hasn't grown into a full cavity yet (dentists are keeping their eyes on it because it stopped growing, but it's not going away either), but aside from that, I've surprisingly had no issues.  My boyfriend had full-blown bulimia from ages like 17-19, but I think the main permanent damage it did was that it worse away his enamel. He says his teeth are more see-through now and that they are a lot more sensitive to temperature (i.e. He doesn't like drinking ice water because of them, or he'll cringe when I chew ice).  I honestly think the people who have major teeth issues have been doing it for a long, long time. Anyway, make sure not to brush your teeth right after, rinse your mouth out with water, and to put something like baking soda or tums in your mouth to help with the acid!",False,False

The only thing worse than hearing you have a problem with your teeth is hearing that you *had* a problem with your teeth years ago that could have been fixed, but has progressed in severity because you avoided getting it looked at.    I just had to have four fillings redone, one that I let go for a year because I hate the dentist. My dentist told me that if I let it go any longer I would have definitely needed a root canal.
