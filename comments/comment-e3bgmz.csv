The thing is that I only just relapsed and I’m actually fucking huge. Like, I’m seriously overweight. So it’s more obvious when I lose weight. And people ask meaning it as a compliment. And I just wasn’t expecting it so soon. All that makes me want to do is just wear a shit ton of goodies at all times so no one can really see.",False,True

Every single one of my female relatives commented on how much weight I’ve lost. It has been stressing me out to no end. I thought it would be nice too, but honestly all I want to do is crawl into a hole because this ed is mine, and I don’t want anyone to ever come close to taking it away?? Or commenting about a part of it when I’m not wanting to think about it?? I just was not prepared. I felt so self conscious, like I don’t want to think about my old aunt having an opinion about how my body looks. I’m worried I won’t be able to keep this to myself and use it as a coping mechanism forever like I have for the past like 17 years, and I really would prefer to keep doing.   Sorry to hijack your post, I just so agree, and it’s been the biggest thing on my mind lately. Sigh. I wish I could help.",False,False

I wanted to say “okay well I classify half a can of tuna and half of a celery stick as a feast because I hate myself. But I’m glad my starvation is inspiring.”",False,True

Recently I’ve had friends comment on me being thin (both positive and negative) and it’s very awkward and makes me want to yell “Thanks! It’s the starvation and self loathing!!””,False,False
