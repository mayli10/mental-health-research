A lot of what you see is water retention, so drinking lots of water to flush out the excess will help, along with staying away from high sodium foods.  If you reaaaallllly need a quick fix, Advil/NSAIDs will reduce swelling. Not healthy to do long term but I do this for special occasions.  I purge almost daily so I very rarely get to see my face un-swollen :(",False,False

It helps with the bloating and stomach discomfort. Also replenishing electrolytes helps, so try to do that if you can. Take care ❤️",False,False
