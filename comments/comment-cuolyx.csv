I never used to but since I live with him I quickly understood how severe it is. and monitor my chewing and stuff.  and now I'm developing it about things. Like mouth sounds. He'll scream and throw things and cry and I'll just politely snap at people to not talk with their fucking mouth full or w/e.,False,False

As a young teen I'd throw pens and shit around my room because I couldn't stand the sound of muffled speaking (people talking outside the room), and there are several more triggers. Misophonia is becoming more and more recognized, thankfully. I don't get treatment for it, but when I'm stressed after a trigger, I put on rain sounds (some sound terrible to me too, it's matter of trial and error). I close my eyes and only listen. For me it's harder to recall how awful the trigger was as long as I'm enveloped in another soundscape, and afterwards I feel a little bit better. Hopefully you'll be able to see a therapist who can help you with this ❤️",False,False
