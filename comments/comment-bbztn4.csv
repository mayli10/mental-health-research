Now it's like I can't remember a meal that wasn't hurriedly scarfed down with as few people looking as humanly possible.

Alcohol - good old times when I was able to treat depression with alcohol, now I avoid it like plague, because calories or fast three days in advance and pray to all possible gods in the galaxy that I get shitfaced from one shot (or get shot so my misery ends finally)  On the other hand, one thing ED gave me, together with other of my lovely mental illnesses, is being a functioning human adult. I am kind, responsible, successful, popular, funny, I can make decisions, I think my face is relatively pretty and my body normal/thin, only problem with that is that I'm dissociating 100% of the time, so I'm living in body and observing life of someone I'll never be :') I'm also not able to vent to any of my friends (not even online ones) anymore, because everyone thinks that I'm getting better and doing great and I don't want to dissapoint them and feel shit for me  The best part is I lost no weight whatsoever (although I started to exercise, so I look better, but 6 pack is not my dream aesthetic unfortunately) and at this point I am so disordered I hope I will die sooner than I will be made to recover.",False,False

I tried to start that up again recently, but every time I do, I just obsess over it because it's as though I can't taste my own food, so I can't figure out how to improve the dish..so I have to eat more and more to at least try to get a taste in me, and then I just end up bingeing because of guilt over eating more than a couple bites while trying to taste.

Otherwise, I guess in a way my dignity? I've purged in public bathrooms and binged in public places too many times to count, started (although I've since quit) smoking, started doing EC stacks, abusing lax, etc, all of which when I was younger would've seemed insane to me.

Now, when I go out to eat or it's a holiday or celebration, I'm constantly feeling awful about the food and calories. It's not fun or enjoyable at all anymore. I'm always worried that I'll binge on way too much food and make myself out to be the pig I am, I'll eat what most people would think of as very little, and get called out for it, or someone will hear me purging.

Non-food wise, I've given up most of my already almost nonexistent social life. I used to enjoy eating with friends but I cant bring myself to do that rn. We dont see each other at all because of different majors.   Another thing I'd say I've given up is a lot of my future?   This is somewhat indirect but my ED kind of led to me developing depression and I've dropped so many classes because I just couldnt get out of bed or was too focused on food.
