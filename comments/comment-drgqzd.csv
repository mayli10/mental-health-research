I think it's important to constantly remind the user that doing just a little is already a big step in the world of their struggles, praising them for trying their best I think, even just for the smallest thing is a great thing. Do not ever guilt trip anyone even if seemingly it's a word of advice or comes from a concern, saying 'you need to eat or you will die/ do you want to worry your friends, family?/ or simmilar things are not acceptable, it's not like we won't know that stuff already. For me personally I think also saying that taking your time and doing things step by step is great, because it's are progress and progress is good no matter what. Make sure to make them fell valid, for example maybe something like ""remember are easy day or a day you fell more normal than on most days does not make you invalid or makes you fake your troubles"", ""everyone's problem is a problem non than less, something may not be a concern for one and for other it may be a daily fear. Remember that fighting against it is a success and I'm proud of you, but also remember loosing sometimes doesn't mean you won't be able to get up again, because you're absolutely capable of that"". Personally it's something I struggle a lot, thinking my ED is fake because of the daily I eat a lot or a normal amount and I feel very invalid on the daily. Also something that concerns me a lot is also that, some may think every person struggling with an ED looks and behaves the same, it's important to know that this disorder comes from mind and regards your thoughts, the body is not the major indicator someone suffers or is more valid. Try to point out that every kind of of a struggle with food is a concern of the same value, all of them harm your well-being and health.",False,False
