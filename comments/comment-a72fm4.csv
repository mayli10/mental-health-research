I absolutely hate when people buy me clothes too, I always panic. And it sucks because it’s always from people I can’t really open up to, like distant relatives.   I actually have a small stack of new clothes I got as presents that I never tried on out of fear. I’m planning to donate it all soon because I really can’t bring myself to do it. Thankfully I don’t need them, so at least they can go to those who do...",False,True

I finally put my fitt down with my mother (who knows about my ed) and told her that I appreciated the thoughtfulness if buying me clothes, it really hurts my soul. She understood but I was in my mid 30's before I screwed up the courage to say this. ",False,False

As for my grandmother... I don’t get her. Yesterday she was on my case because she noticed I wasn’t eating but then today she pulls this crap. This only makes me doubt my body image even more, I literally have no idea what I actually look like ",False,True

I bet he cares about you a lot and is excited for you to meet his family. You might just be projecting how you personally feel about your body and your disappointment about it onto your bf's family, and they'll end up loving you and thinking you're perfect for their son/brother/ect.  Also, your grandmother sounds like a hag, and you should try not to let her shitty comments affect you.",False,False

I really wanted to show up there as the best version of myself, so I’m extremely frustrated right now... and I can’t really tell if what I see in the mirror is real or not, and if it’s not, maybe I look even worse....",False,True

Experiencing fear about the potential of ""disappointing"" your boyfriends family/your family over your size/appearance must be stressful and I'm sorry you fear feeling embarrassed. You deserve to interact with people who lift you up and leave you feeling respected and cared for. I hope the best for you. ",False,False
