I'm constantly torn between looking like an Amazonian goddess and a slim, elegant, tiny thing. I genuinely enjoy lifting weights too, but I wonder what the point is if I'm heavily restricting. Can I even gain muscle with such a huge caloric deficit? who knows fam lmao more cardio for me",False,False

I don't want to spend half my year force feeding myself and half my year starving to death. Life is so much more pleasant when you just listen to your body and follow your hunger cues. And sure, I might not be able to put on muscle as fast as a bodybuilder doing it ""properly"", but here's the thing... I'm not a damn bodybuilder. I'm a regular ass person. Fitness is just part of my lifestyle. I'm not saying you shouldn't have goals, I'm just saying there's no need to go to extremes to achieve every single goal you have in your life.  &amp;#x200B;  Right now fitness and food occupy a big space in my life. My long-term goal is to diminish the amount of space those take up so I have room for my other hobbies and more meaningful things in my life. I can't justify bulking and cutting. I want to keep looking forward to going to the gym, by not punishing myself by exercising excessively. I want to keep looking forward to eating my next meal and not worrying about what it will be, not either dreading having to force-feed myself because I need to meet some BS arbitrary pre-determined amount of protein per day, or on the other side of the coin, dreading the two hours I'll be starving because I'm only ""allowed"" to eat x amount per day.  &amp;#x200B;  When I first started recovery from AN, sure, I put on fat. That's part of the process. The extreme hunger was freaking horrible. But at a certain point my body had had enough, and the body fat ended up going back down to a stable and healthy amount on its own like everyone else that's ever recovered from AN and experienced body fat overshoot. Even if it hadn't, who cares? Gaining fat does not mean getting fat. Even when I carried a lot of body fat towards the end of my body fat overshoot, I was far from medically unhealthy, and still very muscular, because your lifestyle is really what determines your body composition and I exercise regularly and eat a pretty nutritionally complete diet. Check out ETE's podcast on this subject on his second channel (I added the start time of the more interesting stuff to the end of the link):  &amp;#x200B;  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzGi2KRuZhE&amp;t=8m45s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzGi2KRuZhE&amp;t=8m45s)  &amp;#x200B;  As long as you're mindful of what you eat most of the time, listen to your body, and have some semblance of a normal relationship with food where you make healthy choices, and stay somewhat active, you're not going to get fat. You will gain fat. That is an essential part of how body composition works. Even if you're only 8% body fat and you gain 20 pounds, 8% of that is going to be fat. But you'll also look like you're built like an absolute unit instead of a twig by adding those 20 pounds, because most of it is going to be muscle. Furthermore, you pretty much won't be able to add muscle without adding fat, because you will not be hormonally healthy and therefore able to put on muscle unless you are within your body's body fat setpoint range.  &amp;#x200B;  I like to use Mike Thurston as an example of how body fat is really not the be-all end-all to health or looks. For sure he has a higher body fat percentage than I did at my lowest weight, but he looks pretty shredded.  &amp;#x200B;",False,False

This world is more fucked than I thought. :c I'm sorry you have to go through that.   I work out and I really love it. It helps my depression and anxiety. Lifting makes my arms look way better. I don't have a huge bicep or anything, but working out picks my bat flap up so it's not so flappy.
