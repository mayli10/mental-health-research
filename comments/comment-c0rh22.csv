I find some days easier than others and lately I've been struggling with binging constantly as well. I find what helps me the best honestly is eating a large and filling meal, and then distracting myself as much as possible right after. Like if I still sit at home I'll just keep eating, but if I go out for an hour or a few I find the urge often passes. I go do yoga, or walk my dog, something like that. I'm also seeing a dietitian to help me, not sure if that's available to you but if it is a possibility try it out! They help prpvide guidance and knowledge and put things in different perspwctives which i have found helps. Sorry if this isn't great advice, honestly I'm trying to figure things out myself as well. But if you ever want support I know I'm a complete stranger but we do have things in common so I'm always available to chat!",False,False
