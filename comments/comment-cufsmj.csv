I remember having to drink castor oil for punishment as well. Not an experience that many parents would get away with today, or one that had to be repeated often. At least your dad was somewhat considerate and held your nose to help avoid some of the taste, and only a spoonful!   I remember one day I had a ""smart mouth"" as my parents referred to it. I got in an argument and told them they were ""full of \*\*\*\*"" Usually, lying or disrespect would be met with soap in the mouth for a few mins and/or a spanking. This time I remember being marched to the bathroom and she pulled out the bottle. My mom sarcastically said she would make sure I didn't become full of it like them. She gave me 3 tablespoons of that disgusting and vile castor oil. She sent me straight to my room without even being able to rinse or brush my teeth (which had to be done whenever I got the soap). If there is one thing worse than having to swallow castor oil, it is having the residual oil left in your mouth. Till this day I remember my lips feeling like they were stuck together or if I had put chapstick on them because the grease/oil sensation when I swallowed it off the spoon.   I remember laying down on my bed and just feeling my gag reflexes for a bit. I also felt the aftertaste of it every time I burped that day. 2-3 hours later the cramps and movements commenced. It lasted all afternoon and I had some residual effects up till 13-15 hours after taking it. Absolute misery and abuse. If I ever have kids, I would never do such a thing to them.",False,False
