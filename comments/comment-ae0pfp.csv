I've not quite reached that point although I was very close to having to go to A&amp;E a few times because of it.   I've definitely had stomach problems before because of anxiety and stress (welcome to my world of issues haha), and in the past I have thrown up out of stress but it was never quite so intense or long term. I do often find that I can't even tell when I'm stressed though, and I only work it out afterwards when I've literally made myself ill and have a moment of ""oh, that's why my body hates me right now"". I think my general stress level is just so high on a daily basis that I genuinely can't identify when it spikes any more.   I've never heard of abdominal migraines. Did they say anything more about them?",False,False

I am assuming your doctors are not idiots and at least asked you what type of foods you have\were eating right before durring the vomitting episodes. Did they suggest gastritis or ulcers or any possible physical reasons? Do you have any pain/tenderness in your abdomen?    I ask all this because I went through frequent vomiting issues for a long while myself. I had my gallbladder out when I was 19, and I would throw up a lot after eating high fat meals. I also had pain in the upper right part of my abdomen.  Then at 26, after finally losing some weight through restricting similarly to what you describe; 500-1000 calories, I also did intermittent fasting and tried to do more keto style diet.
