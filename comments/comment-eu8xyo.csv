I just bought some chocolate soy milk, 12 probiotic yogurt cups, maple syrup, and canned peaches and that was like $13. I think it was about $3.50 for the milk, $5 for the yogurt, $2 for the syrup, and $2.50 for the peaches. That's Canadian dollars of course. My plan is to make homemade oatmeal for breakfast and I already have everything else I need for that. Ideally I would use fresh apples for the oatmeal instead of canned peaches and to have an orange on the side, but this is cheaper. I do have to rely on taking a multivitamin for like 30% of my vitamins A, C, D, E, and K, but fortunately I figured out how to get all of my other vitamins and minerals without supplements and without spending too much or having to eat more than I would want. The soy milk is kind of high in calories, but it also has 7g of protein per cup and I think it's fortified so it's really healthy. Although I guess eating fortified foods wouldn't be any different from taking supplements. It's not ideal, but it works.",False,False

Sometimes I get frozen meals when they're on sale for like 1.50. My University also has a food pantry that gives out non perishables like canned fruit, rice, spaghetti and granola bars. Sometimes I spend like 60 if I buy some snacks",False,False

How do you do it? I try to spend about $10 per day myself. Not including the costs of supplements or beverages. Just on food itself. The only way I could think of to do that would be to replace 90% of what I eat with the 50 cent croissants the store next to my apartment sells.",False,False

Meals that are mostly whole foods should be easy. So I could definitely get all of the ingredients needed to make my hot chocolate recipe at any grocery store, but my carrot cake smoothie recipe requires almonds and nutmeg which might not be available absolutely everywhere. I typically focus on making meal plans that are easy because I struggle with finding the time and energy to cook.  Meal prep seems great in theory, but it's honestly much easier and cheaper to just have some homemade oatmeal for breakfast, a meal replacement shake, a protein bar, and something from the McDonald's value menu every day. ~~I actually made a meal plan like that which is perfect if you're interested.~~",False,False

Luckily my campus is really good with nutrition and had ALL their foods nutritional facts online. So I basically ate a shit ton of sushi, soups, and salds. I'd suggest seeing if your campus has its calories and stuff online so it saves time logging.  Now I have my own place off campus and I take out 40$ in cash to spend on groceries every two weeks so when I go to the store I can't buy things I don't need. Plus I bike everywhere so I don't have a lot of space to carry a ton of groceries.",False,False

As understand it, the thing that makes freshmen gain weight is alcohol. So, uh, practice moderation? You’ll probably also be walking a good bit, so at least there’s exercise. I’m worried about the same things.",False,False
