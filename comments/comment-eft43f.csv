Period “side effects”, if you will, but no actual blood loss.  So you are still having a cycle of hormone changes. Like fafofo says, missing a few is, in and of itself, not cause for alarm. But if it continues you may want to see a doctor - if just for your peace of mind.    If you want to talk pelvic exams and what to expect, I’m totally here.",False,False

I’m also anemic though, so my red blood cell count is low and I figured that could be a reason why I wasn’t actually getting it.  If you’re really worried though, please see a doctor. They’ll do a bunch of tests and hopefully you can get some answers! ❤️",False,False

When was yours? If you’ve only missed a month or so, I’d say don’t worry too much just yet. Sometimes periods are irregular and there was SO MANY things they can cause it",False,False
