I try to wait until my stomach growls and then I have breakfast, but the rest of the day (even if I have super high carb stuff) it doesn’t do anything and I’m just ‘mentally’ hungry if that makes sense. Even if I binge that feeling ( so-called “mental hunger”) doesn’t go away",False,True

The only time i'm able to recognize actual hunger is in the morning, since i'm usually never hungry when I first wake up.
