If I eat less and just deal with being shaky my stomach would be so much better! It’s hard to balance. Especially when I’m bloated and whatnot :(",False,False

I feel like I’m stuck in this plateau but it’s not because other than like 2 pounds I’ve barely lost anything.  Logically you are fine and 1500 is healthy!,False,False

People keep saying you can’t gain weight on 1200 so I tried it for 4 days and I fucking gained weight. So I went right back down to my restriction.
