They'll probably start with blood tests and check your blood pressure. It's probably also a good idea if you ask your doctor to check your heart rate. My guess is that you either have something wrong with your heart or low potassium. It's impossible to say without getting tested first however.",False,False

Idk why this is happening,False,True

Trying to regulate your blood sugar might help as well, so having a small bit of as close to pure sugar as you can get to spike it now and then a complex carb/low glycemic food to release slowly over time to keep you BS balanced.  Not sure your current route but there are harm reduction techniques for people not looking for recovery.",False,False
