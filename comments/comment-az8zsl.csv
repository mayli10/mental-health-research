I thought it was just because I was smaller that the bloating is more visible, but I suppose there can be a bit more to it.  Thank you for the comment ",False,True

I experience a lot of the same things. The stomach distention is the one that gets to me the most, it‚Äôs fascinating just how hard and bloated I can get. I feel pregnant.  Thank you for the comment. I would say ‚ÄúI‚Äôm glad it‚Äôs not just me‚Äù but I know this kinda sucks ",False,True

My weight has not gotten particularly low at all during this ED relapse, but I was obese when it started (did lose a lot of weight very quickly), and I sure can‚Äôt binge now like I could binge at my highest weight!!! Well, I mean, I can apparently :/, but its effects are definitely, legitimately more pronounced on a physical level, I think.  My stomach had shrunk and stuff when my bingeing first started back up. So I have literally made myself sick from bingeing over the past 6 months or so‚Äîracing heart, sweating, visible stomach distention, feeling like I‚Äôm actually going to burst, u kno, all that fun stuff. Ugh. During my worst binges, it gets to the point where I can‚Äôt be sure what would truly pose the bigger risk of something tearing: puking or not puking. Like it gets to the point where my purging comes partially from a place of genuinely worrying that my poor digestive tract just can‚Äôt handle All Of That.  It definitely felt way more intense when I was at a lower weight and was just coming off ~800 cals per day + regular fasting. And it‚Äôs still much more of a thing now than it was at my highest weight (when I was outrageously fat by anyone‚Äôs standards). So. Erm. Yeah. ‚òπÔ∏èüíõ ",False,False

Sometimes the sudden difference in calorie intake can really stress your body out, I get crazy heart palpitations and that 'can't catch your breath' feeling if I don't eat or eat very little for a while and then suddenly eat a big meal (not even necessarily binge levels).",False,False
