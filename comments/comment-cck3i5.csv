I understand the concern and appreciate the mods for looking out for us, but itâ€™s way too limiting... Literally everything we are talking about here is triggering. Itâ€™s more important to be supportive to each other and to be able to get everything we need to off our chest than to tip toe around triggering each other.

I havent eaten for a few hours but im alone at home so might as well chug some water and purge that since i have nothing to do. The reason why I have nothing to do? my ed fuckin makes everything that made me happy in life useless compared to the number on the scale and im tired. but im gonna suck it up and instead use this as a chance for me to do something enjoy  &amp;#x200B;  o h wow that vent kinda helped my mood bless up",False,False

I can imagine 99% of posts here requiring a blanket TW, which may only serve to dilute the significance of the warning and make it easier for people to disregard (possibly to their detriment in those cases where it applies to specific, non-ED-related issues).  Again, not saying TWs are a bad idea in general...just that they're not super useful when broadly applied. In that sense, I shrug my shoulders at this rule.

Violence, sexual assault, or terminal illness for example are super common triggers that make sense to warn about if youâ€™re going to bring them up.

If you're seeking out content that's specifically about EDs, it sort of seems like you should use your best judgment and understand you might run into numbers, calories, etc. Especially since this is ""ED Anonymous"" and not explicitly a recovery subreddit?   Not that people *shouldn't* apply TWs out of courtesy or consideration, but you know coming into the sub that EDs will be discussed. Isn't that already your trigger warning?",False,False
