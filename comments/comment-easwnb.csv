(And it’s not going to cause weight gain any more than any other macro - ie. not unless taking in extra energy that the body can store/build with)   Somehow the keto trend seems to have led to this rogue idea that ‘extra’ protein suddenly turns into chocolate cake or something. The body *can* create glucose from protein but from everything I’ve read it’s only done as-needed. (And many many sources suggest eating quite a bit more protein than the USDAs 50g guideline, so ‘extra’ would be a high bar.)   I feel that mental struggle though. I find myself saying my meanest stuff to myself after I eat - it’s a huge logic vs emotion showdown. Someone told me the other day “You’re allowed to eat food you like. It’s *good* to eat food you enjoy.” And I’m still tryin to process that.",False,False
