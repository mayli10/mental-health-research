I have bad vision so I wear glasses. I looked up into the mirror (without glasses) and saw and outline of what I truly was. Gaunt and sickly looking and just.. eww! Then I put my glasses on and I was back to looking chubby and tan and glowy. It was the weirdest thing... seriously freaked me out! ,False,False

I credit that with A. leaving my abusive family B. Getting basically adopted into my partner's family and finally getting to experience what acceptance feels like C. One year of ED therapy. Two years of DBT therapy and almost a year of Trauma therapy.   So yeaaaaaaaaah being loved and accepted DEFINITELY tones down my crazy. It's obviously not disappeared or I wouldn't fucking be here. But in terms of the overall harm reduction it's definitely helped. I can admit that I've lost weight I look thinner and I am able to look in the mirror and sometimes feel okay. The real question is how do I hold on to it and when is it enough?,False,False
