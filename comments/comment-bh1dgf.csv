It’s also so easy to forget that levels of restriction are relative to a TDEE that’s different for everyone. You can feel safer (healthier?) or lazier (less disciplined?) than someone restricting to 400 because you eat a whopping 1200 calories, but if they’re short a sedentary and you’re taller and highly active, you could actually be in a higher deficit.  It’s counterproductive to try and categorize levels of restriction. I understand the temptation, but it never ends well for people with EDs to compare these kinds of notes.",False,False

What was I worried about?"" Anything to justify it.  There's a post on mpa that is just everyone's daily goals and it was really interesting (not in a great way) to see how they reacted to each other.   ""Their goal is lower than mine; at least I'm not that bad/I'm a lazy piece of shit and need to go lower.""  ""Their goal is higher than mine; I'm validated/they're disgusting.""  ""Their goal is equal to mine; I'm validated/I need to go lower.""  Obviously not the actual quotes from comments, but the gist of the conversation. I came out with my questions answered but with an understanding of why you trigger warn for numbers, and why it's so bad for recovery to talk about them at all.",False,False
