Maybe 2-4 oz of meat, a half cup to a cup of veggies, and around a cup of some sort of grain or starch seems like a pretty standard meal to me. Like maybe a cut of chicken, some carrots, and some sort of noodle-based side dish. I don't eat stuff like that personally though. That's way too much for me. I just try to max out my nutrients with as little food as I can manage while still being ""healthy"". I also typically just eat one food at a time. Small portions work best for me because of my health.",False,False
