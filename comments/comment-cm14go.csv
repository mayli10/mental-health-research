I obsess over size but it's more about how big is it for how many calories. Kinda like when you're shopping and wondering if something's worth the cost; I wonder if it's ""worth"" the calories. Fruits and veggies, low-cal sugar free stuff is always a good deal; things like cereal and whole eggs can go either way; protein bars, granola, almost any dessert is never ever worth it. Flavor and personal likes/dislikes are also a factor.",False,False

I can only eat the kids size ones because I can have more for less calories than what a big one would be, and I struggle to finish the bigger ones anyway.",False,False

Maybe my lizard brain is thinking ‘mmmnyess many small food better than one big food, is more food” or maybe it’s my more nefarious — but equally stupid — ED brain thinking “small food = less fat. I don’t care if the calories are equal, look how *small* this is. Can’t get fat from small things!”  I also have a weird habit of eating everything with my hands (yes it’s gross, but leave me alone, it’s one of the least gross things I do for my disorder), and small bits &gt; big bits for that. Popcorn, berries, chickpeas, etc.",False,False
