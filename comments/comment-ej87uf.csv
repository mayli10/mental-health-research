In my personal experience, my fiancee has been my absolute rock in dealing and actually trying to recover from my ED. She would never make comments about my body or my eating until i explicitly gave her permission to say things like that she finds me sexy or that i am so strong (I'm a chef so my body is quite muscular), even things like ""if you eat something you will feel better"", she also lets me eat whatever I feel comfortable and safe eating without judgment (even when all i eat are triscuits and string cheese). We have had several conversations about what my boundaries are when it comes to her and my eating disorder, i also allow her to express her concerns and thoughts about my habits and as much as it hurts and is sometimes triggering,  she has slowly help me to actually want to recover. She's also gotten very good and identifying when I'm having a bad day and will 1) let me work through it 2) very explicitly show her support and offer any help i may need.  She has become my safe place, where any and all my emotions are allowed and I'm free to say/do whatever it takes to get me through them.  I feel that open, honest and judgment free communication is the absolute key. Be prepared to hear things that will not make logical sense and that will be very difficult to bear. But if you get to the point where she feels that she doesn't have to keep anything a secret from you, you've won half the battle.  EDs are most of the time fueled by secrecy and shame. If you manage to break through that, you will be already of incredible help to her   Sorry for the rant, i really hope this helps.",False,False

Keep her focus on creative activities or her favorite games. Hold her often. Always being optimistic about her health and hold her hand through the worst parts be strong.ðŸ’•   My partner does these things and when weâ€™re together heâ€™ll see after I eat I often panic and from behind heâ€™ll hug me and hold my body and suggest we play PokÃ©mon or watch anime together or heâ€™ll call over my cat to sit with us. Anything to help me cope..but heâ€™ll let me know heâ€™s sorry for my feelings and keeps me warm and close.  When heâ€™s not around itâ€™s extremely difficult for me because I relapse and will fast days in till I see him again because he makes me happy and brings my attention on our love and his kindness.,False,False

Healthy food or unhealthy food, literally anything can cause a lot of anxiety. When I mean focus I mean donâ€™t talk about it, &amp; donâ€™t make meals / eating a big deal. Donâ€™t talk about dieting, donâ€™t talk about that really good dessert you had last night, donâ€™t talk about other people dieting, donâ€™t talk about others weight gain, donâ€™t comment on your own weight or appearance or eating.
