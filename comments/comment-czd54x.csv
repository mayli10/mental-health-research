I know its tempting to compare yourself to other girls you see in porn. But remember that a lot of those pictures (especially in pictures) are photoshopped, have the model posing in a very specific way at a very specific angle that looks flattering. I used to be very bad about this, and I think the body positive and instagram vs reality movements helped me a lot. It reminds me that my body is NORMAL and that its totally ok to have rolls and stretch marks and body fat. Its so refreshing to see people being honest and open about it. Social media is VERY idealized and fake. It's not real life. And remember that your body doesn't exist to meet society's stupid and impossible standards of beauty. Your body exists as a vessel to keep you alive, so you can live a happy life.",False,False

That and most porn subreddits, but *especially* that one. If some of those are shopped iâ€™d like to know too because it really fucks with me.",False,False
