I bake four days a week (sell half, force the other half on my loved ones) and there is definitely a perverse joy in creating something beautiful and delicious just to watch somebody else consume it.",False,False

Since I wonâ€™t allow myself most foods Iâ€™d rather go shopping and Iâ€™ll feel way better. When Iâ€™m broke and donâ€™t have $ for clothes Iâ€™ll go to the 99 cent store and buy a bunch of cute unnecessary things like cute folders and gel pens, scrunchies for my hair, socks, a coloring book lol. Just anything that looks cute and gives me instant happiness for the day.  Keeps me from eating too :)",False,False

Box if they donâ€™t ship to my country. Iâ€™ll pay import fees.   And then Iâ€™ll hoard that shit and never use any of it.",False,False
