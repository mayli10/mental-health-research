So yesterday was one of the most embarrassing days of my life. At a fast food place and my card is declined due to ‘fraud suspicion’. I spend an hour going through verification after verification to get it unlocked. Several customers try to pay for my meal out of pity. One comments ‘you look like you haven’t had a real meal in quite awhile’. Finally, just as Visa unlocks my account, the manager brings me the food I’d ordered for free- because ‘sometimes you just need something good to happen in your life’.  No! I could easily afford to buy every customer in that building lunch, man, I could buy a franchise if I wanted it. But no, instead I break down in tears because TOO MANY GOOD THINGS HAPPEN TO ME AND I DESERVE NONE OF THEM. Then promptly purge my meal, since that was the original intention.   Today I could barely get out of bed due to guilt.  Edit to add: also grew up poor. Like where powdered Gatorade was lunch and dinner. Now am not and waste hundreds and hundreds of dollars a month on food going directly up and out.",False,False
