The whole starving thing makes me tired but that's about it.  When I'm properly caffeinated, I honestly feel manic when restricting. It's like a high. Then I eat and come crashing down and lay facedown in bed for an hour.",False,False

I don't think. lol.  No dysmorphia. There does seem to be something of an obsessive-compulsive undercurrent to my eating issues but I've never struggled with that before the food thing either.  Regardless, my PCP still diagnosed an ED and just noted it lacked the dysmorphic dimension.",False,False
