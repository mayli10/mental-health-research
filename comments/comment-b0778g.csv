Get lots of protein and fibre. Stay away from fatty foods. Invest in some miralax and some kind of fibre powder or tablets. It sounds excessive but it‚Äôll make a *huge* difference in the long run. Brown rice is good too and green foods. If you eat meat fish is good, I really like grilled salmon but haven‚Äôt had in a long time. Maybe it‚Äôll help you too. If you must have sugar try to switch to Stevia. It‚Äôs not that great but it‚Äôs all natural. I can‚Äôt diagnose you with GP but people with EDs are more likely to get it than people without them, though it usually affects people with diabetes but keep up with your nutrition. GP isn‚Äôt fatal but if you become malnourished you can get something called a bezoar that‚Äôs basically a chunk of food (gross I know sorry) stuck in your intestines and you won‚Äôt know it‚Äôs happening basically until it‚Äôs too late.

I actually have been going through this and I think it's because I restrict really low on weekdays and eat ""normally"" on weekends.   Things that helped me was actually reducing my fiber intake, eating small meals multiple times rather than one big meal, taking walks after meals, and drinking plenty of water. But drink water between meals and not during. Also fennel and ginger tea with lemon. And I'm sorry, i know how uncomfortable it is :/",False,False

Diet modification sure is the first-line therapy, so lemme dump some info from evidence-based physician guidelines  &gt;Foods that are fatty, acidic, spicy, and roughage-based increase overall symptoms in individuals with gastroparesis \[[3,4](https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-gastroparesis/abstract/3,4)\]. Fat slows gastric emptying and nondigestible fiber (eg, fresh fruits and vegetables) require effective interdigestive antral motility that is frequently absent in patients with significantly delayed gastric emptying. Patients with gastroparesis should be advised by a dietician to consume small, frequent meals four to five times a day that are low in fat and contain only soluble fiber. For patients who are unable to tolerate solid food, meals should be homogenized, as gastric emptying of liquids is often normal even when emptying of solids is delayed \[[2,5,6](https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-gastroparesis/abstract/2,5,6)\]. Patients should also be advised to avoid carbonated beverages as they can aggravate gastric distention \[[2](https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-gastroparesis/abstract/2)\]. Alcohol and smoking should also be avoided as they can decrease antral contractility and delay gastric emptying \[[7,8](https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-gastroparesis/abstract/7,8)\].  So in normal English  * avoid: fatty, acidic, spicy, roughage-based, non-digestible fiber (fresh fruits and vegies), carbonated drinks, alcohol, smoking * eat: small low-fat soluble-fibre meals 4-5 times a day, try a smoothie/liquid meal if it's getting bad",False,False

Sometimes to the point that my ribs would ache.  Unfortunately having the food come up that end does nothing. I‚Äôm assuming because the issue is more trapped gas than volume.
