Happy eating out, happy eating with his family while stressing tf out when I was alone.   I decided to come clean about this, that I have a problem eating certain things, problems eating out, eating with people. I told him all that seems relevant without going into details that are just.. you know too much. That has helped me tremendously. For example I've told him that I don't want to be pushed into trying new things, I'll probably come around one way or another but I need my time to settle into it and pushing me to ""just try this new sauce"" doesn't help. He's accepted that even if he finds it hard to understand still and we find ways to work around this e.g. if we want a cozy night in he gets take out and I cook for myself something that I'm ok with and we eat together.",False,False

I have mentioned multiple times that I do intermittent fasting so it’s not like it’ll be new info I’m just worried the real life reality of that will cause him to be concerned  But yeah I used to have a lot of Ed friends and now I have basically no one to talk to about this kinda stuff so I guess the last 2 years of loneliness have been rough re no one I can have an honest Ed conversation with",False,True

You’re spending two months there and he is going to see you every day. He cares about you and will want to help you. You need to do what works for your digestion, but it also sounds like you need support. You sound very alone in this!",False,False
