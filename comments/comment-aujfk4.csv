My BMI was the same before I went into treatment, and girl lemme tell you I had to eat a HELL of a lot of food to gain anything at all. I was \*losing\* weight on what would otherwise be considered a weight-gain diet.  Your body is crippled from starvation. Your bones, your organs, your muscles, all of those are damaged and will use the calories for repair. And they \*reeeeally\* want those calories, man. You probably have gained weight, but this repair phase can't last forever and the extreme hunger should subside. I know this probably wasn't that helpful, just hang in there &lt;3",False,False
