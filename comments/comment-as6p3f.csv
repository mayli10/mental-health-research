Even though it was a super toxic relationship, I didn't recognize it at the time and I loved him a lot.   To be honest, I didn't even focus on meeting someone else for the first few months. I focused A LOT on myself and filling my time and improving myself. I, at the time, was looking for a job so I focused on that. I focused on hanging out with my friends and family and journaling. I was able to do a lot of things now that I was single, and not just go on casual/fun dates but I had more time to myself! Literally, I started learning German, taking better care of my skin, my social life was better. Eventually I was so much happier and was a point where I was SO thankful for not being with my ex. Try not to focus on the one person that's not there and look to the people who are there for you!  The biggest thing is after the first few weeks, stop thinking about him. Stop talking to him. Stop talking about him. He's not in your life anymore. He was a part of it and you learned a lot from him, but he's not your future. you broke up for a reason. One day you'll look back on this time and be so thankful for it because it forced you to become a better person.  THEN when you're ready you will know and when you meet the right person you will know. TBH, this part is super silly haha but the way I found the person I'm currently with is I started watching Law of Attraction videos on YouTube (Leeor Alexander) and I had watched a video on inspired action a few months earlier. That's when you suddenly feel the urge to do something, you should listen to your gut because it might be the ""universe's"" way of helping you reach your manifestations. I had been journaling about a relationship I wanted and how I wished to be treated and the kind of person I wanted to be with and even though I was not into the idea of dating apps I suddenly wanted to download one. So I downloaded one and the current person I'm with is the second person I met on the app!! I was literally on the app for 2 weeks before I met him haha so it kind of feels like it was meant to be.   I honestly truly feel that after time, things become more clear. A year from now you'll be really thankful for your current pain because it brought you to a better point in your life.   &amp;#x200B;  I'm really sorry for what you're going through right now. heartbreak hurts so much. Please message me if you need anything! ",False,False

On the bright side: Now you knew he was a piece of trash before it could have gone on longer.   You will find someone more worthy, and better soon. Trust me. It made me feel and do the same finding my ex doing that shit with MULTIPLE girls.",False,False

We were together for 3 years and he treated me like I was disposable, not special, there were plenty of girls like me and I was lucky to be with him. I always told myself if I were just skinnier he'd treat me better.   Nah, he was still trash.   I'm with someone new now who treats me so well. Better than I think I deserve.   Moral of the story, it's not you it's him. I can't wait for you to find someone one day who chooses you for you. ",False,False
