Waiting on blood tests to come back and scheduling an MRI to figure out what exactly is wrong but in the meantime I have to drastically up my salt and eat more because there's a real danger of passing out on a ladder at work or while crossing the street at this point with how my vitals are. I have been trying my best but maintenance is really high for me (conservative calculation about 2700) because of my height, my job, and the fact that I walk almost everywhere since my car died. I can't change my lifestyle in any way to bring that number down but I'm really struggling and the extra salt is making me bloated which is making me feel horribly ugly, and when I feel bad about my appearance I tend to reassure myself that at least I'm smart and funny, but the cognitive issues I've been having as part of this are taking that from me too.",False,False
