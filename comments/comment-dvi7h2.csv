About school and work, yes, but also this great big overarching anxiety that the plan I had for my life isn't working out how I wanted and I have no idea where I'll be or what I'll be doing or who I'll be with in a couple years. Or who I will be, even.  I had a long term relationship and a career goal and had it all planned out. Then I lost everything. And I feel so aimless and like I can't handle the fucking anxiety of not knowing what comes next.  Literally all I want is to get married, work as a nurse, have a couple kids and maybe foster some children. A nice house, not too large but pretty, and a *big* garden. That's it. I feel like I want such a simple life for myself but it's so unattainable because I don't have a relationship or a location in mind or any idea about wtf I am supposed to be doing.  I graduate with a bio bachelors degree in a month then start a year long accelerated bachelors program for nursing.   Honestly just typing this made me so anxious I want to purge. I've had a good long streak of like 3 weeks of restriction with no binges, but today I forced myself to eat maintenance since I was having chest pains. But now I just want to purge it so I can stop focusing on all the shit I hate.",False,False

For me itâ€™s definitely keeping up with people expectations of me as the smart or good student. Grades arenâ€™t everything. Someone who might go to Yale might be school smart but if we still lived in a hunter gather society, they might not be considered the smartest or the fittest. Know that you are worth more than school work and that doesnâ€™t define how smart you are. If you have to drop a few hard classes then do it. Donâ€™t sacrifice yourself or your mental health for it. I will assure you, if you continue with the work ethic you learned from all these previous years of school then youâ€™ll be okay.

Thereâ€™s just so much, itâ€™s like the teachers donâ€™t realize we have a life outside of school. I feel so overwhelmed and hopeless, itâ€™s hard to find motivation to keep up with it all. My grades have been suffering. Iâ€™ve never suffered in school before. Iâ€™ve always been a mostly Aâ€™s sometimes Bâ€™s student, and the type that passed all the tests and overachieved and that everyone always thought of as the smart kid. But now I just canâ€™t do it. Maybe Iâ€™m just stupid and not cut out for life.",False,False
