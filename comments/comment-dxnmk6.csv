It's possible that a BMI of 16 is normal for kids or teens, doctors usually use percentiles and 5th to 85th percentile seems to be normal weight.  Not sure that's still the best way to do things because teens have an adult physique earlier than when the thing was created, but that might explain it.  *You don't have to be underweight to get a diagnosis, atypical anorexia nervosa is a valid illness if you don't meet the weight requirement.",False,False

Also they changed it the BMI requirement? That’s really really good. It gives me hope that maybe soon I can talk to my parents about this and get help, and it will probably help other people get help too. Guess the DSM is not as dumb as I thought :)",False,True

I'm 5'1, I get the struggle though. I'd have to be 97. However, even though I'm not, I have been diagnosed. The DSM changed the BMI requirements.",False,False
