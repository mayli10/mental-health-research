After quite a while of mostly 'normal' life, lately it's been flaring up again for me. Yesterday I hit my lowest weight in a couple years, and then last night I had my worst binge in years.   Today when I woke up the scale says 2lbs heavier than yesterday, and I feel like a total asshole. The weirdest part is that even with the 2lb 'extra', I'm still at a lower weight than I've been at for a long time. I still feel like total crap though.   It's a shitty headspace to be in, but you're for sure not alone.",False,False
