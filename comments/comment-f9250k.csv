Tried to change my anorexia into being healthy. Turned into b&amp;p and then just in binge ed. I ventured around between all of those. Now I’m somewhat on healthy with occasional binges.   You’re taking a step somewhere. Get into some support groups and therapy. Find your way out. One of the best perks is when you stop bingeing, you usually lose weight to your body’s set point.   It’s a long journey and it sucks. But there’s a freedom to recovery. Recovery doesn’t have to be perfect either.",False,False
