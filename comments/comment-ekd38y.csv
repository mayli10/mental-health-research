I took a ju jujitsu class once and almost had a panic attack. So many people (mostly guys) touching me and looking at me...I couldn't handle it.,False,False

But there is so much human contact.. Sparring with some stranger? Hell no. And what if that person was like super skinny and attractive? I would be traumatized and couldn‚Äôt leave home for days probably.  I wish I was exaggerating but unfortunately i‚Äôm not ..",False,True

And I also feel that in sports like yoga and ballet the visual side is stressed a lot.. the certain ballet aesthetics for example. My uni also offers more fast paced classes but I am already afraid of passing out doing yoga, because of low restricting.. So there clearly is pros and cons with both kind of classes .. or maybe it‚Äôs mostly my anxious isolated overthinking trainwreck self making excuses haha",False,True

I have a lot more luck with boxing and circuit training group classes. They're fast paced with a lot of focus on technique. I'm so focused on getting the moves right and keeping up with the instructor that there really isn't time for me to look at other people's bodies.",False,False

I know that it‚Äôs just in my head. Really working on it, and it‚Äôs always good to hear someone else assuring me that it‚Äôs not real.  And I have actually been doing yoga at home again for a few months now (thanks youtube lol) and it helps so much. When I‚Äôm doing yoga I can get out of my head, it is the only thing that calms me down and and makes me feel that I‚Äôm doing something good, something that isn‚Äôt about punishing my body and myself.   I would really like to better my technique and learn more, so it would mean so much to me to get the courage to start those classes. Maybe the ‚Äùbeing afraid and anxious of other people‚Äù -part eases over time..",False,True

Even dance if that‚Äôs something you like. You will love it. It gets you more in touch with your body and rids you of the mind-body barrier that (I think) is a huge catalyst for eating disorders. You don‚Äôt have time to think, you just have to do. Move intuitively, trust yourself and your body more, without overthinking everything. Over time it dissipates that barrier and you begin to feel more at home in your body, not like you‚Äôre just a 5-lb sack of disordered tissue operating some lifeless meat sack. It brings about a sense of unity, and it is so, so healing.",False,False

But think of it this way‚Äî when you are at the gym, are you hardcore judging everyone else there? From the buff fit guys to the obese woman sweating and lifting 5 lb dumbbells? Probably not, right? And if you were, wouldn‚Äôt that just be a projection of you and your own insecurities rather than something about them? Everyone else is the same way. Trust me‚Äî they are all much too focused on themselves and what is going on in the class/their routine and how well they are doing it and how THEY themselves look doing it to judge you. In psychology this is called the Spotlight Effect‚Äî thinking that everyone is watching you when really they aren‚Äôt. But ED‚Äôs make you hyper-aware of your own presence so we tend to forget this. But just remember‚Äî everyone is ignoring you üòù",False,False
