Just wanted to comment, again, to reiterate that I &lt;b&gt;feel very guilty and bad about my thoughts&lt;/b&gt; and am actually EXTREMELY familiar with binging. I am sorry if my post hurt you or served as a trigger but please understand that I would NEVER logically conclude that people with BED should just “have more willpower”   I never said that, I do not think that, and I would never suggest it. This is a post about people who, from what I can tell, do not have a debilitating binge eating disorder. This is not a post pertaining to people with BED. It never was. This is a post about people who treat ME like shit and blame misinformation and pseudo science for their behavior. I am sorry if you’ve taken this to heart, but I am allowed to vent and speak about negative thoughts caused by MY disorder as much as anyone else in the community. If my symptoms and negative thoughts make you uncomfortable, then you’ll be pleased to know that they make me extremely uncomfortable too. You are over reducing everything I said in my original post, you are making sweeping assumptions about my specific disorder, and you are claiming I’ve said things where I haven’t. I wish you the best of luck and I am truly sorry if this post hurt you in anyway.",False,True

I posted another comment on this thread, but I wanted to say the same thing.  If anything, I have *more* compassion for them since losing the weight. I'm actually extremely surprised the sub reacted to this post in the way that it did. OP hoe story sounds extremely insensitive to a huge amount of the ED community.

Like you, I've lost 50 pounds now and am no longer in that position, but looking back, I did genuinely have no control over my binge eating. In the same way we have no control over the restrictive aspects of our ED's now, I genuinely had no control over my eating, and I tried literally everything. It was *only* professional help that really helped, but if I didn't get that, I imagine I'd be in the same position still. It wasn't willpower at all; it was a mental illness. No diet or workout could fix what only therapy could. And to be honest, I had a lot more willpower back then than I do now. I don't try to fight my ED anymore; back then I was trying so hard and fighting every single day. I wish I could tell myself back then that ""trying harder"" wasn't going to fix my BED and cause me to lose the weight.",False,False

I acknowledged that everyone on this sub knows Weightloss / CICO is not a breeze, but I would agree the tone was defensive and I apologize if I came off aggressively.   In general, I’m just so sick of seeing people being vicious about fat people on this sub and pass it off as a rant. It feels so hateful and condescending to a part of the ED population, and I’m sure I’m not the only one who gets insanely triggered by it. That’s all.",False,False

I am so sorry you’re also dealing with this. It’s invalidating when people try to discredit your weight loss as an act of god, especially when they use insane pseudo science to back up their position on the whole ordeal. Like, I eat my OMAD at 9pm everyday and people are MORE surprised that I’ve lost weight by eating at nighttime than they are that I’ve only eaten one 500&gt; call meal all day.

I’m not trying to invalidate people’s coping mechanisms, this post was never about people overeating as a means to cope with abuse or stress. I’m additionally not saying that fat folx aren’t allowed to feel insecure. I have acknowledged how shitty it is that I think these things, and would never wish an eating disorder on anyone as a means to lose weight.   I’m sorry about your PTSD symptoms, I hope you’re doing better. Your coping mechanisms are just as valid as everyone else’s, restrictive or not.",False,True

I'm so sorry you have to deal with this, especially from people who I understand you have to see and talk to regularly. It must be extremely hard...for what it's worth, I don't think you're fatphobic. You don't think fat people deserve to be discriminated against or anything like that. You're just acknowledging the parts of reality that are inconvenient to them. That's not fatphobia. Being called out on your bullshit isn't discriminatory.  I'm in the ""used to be obese, soon to be underweight"" club, too. And when I started out, it was for good reasons, I wanted to get healthy - I'd still get my morbidly obese father throw the most random, cliche bullshit my way.

For me it was easiest for me to lose weight when I was sickest and the most obsessed about what I was eating and how much I was exercising.   My ptsd symptoms have been horrendous for the past year and I gained weight, but I made it through a really hellish time in my life alive and I won’t apologize for not focusing on CICO when I was just trying to survive.   And I reserve the right to be unhappy with my body and express how shitty I feel even if I’m fat.   Losing weight is so much more than CICO it’s also having a particular mindset, and it’s not a breeze as I think everyone on this sub can attest to.

Like obviously I would never EVER wish an eating disorder on anyone or use my own eating disorder as a standard for losing weight, but the mysticism surrounding weight loss pisses me off SO much.

You don’t have to be as extreme (disordered) as I am- but the 400 calorie smoothies and keto friendly “fat bombs” sure as shit aren’t helping out.
