My friend may not know WHY I‚Äôve cut her off because I never quite found the anger in me to snap and tell her what‚Äôs going on and I know it‚Äôs bad on my part because I should stand up for myself but I find it easier to just let her loose and let her figure out who she is without me needing to fight her about it, if that makes sense. If she no longer has me to leech off of I figured she‚Äôd go back to her old self and if not it‚Äôs really not my problem. I‚Äôm hoping she finds her way but at this point only her therapist can give her the cold truth because I‚Äôm not ready or skilled enough to put myself in the situation of telling her what I may personally think is wrong with her as mean as it sounds. I‚Äôm glad I could find someone to relate to my post. I‚Äôve been struggling for awhile trying to find any form of advice :)",False,True

I took the easier way and didn‚Äôt confront her because I figured me just leaving and her having no one to feed off of will end the problem for me and hopefully her eventually. I realized that we were truly no longer ‚Äúreal‚Äù friends as I was being used for personal gain. I appreciate your input and I‚Äôll be using your advice,False,True

I totally forgot about this post thinking no one would reply honestly. I was on a total rant and I kind of regretted posting this but knowing others can relate to my situation makes me feel a lot better. Since writing this I‚Äôve limited our contact to a whole new level and as I watch from the sidelines it‚Äôs as if she‚Äôs frozen in time. When we would hangout every other day it felt like she was changing her personality to fit mine like clockwork and now it‚Äôs like she has nothing new to add to her shiny ego that she just stays put. I feel bad but it‚Äôs the healthiest thing to do for both of us. I appreciate your feedback friend :),False,True

Your friend sounds like my best friend from waaay back in high school. All the things I confided in her she would regurgitate to other people but exaggerated to hell and back. Because I was a highschooler, when I realised what she was doing I started to feed her totally made up stories that got increasingly more ridiculous and oh boy, she took it and ran with it. Totally not a mature thing to do but it confirmed my suspicions and then I just slowly stopped talking to her. I'd refuse to talk about anything personal and I'd deflect all questions. All her vents were met with 'I'm so sorry its hard for you right now but it'll get better' or 'maybe you should seek professional help as I cant provide the advice you need' and I think that conveyed the message. Either that or she got bored of me not fulfilling her need for attention or validation or whatever she was seeking.  Its always nice to have a friend to talk to about the harder side of life but when it's causing so much stress and clearly isn't good for you or the other person it's really the best thing to do. It's saves you the mental strain and could lead them to seeking the help they need (probably not the kind they want though) or cutting their bullshit out entirely.",False,False

Either way you won‚Äôt have to deal with her issues anymore. What she‚Äôs doing is really not okay, and is extreme rude on her end.",False,False

I know it can be hard to accept it but believe me, if she is being toxic at the point that's faking an ed that knows your are struggling with ITS NOT YOUR FRIEND. She doesn't want to help you, she is triggering you. My advice is that you to talk to her and get a little bit of distance for a while to see if she changes her attitude. Good luck",False,False

I don‚Äôt have any advice about this specific situation, however I once had only a few friends (now 0 friends), and I had one very close friend who did/said lots of rude or insensitive shit to me and I always let it go because she was like my only friend. In the end, this resulted in her stealing almost $1000 USD from me, and also betraying me by hanging out with my extremely emotionally abusive ex behind my back. My whole point is, your friend doesn‚Äôt respect you and is kind of just leeching off of you, and while it is hard to not have friends, it also is hard to have friends who are so toxic that it‚Äôs just as hard if not worse than just being friendless. She has no right to wear your stuff, insult you, and the copycat ED thing is SCARY! I personally would put my foot down even if she cries etc and tell her to see a therapist and maybe that she can‚Äôt come over for a while, if she wants to hang out maybe it can be in public or her place etc. Sounds a lot like there are boundary issues (both with her having none/ignoring other people‚Äôs boundaries), and on your end (hard to stand up for yourself). Your mental and physical wellness are way more important than catering to a friend who is destructive and toxic. I hope this made sense and didn‚Äôt come off rude. üñ§",False,False
