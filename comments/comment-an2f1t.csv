When I feel emotional hunger, I find different ways of getting the energy out, such as journalling, going for a walk, or dancing.  When I feel mouth hungry, I'll chew gum or drink tea or flavored water, and try to distract myself.  I also try to go somewhere where I don't have access to food, like my dorm's common room.  And like SpaceWhale88 said, eating 3 meals everyday, without exceptions, helps a lot.  When I first started recovering, I had no idea what a normal meal/portion looked like, so I looked up meal plans that fulfilled my tdee and went from there.   ",False,False

Oh man okay I've been purge free for a little over 2 weeks now. The first week and a half I was EATING. Like, couldn't stop, gross amount of eating-eating. But seriously I didn't stop myself from binging because this was the first time my body got to keep food and I sorta wanted to give it the reassurance that I wouldn't take it away? But suddenly it started to become okay and I could eat a normal amount and it would be okay. I'm now lower than the weight I was when I stopped b/ping. Of course, everyone's journey is different and I am very lucky to have only take two weeks. I think it's the easiest to attack the behaviour in your ED before you get to the thoughts and feelings behind them. ",False,False
