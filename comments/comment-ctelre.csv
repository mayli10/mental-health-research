I actually DID do this once, I sold all my stuff and quit my job and broke up with my girlfriend and cut off all my hair and loaded up a backpack and walked across three states, and it was exactly as perfect and amazing as I thought it would be.  I felt good.  I looked good.  I felt *in league* with my body instead of against it.  I wish I could do that again.  I got really depressed when I came back, though.  Or, even if I couldn't go all the way and do the whole thing again, maybe if I could just take a few weeks off from my job and other responsibilities.",False,False
