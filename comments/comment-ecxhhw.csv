For thighs keep doing squats, leg press, Romanian deadlifts, leg curls, split squats with dumbbells, etc.   Always heavy sets first (after your warm ups sets) and then high reps sets with lighter reps.  Also If doing cardio: it should always be done after weightlifting sessions(never before) and kept at 15-20m max.  If you only do jogging with no WL, itâ€™s not worth it imo, especially for weight loss. Itâ€™s boring, time consuming and not very effective. After long enough, it increases cortisol, eats away your lean muscles but at the same time if you donâ€™t jog enough it burns almost no calories.ðŸ¤”  If doing cardio only then HIIT (sprint intervals) is my go to. Takes about 3-5m and is more effective at burning fat + doesnâ€™t cause muscle loss.  Unlike cardio where you burn calories when doing it, weight lifting burn during and after &amp; the more muscle you build, the more calories you can eat just to maintain it =P   No need to starve ourselves. Hope this helps",False,False

Going lower wouldnâ€™t be smart tho.  Iâ€™d definitely recommend weightlifting and 100% not jogging.",False,False

Even prior to restricting I never drank much (maybe 2-3 servings of juice/pop) but now that I restrict I drink water primarily, tea, and maybe a monster if I work. Like I just canâ€™t get anymore down and itâ€™s frustrating not seeing the numbers go down when the weight should be falling off.",False,False
