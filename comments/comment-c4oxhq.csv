I started doing wild stuff like being obsessive over my sleep posture, and the scents I use like in my shampoo and perfume in case that was it. Paying better attention to my sleep helped, and it stopped being consistent after a few weeks. It still comes back sometime though, and I’ll just take DayQuil or Claritin and treat it like allergies. Never really discovered any information about it cause I’m too chicken to go to the doctor lol",False,False

That said I was there a year ago with my heart doing a ton of irregular things like that. And then the cardiac arrest issues began. For me it turned out a lot of it was caused by severe hypokalemia (low potassium) and electrolyte imbalances requiring prescription potassium. ""Gain weight"" was never told to me. It was, ""Let's try to understand what's causing your irregular heartbeat/chest pain/cardiac arrest/muscle weakness causing you to also not be able to walk for weeks/seizures coming back,"" sort of thing.  Don't take over the counter potassium without getting frequent blood labs and EKGs at the very least done. A lot of the symptoms are shared with hyperkalemia which is problematic if you're self diagnosing and taking them.",False,False

Try balancing your meals more? Make sure you get carbs for energy, vegetables for gut health, and iron and protein?",False,False
