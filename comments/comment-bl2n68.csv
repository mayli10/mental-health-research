Just offering support. And my main point was to atleast try and help them. I already said that if they continue with their bad habits the person should leave if it is hurting them.   And if it is just someone who gained weight - try a diet and fitness with them. If they continue on their bad habits you are allowed to leave. That is what I am getting at. For me it is a difference for me between refusing to date someone who's fat and leave someone who is fat, without trying to work it out with them and help them get back in shape.",False,False

Most people are *not* mental health professionals (and even if they are- they are not allowed to treat friends, family, partners) and a lot of the time even the pros-the people who's job it actually is to help them- can't do a damn thing about it, so I still don't believe that anyone is an asshole for not attempting to treat their friend/partner/whoever's eating disorder/addiction/whatever.",False,False

He then found her secret stash of junk food and confronted her about it. I don't remember what happened after but long story short the GF had diabetes, a life threatening disease and didn't want to change her lifestyle. In cases like this I feel like it's justified but you're also right, many of the people posting this on aita are just seeking validation for being a shitty person",False,False

Join a gym together, start some sort of a healthy (balanced diet)? Also, if the person gains the weight super fast then there is something going on - way bigger than just eating or being ''lazy''.  Just as you said '  &gt;If somebody left me because I starve myself..'  Yes, that could be kind of an asshole thing to do if you don't try to help the person first. I don't think that if my partner gained weight or staved himself, instead of helping him to get better I would just leave him behind. Obviously, if you try and they don't listen and just continue to engage in their bad habits, you can leave since you are getting hurt in the process.  For example, there was this post on AITA about how a woman told her best friend's husband that his wife was secretly eating and had a stash of junk food when the husband made it very clear that the wife needs to lose weight (the wife has always has been fat, she was diagnosed with being  pre-diabetic and the husband had enough) otherwise he would leave her, they BOTH went on diet and the husband lost weight while the wife gained. There is no information whenever he left her or not.  Anyway, that to me seems fair - he tried to help her, she refuses to see a therapist for a possible B.E.D;  But just to leave someone without giving it a shot and helping them?  &amp;#x200B;  Everyone has preferences and I am not saying that people should date outside of their preferences but at least try to help the person first, rather than just leave them because they are not as attractive anymore.",False,False

But he will also be an advocate for healthy and strong, and attractive! I can’t be mad- I wouldn’t be attracted to him if he was overweight. I would try to cook healthy for him, push him to exercise, etc. why should I be offended that he feels the same? I want my husband to want me. I want to be sexy.

I'm also going to throw this out there: the last couple of times I've gained weight were because I was in a relationship, and was on birth control. Any medication which can possibly cause weight gain, will. My ex grabbed my love handles and jiggled. (Suffice to say, not an amazingly healthy relationship). My partner now checks in regularly to ask how I'm doing, and makes sure to tell me he loves me and that I'm beautiful, even when I feel awful.

I think it's all about context:   I don't think anyone is obligated to commit to a long-term relationship knowing it could damn well be cut short by their partner's bad habits, whether or not they have any control over them.   If somebody left me because I starve myself and they don't want to bury their 45 year old wife someday, that's totally fine. Likewise if somebody wants to leave their obese partner to avoid that suffering, isn't that fine too?   Hell, even if it's just about not being attracted to them anymore. You don't get to pick what you find sexy. Never in my life did I sit down and think *man, from this day forward I will only like men with curly brown hair.* nor did I ever think *gosh, I really oughta start getting hot and bothered over dad-bods.* It just happened. Being physically compatible is important in a relationship. More so for some than others. Whether it's about sex, or even just that you want somebody who can go on a hike with you.   I wouldn't think ill of somebody who decided they didn't want me anymore because I'm composed entirely of bones and constantly held back by the physical symptoms of being underweight.   Is it that different on the other side?",False,False
