I use Premium Jane 1,000 mg full spectrum. I think a serving is 50-100 mg. It’s expensive but effective. I take it when anxiety hits. I put it under my tongue and in 20 minutes I’m so calm it’s scary. I gave it to my friend who has no anxiety and she was so calm she couldn’t even talk. I definitely recommend it.",False,False
