On one hand, it's not that bad because I've had huge tits since I was like 9 so it makes little difference. And at least the band size has gone down. But on the other hand, it sucks because my fucking back hurts. These are DD cups I have to lug around on a daily basis, man. Shit gets old.   On the plus side, gotta agree with you, my ass is at its prime right now. So weird. But, hey, I'm not questioning it. ",False,False

You might not gain fat on your boobs. I never do, but the positive is that when I lose weight, the relative size of my boobs increases because the glands stay the same size :) ",False,False

I hope you can find somebody decent at a weight you’re comfortable with. My dad is a narcissist and drug addict and I wouldn’t wish that kind of man on my worst enemy. ,False,False
