Even from an objective point of view, you have every reason to feel upset.  And even if your life HAD been perfect and amazing and great, mental illness can get anyone, at any time. It doesn't matter how objectively good your life may be; there are people who are in objectively shitty situations who feel happy and fulfilled, and people in objectively AMAZING situations who are suicidal. You don't need to feel guilty about this, because this isn't your fault.",False,False

I’ve had my ED for a long time now. In that span, I’ve gone from not enough money to live on to high income. I’ve been in stable and loving relationships, toxic relationships and single. I’ve been in good and bad living situations. I’ve had jobs I’ve loved and jobs I’ve hated. I’ve had large groups of friends and no friends.  Everything could be seemingly “right and perfect” in my life but I was still depressed and suicidal. Why? Because I have an ED. Because an ED is physical AND psychological. It’s controlling the narrative in your brain. Just because you have good things in your life, doesn’t mean that you can’t still be sick and hurting.",False,False

But why not? He had painstakingly assembled all the ingredients of happiness. He had performed all the necessary rituals, spoken the words, lit the candles, made the sacrifices. But happiness, like a disobedient spirit, refused to come.” -Lev Grossman, *The Magicians*   This has been the question I’ve been dancing around through years of therapy and hospital stays and medications. For me, there were layers and layers of fear and hurt, and quite a few core beliefs about myself that were really unhelpful. The idea that I’m a bad, wrong person. The idea that I’m not enough, and then definitions of ‘enough’ that ensured I’d never ever get there. I was trying to summon happiness by assembling external things and circumstances, but for me the problem lay deep inside. No arrangement of job, city, partner, pet, domicile, hobby, etc. was going to help for long. It’s taken a long time for me to be willing to even look at that head-on.    Taking the new actions to re-train my brain, the changed actions that will lead to changed thoughts and eventually changed feelings, is suuuuper uncomfortable at times. (Try looking in the mirror and saying out loud ‘I am part of the universe and I am loved’. Uuugghghgg. I had to start by doing it with the light off.) But I’m finally feeling real benefits, so I’m going to keep going. I mean, I’m still visiting this sub, so I ain’t doin it perfectly, but turns out that’s ok so long as I’m willing to keep trying.",False,False

And those who have more hardships to deal with in their life are not necessarily unhappier.,False,False
