I made some vegan banana walnut muffins the other day for my vegan friend and calculated the calories, turns out that recipe is 337 cal for 100g and those muffins weight about 160g. Dunno if that helps you in any way but it works for me ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è",False,False

I went vegetarian at age 12, a few years before my ED started. So I try not to judge too harshly. For me veganism was definitely part of the ED; I respect that for others it MIGHT not be, but would be more convinced if it had started far pre-ED.  Also, recovery is hard and you can't expect people to do it all at once, right? I figure it doesn't matter too much what you eat as long as you eat enough to gain (if needed) so if people want to eat enough vegan food to gain, cool. I'm a firm believer in people finding their own paths, I guess.",False,False

There is so many recovery instagrams I follow that I suspect are still actively trying to lose weight! I think Veganism kinda allows you to still have massive rules and restrictions around food (and satisfy that part of ur brain) while eating larger amounts of food. So in that sense it‚Äôs actually pretty good for recovery .   I went vegan initially to lose weight,  but I‚Äôve always had moral objections to eating meat. Actually, in my worst phases of anorexia I just went back to being vegetarian, eating dairy and eggs bc often the products with the lowest amount of calories for the best taste had those in them (halo top, cottage cheese, hot choc powder etc)  But yah I do agree veganism and eating disorders must have some high af correlation rates ",False,False
