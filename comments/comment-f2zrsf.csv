Boredom/emotions are a big cause of snacking, and water can replace that kind of feeling and make you feel fuller. To help, you can steep tea and have big tea jugs orr there are super fun water flavourings you can buy at grocery stores that are 0cal but make water taste more funky fun :)  Please don't use this as a replacement of eating though!! Just when you feel like the snacking is out of control.  Another tip as well, if you live on your own/have the choice, get rid of snacky foods that aren't filling or make you feel bad because if they aren't around, you can't snack on em,  One final one, pick up a new hobby!! If you like instruments or drawing, taking walks, anything like that, do that to distract yourself from boredom hunger because you won't be bored anymore! Sometimes we eat because we don't have anything else to do, so doing something is (surprise) a way to curve that!",False,False

Experiment with different options till you find one that works for you. Mine is diced green apples, diced kosher pickles, soaked in pickle juice. And oranges. Either while or pre peel them and divvy them up into snack bags. It satisfies that sweet salty cronch craving.",False,False
