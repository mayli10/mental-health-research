I feel like a failure if I eat 1200 Cal because that's what society deems as minimally normal. That is despite the fact that I don't fit the description of someone who that is recommended for (I'm taller and get a fair amount of activity in ever day)  But here's the thing:  1. 1200 is for a sedentary small woman to lose weight. If you're taller, more active, or a man you should be eating at least 1500 cal and still lose weight.   2. Fasting is another thing that I don't really want to discuss, but basically 1-3 day fast can be ok if you're not below a bmi of like 21 and you're eating normally (as in maintenance or close) on days around it.   3. The 800 Cal diets are just exactly what you said- doctor prescribed. A doctor prescribes antibiotics when someone is sick or insulin for a diabetic. Just because it was prescribed to that person doesn't mean it's safe for *you*. And the 800 cal diets are probably also being monitored by a doctor to make sure they're still getting nutrients and are healthy.   4. Then there's the issue that just because someone is posting in a not explicitly disordered sub and/or doesn't know they're disordered does not mean they're NOT disordered. Having an ED you can rationalize a lot of unhealthy behavior and make it sound pretty normal. What's not normal is the obsession and distress you have. That's not going to be clear from someone's public post.   In summary: Eating &lt;1200 Cal EVERY DAY is not normal or healthy behavior. Please be safe and make sure you're getting enough nutrients in your diet. And remember it's ok to eat more, especially if you are not feeling well.",False,False

I'm definitely not a professional, but in my opinion people on 1200isplenty and people with eating disorders tend to ""play it safe"" by underestimating their TDEE to make sure they lose weight. Even going so far as assuming a 100% sedentary lifestyle or using their BMR instead of TDEE. Some very short comatose women may be fine on a 1200-a-day diet, but for anyone else it's not really. The cookie cutter estimate of a 2000 - 2500 calories TDEE for the average person isn't too far off for most people, especially considering that when you eat sufficiently you tend to have more energy to be moderately active instead of lying in bed feeling faint all day.  I'm male so I'll admit that my TDEE may be higher than for women but I'm slightly under average height and well under average weight and I find that I can maintain at 2500 and lose weight at &lt;2000. I lose weight very rapidly if I manage 1200 - 1500 per day, but restricting like that for a long time is hard and leaves me too tired to do anything active. Also ultimately leads to binges.  1200 is what most people would consider extreme dieting for rapid weightloss and not meant to be sustainable in the long run. Definitely not ""plenty"", but fine if you want to lose weight fast without being actually starving. In barely any situation is &lt;1200 healthy for an extended period of time. Sure, people on My 600lbs Life are often put on a 1000-a-day diet but they're literally so obese that they're going to die if they don't lose weight ASAP.  This is a sanity reminder for myself as well because my ED makes me feel like a weak-willed pig if I go over 800-1000 a day, which I almost always do anyway because binges. ðŸ™ƒ",False,False

But sending love 1200 is not that good. Don't put a cal limit or any numbers or a label on something cuz you know that's the thing that fucks us up. so just eat and listen to your body. (btw for their ""normal diet"" all them articles are for the clicks and money. because people with out ed's they see those diets as yo yo diets).",False,False
