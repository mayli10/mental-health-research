It makes sense, im sure everyones experience is different but when a friend of mine went through treatment she couldn't hold down solids. So she just drank her calories all the time with meal replacement stuff.   Chemo is no joke, its literally so crazy to think about what it is and that we actually use it as a medical treatment. Metal AF.   Water weight is rough. :( Thank goodness its over! ",False,False

I have one photo of myself sitting in a wheelchair and it makes me cringe how puffy and swollen I was. It was insane. I lumbered around like a ghoul, struggling under the weight of my legs and couldn't fit in any pants except my dad's sweat pants. My face was noticeably more puffy than it ever was but it was just oodles and oodles of water weight. ",False,True

People think it's all over when you're in remission, but they ignore the mental side of an illness. Hugs to you!  Ps: your smile is adorable!",False,False

Some of my closest friends have been through that shit and it's hell in every way.   From what I've seen, EDs are even more taboo for people who've been though cancer because there's so much pressure to be ""thriving"" in remission. I'm sorry you're in that situation. Feel free to vent here anytime.",False,False
