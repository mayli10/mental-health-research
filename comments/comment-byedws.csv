I've been in and out of therapy for the past few years and it's hit or miss.  Then again, I always asked them not to discuss the ED.  I am on antidepressants, which help with anorexia.  From what you've described, I think I do something similar to help with irrational anxiety, but I have never applied it to the ED.",False,True

I've found it a really powerful tool in helping with my irrational thoughts. The basic premise is that you acknowledge that thoughts are just thoughts, they're not facts. You acknowledge that you are having the thought that you feel like you don't deserve food. But it's just a thought, it's not truth. I'm probably explaining it badly... let me know if you're interested and I'll try to find some of my old online resources",False,False

I know that 2,000 calories is the daily recommended intake for a woman.  I know that a BMI of 20-21 is healthy.  I know that a person cannot live forever without food.  None of this is rational nor healthy.  But I can't stop it.  I feel like I don't deserve food.",False,True

In fact, most women need more than that. Read this:  [https://fitfolk.com/average-calories-burned-per-day-men-women/](https://fitfolk.com/average-calories-burned-per-day-men-women/)   Yeah!
