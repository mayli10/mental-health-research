I also mostly eat plant based so upping protein should help. And luckily tofu is a very safe food - definitely gonna stock up!  My hair gets super knotty at night, so I'll make sure to do a little braid tonight. Very little cause my braids just look like rat tails at this point :(",False,True

Nothing really worked for me other than upping my caloric intake (basically, recovery) - think of it as your body giving you a signal. For me, the dreadful hair loss was the only thing that forced me to recover - not losing my period, not feeling cold all the time, not even chest pain. One year later, my hair is thinner than it used to me, but it's gradually getting its volume back :) For now, I would suggest getting it cut shorter and babying it as much as possible. It will get better!",False,False

Too much biotin can cause you to break out (at least it did for me) and non of those stupid hair products work. I drink half of a  Muscle Milk Light which is 10g of protein and 50cals for half. Tofu, eggs, cheese (non dairy is way less cals, nuts (not always a safe food :-(, are all really good sources and not horrible calorie wise. If you eat meat chicken breast and salmon are good too and you could prolly just bake it in the oven with non stick cooking spray.   I still eat about 1000 cals a day and could eat way less calorie wise and still be at 30-40g of protein which has reeaaally helped my hair.  On a high restriction day I’ll have:  Half protein shake: 50 cals 10g protein   Hard boiled egg: 70 cals 6g  Tofu veggie stir fry: 4 oz of firm tofu is 100 cals and depending on how much veggies and soy sauce you use it should be around 200cals for 9g, and a few more from the veggies but not a ton.   That’s 320 cals for 24g of protein and lots of dairy/non dairy low fat ice creams have a good amount of protein in them and range from 180-300 cals.   Tip about the stir frys: Any thing you make in a non stick pan basically doesn’t need any oil. I just dry fry or use a splash of veg broth if it does stick!   Also lightly brush your hair before you shower, especially if it’s curly/thick. I used to just use a wide tooth comb in the shower to detangle with conditioner but chunks would come out. Always brush from bottom to top and hold the middle while going up so you’re not ripping your hair out.   I try to keep my hair French braided so it’s less tangly especially over night. And then you have really night wavy hair the next day! Just be gentle when taking out the hair ties.  Scrunches are better than elastics as far all hair loss when taking it out of a pony tail or bun and microfiber towels are just all around better for drying your hair.   Okay I didn’t mean to write this much but the same happened to me and I was freaking the fuck out and it made my depression really bad so I wanna try to help the best I can!",False,False
