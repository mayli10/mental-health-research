Emailed an eating disorder organisation in the middle of the trip.,False,False

But then I sober up and change my mind seeing whatever I ate while I was high.  I hope you can find some peace. FWIW I have found CBD can help with it a little (just the anxiety/other thinking) without feeling dependent on weed or risking other mental health issues.",False,False

Just to be able to sit in quietness and think normally without any obsessive behavior or anxiety; To simply live life like it was intended and just relax. It’s been a long time since I’ve felt that way. Made me realize how much I miss it.",False,False

For just like an hour or so I’m happy and think I look beautiful and appreciate how I look. In those times I’m even kind to myself. Wish I could have that without a substance.,False,False

It sucks and I’m sorry you feel this way too. Sending love your way ❤️,False,False

What I'm about to describe is my experience only and I dont necessarily reccomend it. My GP suggested I try microdosing shrooms to help my depression. I tried a bit last night and while I wasnt high, for a brief moment I felt comfortable in my own body. I was relaxed and just felt regular. I'm like is this how normal people feel in their bodies all the time?!? I just felt like a woman sitting on her bed on her phone, nothing bad about it at all. It was just a few minutes of feeling sorta outta my body but not in a trippy way. But it removed my self judgment for a bit and I saw myself as a normal woman. Not a fat woman, not a sausage overstuffed and full of rolls. I live in the midwest and I see fat people all the time, it's kinda normalized. I didnt see my fat, i felt like a whole person.",False,False
