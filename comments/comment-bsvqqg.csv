The body has a regulated system to determine which tissues are built with the calories.  Some tissues are ugly, like fat, some are more desirable, like muscles or joints. When you exercise, the muscles and joints that are worked will be prioritized for tissue building. For muscle, this is called *muscle protein synthesis*. MPS is triggered by stressing a muscle through use, specifically resistance training.  So I after a nice solid weightlifting session, MPS peaks, and the food I eat (almost 1lb straight chicken breast) is more likely to be applied to muscle than be stored as fat.",False,False

Seriously, eat before that. Itâ€™s dumb as fuck and terrifying and  every time I would end a fast I would swear I would never do it again but itâ€™s so addicting.
