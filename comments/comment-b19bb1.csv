I'm in competition with myself to see how much and for how long I can restrict. And how much I can binge. And then it's a gamble ""bet you'll relapse on purging like the dumb bitch you are!""

It’s like a stupid competitive game with my best friend, who is actually my enemy. But calling my ED a friend is crazy, but also... not wrong in how I treat it. Idk it’s so fucking weird.",False,False
