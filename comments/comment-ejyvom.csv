I remember the first time I cried in a dressing room and I remember what it was over. A shirt that in retrospect only looked bad on me because it was incredible ugly. It was brown with gold accents and stretchy but also not fitted like WHY DID ANYBODY MAKE IT but it was during my first attempt to get clothes that weren’t for kids and I just couldn’t figure it out.  Clothing shopping can be so awful and sizes are the worst. I can never tell if having other people there is better because they can say nice things to you or worse because then you’re Seen.  Hope you managed to find something you like.,False,False
