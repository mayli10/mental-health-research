When I was at my LW I asked my mom to buy powerade zero and she came back with normal powerade. I was unable to get out of bed, so weak, and just wanted my safe drink... I was so angry and disappointed but also really mad at myself",False,False

If it’s not *exactly* the thing I want then why would I eat it???  I think when your life revolves around food (you’re literally denying yourself a basic human right?!) it’s perfectly reasonable to want whatever tiny treat you allow yourself to be something you actually like. Bless her she was trying to do something nice for you but you absolutely shouldn’t feel bad for being disappointed or upset",False,False

eebs9k4,t3_ah5q8s,t3_ah5q8s,OkWorking7,1,2019-01-17 21:40:00,/r/EDAnonymous/comments/ah5q8s/im_so_ungrateful_and_i_hate_it/eebs9k4/,Ugh that is the absolute worst. The feeling of disappointment because you didn’t get what you asked for and were looking forward to. The feeling of guilt because the other person tried to do something nice and you feel ungrateful because they got it wrong. The feeling of shame because you feel like if it wasn’t for this ED you wouldn’t care that they got it wrong but you feel like you literally can’t eat what they bought. With a nice little panic attack thrown in because you’re experiencing so many intense emotions over something that seems so objectively trivial.  I have totally been there more than once. It sucks :(,False,False
