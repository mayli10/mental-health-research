I'm frankly somewhat agog, nigh speechless. I don't think you'll be offended if I say I sympathize… you're not throwing a pity party here, merely… testifying from the front lines of some low-key warzone. From an adjoining foxhole I send you an empathetic hollah… Wishing you awareness and strength.",False,False

It's hard to rationalize because it seems like a lot of internet strangers but it's true, we all look out for each other since it's not something that others can easily sympathize with. Please try to look after yourself and show your body a little bit of love, it's hard but it's necessary and even though the high from restricting is so so so tempting, it's not worth your life. I'll be rooting for you and I hope you can find something that can help you see that your body is worth keeping alive. Shoot me a DM if you need somebody to talk to",False,False
