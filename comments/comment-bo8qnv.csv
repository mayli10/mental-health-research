I saw a lot of posts on here after the Met Gala photo of Emily Ratajkowski's (sp?) stomach talking about how much they hated themselves for not looking like her. But on the r/instagramreality there is a candid (i.e., not posed) photo of her that shows that while she is certainly very slim, her stomach does not look like that unless she breathes in/sucks her stomach in. It breaks my heart that so many people on here had such an intensely negative reaction to something that even a woman like her doesn't have.",False,False
