It all just feels wrong and the facts feel very stigmatized. I personally wish that they didnt get so involved in these kinds of things. Plus it’s like i finally get my mind off of everything that’s going on and into the groove of work and then i see a brochure or hear someone mention something and it makes me start thinking about it all over again. It’s just stressful. ,False,True
