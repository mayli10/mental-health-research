My belly is loose from 2 huge pregnancies and when I eat anything (even a regular meal) my belly sticks out from the muscles having been stretched out. Once I poop, or first thing in the morning, it's flat again. When I go to the bathroom, I always liken it to giving birth, as gross as that it is.",False,False

I like feeling like I'm not a freak for not having a flat stomach. It would probably bother me if people said joked about that while they do have a flat stomach though. but I've never encountered that in person,False,False

I'm bloated every day I eat (and sometimes on days I don't eat because stress and some drinks bloat me too) so normalizing it makes me feel better... if I eat out with friends and i start puffing up really bad, it calms me to make a joke out of it like ""haha i've got such a food baby right now"". Of course i'm self conscious about my stomach, but making a joke about it makes me look like i'm confident about it. and it's a healthier thing for me to say than ""god I feel like a fucking whale right now"" which is what I really want to say. lol. nobody wants to hear that though.",False,False

Eating so much that you feel uncomfortable or sick is not something to be proud of. I hate people who BRAG about how much they can eat in one sitting. Being able to eat a lot is not a positive personally quirk.,False,False
