Realised that it's not worth buying fresh strawberries when the frozen ones taste way better and are cheaper anyway.   I'm so sorry for being kinda nitpicky but you could probably make your own frozen dinners for wayy cheaper. I've noticed brands like Lean Cuisine just use a small portion size and cut out fats and that would be easy and cheap to do in your own kitchen. And ngl, they'll be tastier. ",False,False

A tip on frozen fruit though; the 2 kg bags sell for $11 here (I'm Canadian) which works out to be fairly cheap per serving if you stretch it out over two weeks by having a 150 g (~80 cal) serving every day. ,False,False
