I spent $50 last weekend on it. Saturday’s are my worst days cause I sit here all day bored especially when he leaves for work.   I have 2 1/2 month old baby so I don’t wanna pack her up just to get food. Car seats are fucking heavy.   I looked at door dash today, they added Portillos. I. Love. Portillos.   I’m just gonna sit here and think about it now. Cause I wanna binge but I finally got out of the 180s this morning. So it’s keeping motivated to not eat.",False,False
