The only way to get over a fear is to expose yourself to it. Your dietician is going to ask you to eat every food that you fear and hate, and they wonâ€™t believe you if you say your dislike of the food is unrelated to your eating disorder. They will give you more than you think you can handle but they  are medical professionals who took an oath to do no harm.   Please listen to your doctors and keep eating. Itâ€™s the hardest thing anyone can ask of you right now, I know, but itâ€™s worth it. You have to physically heal your body with proper nourishment before you can heal your mind. Stay strong, lovely one.",False,False
