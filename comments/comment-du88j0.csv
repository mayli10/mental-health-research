I've lost 60kg (Idk about pounds sorry) and while I'm still at the low end of being overweight I feel like I've lost nothing. There is floppy skin everywhere. I feel so ugly and disgusting it's unreal. Sadly I won't get rid of it until I can get surgery but therefor I have to be extremely lucky and also keep my weight down for 2 to 3 years. Otherwise insurance will not cover it. I hate it so much.,False,False

I’m 5’1 so losing and regaining the same 50 lbs brings me from normal to obese weight, and I’ve been doing that for like 15 years. My skin is sad.

I have 75kg between my (morbidly obese) high weight and (drastically underweight) low weight. I’ve cycled all over the place within that range and my skin is loose and riddled with stretch marks.

And BACK to obese this year (although not morbidly, just 1 point over on the bmi) and back down now to a normal weight.   So my skin is FUCKED.
