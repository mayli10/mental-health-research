Itâ€™s all very delicate. Having too much magnesium, potassium, and calcium (youâ€™ll be okay, weâ€™re talking about very high amounts) can interfere with the contractile signals of the sinoatrial node of the heart and can cause heart failure. So too can lacking these nutrients.

Just some information I thought was worth sharing.   Hope youâ€™re okay!",False,False
