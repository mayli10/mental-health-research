From my experience, as kids get a bit older they start to phase out of eating lots and lots of junk and appreciate larger and more nutritious meals a bit more. He could just be a late bloomer, if he hasn't had any health problems related to malnourishment. Perhaps bring it up with whichever adult is the main caretaker of him/ makes food and tell them your concerns? If you have already done that too, then I'm fresh out of ideas",False,False

It’s also affected his growth. My older brother and dad are both 6’3 and I’m 5’11 my self, but my younger brother is really short compared to what my older brother and I were at his age.",False,False

Frame it as ""you're active and I bet you'll do even better at *insert sport* if your body had some nutritious food in it!"" And like try to emphasize that he can eat unhealthy foods also, just that he should try to add some more nourishing foods in! Offer to make some for him in a way that would be tasty rather than bland (sometimes that is the issue)",False,False

He’s 12 and still growing so he can literally devour so much food and not gain any weight. But he eats sooo badly, I can’t remember the last time I saw him eat a vegetable. And it just hurts me, don’t really know why. It’s really irrational, since he’s no where overweight and he’s very active. But still I have this fear of him becoming overweight or something like that.",False,False

I want to try to help them and help them eat healthier (i can barely eat normally but thats my superiority complex talking) because I know they get down on themselves but i dont know how to do so without it sounding like ""hey you're fat lets change"" yknow? i just dont want them to have health complications in the future if they dont change their eating habits",False,False
