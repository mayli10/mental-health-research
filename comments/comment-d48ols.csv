I’m getting checkups every 2 weeks by the university medical center, am going to be seeing a nutritionist available at my college, and am looking into campus support groups.  If you don’t think that’s enough, idk about where you live, but I know in my city, there’s a treatment facility that offers limited intensive outpatient treatment.  Three times a week, 4:30-7pm. There may be programs like that in your city, so do some research and see what’s available.  All things aside, I totally get being scared of dropping out so early.  I had to leave college twice for medical complications that prevented me from going to classes.  If it does come to that, keep in mind that it doesn’t mean you failed.  It means you are being mindful and prioritizing your health and your future.  You can always go back to college, but you can’t reverse organ damage or failure.  Take care of yourself ❤️",False,False

Maybe look into that? You could also see if there’s like an outpatient program or something that you could do while still staying in school, but if you’re very unwell then it might be difficult to balance both treatment and school.",False,False

I'm pretty sure I'm at risk for refeeding syndrome and I've probably fucked up my body in some other ways I don't even realize. And I'm going to have to gain weight, which is virtually impossible with all the walking I do just to get around to my classes. Plus having to prepare my own meals on a regular basis and be completely responsible for my own intake. It seems impossible to do while I'm here by myself.",False,True

Depending on the size of your university, most universities will offer counseling at a pretty cheap rate. I had (to my knowledge) unlimited appointments with our counseling services at $15 per appointment, although with the size of the student body it wasn't always easy to get consistent, frequent appointments. My friend, on the other hand, just moved to DC for grad school and her university is much smaller than where we went to undergrad, so she was surprised to find out she could only do 6 appointments at her campus; they do, however, help their students get set up with an off-campus therapist if they need more than 6 appointments.  If you go to your university's website, you can probably find a page about the health services and they might have info on counseling there!",False,False
