I remember my first purge. 7 years layer, and I am about to purge again in a few minutes. 2 years worth of treatment centers, thousands of dollars for treatment or bing food... just stop now. This is absolute hell.",False,False

I'm also glad you don't want it to become a habit. I purge semi-regularly (unfortunately, a few times per month), and every time I feel a massive amount of regret and fear about my overall health and (more cosmetically) my teeth. I've noticed lately that my heart rate is erratic and my chest hurts during the day.   There are days where I lose weight after purging and I recognize that as reinforcement to the negative behavior. I don't know how to make that stop but usually it is just water weight. And realistically, losing a little bit of weight is not justified by the obvious damage this habit is doing to my body. I don't know what to do but I'm trying really hard to stop the habit and I'd definitely recommend that you also try to quell the urge. I'm so sorry that you were successful in purging for the first time.",False,False
