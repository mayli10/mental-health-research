Good call to give up on them. It's like playing chess with a pigeon: they'll shit all over the board and strut around like they won. If you want intellectual vigor, talk to a professional with a background in a hard science. You'll notice those kinds of people aren't in groups like that. All we can do is try to communicate good information to them in the simplest way possible.",False,False

I'm not going to tell someone that their opinion is wrong if I haven't even investigated it. It's not my fault that their ""research"" was hippie pseudoscience bullshit. You're right, they have definite answers for everything. God forbid you tell them that what they are arguing is too ""black and white"" or you fundamentally disagree. I got called a ""bimbo"" for disagreeing with them once, it's clear they can only tolerate those who affirm their beliefs. If you aren't once of these people, they call you names and spam you with articles from sources that are the furthest thing from reputable. It's just like antivaxxers. I give up honestly.",False,True

Even mental health diagnosis are just labels for collections of behaviors, the scientific body of knowledge doesn't presently describe their origin (that's why there isn't a test you can send off to a lab for a mental health diagnosis).   Sounds like your dialogue partner got into some anti-vaxing community or something. If you talk to anyone who knows their shit with physiology they'll tell you we understand very little of the total picture. The body and the organism are insanely complex and resist reductionist descriptions.",False,False

It seems pretty obvious that sexual trauma/emotional abuse and things like that play a role in lots of people. No one in my family has food or metabolic issues and mine came right after trauma so it seems like the simplest explanation.,False,False
