Unkind words from a relative are a source for my DIL. Looks like your family, too. People say the dumbest things! Talking about another‚Äôs size or what they eat is definitely off limits. I‚Äôm sorry for your pain. Stay strong. Look for as many positive places for help as you can find. There are some Anorexia recovery blogs that might be a positive help to you.   You are human. Each day we can start again. Maybe sharing some of the blog stories would help dad understand. Making him understand that this disease could kill you, so quit pointing the verbal gun your way. . . . . . .   You are not alone. Be kind to yourself. ü§óü§óü§ó",False,False
