All cameras have lens distortion and those lens distortions typically make things look larger and bigger. It is due to the way camera lenses work. This also goes for video cameras. They tend to make things in the center of the image bigger than they are, and they also distort shapes as well.   So, in short, we all look bigger on camera...it is not just a saying, but a fact. So don't beat yourself up too hard because of how you look on a camera that is built to distort you.",False,False
