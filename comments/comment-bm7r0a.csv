eut9p2c,t3_bm7r0a,t3_bm7r0a,stoned-tea,1,2019-07-24 21:39:51,/r/EDAnonymous/comments/bm7r0a/does_anyone_else_just_feel_like_theyre_not_made/eut9p2c/,I feel like this is a very relatable feeling to anyone with a mental illness. Idk if this will help anyone else but there’s a song by The Beach Boys called “I Just Wasn’t Made for These Times” that I’m obsessed with. It’s truly a work of art musically and it comforts me to know that someone as influential as Brian Wilson felt the exact way I do but only in the 60s. Here’s a video link to the song if anyone is interested.   [The Beach Boys - I Just Wasn’t Made For These Times ] (https://youtu.be/NR7_TbMIVnA),False,False

Being a naturally sensitive person and having to deal with people criticizing me, shaming me, and pushing me around for it too, damaged my mental health pretty severely.   Now I realize that the problem isn't me, the problem is that we live in a culture that often praises callousness. Even from childhood we're taught to suppress emotions because they're an inconvenience to the adults around us.  I understand resilience is important to have in this world, but I don't think it's necessary to shun all displays of sensitivity either. Vulnerability can be beautiful and it helps to cultivate an element trust between people.    Anyway, I still feel like an outsider most of the time. My empathy gets me into trouble because I realize that most don't have as much as I do. Yet I still expect people to treat me with the same kindness as I do them, it's always been my downfall and it's always caused me pain.   At least I can say I don't feel guilty for it anymore. Sensitivity is a beautiful thing. Yes I feel negative emotions really intensely and it hurts more than I could ever convey with words, but I also feel so full of wonder and joy at times that it brings me to tears.   We may be few, but we are here. You're not alone, I promise. ❤",False,False
