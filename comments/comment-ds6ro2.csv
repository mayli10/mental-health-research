I have almost the same fucking stats as her and no, that's not physically possible I know she doesn't get a period because she's so tiny and I barely have mine.",False,False

At one point I was really obese and did a full fast, including restricting fluids (DO NOT DO; DO NOT RECOMMEND), and I lost the better part of 30 lbs in two weeks.  The bigger you are, the higher your base metabolism and the more stored water you have, the faster you lose weight initially",False,False

But if she did a full on fast (water and 0 cal beverages only) It is completely possible. People often can average out to losing 1lb a day between actual fat loss, weight from having no food/waste in their system, and water weight.  That said, it is only even remotely safe of you have the fat stores for your body to run off of. And you have to be careful with electrolytes etc.",False,False
