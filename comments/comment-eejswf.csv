I took 60mg of concerta while drinking because I usually want to eat EVERYTHING when I’m drunk and I ended up eating nothing (even when food was offered to me) but also acting tweak-y and didn’t sleep that night. It was too much.  Then I took 40mg aderall (also while drinking) and I felt very high energy while drunk but also had NO appetite and didn’t eat for 24 hours because I literally just did not feel hungry. So I’d say do small doses and be careful if you like uppers because it’s cheap and an addictive fun high,False,False

To avoid the post stimulants binge I HAVE to eat something small while on it. The bright side is that it really does reduce your hunger and also makes most food disgusting so it is a lot easier to not eat. I take 40 mg Vyvanse and 10 mg adderall as a booster.,False,False
