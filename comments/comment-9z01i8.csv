I was gonna call it â€˜how to have your cake and eat it tooâ€™   I spent a long time thinking I could have my cake and eat it. I could eat whatever I wanted and not gain weight like Iâ€™d beat the system. But bulimia ended up destroying me physically and financially and the addiction grew and grew. So I guess you canâ€™t have your cake and eat it but also I thought the common saying and reference to cake also made it pretty apt for a bulimia memoir ðŸ˜‚,False,False
