Malls are sensory overload (bright lights, blasting music, lots of people). Can you go somewhere else to distract yourself from the urges... Sit in a park/ your car and read/ smoke/ vape/ play games on your phone? Go into Starbucks for a drink? Or if there's a nail place in the mall, get your toenails painted? Literally anything",False,False

I realise it’s not worth it. My entire body will hurt the next day and I don’t want that. I’ll be bloated and I don’t want that. I could gain weight and I don’t want that. I’ll feel overwhelming guilt and shame and disgust and sadness and anxiety, and I don’t want any of that. Eating all of the food I want in that moment is not worth the pain.   I’m not sure how helpful this is, I haven’t struggled too much with bingeing and we’re all different, but when I do get those urges this works for me.",False,False
