I felt awful but we also didn't have any freezer space to keep them. I feel like I'm either eating everything in sight or I can't force myself to even eat things I specifically made to be low-calorie.,False,False

It helps too since if I only make one portion and then wash the pan before I eat, Iâ€™m not gonna wanna cook and do it all again for more lol... I was doing that but I got super lazy about it. I need to do better. In my defense, I stopped being able to walk(but I have what I call my leg exoskeletons now so I am able to cook most of the time since I can stand and walk a little bit, as long as itâ€™s nothing heavy like a turkey, Iâ€™m just lazy af and self sabotaging lol).  But seriously, I wanna start buying cheaper fresh stuff because it is so much cheaper and I ainâ€™t rich lol. I canâ€™t afford to eat 6 TV dinners in one sitting every 4 days   For me cereal and anything salty or cheesy like chips and dip are dangerous. I go through them so fast.",False,True

Ie, Iâ€™ll buy vegetables in their purest form, so they need to be prepared. Raw quinoa. Green af bananas. Raw or frozen meats. Raw oats. Flour and yeast that I have to make into bread. Nothing I can monch out of a bag, etc. Usually the only things that are readily edible are apples and yogurt, neither of which is that terrible for you nor do I really binge on.   This is beneficial for 2 reasons: 1, the ingredients are cheaper raw and unprocessed, and 2, they will actually make it to meals days later.   The dangerous ones are cereal and peanut butter so I have to exercise serious control around them. And I cannot allow myself to buy crackers under any circumstances, which is a pity.",False,False

Especially if I got something new to try. It's like a switch flips and I either eat it ALL when I get home, so like 3-4 different meals in one day, because suddenly everything is new and exciting and I want to try (and finish) it all, OR it takes me months to eat them because I'm scared of wasting calories on new food if it's no good.
