We went climbing and I gave him the ring box that had a lock on in (Originally I wasn't going to give him the box and I'd just be on one knee when he got the key from the top of a climb but we ended up having to go during the busy period of the gym and he hates being the centre of attention). To give him the key we played a climbing game where you pick a route and each climb and subract a hold until one person can't climb it anymore. On my last move I left the key on a chain on the final hold. He climbed it and then we had a coffee together at the gym cafe (I had a skim cappuchino even though I couldn't purge!) and I did the actual proposal. We both cried a little but no one knew what was going on. It was awesome!,False,True

Did a bit of binging but basically pushed the proper hands-of-the-wheel-loss-of-control for after my fiance (squee) went to bed.   Got to have my cake and eat it too. Then purge it because, like, cake.",False,True

But maybe just take 2 different days this week? Like, Friday is ""cheat day"" and Saturday is binge day? That way you can stop thinking about Friday, just go with the flow, and do your usual b/p activities on Saturday?   It's a really special occasion, and the best thing would be anything that you don't have to think about. I know thoughts don't work that way.   Sorry it sucks.",False,False

He knows about my binging and knows it'll be a part of the day. I just wish I could stop ruminating on the binging and focus on the proposal for like a second.   Particularly as a lot of the ruminating is anxiety that I won't get to binge as much as I want or I won't purge in time.,False,True

Honestly, I keep the same schedule sometimes. But I am wondering...can you change your binge day to Saturday this week? I don't think Thursday would be good cause then you'd have binge/booze hangovers.",False,False
