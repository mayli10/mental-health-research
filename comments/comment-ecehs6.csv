It's good to rip some of that shame away.   For what it's worth, I dropped out and started working because it actually helped me regain a sense of responsibility and helped me get better. I still worry over it loads (especially now that I want toove career paths) but I did manage to work my way up to senior level in an industry to the point that nobody cared about my degree and my experience spoke for itself, so it is possible to move past it.",False,False

I didn‚Äôt mean this as a positive or ‚Äúcool‚Äù thing, I‚Äôm embarrassed and stressed out about my education. I just wanted to commiserate with people in the same situation. Ultimately my situational is fixable and I‚Äôll be right back at it again next semester.   There‚Äôs nothing wrong with taking longer, I hope you are happy with and proud of your degree once you get it, it‚Äôs such a struggle to handle school alongside mental health problems.",False,True

It's not something to have solidarity over, or to accept as a reasonable outcome. I don't want to bump fists for ruining my chance to go to a reputable university debt-free, without having to work full time. Now as an adult, I have to work full time at a low-wage job while also going to school full time, and while I have to pay rent and bills, I have to pay my way through Community College. What's supposed to be a two-year Associates Degree is now a seven years in progress Associates Degree. Don't be like me. Don't make your failure a joke or try to form a pity party to feel better about it. Leave college and work on yourself so you're able to function properly. Without that you'll never be able to complete or commit to anything.",False,False

I hope things are a bit easier for you next semester.",False,False
