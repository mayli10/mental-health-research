And needing to make sure you have a specific article of clothing that you don't often wear in a size and style that fit and flatter is super normal. What you eat, how you move/exercise, and hormones can all completely change how clothes fit; what used to fit you perfectly might not look the same a couple months later even at the same weight.   So if someone makes a comment like that again, you could try to play it off as you just don't wear that often, so you aren't sure how it fits.   If you aren't too many sizes away from your old clothes, you could try things like belts? Or you could learn to sew, if you have the time. (I'm getting a sewing machine just so I don't have to worry about making clothes smaller, and if necessary I can make my own clothes.)",False,False
