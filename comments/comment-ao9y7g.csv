I started purging two years ago because it made me feel like I’m in control, and now I can barely go a day without doing it. I’ve fucked my entire body up because of this, my teeth literally hurt all the time, and I have heart problems now. it’s not worth it, it’s not worth all the bad that happens because of it.
