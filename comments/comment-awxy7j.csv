Lol!!!’   Usually people KNOW diet and exercise are the keys to loosing weight but they don’t want to have to do what it takes to loose weight/eat healthier. I have found that joking about how ‘miserable’ it is confirms people’s beliefs and makes them feel more comfortable with their own eating routines (‘but I don’t want cauliflower! I want fun pizza!’),False,False
