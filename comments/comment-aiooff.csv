I don't have an eating disorder, but I have spent much of my life dealing with struggles trying to understand my own beliefs and views and how to change them and break unhealthy patterns of behavior. I found focusing on health as a lode stone intention (along with love) was a tremendous help. My actions observed with loving understanding, and assessed as ""is this healthy for me?""  My advice was very forward/directive, and I want to apologize for any offense as I am pretty ignorant on the topic. Sometimes the fool likes to speak about what he does not know. But I do stand by my beliefs, as they apply in general to a lot of different mental constructs that result in the physical manifestation of those beliefs and reward / punishments that our brain set up to achieve those values / beliefs.",False,False

It should no longer be the skinniest, or prettiest, but healthiest inside and out. Focus on nothing but being the healthiest, and youâ€™ll find you achieve a much happier stage of acceptance and love for yourself. Reframe your values of physicality, and you are more than your body. The mental constructs you have formed are unhealthy physically and mentally. They have trapped you in this cycle, because you are not able to let them go, but you are more than the idea of who you are, or the belief of who you are. Let those go, and focus on being a healthy person.  Healthy in body means proper eating if healthy foods. It means appropriate exercise and activity. Healthy in mind means self love. It means observing our mechanisms that drive our behaviors and beliefs about ourselves, and facing the with love and understanding instead of judgment and shame.   Change your mindset to an honest, objective definition of healthy. Trust that you will find a much happier and rewarding life by loving yourself as all shapes and sizes, and future you will thank current you to the ends of the earth for having started this journey.",False,False

I've been comparing myself to both ever since :):) to the point where I'm actually offended if there's a bit of nudity on something like I've turned in to such a child. And the other day my current SO liked a meme about Mia Khalifa so I've been obsessing over that for two days straight. ,False,False
