People openly posting about like 3 month water fasts?! Dry fasts?!   The most disturbing are the ones where people are obviously a lower weight and post about doing things like 7 day fasts.   Or the fact that most of them go on 7+ day (really anything past 3 day) fasts without consulting a doctor. Maybe you do have a lot of excess fat, but it doesn't mean you body doesn't need certain nutrients you only get from eating",False,False

They fall for pseudoscience like cleanses and similar dieting trends which lately involves fasting for days at a time. It's unhealthy to deprive your body of nutrients like that, but of course they've all read stuff claiming that it's okay and they believe it anyway. Their behaviour is definitely disordered, but they likely don't have eating disorders. They genuinely think they're doing something good for themselves.",False,False

Yes it kind of ruined my life because now I‚Äôm addicted to the euphoria of starving now but also struggle so so much to do that again. I get kind of annoyed when we all on this sub project so much hate onto the fasting subs. For some people they truly believe they‚Äôre being healthy because of all the recent research about fasting, doing it for spiritual reasons etc it‚Äôs such a big assumption on our part.   Final anecdote: when I‚Äôm at my most disordered I struggle to fast. I can‚Äôt leave my thoughts about food  enough to turn my attention elsewhere. End up binging and purging. When I‚Äôm more emotionally stable I‚Äôm actually able to do it. And after I did that first fast and a recent ish 5 day one I actually felt normal after it finished and ate food without binging for a bit only though lol",False,False

I also think lot of the weight loss subs contain *pretty* disordered rhetoric.  I think the difference is probably the mental and emotional aspect of it?
