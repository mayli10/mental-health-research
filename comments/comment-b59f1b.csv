Modern optical HR sensors (chest straps are even better) and algorithms for calculating calorie expenditure are pretty dang accurate. My Apple Watch and Garmin both come up with calorie expenditure numbers after a run that line up with lab values for similar efforts using direct calorimetry, and last time I checked the literature even portable gas analysers were ±15-20% or so. You definitely shouldn't eat back every calorie your Fitbit tells you you can, but they're nowhere near as inaccurate as you say.",False,False
