So on the first day after the fast, you really should only drink liquids like broth or coconut water. Then maybe on the second day you can try smoothies or thicker soups. By the third or fourth day, you should be pretty much okay to have regular food as long as you don't overeat too much.   Since you fasted for so long your body just couldn't handle eating solids even if it was just an apple. I would suggest just taking it slowly for a couple days, but I don't think you should be too concerned. Of course I'm not a doctor or anything so if you still can't keep food down after a few days please go talk to someone who can help.",False,False
