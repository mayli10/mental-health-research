We were in a gender studies class together our first semester, and I remember both sort of alluding to ~body shit~ during a small group discussion. Then my junior year, the time in college when my ED was the worst, we lived in the same dorm and ate in the same dining hall, and I remember seeing her get cup after cup of tea and getting thinner and thinner, and I wonder if she remembers me doing the same thing. Then we came back to school and she had gained some weight and smiled more and stood up straighter and stuff. I think she might have written something for our literary mag about her experiences with an ED. Anyway I really hope she’s doing well now!!!",False,False

I worked on a project with a girl - so skinny, and it is a year ago and she is still just as skinny. I hoped she would get help, someone close to her would do something, but no.
