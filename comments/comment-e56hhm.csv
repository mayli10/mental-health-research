Really the only way to know if it’ll help *you* is to try it and see. (Tracking mood/symptoms while adjusting meds helps me see what’s helping.)   It can be slow process with SSRIs because it takes 4-6 weeks to achieve max efficacy, and after that dose tweaking is sometimes needed. But there’s definitely hope. There are also other categories of meds that can be tried or used in combination. I know it can be really hard to hang on when the pain is so great and the help uncertain, but I hope you’ll give it a shot. &lt;3   I’ve had the best results combining meds and therapy since meds improve things by maybe 20% for me (which can still be life changing). They give me a boost so I can take the actions that help me move forward.",False,False
