Saying something like, “I need you to help me and this is the way I need you to help: by being aware but never commenting unless I ask for your input.”  Often times people are more willing to follow YOUR instructions than you think. This makes them feel valued by you, as well, so it can be a win-win.   Good luck with your struggles. It is brave of you to come this far.",False,False
