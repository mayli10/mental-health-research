I've lost a couple already. Telling myself ""if you eat it you purge it"" also helps cause I'm a lazy purger and it makes me gain.",False,False

I will err on the side of caution and eat less, if I don't know the calories of something. This is why I am never afraid of eating in restaurants, because 10 times out of 10 I will eat less overall - less in the meals leading up to it, and less at the restaurant itself. If someone said to me I had to eat pizza every day or I'd die, I'd eat a slice and probably call it x calories. X calorie allowance at home, I'll get my full calories worth.",False,False
