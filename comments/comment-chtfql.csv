My bestie and I only work (I think) because we‚Äôre pretty open with each other and because we aren‚Äôt easily triggered (typical triggers like seeing calories, bodies etc don‚Äôt bother us).

We never met IRL but we became pretty close while texting &amp; calling each other nearly every day for about a year.

Like a bumblebff for Ed's!     Like I just want someone to go to the mall, try on clothes with and bitch about vanity sizes, scrutinize nutrition labels and have circular and incessant conversations with about how many calories everything has.     But most importantly someone I can hang out with that let's me eat when and if and what I want to without making it a huge deal.

And I‚Äôve found a few friends online whom ended up becoming my ‚ÄúIRL‚Äù best friends. Obviously a few fizzled out, but my best friend I met on MPA, and we have a pretty cool dynamic where it‚Äôs not competitive or triggering for us (well obviously I can‚Äôt speak for her but we try to set rules/boundaries... and our triggers aren‚Äôt typical or hard to avoid) but we‚Äôve been able to talk candidly about our struggles. I really value having that, and I hope one day you can have a friend like this too- somebody who you can be 100% yourself with and you can talk to about weird ED stuff but still laughs at your farts and has girls nights out- or whatever nights you partake in!",False,False
