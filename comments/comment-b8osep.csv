Waking up super hungry and ravenous. Literally worst hunger pangs are at this time (mostly bc they happen when I’m restricting super heavy and sleep is HARD when I’m restricting) and then I’ll go eat bc my self control is GONE and I’m just starving. I usually won’t have a full blown “binge” though which is interesting. Like it feels like a binge in that it’s onset so quickly and im kinda dissociated due to being tired, but it’s usually no more than 500 cal. ",False,False

The past few nights I’ve had these and wake up horrified and then have to convince myself it was a dream and then I’m okay.  Idk why I’m telling you this but my specific dream last night was swallowing an everything bagel completely whole so it would fill my stomach.  Not gonna lie I woke up pretty satiated because of it lmao,False,False
