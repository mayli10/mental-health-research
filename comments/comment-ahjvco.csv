For me, when craving specific things I try to make the lowest calorie version I can while still meeting it. I've never had a binge, so I think my method is pretty successful. For example, fries? Oil-less sweet potato fries. Chocolate? Chocolate almond milk. Carbs in general? A small baked potato is okay without butter on it, just add plenty of seasonings, and get creative with it!    If it's hunger in general, drink lots of water, hot tea, and make sure the meals you do eat are large but low calorie. Fill up on the veggies, especially ones higher in iron, magnesium, and protein during this time of the month. ",False,False
