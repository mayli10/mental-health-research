When I was recovered and healthy I would watch vegan taste testing videos because some vegan food can taste like a flaming garbage can. Maybe you plan to try it but haven’t gotten the chance yet? Unless they’re dealing with an ED or have been with people that have an ED most ED behaviors go right over people’s heads.,False,False

My partner recently asked why I don't talk about my disorder very often so I've kind of allowed myself to open up a little more lately but I'm worried I'm freaking him out,False,False

But it does lend an opportunity to talk about your disordered behaviors with him. Maybe you can give it a try?,False,False
