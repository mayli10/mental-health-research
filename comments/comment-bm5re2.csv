When I start trying to maintain, I'll need the logging to help me keep on track. It's like I'm chained to it now. It's the only way I've ever been able to get get to a healthy weight in my adult life and it's probably the only way I'll be able to maintain properly. :'(   I also wish I could do it intuitively, easily. :'(",False,False

I’ve been in that three pound loop since January and when I’m at the bottom of that scale I am five pounds away from my newest gw (cos I hit the last one but ofc it eventually stopped being satisfying and I developed a new one). I consider if I could be okay maintaining in this loop forever and sometimes I think I can, but then I remember that that’s just the sweet siren song of mediocrity.   It just feels like stopping isn’t the alternative to continuing on.",False,False
