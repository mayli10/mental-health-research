I just cant seem to lose recently and I've been gaining and now maybe losing. In the moment food is so comforting--or at least it used to be. I find myself doing it even when I dont want to and it brings me no comfort. Just guilt and shame. ,False,False

I restrict eating, i lose weight, I look hotter. Other stuff I can work hard, and still not get the result I wanted because sometimes life is just like that. But the simple science of calories in vs calories out affecting weight is very easy to control.",False,False

This feels like something that is mine, something no one can take away from me. It soothes every hurt, anger, pain that I can’t bear to think about. Using ED behaviors feels like a fuck you to people I’m when I’m upset with them, even though they don’t know it’s happening and it only hurts me. It feels like it somehow balances out the pain. But the good feelings don’t last as long as the sadness, loneliness, and shame it spirals into. It’s the most empty, shallow gratification....and yet I cling to it so desperately. ",False,False

My life is chaos.   I have brain zaps from effexor even though I rarely if ever forget to take it. My doc wanted to put me on more, which I feel would just make things worse.   Everyone has someone to love them and take care of them but I'm so fat and ugly I will never find love. I spent all afternoon and evening alone with my thoughts. I was too negative and my sponsor didn't even want to talk to me.   My life is blowing up. I'm so alone and I have nothing to look forward to except more of the same.   If I was actively dieting I wouldnt be thinking of this. I would just be thinking about food instead of how terrible and hopeless my life is. If I was losing weight I'd feel proud of myself.   I wish I didnt eat today. I took my meds so I cant even purge. ",False,False
