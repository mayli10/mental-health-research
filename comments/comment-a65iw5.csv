I now just want to get back to my ultimate low weight (47kg) but I know that when I get there I'll want more. I'll try to reach 45kg just for the sake of it. And it's a round number!   But then, I will probably try and see how low I can get...? Let's see. I'm at 48-49 now so it's not a long way to go. ",False,False

It's crazy how our minds can easily be manipulated without us even realizing and feeling as though we are in control but in reality we aren't.,False,False
