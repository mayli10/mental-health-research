It has a tiny amount of calories, and it lets me keep going a while longer. I'll also have diet sodas, coffee, whatever. I don't get too hung up on what other people call breaking a fast or not. Hell, there are some people who put butter in their coffee and call it a fast. You do you.   (Added note if you're worried about insulin or whatever such tiny amounts of calories are extremely unlikely to spike it)",False,False
