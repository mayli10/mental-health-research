Iâ€™ve switched dentists a few times over the years, so I donâ€™t know if any of them knew, but one of my back molars had to be pulled because half of it chipped off and then was maybe getting infected. Apparently the same tooth on the other side has a giant cavity in it. New dentist said maybe it was damaged when I got my wisdom teeth out, but I wonder if itâ€™s from enamel loss. And then thereâ€™s the staining from so much coffee and Diet Coke over the years too ðŸ˜¬",False,False
