I don't experience increased hunger when taking them, unlike for example when I was on Zyprexa. You can always stop taking them if you experience any negative side effects, but personally I haven't with Seroquel. ",False,False

I started out on 25mg and tried to go up to 100mg and even at 25 it made me sleep like 12-14 hours and I'd wake up in the middle of the night and binge eat. It felt like the munchies you get when you're super stoned and I'd eat everything. I hated it so much. Most people don't have that issues with such a low dose, and the adhd meds might help you not have that side effect. It mostly just makes you wanna eat down the house so if you can not eat a whole bunch of stuff you'll be fine ",False,False

The dose you’re taking will only target the histamine receptors in your brain; in other words, it’ll pretty much only do what you’ve been already doing with the Benadryl, etc, just better. Causing weight gain at this dose is highly improbable and would likely be a placebo effect if you experience it at all.   As for your second question, it being bad ethics aside, it sounds like your psychiatrist knows what she’s doing and, as such, she knows how detrimental doing something like that would be to you.

With the exception of alcohol, none of these drugs contain actual calories, so while it can be challenging to resist the munchies, weight gain is not guaranteed.  It’s important to look after your mental health, if you and your therapist have agreed that this medication could help you, it would be a good idea to try it. You might find that relief from your ED follows. One thing at a time. If you find the potential appetite stimulating effects do affect you (not everyone gets the same side effects!) and you feel it’s exacerbating your ED, you can discuss with your therapist about alternative or complementary treatments. Good luck, hope you feel better soon.",False,False
