I think seeking professional help is the most logic - if not the only - thing to do at this point, it is very hard to recover from this state all alone. Isn't there any way you can speak to someone without letting your parents know? If you definitely can't, you should tell your parents then. They will eventually find out but it might be too late.  The point is, you have to get someone to share this burden. A professional, your family, a friend, a therapy group... whatever. Just... share it. This is too heavy to fight alone. ED feeds itself on you feeling alone and helpless against it.",False,False
