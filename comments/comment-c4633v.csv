For me I think part of it was because I previously had semi-controlled BED (I was average to slightly overweight) and at that point in my life depression made me apathetic enough to completely stop using food as a crutch, but the weight dropped fast, I don't think the prozac had any impact on that whatsoever.   It wasn't through fasting or anything either, I had 3 square meals a day with no snacking because I wanted to get better and I knew I had to give my body enough food to get through the day. The depression simply made me see food as fuel rather than a comfort. I didn't want to take care of myself, but I knew I wouldn't get better if I didn't.   Long story short, I don't think the prozac had any effect on my ability to lose weight.",False,False

He would rather me actually take my meds every day and try to get better than give me something that is going to give me even more ED related anxiety. It's always an option to talk about. Finding the right meds can be really hard.",False,False
