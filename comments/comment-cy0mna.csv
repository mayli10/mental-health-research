It’s like a meth head being proud of their resourcefulness in getting money to buy more meth. One day you’ll be in tears because you want to eat an apple but just can’t. You’re not in control of this and it’s not admirable. Thinking it is is so dangerous. No one envy’s us. It’s pity you’re getting. If I see an Ana, I just feel so sorry for them and recently I’ve seen mostly old Anas which is the saddest of all, because that’s been their whole life. I wish I hadn’t lost my youth to this bullshit. I hope you don’t lose yours. I said this tonight to my husband, watching tv, there was a college scene.
