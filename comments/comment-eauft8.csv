And as you’d expect - it’ll be several times 400. We need energy to function so the body and brain will eventually pay a hefty price for severe restriction.    In our society it can be hard to know what’s ‘normal’ vs disordered, but eating disorders are a terrible hill to die on so I’d suggest erring on the side of seeking help and support if this is adversely impacting your life. (Disordered eating can also crop up with a range of other mental health issues and those are equally worth getting help with.) Best wishes.",False,False
