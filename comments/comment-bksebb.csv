My OCD isn't too bad, luckily. It's more of a one-more-thing than a proper must-address, and my antidepressant works for anxiety and OCD too, so that helps. Mostly my OCD manifests as dermantilomania. It started when I had my first eczema flare up in elementary.   I accidentally developed a restrictive ed in late elementary when life started to really suck, and it's been a little over a decade since. Still have never sought help for it. I've genuinely never been that bad off to need help - at my disorder's worst, my paediatrician was telling me I was too fat and needed to lose weight. (My stomach was concave, I did hours of martial arts every other day, was about as strong as the strongest guy in my grade, but okay.)   Mental health issues run up both sides of my family so bad, right now the most likely thing to kill me, statistically, is myself. If I make it to 40 without dying, the prevalent COD becomes cancer, with a small chance of heart disease. But at least half of my family members didn't make it to my birth because of untreated mental health issues, and of those who did make it, everyone older than me has shown signs of mental health issues themselves.   That's the problem with mental health issues - they're all in your head, and that's where you always are.   On the clothes front, though, you could get a big tub and some fabric dye and just dye all your clothes black? Then you don't have to but anything new. (I'm suggesting this like it's a joke, but depending on your exact situation, this might actually be a reasonable solution. Like, I would totally dye a lot of my clothes black if I had mostly non-black clothes, but I'm goth trash.)",False,True

And not just about food.  Like, I work in a lab around carcinogenic and biohazardous materials and frequently think ‘I should drink this’. WTF brain?  And then I don’t do it because I may have my issues but I don’t want to die.  It’s hard, but try and forgive your impulsive brain. That’s just how they work.",False,False

Everyone in my immediate family has mental health issues that were diagnosed long before mine. They kind of trivialized my anxiety issues growing up and always one-upped any issues of mine. So I sort of developed this identity as the ‘normal’ one in the family. (Narrator: she was not normal)  Looking back, I had issues with OCD as early as first grade and ED by middle school. It took me 20 years to decide it was bad enough to seek therapy, and it actually started with a list for me too (so I guess I did write it out, didn’t quite realize that’s what you meant). Seeing on paper all the routine tasks that provoked my anxiety and consumed my day made me seek help. But it still doesn’t stop me from worrying that it’s ‘all in my head’ (like that makes it less real).  I’ve tried to journal and track but I’m not very good at it. I do a thought log for therapy. But I either write 20 things a day or nothing.  I am also very fortunate to live alone. I really like being able to eat/not eat/clean/not clean without judgement. Although it results in a variety of levels of cleanliness depending on my mood.  I’m sorry to hear about your therapy/doctor situation. Waiting months sounds terrible! I’m very glad I got into therapy but it is a love/hate relationship. The exposure and response prevention assignments for OCD are brutal. There are some pretty decent CBT workbooks to help with OCD if that is an option for you?  I should just swap out all my clothes for black, make my life easier. I hate buying clothes though, and most of mine are ancient or hand me downs.",False,False

I was thinking that if I was diagnosed with an incurable disease and it was zero chance I’d live and just drain my family finances, I’d buy a gun and take a boat out on deep water and shoot my self and make sure when I died I’d sink to the bottom.. weighted wetsuit or something. But this thought train is always but of course I’d bring tons of food to have a spectacular binge before. Lol. Sad.",False,False

My main issue with accepting it was I was always told I was faking everything when I was a kid so as an adult I wouldn't be able to do more than make it to the bathroom to relieve myself some days but I'd convince myself after the fact that I was just being lazy. Seeing all the symptoms I struggle with, both mental and physical, really helped put things into perspective. When there was over a page of issues, I believed there really was something wrong, and it's not my fault I can't function some days. Now whenever I have a really bad day and start feeling like I'm just useless and fake and all that, I look back at the length of my problems and don't really feel better, exactly, but I feel validated. Like I'm allowed to feel bad and not do anything productive.   I also made little trackers in a journal where I colour little boxes or circles to mark how bad the day was, according to a couple factors. Seeing all the bad together also helps with validating my issues to myself.   The kitchen gets gross more from other people, since when I'm not restricting I'm too anxious about other people seeing the remnants from my unhealthy snacks and judging me, and I have to be in a fairly good mood to cook too.   I'm jealous of the therapist. I can't even get a doctor's appointment until next month. I made it months ago. I'm really looking forward to being back on my meds. Both for physical and mental issues. OTC drugs only do so much, and I'm tired of needing to use unhealthy coping mechanisms because it's all I have at the time.  I like laundry alright, though putting them all away properly is annoying a lot of the time. But I also almost exclusively wear black so that probably makes laundry a lot easier for me.",False,True

My acceptance of my comorbid mishmash of mental health issues also comes out in waves. I have OCD and literally have obsessions and compulsions around this ridiculous fear that I’m faking my other obsessions and compulsions 😒  Accepting some issues comes easier than others. I should definitely write stuff out more though, maybe it’ll help. I’m really happy to hear that it helped you! Sometimes crying can be cathartic.   I definitely clean more the less I eat. Especially my kitchen (cause that makes sense). When I’m binging, kitchen = trashes. When I’m restricting dishes don’t even touch the sink before being washed. I do sometimes get tired and slack on doing laundry, which is my least favorite chore. So clothes pile up quickly.",False,False

It took me writing out everything I suffer from. Looking at all of it together feels really validating for me. If you haven't tried it, I'd definitely suggest it. Accepting that there's really something wrong and I wasn't just making it all up made me sob for about an hour — full on ugly crying — but I've felt less stress from feeling like a fraud since.   I can only wash old dishes when I'm fasting. Otherwise it's too gross for me to touch. I also do full, excessively detailed skincare routines when restricting.
