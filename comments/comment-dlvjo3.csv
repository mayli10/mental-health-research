This can lead to the potential for a very large number of calories to be stored as glycogen in the muscles, along with a lot of water retention to go with it.  (This would seem to match up with /u/paperklipp's scales telling her that her water weight has gone up by a few percentage points.)  Additionally, after being active while in a restrictive diet, the glycogen stores will be completely drained at the start of the binge. This would be fairly common for someone with anorexia who is very physically active.  &gt;If you're not active and binge is that the only time you gain fat?  No, if someone in the aforementioned condition continues to binge for more than a day, then the glycogen will be replenished, water weight will be at max, capacity for burning off excess calories as body heat will be reached, and fat storage will begin.  The studies seem to suggest that this starts with a few tens of grams of fat stored on the second day, followed by more on the third day as the body gets in the swing of it.  Someone with an ED will be in an even more different situation. Take a look at this study: [https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fendo.2019.00041/full](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fendo.2019.00041/full)  Relavent quotes:  &gt; The microbiome plays a central role in the amount of energy harvested from a specific quantity of food, with important implications for body weight regulation. In 2005, it was discovered that compared with normal weight controls, overweight patients have an altered gut microbiome, which appears able to extract more energy from the same food  &gt; [...]  &gt; Differences in the microbial species that extract energy from the same quantity of food could help explain why **patients with the restrictive subtype require dramatically more calories to gain weight compared to patients with the binge-purging subtype**  For someone with extreme restriction, a large amount of the initial calories in a binge are going to pass through the system unprocessed, because the gut flora is inadequate to even absorb it all.",False,False

It is perfectly possible for a physically active, restricting person to gain almost or exactly zero body fat after a 1 day binge.

That first article is talking about the same study as one of the ones in my original link.   That 0.2lbs is averaged out over 5 days of binging. The study wasn’t about 1 day of binging. The other studies in my link discuss the effects of one day binges, please continue to ignore them.  The second link doesn’t cite any studies, it just says that “science says 60% of the weight will be fat” without backing it up.  I would like to point out that this is contradicted by the actual cited real studies in my link. And I would point out that the author in the second link is totally confused about this topic:  &gt; If you have a normal system and your glycogen stores are depleted from either physical activity or dieting, you will store almost all of the carbs you eat.  This seems to imply they will be stored as fat, but it’s actually glycogen.  &gt; Next, if you are reasonably fit and are not considered overweight, science claims that 60% of the weight you gain will be body fat.  Gonna wait for a source on this one. In the mean time, let’s see some quotes from my original link which you didn’t read:  &gt; de novo lipogenesis (DNL), takes place when you regularly consume more calories than you burn. DNL is your body’s least preferred way to use carbs; your body would rather, in order of priority, burn them for energy, store them as glycogen, or even burn them off as heat.  &gt; the first three days, they depleted their glycogen stores with exercise and a low-carbohydrate diet; then, for each of the next seven days, they consumed 3,500–5,000 calories, of which 80–90% came from carbs (760–990 grams). On the first day of this week-long binge, all the extra energy served to refill glycogen stores; the athletes didn’t gain any fat. On the second day, fat synthesis amounted to only 30 grams. On the third day, to only 45 grams.  Instead of googling around looking for blog posts that say something different you could just read the studies and try to understand the science.",False,False

Mind that it’s *excess*, *not* counting what you burned that day. And different things take more/less energy than others. (Fun fact- sugars consume more energy in the breakdown into fat process than carbs).   It’s not impossible to gain literal fat in a huge binge. Excess calories in carbs/sugars/proteins/etc. do have to go somewhere as they’re broken down.   *But* excess calories also contribute to building *muscle*. So if you’re exercising on top of it all, your weight will be distributed accordingly to what your muscles need to repair the damage of strenuous exercise. This is included in the 3500 calories = 1 pound gained.   You also have to consider the *time* it takes to do all of this. It’s not like you’ll put that weight on in an hour or even twelve. If you “undo” the damage the next day (i.e., eat low enough to have your days deficit outweigh some of the previous excess), it can slow the process further, leaving you more time to burn what fat you did end up building.   Otherwise, water weight is a huge, ginormous factor, as it always is. “Gaining” 5-6 pounds and in some cases, even more than that, is going to be the majority of the problem. Depending on the sodium content of what you ate, it can stick around for days. Gas will also contribute heavily to bloat and feeling larger.   Anyway I don’t know the original question but I think this is on topic lmao. But yes you can feasibly gain fat/muscle in a day but it’s not gonna be an exact reflection of how much you ate  🤷🏻‍♀️ my bio degree is more in animal science but I’ve got at least semi-accurate knowledge of microbio n ochem (I got a D BUT REGARDLESS-)   Also if ur being a snot taggin me blackcat I’m gonna punt u 😠",False,False

I don’t like to cite anecdotes as evidence, but I’ve lived this way for a really long time and I’m not an exception to the rule, my body abides by the laws of physics. In the past I lost weight down to a really low BMI by living this way (although my binges were admittedly closer to the 10k mark at the time).",False,False

If you eat in a surplus you gain fat. How is it just all water and no body fat? I know not all of those calories got absorbed but surely some did.,False,False

Like my binges are always 15,000-20,000 kcal, so it takes two or three weeks of low restriction and exercise purging to get back to my starting weight. But all throughout that time my smart scale says my body fat stays exactly the same and only my water weight changes. So I didn’t gain any real weight technically, but I still didn’t bounce back in a day or two. There are lots of factors that effect how quickly your body recovers from a binge: the calories, the salt, the carb content, your hormones, your water intake, constipation, purging, etc ad infinitum. Physics still remains physics.",False,False
