If it’s any consolation, my grandma once told my mom she had a big nose and it looked like she had been caught in the rain (it was not raining outside!) when my mom does not have a big nose, and looked completely normal.  Dementia/old age/bad eyesight will do that to a person! I hope you can take it in stride, because I’m so sure that is not what she meant to say!!!",False,False

But my face dropped immediately and partners mom jumped in and said “mom! People just say “tall” not BIG it doesn’t sound very nice!”.  Oy vey,False,True

Does she have dementia? Because people with dementia can be very rude and delusional. My dad had a very rapidly progressing type and it wasn’t pretty. He would bitch about my sister, to my sister thinking it was his long dead mother.",False,False
