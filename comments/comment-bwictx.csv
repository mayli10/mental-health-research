There was a point where I was truly starved and worried everyone, but even then they just referred to it as a diet. They believe that it is caused by an ex friend when that is the farthest from the truth :( I kept trying to tell my sister and mother that  its not because of that friend and that it was always just me and how I viewed myself... I am now ""recovered""- not really, but I basically just gained weight and they don't think I suffer from any disordered thoughts with food  anymore and look back at that time as just a stupid diet... It feels invalidating to say the least and I wish they could see that this is my own issue rather than an outcome of a failed friendship",False,False
