I got drunk this weekend with a friend of mine and we finally admitted to each other that we both have eating disorders and it was a weight off my chest - until she started talking about all the weight she's losing and how she likes being in control. I've just regained the same 6kg I worked so hard to lose before Christmas and I've never felt less in control in my life, finally coming to terms with the fact that it's not just restriction but probably bulimia (I'm so in denial it's actually hilarious) and still not seeing the effects I want. I know it's not healthy but she looks great and I now feel like I'm somehow 'failing' at my eating disorder. I know that's crazy but what the fuck me, why can't I be better at starving myself?",False,False

I know I have disordered eating habits for sure and am always striving to lose weight even when I’m in binge mode, it’s like I’m a failed anorexic almost. When I restrict, I restrict hard. But then I “fail” by going into binge territory for a month. I flip flop through the same 25 pounds any point during the year. So I totally get you. ",False,False
