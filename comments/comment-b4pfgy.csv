I always include this disclaimer.  &amp;#x200B;  One of my parents is hypervigilant, so when I dropped around 20% of my body weight in \~4 months from what I saw as a super healthy diet, she took me to the doctor, had me diagnosed, and ""encouraged"" me to go to a recovery clinic. I got to choose between IP and OP, so I took OP.   When I got diagnosed, I was shocked, and right after I had planned to meet a friend. I told him in a state of panic what the doctor labeled me as... He's the only person I told. Thankfully he understands I want an outlet, not a savior, so I would basically just spam him with how much I hated things in """"recovery"""" and has never made an effort to really stop me- he just listens, which is EXACTLY what I want/need. Doesn't judge, no threats, put-downs..  My parent did take the initiative to tell everyone and their mom though, so it's not like it mattered that I only told one friend. :/  I've also told other people but I don't use the term eating disorder, I just kind of vaguely say ""oh i don't eat that b/c it makes me feel fat"" or stuff like that, like ""i like to control what I eat"" ect. For non-ED people and people who haven't seen EDs explicitly that just comes across as a 'healthy eater' although it's risky, since some people HAVE had EDs and will look you in the eye and go ""that sounds like an eating disorder"" nooo it was a healthy but misguided diet hahahahahaahaaa",False,False

She would also constantly ask what I ate each day and stare at me any time she saw me eat or someone mentioned food around us. She even tried to force-feed me a granola bar one day. Basically, it was a mess and made my ed so much worse. I found out a couple weeks later that she has an ed too (she won't admit it's a problem, but she makes herself throw up any time she feels bad about herself), and it's obvious she's trying to compete over it. Like, she wants to be skinnier than me but still eat more than me, so she exercises and purges more. If you're friend is in recovery, it might be a good idea to tell her so you can support each other IF you're open to recovery (you absolutely deserve it, but you might not be in the right mental space to try right now). Otherwise, you'll just make things harder for her. I would wait until she's farther into recovery before telling her.",False,False

Personally the only two people who know about mine are naturally healthy and moderate people without any mental issues.
