I was completely dependent on laxatives after abusing them in highschool for years. Itâ€™s been over 10 years since I last used them, it took me years to recover but I have more or less normal BMs now. I do still take psyllium husk fibre supplements daily and I drink a ton of water to help things a lot but no stimulant laxatives and I can go daily. You can do it!!",False,False
