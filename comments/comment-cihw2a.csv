Next day I'm 118. Then 116. But 116 is my lowest weight so it doesn't count until I hit 115. And then that probably doesn't count because I'm just going to yo-yo around 117 for the rest of my life anyways.,False,False

There is also the whole pooping thing. And the weight of the actual food itself.,False,False

I haven’t been below 160 in years so I was sooooo happy when I saw the number (I weighed at night with my clothes on after eating and drinking all day so I assumed I’d be lighter in the morning). But I’ve been weighing at 163 the last two days in the mornings now, naked, no food or water, after a bowel movement. It. Literally. Makes. No. Sense.",False,False

It can all be so frustrating.   Beginning of this month I clocked in at around 173. Now my weight keeps fluctuating between 157-166, and it pisses me off to no end when I weigh myself and see I’m 163 or more when the day or two before that I was 157. So I usually don’t update my weight until it’s been showing the higher weight for like a week. I can’t tell if I’m cheating myself doing this and I also feel like i don’t know how much I really weigh. I’ve been eating at a deficit every single day and have been militant with weighing my food and tracking my calories and sometimes it feels like I’m not doing enough.",False,False
