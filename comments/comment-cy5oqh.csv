It’s honestly so frustrating to be tired and hungry and actually looking forward to eating something. So of course you’re emotional when it doesn’t turn out the way you planned. Or maybe it’s all in my ed brain but I’ve definitely experienced this a lot of times,False,False

Our ed’s make everything about food so significant that we forget the important things in our lives like our relationships with others, our health, our lives in general. Please don’t cry and please enjoy the pizza as it is with your boyfriend. You deserve it. You deserve to live.",False,False
