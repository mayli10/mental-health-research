Safe: Cage-free eggs/egg whites (hard boiled or scrambled), avocado (the only plant I can digest at the moment, ugh), vanilla collagen protein powder, wild-caught seafood (especially Trader Joe’s salmon with a bit of avocado sesame sauce on top... relatively cheap and absolutely divine), free-range poultry, grass-fed beef, EVOO, Bulletproof collagen protein bars, non-dairy MCT creamer (I use a tiny pinch + Jordan’s Skinny Syrup to make bomb low cal green/rose tea lattes that tide me over between meals), and Halo Top (1-2 servings a day; it’s virtually my only “indulgence” apart from drinking a few times a year). I suppose a lot of my safe foods are uncommon, but LCHF is what works for me and I feel like garbage if I don’t get enough healthy fats.",False,False
