I don’t want to tell anyone, especially my family, because I’d be fine for a week, even a month and then have a breakdown for a few days. Then go back to normal again. I worry that if I tell them they’d become paranoid every time they see me weighing my food or, conversely, eating cake.",False,False

I've mentioned fasting to a friend who's prepping for a body-building competion, but they do their own weird shit with bulk/cut cycles, so while he mentioned that 48 hours seemed like a bit much, he wasn't shocked.",False,False

Ugh.   But IRL? Three people know. Two live very very far away from me. One lives here and condones it because he also has very disordered eating so it’s more of a “buddy” kind of thing.   I want to keep my mouth shut about it. But it’s literally all i think about it and so i talk to those people about it. At work sometimes i do get a little too weird about calories and make offhanded comments about how i don’t eat unplanned snacks which is probably not something people pay too much attention to but i let things slip i guess.",False,False

One of them being that I'm on and off and feel like I'm faking most of the time.  Another thing that discourages me from sharing is that they won't understand, ED awareness is inexistent where I live and we don't have a mental health care system, which brings us to my first point :  I didn't learn about EDs until spending a good amount of time on the net doing weight loss research, and because of this exposure I feel like I gave myself my ED   Also I like leading this ""double life"" kind of thing, it makes me feel like an interesting mysterious character",False,False

Every so often I do get tempted to spill because I'm just so sick of hiding it. Like, I'm sure anyone I'd tell already p much knows.
