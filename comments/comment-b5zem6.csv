And I based the cost on the price listed on the No Frills website. And the meal replacement shakes are great. They're worth 68% of my daily nutritional needs for only 27% of my daily calorie needs. That leaves a lot of room for other foods to fill in the rest of my nutritional needs. Also, in the screenshot I posted vanilla extract is listed as an ingredient, but it's too expensive so I'm planning to buy vanilla flavoured almond milk for that smoothie instead. Part of the reason my meal plan is mostly smoothies and shakes is also because I have a problem which makes it difficult to digest a lot of foods and I'm hoping that if I switch to mostly liquids that my body will have an easier time absorbing everything.",False,True
