That this moment is the only moment in which I get to do anything and I donâ€™t want to spend it in an endless attempt to atone for previous moments.   And like you talked about...reminding myself that one day of off-plan eating is a negligible blip but that diving into that vicious cycle of trying to â€˜fixâ€™ yesterday can really have a harmful impact on my life.   Best wishes &lt;3 You deserve a wonderful now.,False,False
