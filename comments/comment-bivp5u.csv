When I was 16 I told my mom I didn't want to be alive anymore and she hit me and told me never to tell anyone that again. I threw myself out of my friend's car at high speed. I'm okay now, minus a few scars. I'm very happy, now, that I somehow made it out of that alive. I felt so empty all the time, how was I born the most worthless being alive.   But I was not, and am not, even now, worthless. Neither are you. We inherently create our own worth, no one can assign that to us. We are just hairless apes running around on this planet and I realized that while the emptiness is going to try to consume me, i'm the one literally fabricating this emptiness. This is a big dumb fucking rock, I can do literally whatever i want- but if I kill myself I give up the chance to adopt dogs, and I forfeit sunsets, and sleeping in on weekends. I fold my cards and refuse any chance of building my life better. It took me a long tine to come to this realization. That was my first step. Your brain is broken, and you need to see a doctor and get it sorted out, and that's tough and scary but genuinely you feel this way because of a chemical imbalance in your brain chemistry- it's not your fault, you just got unlucky. Like me. Like millions of other people. If nothing else, give it a try before killing yourself, what's the worst that could happen?  I'm not saying getting help is a cure-all, and it doesn't happen overnight. Hell, I still have an eating disorder. I still have to put my clothes in the dryer, take them out, put then back in, open close the door three times then start, stop, start it or else I feel like I'm going to die. But I feel human. I feel okay. I'm not so scared all the time. I'm the only person I have in this world, so I'm gonna take care of her. Am I gonna fuck that up sometimes? Yeah, I'm just a human, but I can recognize that. And I know you're going to be stubborn and bitch that I'm ""just saying that"" and that I'm wrong but that's okay. I think you'll figure it out. I care about you, and I think you have it in you to figure it out.",False,False

I’m truly sorry that you’re suffering so much. I know talking online isn’t the same as having a friend in real life, but you can bother me anytime you want for any reason you want- because you aren’t worthless to me ♥️",False,False
