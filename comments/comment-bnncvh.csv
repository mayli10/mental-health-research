If i could exist as a digital consciousness or a robot or something I would. I hate having a physical body I hate having flesh and skin moves and sweats and has pores and gets pimples.

I hate that I have to eat to function and that a side effect of eating is having to poop and have other bodily functions.,False,False

But last time I was hospitalized (for non ed related reasons) they said I was in relatively good health (other than all the broken bones I was in there for lol). I'm okay, I dont really have any other health issues. One day when I have enough money, I'll go see a doctor.      Funnily enough I am a never ending ball of energy. It must be manic because I was a lazy slug in comparison when I was at a healthy weight. I never stop. If I stop I'll probably sit down and never get back up.
