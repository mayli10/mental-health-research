I've had some therapists who were helpful and some who weren't. They won't just tell you health facts that you already know and tell you to stop being unhealthy, they will give you a chance to talk through what's going on (saying it out loud, to another person, can be such a relief sometimes) and help you identify patterns and triggers and plan ways to avoid them. I know not all EDs respond to therapy, but I have comorbid anxiety and getting that dealt with and treated gave me the ability to start improving my eating too.  You write that you want to get better. That's the biggest hurdle to therapy I think - it doesn't work if you don't want it to. But you want to recover, so it sounds like therapy might be worth a try.  Whatever you decide to do, I wish you the best. Hope you feel better soon.",False,False

But you're right and you know what you're doing.  I'm sorry you're feeling this way. I really am. I wish I had some magic to offer, but all I have is sympathy.",False,False
