I think that's a learned behavior, rather than a genetic one. But maybe there are other genes that contribute to it, like whether or not you're prone to anxiety or depression, or how your body responds to insulin and hunger hormones, etc. Like, in my case, I've been diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder and ""depressive moods,"" both *hereditary* traits which basically necessitate some kind of serious coping mechanisms in order for me to function, but I *learned* to use food as a crutch when I'm dealing with difficult emotions or stress.  The other thing that's interesting and complicates the situation is, as far as I know from the limited and not at all rigorous reading I've done in my spare time, that biologically, a ""feast"" usually follows a ""famine."" So, when I burn a lot of calories during my sports training and don't replenish them, I'm much more likely to have the lizard brain response of binging at the next opportunity, because my body is like ""uh, wtf? are we starving? is there no food in the environment? oh, never mind, here's some extremely calorie-dense and unhealthy shit! eat it all right now so we can store it and survive the famine!"" Same thing if I'm fasting after a *previous* binge.  Like, yesterday, I ate a pretty reasonable amount at a slight deficit for the day, but I exercised so much this week that I was (intentionally, foolishly) in a deep deficit for the week, and even though I wasn't sad or anxious, I binged my brains out. And that response that I couldn't seem to control at all makes sense biologically, for species survival, even though there really isn't a famine and I'm just doing this because I hate myself.  The *other* other thing that I read, which may or may not be real, is that another response to famine is just, *not* eating, and in fact, burning *more* calories. I think it's called the migration theory? But it basically ""explains"" the set of behaviors associated with anorexia, ie eating very little and/or being very active without sufficient fuel, but somehow surviving for a while. Like how some birds fly great distances without stopping when the seasons change, and they barely eat or sleep for months. That also seems to be genetic, according to the 2 studies that I heard about/read briefly, and it may or may not coincide with the other gene for ""feasting"" after a ""famine.""  So, nature *and* nurture, I guess? I don't really know what this comment was supposed to be, it kinda turned into a lot. I have no idea about biology or psychology, I just read sometimes, so this is probably not truly accurate. But that's my 2 cents, for all they're worth lol",False,False

In a kind of misguided way? Like we were allowed muffins, but not cereal for breakfast. I always had to finish my plate, even if I didn't like what was on it. Eventually when I hit puberty and got kinda chunky it got worse and I wasn't allowed anything but fruits, veggies, and whole grains, and every extra portion received a comment. Now I'm bulimic/orthorexic.   I think if you have the genetic component, there's very little that your upbringing can do to prevent it.

That coupled with some kind of ongoing guilt she felt about her PND and the fact she was raised poor meant she gave me a ridiculously large amount of food, frequently junk food and sweets (my dad cooked meals which were mostly from scratch and relatively healthy though). She also had crushingly low self esteem and constantly vocalised how ugly she thought her body was and hid in oversized clothes even after she'd lost weight which I think probs had an impact on me.   I was normal weight as a kid but started piling it on as a teen due to emotional eating (hated school) and a predilection for junk food which was readily available. Had a moment of horror about 15 when I weighed myself, refused to eat anything but raw veggies for a while and so began years of binge/ restrict cycle and yoyoing weight. Ironically both me and my mum are currently at normal BMIs (ive been everything from UW to OB in the past) but my mentality towards food is completely messed up, I don't honestly think it's repairable at this stage. I don't blame her because I think she was going through a lot but I hope I manage to not pass it on to any children I may have. I'm honestly quite jealous of people who grew up with food just being a non issue, take it or leave it type thing, can't relate.",False,False

I spent the first 10 years of my life with a compulsive hoarder mother who was also really neglectful, so there was either no food for a week or a mountain of food.

After that, I was adopted by a family that has a really lax attitude towards nutrition—getting fountain drinks every time we left the house, pizza all the time, the whole thing.  It's like it's wired my brain a certain way, where if I eat I binge and it's best if I eat nothing at all so I don't activate the ""get rid of everything so it doesn't go to waste"" mode.

My mom, dad, and brother are capable of intuitive eating without really needing to pay any attention to what or how much they’re eating, and they can course-correct really easily if they over indulge, like over the holidays or whatever. I kind of thought I was just an anomaly, but today I saw a post somebody made in the binge sub asking if anybody else binged as a kid and I realise I actually did. My mom allowed us one kid-size candy bar every day after dinner, but I was a terror for sneaking into the cookie jar or the treat box when nobody was looking and then going back for more and more. When I started taking care of preparing my own meals I would make absolutely massive portions and eat the whole thing over the course of a few hours. I would have multiple bowls of cereal with milk and sugar just because I liked the taste and texture. Instead of having one slice of bread with a bowl of soup, I would have three or four, and absolutely *lathered* them with butter. I never really felt like I was stuffing myself beyond satiety like I do when I binge now, but I was definitely eating way, way too much.
