I measure most calorie dense food and protein so I can’t overestimate. My minimum per day is 1400kcal, but my goal in September was 1800, now I’m averaging 2400kcal per day (60 kcal/kg/day), which is a ton of food. I’m a little afraid to go much higher. The nice thing about having a dietician in charge was I never had to think about the numbers at all.",False,True

My dietitian at the time said it’s normal to sometimes lose a bit at first, but I’m not sure how much or for how long it’s normal.  Is it possible that you’ve been underestimating your TDEE and/or overestimating you’re intake?  Can you try swapping your usual restriction foods with higher calorie versions (for instance, full fat dairy instead of nonfat, regular bread instead of the low cal kind, etc)? That might help stop you feeling so uncomfortably full, since the volume would be closer to what you’re used to. Calorie dense foods are great too, like adding extra oil when you cook, adding seeds to smoothies/oatmeal, etc. And snacking on nuts, pb, chocolate, etc in small amounts throughout the day— not a lot at one time to prevent feeling too full, but the small amounts will add up at the end of the day.",False,False
