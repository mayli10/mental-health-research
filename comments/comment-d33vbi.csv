You're never alone and any anxiety attack/hole of despair has an end! your ex sounds like someone you need to distance yourself as much as possible from in a small town--become the cool ex gf who never gives him the time of day and he looks like a fool still talking about someone who has clearly moved on. Dont know about ur current bf but dont make a snap judgement late at night with no food, put him out of ur mind or send him a short text saying ""hey, not feeling great, can you reassure me that everythings ok?"". the girl who ruined ur life can also suck a dick, and i promise you can find nicer friends--even if its in a support group or something. i know that might sound really lame but its honestly a good place to meet like-minded people who can urge you to change ur life up for the better (so u dont have more coke induced panic!)     coke is a super fucked drug because of how good it feels at first and howwwww terrribbllee it becomes. if anything, abuse caffeine.&lt;3",False,False
