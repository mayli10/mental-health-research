I went to the courts and same. The army was better but I still struggle with the fact that they only did so much.   Believe me I understand. It's what caused me to gain weight and now I'm in this scary restriction phase.   I wish I knew the magic words to help. I personally thought ""the body keeps the score"" was good to help me realize what happened will affect your body regardless.   I really hope you can find some peace and happiness even for a brief moment today. You deserve it.",False,False

Sexual assault happens to men and women, old and young. It happens to people of all ages and to people whom are overweight, underweight, normal weight, obese. It is awful. And not your fault.    It doesn't matter what you look like or what you are wearing. Nobody has the right to assault you. It is not your fault. What happenend was the fault of this person that hurt you.     Also please remember that sexual assault isn't so much about attractiveness as it is about power. Sick people trying to dominate and overpower other people in a sick way.   You are not wrong for being the victim of a crime. You are not at fault. Your body is not at fault. Even though it may feel that way sometimes.    Wishing you so much strength and self-love.",False,False

Being sexually assaulted is very truamatizing and people who do such things don't go with such logic. He would have done it regardless, because assaulting someone shows they don't care about the other person, only themselves.  Please, try to get some therapy to help with the feelings of guilt.",False,False
