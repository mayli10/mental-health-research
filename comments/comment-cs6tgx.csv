Something I've realized is that all ""sick enough"" means is that you're not living the life you want to live, and you can't seem to change it no matter how hard you try.

It's a weird subconscious self-sabotage, and an inability to let ourselves feel content and happy. It's like a sick need to suffer. I maintained a thin weight in a truly healthy way for about a year and I relapsed from the stress of going away to college because I never had any real treatment beforehand to prevent me from going back to my old toxic ways. I beat myself up every day because that ""decision"" (rationally I know I didn't really consciously choose it, it is an illness after all, but I still beat myself up over it so much) because it's what led to me being suspended from school and gave me a ton of painful health issues that didn't go away for literally years. All I've wanted for the past 4/5 years is to get back to somewhere I feel confident and comfortable but have the mental wisdom and tools to not feel like I have to take it too far. Like, WHY didn't I just stay at that thin and healthy place? It's such a fucking mystery and it kills me. I feel like if we could all learn ways that better helped us channel our need to feel in control, whether it be through art, other long-term goals, or some kind of healthy way, we wouldn't constantly feel like our bodies aren't good enough.

I agree that it's absolutely insane how normalized disordered eating/thinking is. What's very strange is that people will talk about dieting and food like they're actually going to eat in this perfect way, but they obviously't aren't, because they're not sick. It's like a total disconnect for them between what they say and what they do, because their brains are healthy and normal, but the rhetoric they've been taught is ""right"" is actually deranged. Whereas when people like us who actually are disordered do eat in the way our orthorexic-minded society says is 'right', we become sick.

If you are scared of going to extremes, just pick a goal weight that is healthy and ideal and get there- stay there. This whole ED thing is a total need for control and mainly psychological. It's possible to be skinny by working out and eating at a defecit and than maintaining. It's honestly about self discipline and control- why are we choosing to channel our energy on a destructive and vain ED when we can be what we want without actually hurting ourselves? I doubt any of us actually want to look like a literal corpse- but we want to be like ""hella skinny"", I know that's possible without hurting ourselves.

Seeing the right therapist and having the bravery to be truly honest with myself and them is something I still haven't been able to do, and my life would have been so much different if I just bit the bullet and did it then.   For me as a teenager controlling my food intake was something that 'saved' me in the sense it kept me sane and feeling (falsely) like I had my shit together. I was so deep in it that I didn't even see it as a problem. I really encourage you to be honest about what you want out of life and what you would need to do to get those things, and what you might have to let go of in order for that to happen. It doesn't even necessarily mean that you have to not be thin, this disorder is honestly much more about faulty thinking and behaviors then it is about weight. I say this because what scared me out of getting help was always that everyone was going to make me have a body I hated. Now that I'm older I can see that the help I needed was to correct my faulty beliefs about myself and food.  For me, I only saw a couple of really bad therapists and doctors and I had the notion that all they wanted to do was make me gain weight and they didn't understand or care about me and they were just ganging up on me. I really wish I had found someone who I could be honest with, and who respected me, and who was reasonable (because honestly, and this may be an unpopular opinion, but at least back when I was a teen, a lot of eating disorder specialists weren't). If you can, please try and find a good therapist who respects you and you can feel comfortable being totally honest and open with.  I can't even put into words how much better your life will be.
