I would explain that you're feeling guilty about consuming animal products but make sure you make it clear that it's not ED influenced. If it's making it difficult for you to eat it may hinder your recovery and I don't think a treatment team should force you to eat things that make you uncomfortable on a moral level (again, not ED influenced). Maybe see if you can eat non dairy cheese as a compromise?  If that doesn't work, you really just have to push through. One day you will be recovered and able to be completely vegan again. You need to put your health first, as difficult as that may be. You'll have the rest of your life to live and eat the way you want to once you've finished the program",False,False

Maybe it’s something to talk about w your treatment team?   However, the few other times I had started recovery, my levels were so low across the board that I craved meat like some kind of demon spawn zombie, and had to eat it. I felt really guilty about it and still do but I also know that my body needed it. I continued eating it until I started to be really disgusted by it and it wasn’t good anymore, which is how I knew my levels were restored, and then I switched back to veganism.   So there’s no harm in getting yourself better first. Veganism is all about doing the least amount of harm but you killing yourself is doing harm, so getting better even by eating meat and dairy products is still doing the least amount of harm.   But again maybe try to talk to them about this? Perhaps there’s some certain foods you can eat more of to substitute for the ones you really hate ",False,False

The problem here is that you don't feel like eating this food, but I don't know how flexible your program is (can you eat vegetarian food that meets their calorie requirement that isn't necessarily the meals listed or do they just give you the meals?).  Because I was doing it myself it meant I did not have to eat really heavy food like what you are describing, but I was definitely using veganism as an excuse to restrict more (even though I had been vegan for years longer than I believe I had an ED, and I was a vegetarian since I was born before that) so I felt it was necessary to just eat whatever. I do eat meat but I find most dairy disgusting still, I hate things covered in cheese and milk and yoghurt are gross so you might not stop finding that stuff gross - it's way too heavy/greasy for me.   I introduced all this stuff slowly because at first it was disgusting for me too, except for a few meals I felt like I wanted to eat (stuff that I had a good memory of and didn't seem intolerable) and then after a while of eating a few of those things other stuff was easier. Honestly, I still feel pretty crap about it often, but for now I still am not comfortable reverting to veganism as I am not confident that I wouldn't start heavily restricting again, and I guess I have weighed up in my head how much better I feel now and the fact that I am actually able to function vs my morals in regards to animals. Right now I only eat animal products a few meals a week so it doesn't have to be forever.  Is there any way you can discuss with the people doing your program that your veganism is more than just a mechanism for restriction and you are having serious issues eating animal products so you can incorporate them more slowly? Sorry it's super long, just thought I'd describe everything I experienced. ",False,False

It gave me an ""excuse"" to be like, ""oh I can't eat that"" literally all the time.  I had to give myself actual permission to eat because I needed to be in control of my diet. I would tell myself, ""its okay to eat this granola bar because I cleaned the bathroom"" (or different foods or completed tasks). That way I had to EARN my food. I started kind of breaking the veganism lifestyle slowly, an egg here or there, jello, etc. But I'm still vegetarian, I just eat eggs and sometimes cheese now.",False,False

The only comfort I can give you is that nothing is in your power to stop those animal products from being shipped into the facility, and that it's just food that is being cranked out to make your calorie count as high as it needs to be in treatment. For them, it's just less volume than trying to supply proper vegan food to hit whatever calorie goal is set for you. What you'll be eating in no way reflects on your beliefs, and you are only eating it because there is eyes watching you, saying that you have to.   I'm sorry it's taking such a toll on you, I hope I could be of some comfort :-(",False,False
