In my opinion you're definitely going down the path of developing an eating disorder. However I do believe the earlier it is, the bigger chance of recovery so I'd really suggest not starving yourself after today because that's probably contributing to binges. You won't gain much from one binge! Obviously it's much easier said than done but I really hope you can get out of this cycle :)",False,False
