Is that not just another sign of mental issues?

I never thought I'd be the girl who becomes underweight, like it was always my HARD line to stop once I reached my goal weight, which seemed very reasonable because I had impeccable self control.  But I loved restricting, I got high off of it.  My friends always tried to figure out my ""vice"" since I lived this seemingly pure life, and that was it.  I really felt in control of the restriction, but I think I lost myself when it became an addiction.  I was overweight at the time so I just figured I was crash dieting because I was greedy, but it really slipped into a real eating disorder at some point.  I would cancel plans to restrict, it became my life.  And the numbers in my head would not turn off no matter what I did, and I slipped into underweight territory.

You want to lose some weight, you realize you have a knack for restricting, it makes you feel like you're accomplishing something, and then you get really addicted to that feeling of accomplishment and the prospect of not being in pursuit of a lower weight becomes frightening to the point where you can't stop.
