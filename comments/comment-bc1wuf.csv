You are still young and sound fairly healthy from the limited information you shared; PLEASE tell someone and get help before things have a chance to spiral into a full-blown eating disorder. Believe me, the longer you wait the harder it is to recover. Your story is almost exactly like mine (even the ages), except I didn't get help. I am now almost 27 and have lost so many years of suffering and pain - don't be like me.",False,False

You’re not being stupid at all, if you can find the courage to tell someone about this it would be amazing, stay strong, we’re always here if you need help",False,False
