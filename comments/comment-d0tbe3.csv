I feel so determined but then I mess up straight away. I hate it. I thought seeing the number on the scale go up would make me stop, but now I just feel doubly bad. I’m going to try to just stop trying so hard and try to not think about it if I can. Hopefully that works.  Thank you so much, it sucks you’re struggling with it too but it’s kind of nice to know I’m not alone with it.",False,True

I just feel like such a failure when I keep failing over and over, which is probably fuelling it and making it worse :(  thanks for sharing, definitely makes me feel less alone in it.",False,True

I think if i would have resisted or excercised afterwards i would have only maken it worse",False,False

I don’t know how I stopped that day versus any other day I tried, I just got so sick of myself gaining weight and I guess finally crossing the 120 threshold after not being there for over a year made me so sick of eating.   If you want to talk to someone about it, I’m all ears because I feel like I’m constantly fighting (or giving in to) the urge to binge lately",False,False
