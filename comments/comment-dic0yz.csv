Iâ€™ve had this ED since I was 14. It definitely was the worst in my teens. It might have to do with being more acceptable to be bigger and less emphasis on appearance when youâ€™re older (since youâ€™re not at the peak beauty by societal standard anymore).,False,True

Thereâ€™s this weird thing that happens around there where ED recovery rates increase/ I donâ€™t think anyone knows why. It happened to a girl a met in treatment said it was like a switch had flipped so I was wondering if it was the same phenomenon? Though being in a less toxic culture probably had a lot more to do with it ðŸ˜Š,False,False
