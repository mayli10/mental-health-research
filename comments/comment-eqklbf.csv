I feel like if your other design fits more with the idea of “wedding dress” then they’ll like it more. Lots of people aren’t fans of “sexy”/nontraditional dresses so it’s probably just the design and not you!! Tho it could also be that you don’t usually dress daringly or something? Like if the dress doesn’t seem like it’d be your normal style then they might not like it as much (which has nothing to do with ur body),False,False

The only opinion that matters is yours and your fiancé's, to a certain extent. I think you should ask for his opinion but the final saying is yours. Does he know about your ED? Even if he doesn't, I'd suggest having a heart-to-heart with him, saying how you really wanna look your best for the wedding, how you're considering marking the day by going out of comfort zone and trying something new...  you don't have to give him the details but tell him how it worries you that most people picked the basic one because you don't wanna choose the wrong one. You're a bride, I'm sure he'll understand your concerns. Hell, there's a bunch of shows about the process of picking a wedding dress, it's not easy!",False,False
