For me it seems to be a coping mechanism for lack of control in my life. I couldn't control a bunch of bad stuff that was happening to me, but I was able to control my weight and eating less would also save me money (I had never been employed at that point), so it made sense. Too bad for me that I slipped into such heavy restriction that I would worry a pack of instant ramen was too much or that I'd cry trying to eat half a bagel. That one was a wake up sign for me üòÖ I've been trying to get better since then. It's hard to get better on your own, but there are no resources around me to help that I actually have access to (unless I get myself hospitalized) and while I've thought about asking my parents to help me learn healthier eating whenever I visit there's no way they would actually be able to help me. It's a nice idea, but I've never been able to rely on them, so I can't expect any help from them with this.",False,False

I had a lot of surgeries as a child and young teenager and my therapist thinks Ive become sort of detached from my body. Like, it doesn't feel like mine at all and I tend to depersonalize a lot and I feel like my eating disorder has been a way for me to escape the physicality of it, in addition to beginning as a creative sort of self harm. Then I was sexually assaulted when I was at 16 and I think since then its been an attempt to desexualise my body. I hate the idea of anyone thinking about my body in that way. So I suppose in a roundabout sense what I might be trying to do is kind of infantalize myself and seek out what I had as a child.",False,False

I used to easily pass as 17, but I'm approaching 28 now and it doesn't work as much üòÅ 18-19 is my new 17 :(   I don't have anorexia, but something related to disordered eating, and that's nothing new. My parents told me that I have always been a picky eater. I had some obsessive compulsive behaviours with food (not mixing different food items, eating always with the same fork, eating at a specific spot, spreading food all over the plate before eating it and eating one spoon and spreading it again etc).   I would say that's one factor. I want to look like a 17 years old. I want to behave like one. I don't want the responsibility or complications of adulthood. I wish I could just go back and appreciate those years even more. I wouldn't say this provokes any ED, but most people develop an ED after a traumatic event and having an ED could be a solution of trying to stay and be reminded of happy times. Being locked in time. Not wanting to face the problems.   My depression started when I was 10, so that might be linked to that too. I can easily remember happy times from ages 3-9. But my disordered eating started pretty much when I could move and talk. My second word was ""no"" üòÖ ",False,False

Personally I had that in combination with my parents basically kicking me out when I was 14, so I pretty much had to take care of myself from that point onward and obviously fell into drugs and bad crowds etc.  Combine that with just a general lack of caring of my parents even when I did still live with them and you have a childhood that isn't a childhood at all.  I'll just see all those family films or actual families where the parents, you know, actually care, are sad when their kids are old enough to leave the house and excited when everyone comes together for stuff like Christmas and I'm just jealous.
