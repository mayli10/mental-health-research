It's why so many are obese; they eat an extra meal everyday. Plus eating constantly is supposedly bad for your colon.  And, I like the fact fasting and OMAD are becoming normalized. It keeps my obsession with calories normal in the eyes of my family and society thus enabling my eating disorder.  The fact big restaurants have to now have their calorie count actually kills me and relieves me at the same time. But it's good for others to make healthy choices.  Everyone wins, basically.

I feel like it's more acceptable for overweight or really fit people but at least if I can just bring up the fact that it's healthy then I don't have to make up other excuses.

I was legit talking about this to someone the other day. It’s wild to me how many people think that fasting and ED are two completely separate things. People argue about how it’s healthy and bla bla &amp;&amp; like fine okay I must be real damn healthy then. I can’t lift my school bag because I’ve been participating in this “heath regime” but naw ur right it’s healthy and “perfectly safe”. Lately I’ve just been saying to people “yeah. You’re right. They are two completely separate things; IF you don’t have an eating disorder.” I see social media advertisements for laxatives, and fasting regimes on a near daily basis. I have an eating disorder, but I’m trying to get better. The very last thing I  need is fb and Instagram telling me to fast or purge. It’s super triggering and completely invalidating of our struggles. ",False,False
