It took me years before I could engage with my trauma, and that's after being hospitalised twice and being outpatient for God knows how long.  There are other therapies that you can do to stabilise you, uncovering trauma can be very destabilising, so you need to ge ready. I did DBT for my borderline and it was very helpful.   I'm about to start cptsd group therapy which will teach me techniques of how to deal with symptoms (flashbacks, nightmares, feelings of guilt etc) and then I have an option to continue 1 on 1 therapy. The team very clearly told me that if I didn't want to talk about my specific traumas I didn't have to, and it's perfectly normal for people not to want to engage with it. Apparently loads of people do the group and choose to opt out of the 1 to 1 because it's too painful.   Bringing up old shit when you can't even cope with today, is counter intuitive. When you're ready, you'll tackle that shit head on.  Recovery is not a race, its better to take time and do it right than jumble through everything",False,False
