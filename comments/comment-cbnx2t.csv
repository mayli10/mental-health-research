One time I hid a brand new box of ice cream sandwiches in my room because I was binging on them before &amp; saw she got a new box. It melted &amp; I threw it away &amp; she still doesn’t know it was me. Obviously I shouldn’t have done that, but I wasn’t thinking clearly... She blamed it on my dad and wouldn’t stop talking about how he kept “coming in and stealing my food!” when really, it was me. She still holds that over him and STILL talks about it sometimes. That was probably 5 months ago 🙄",False,True

I'd just reach out to your sister and spend time with her + make sure she's aware of the impending fuckery.,False,False

And that I can promise that fasting isn’t the only way through this. You deserve to eat. This sounds really rough though 💗,False,False
