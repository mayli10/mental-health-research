My mom always makes and buys way too much food when I come home to visit. It's mostly a sweet gesture but it makes me really angry.  I get super sensitive and a fight breaks out. Every fcking time.  And it's just way too much so she always has to throw away most of it and then complains why I didn't eat.,False,False

You almost died from it, twice. It should be obvious at that point that it's a big problem and that it's not a simple solution. For him to tell at you in that way (especially on your bday), well, I'd react the same way. Especially since restriction messes with your emotions and makes you prone to anger, just from this comment I dont think of you as a brat. I would have been angry too",False,False

I have absolutely no control around food so when she gets me Oreos they‚Äôre all gone in three minutes and then I hate myself for the rest of the week.

The bit I hate is when they get all offended that you didn't eat the food they bought that they either didn't ask if you wanted or did and ignored when you said no.

I cried (mostly from anger at myself, but also at my mother for ignoring my pleading) when I saw it because I was at the lowest point of my ED then and knew I couldn‚Äôt even begin to stomach a bite of it. This lead to my father screaming at me and telling me to ‚Äújust eat‚Äù, that my ED wasn‚Äôt real and I was just being ungrateful, etc.  My blood was absolutely boiling at that point, and I was so distressed and insulted considering I had nearly died TWICE that year due to being so malnourished/underweight that I acted impulsively and chucked the entire cake at him.  It was a complete disaster, and I know this all probably makes me sound like a completely ungrateful brat, but ED-fueled hanger and despair are definitely quite the motivators for poor decisions.",False,False

The day before yesterday, mom took my younger guy cousin, younger siblings, and I to Jack in the Box and got us all burgers and pops and stuff. At least yeaterday it wasn't as bad of calories, but still she took us to get coffees and food. She tells me that I need to lose weight in subtle ways without actually verbally saying it but she makes it so that I can tell while at the same time she feeds us junk food. Wow...",False,False
