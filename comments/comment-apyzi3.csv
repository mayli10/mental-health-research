But there seems to be a point of diminishing returns for most people.   I've been at BMI 15 and 22 and I get the most attention from women at around 16 and from men around 21. I used to care... But now I don't trust anyone and just look into the mirror which always tells me I need to lose even more. Fun times,False,False

When I was at a ~16 BMI, people babied me. Holding doors, carrying my books/backpack, always asking if I needed anything... but it was obviously out of a place of concern. I was treated in a similar manner as a kid with a terminal illness at a Make A Wish event everywhere that I went.   When I was at an ~18-19 BMI, I got more comments like “you are SO SKINNY” in a positive way, people asking my diet/workout plan, but ultimately it was still mostly attention from other women that wanted to “look like me” and old guys in an almost predatory way?   When I hit my current BMI of 22 (still not recovered mentally but am at my body’s “set point” and don’t think about food super often anymore), I’ve started to get a TON of male attention from normal guys my age and am treated more like a capable adult. I don’t really get “preyed on” like I did when I was super tiny, I feel more equal.   TLDR: So yes and no? I think people just treat people that they seem attractive nicer.
