Just make sure to at least eat a bit and to drink water!!,False,False

You need to have some sort of protein in your system (even like an egg or some nuts!). If you’re currently restricting, there’s a high chance you’ll faint or bleed way too much, both of which can really mess up the piercing or tattoo. Body mods are something that can/will last a lifetime, so think of it this way; would you rather eat a tiny bit or food that you can work off later via exercise, or have a fucked up tattoo/piercing hole?",False,False
