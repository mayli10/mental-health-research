It‚Äôs almost like my brain forgot some of those foods even existed.   That was really thoughtful and I appreciate you doing that and being so kind. I‚Äôm trying really hard to get out of this constant cycle.,False,True

Small quantities are the sweet spot between self-destruction and self-care. Relapse and recovery are scary and weird, but carving a space out for yourself between the two is okay and valid and I really hope you can find peace. Much love",False,False

(I do a tablespoon of each a day) : chia, hemp, pumpkin (good omega source, decent protein, hemp has all essential aminos, chia expands into a cool pudding, esp with oats)  Legumes: lentils, chickpeas, black beans, pinto beans (good protein, fibrous, cheap, healthy, freeze well)  Soy: tofu, edamame (dried available as snack), tempeh, soymilk. Good source of minerals and protein. Tempeh is probiotic and excellent for gut/digestive health  Leafy: spinach, arugula, kale (protein and nutrient dense but super light)  Roots: carrots, sweet potato, beets (help curb sugar cravings and good for circulation + vitamin a)  Fruits: berries, pomegranate, apples (antioxidant-rich, low sugar, vitamin c/e)  Almond milk: you can make tumeric lattes with stevia and black pepper and they are so yummy and good for inflammation. Or just make your oats with almond milk, it's so yummy. Also raw almonds for a snack - excellent for circulation, heart health and nutrient absorbtion.  Mushrooms: good for soup, stir-fry and roast. Medicinal mushroom tea/tinctures (like reishi or lion's mane) are good for digestive + organ health and immune support  Onion: a food group. Adds 300% more flavor to everything. Also garlic.  Flaxseed and nutritional yeast are excellent to add to soup or stir fry. I personally don't use them but know many vegans who do.   Try out new things! You cant go wrong with pairing any of these with some fibrous veggies. Treat your body to new things and find something that works for youüíö",False,False

This is in a day:  An apple, banana, and pear Belvita breakfast ""biscuits"", and PB on whole wheat bread.  Can of beans (my go to for protein, plus it's easy to mix with spices, turmeric, garlic powder, etc.), broccoli florets, and some baby carrots.  Last meal is usually a big salad (2 cups spinach), mixed with chopped red cabbage and sliced mushrooms. Whatever dressing I have (or make). End with a cup of blueberries.

I actually used the same almond milk for protein shakes too (before I got tired of them lol)  Quorn does these lovely fillets without breadcrumbs too, they are SUPER low cap considering the size.  Find a good pop and bam.  Tasty! Unsure if they're vegan though...   And if you wanna feel young they also do chicken nuggets, sometimes I treat myself to them :D and these ARE available in the vegan variety!",False,False

Have you ever heard of Fry's? It's a vegan brand. It isn't low cal specifically but I can handle some of the portion sizes.  Like their vegan sausage rolls are dainty and nice.  The hot dogs are one of my vices.   Bonus, subway is still doing a meatball marinara for vegans atm.  The 6inch is 343 cals or something.  Not bad for a sub.   Milk substitute? I use unsweetened almond milk.  It's low cal, and it's packed full of vitamin e.",False,False
