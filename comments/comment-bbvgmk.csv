I’ve been seeing therapists since before I developed my ED or lost my dad, and they’re not just for when things get “bad enough.” Even as you heal they can give you helpful tools to stay on track. Plus, you can cry and obsess about whatever you want every session without worrying about wearing out their patience because you pay them. 😉",False,False

I lost my dad a few months ago and that’s when my ED really started flaring up. I had a mental breakdown on Wednesday because I ate a grilled cheese sandwich, and I told my therapist that it was so weird that this is what I’m focusing on right now. She said, “Well, it’s easier to cry over a sandwich than your dad.” So it makes sense how you feel. I’m so sorry for your loss, try to be kind to yourself.",False,False
