The long-term damage of being underweight for a longer time shows up pretty late, especially regarding bone health. I have met plenty of ""older"" women in my support group (aged 40-65) who were fine being underweight when they were younger, but are now facing the consequences.  I'll never get tired of preaching this: Being underweight on the BMI scale is awful for your health, and only morbidly obese people have a higher mortality rate than slightly underweight ones, even when controlling for illnesses and such.  Are there maybe some people who have extremely small frames and are fine with being underweight? Surely. But BMI is a range for a reason and the 18.5 threshold exists for a reason, and I seriously doubt that suddenly 80% of insta health gurus naturally fall out of the norm.",False,False

They shouldn't be your role model or take their advice for health &amp; nutrition vs your doctors. There are so many of them on IG that clearly have Ed's or distorted eating habits at the very least sprinkled with MLMs. Glad you are focused on recovery.,False,False

They will do better if they eat a varied diet and at maintenance levels instead of restricting, but I have to wonder if it's just a matter of time before side effects will pop up.   Personally I can not be underweight and maintain good health, I think it has something to do with having a wide frame and carrying more muscle than average. Even if I'm eating a lot of healthy foods and keeping my calories up I still suffer fatigue, pain, insomnia, and shitty immune function (think, getting sick once or twice a month) if my BMI drops under 18.
