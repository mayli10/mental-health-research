It's hard, but really focus that you're eating enough to at least have milk for the baby. Or have formula on hand if that's not a concern. I know how it is, too. :/ I've got my nearly 2 year old still nursing and I feel bad that he says there's barely any milk now after like one minute. The body is usually pretty good at pulling things for the baby, so if nothing else, try to get the vitamins you need and enough calories to produce.",False,False
