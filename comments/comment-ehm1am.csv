I’d find it pretty triggering also.  My family is doing quite the opposite, I’m exhausted by seeing my family members with diabetes and heart disease k!ll themselves with unhealthy eating, they don’t even understand calories/macros, they drink sodas right and left. It’s wild I would help the but it’s not worth the risk on my part, they’d be like’what are you starving yourself?!’   One thing that I two myself and my friends with EDs, is to “get better” for you and just yourself, don’t recover or get healthier to please. Do it for your own performance. That mindset of putting myself first helped me so much. Oh, and don’t get me started on my grandparents trying to lose weight, they fat shamed themselves, it was torture XD",False,False
