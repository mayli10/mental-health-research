As Yatessc said, restricting causes short-term damage even if the person isn't clincially underweight, and the purpose of restoration is to stop that damage and start undoing it's effects.  OP, by all means ask your medical team these questions, and if they're any good they'll consider your emotional as well as physical needs in this situation. But they might be right, it's not as simple as saying that if your bmi is between x and y everything is 100% perfect and healthy.",False,False

Treatment should be to ""restore"" someone to a HEALTHY weight. How much did you weight pre-ED? Maybe they used that number?  For some people treatment probably (should) involve weight loss... imagine someone with BED who is overweight because of it. Developing normal eating habits as a result of stopping emotional eating would likely result in weight loss.",False,False

To recover you need to eat to give your body what it needs to fix this damage. That is why they want to to go over your ideal weight.   Also bmi is bullshit. I'm super bony and yet I'm considered overweight. I'm 6.5 and 215 lbs right now, overweight. At my lowest I was 189 lbs, normal for bmi and I couldn't sit for more then 10 min because I had no ass and my spine hurt from touching the chair back. Even laying in bed hurt but hay I was a normal bmi so that must be normal.  Just trust in the process.",False,False
