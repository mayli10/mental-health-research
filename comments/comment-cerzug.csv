Yeah, probably.

One of the other people in this thread mentioned famine as a possible type of trauma a causing changes in genes and it made me think of two study I learned about in my college intro genetics class. So this phenomenon is called epigenetics, the study of genetic change in organisms by modification of gene expression (aka switching genes on and off). There was a famous study done looking at Dutch people who lived through a famine, they looked at their DNA and the DNA of their children. The scientists found several patterns of methylation (a type of epigenetic modification that stops expression of genes) of DNA (one of which, for example, was linked to lower metabolism in their children) and theorized that these patterns may be related to the influence of the famine the parents experienced before the children were even born. Lower metabolism would have been beneficial for people living in famine, so it kinda makes sense why we would evolve to pass that on to our offspring. Link: https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.nytimes.com/2018/01/31/science/dutch-famine-genes.amp.html There‚Äôs also a study that looks at epigenetics in rats. Rats that were licked/nurtured as pups (babies) ended up giving birth to relaxed pups, and rats that were not licked/nurtured as pups were more anxious and prone to disease compared to the first group. They found that methylation played a role here too. This also kinda makes sense because if you were a rat in a dangerous environment without a parent caring for you, you would benefit by being more ‚Äúanxious‚Äù so you could be more alert about predators and stuff. Link: https://sites.bu.edu/ombs/2010/11/11/licking-rat-pups-the-genetics-of-nurture/  This shit is wild and there is so much more that needs to be studied so we can learn more about epigenetics. Also yeet my half-complete college biology degree is good for something I guess. If anyone knows more than I do or if I explained that badly feel free to add more/correct me.",False,False
