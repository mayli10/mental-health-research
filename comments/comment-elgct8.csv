I cycle constantly through being a grade a stereotypical myproana bitch to just struggle struggling my way to fast and eating 1000-1500 too a day and knowing that even though its low enough to be losing its not enough to be an eating disorder which i think just makes me purge more and more. And then I pretend I'm over it when I talk to my friends lol.,False,True
