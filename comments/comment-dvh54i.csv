I'd have to not care and be miserable. It makes me feel very alone. Usually I do care about whether I've eaten and what. I broke a mini-plateau recently and it triggered PTSD from the weight I lost last year. I was in two minds about it, like you've said   I'd been verbally assaulted last time I plummeted to around my LW and my relationships were more fractured and difficult. I felt dehydrated and weak. As I was coming out of it, I'd snap and binge automatically w/ little control over what I was doing. I kind of sabotaged the mini-plateau I broke recently and I think you feel better in the short-term  I wolfed down about 3k + yesterday. I didn't feel full afterwards or sick, my stomach was growling in the morning but I was pissed off over a mild weight increase. I was sore and tired af and I wanted to sleep all day. As the effects of restriction and stress set in again I became really agitated and manic. I'm going through a very stressful period atm",False,False

Tbh it helps avoid actual binges in the future and is actually crazy motivating. Lol. I do fast afterwards or before, though.   It‚Äôs like I take the control back from my idiot brain and idiot body.
