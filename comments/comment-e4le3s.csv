I feel like if it wasn't so incredibly hard to maintain a BMI that low then there would be more people doing it (sadly).

She was always skinny and appeared underweight and only became more so over time.   I am reminded of Audrey Hepburn who had lifelong health impacts and was always skinny after being malnourished as a child during WWII.   Perhaps that kind of thing could also explain Eugenia and other people who were underweight starting at a very young age. Just a thought.,False,False

This lead to me reaching 107 lbs. (i ate abt 800 calories on average)  After this i upped my calories to about 1200-1400 and slowly went down to 100 lbs. Now whenever i go under 100 lbs i get really hungry at like 4 am. Its kinda upsetting but i guess i have to live with it.,False,False
