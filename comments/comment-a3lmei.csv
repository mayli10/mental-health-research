It's better to have big ideas and scale back than start with something that's boring/uninspired in the first place, IMO.   Take care of yourself.

It's important to remind yourself that even though this project didn't work out, it was still a good idea. Maybe it's an idea you can use in the future for another project! I've always had issues with self esteem around exam time so I get how this can make you feel like you're a failure but it really does sound like it could have been a good movie bc of your perspective and it doesn't mean that you won't be able to work on a similar project in the future successfully because now you know how to manage the project properly to get it done in time.  &amp;#x200B;  I just want to let you know that you don't deserve to be so hard on yourself :) It's only one project for one class, and this is something that you can learn from and try to work on next semester.
