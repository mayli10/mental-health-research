I know she's extremely nervous right now. She set up the appointment yesterday and is seeing a doctor today. She just had another breakdown about the thought of even going to get help so we're currently dealing with that. I'm very nervous as well tbh. It's really tough to see her like this.  I'll certainly look into services around the area as well.  Thanks again!,False,True

That would include CBT or the relevant therapy that helps, as well as a dietitian. It consists of around 40 sessions, far more than what you get if you're going for depression/anxiety.  Waiting times can vary between places, but the aim is to see everyone within 4 weeks of referral. If it is longer, then her GP will take initial care until she can see a specialist. It'll likely be they monitor her weight to ensure she doesn't drop too much or too quickly, as well as any symptoms she's experiencing, mental and physical.  When seeing a specialist, the GP will still remain part of the care team, but may not be as intensely involved. Should her GP not take her concerns seriously, do encourage her to speak to someone else. Any doctor worth their merit will treat all patients with respect.  Only in extreme cases are people hospitalised and treated inpatient, so she'll still be able to live her life day to day without major disruption.  It might be worth looking at services in and around Manchester for a more accurate understating of what to expect, but I shouldn't have thought it would differ too much from down here, other than probably having more options available.",False,False
