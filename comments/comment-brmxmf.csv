I know everyone looks bad in them but it still catches me off guard lol,False,False

It plays better to a jury if shoplifters look gross and methy ... I can't look at myself in those because of how bad I look, but they also make my boyfriend look way worse than when I look over at the real deal, so take comfort!",False,False

I always come in looking dead and buying childrenâ€™s Motrin, laxatives, pedialyte, monster zero, diet root beer, and protein bars.   Usually I use self checkout when I can but Target now has cameras there and if the workers see what I see in that camera I look rough and sketchy lmao",False,False

I feel shitty abt it either way I either feel like everyone can tell that I have an ED and is judging me or thinks that I'm a fat lazy slob. Trying to recover and trying to stop only using self check has been a trip.,False,False
