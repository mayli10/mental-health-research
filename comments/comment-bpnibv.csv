I guess all my issues got solved because the person who promised us free tickets didnâ€™t actually have them, and Iâ€™m not about to drop that much money on the ticket. So, yay?   Iâ€™ve also been ridiculously bloated, but I managed to eat a good, nutritious high fiber meal of beans, sweet potato, broccoli, spinach, quinoa and some chicken. Hopefully that will help with constipation (I plan on using lax anyway but Iâ€™m trying okay)  In a moment of weakness, I asked my dad to bring back my favourite cheese danishes from out of town (he was there on a work trip) and he brought back a ton and now Iâ€™m just trying really hard to control myself.",False,False

My partner kind of made me drink these horrible shakes with milk and protein and other shit when I was fasting when I spent time with her since it would be the only thing I'd eat that day.

I'm sick of this thing called life and want to leave it. Not even because of my ED but because my self confidence is at an all time low and i can't seem to do anything right.   I used to be really good at football but since i lost a bunch of weight I've just gone to shit. *I* was the person everyone thought ""woah look at this kid, she's really good"". I was renowned for being that kid on the team who was a really good tackler and, i kid you not, there were kids who were scared of me because of how easily i could knock them down. Now the tables have turned and now i'm the one being crushed by other kids. Tackling was the only thing i was good at and it didn't matter because i did it so well. Now i'm not big enough to do that. I'm weak and slow. I'm short so now that i'm not fat, i don't have a chance of even doing my job during the game (defending) since everyone else is bigger or just straight up better than me and it's really getting me down.

For example, I usually can't go and take a shit until 1 pm because my parents are now in a bedroom attached to the only upstairs bathroom. My dad will keep the bedroom door open and quietly watch TV until he leaves in the early afternoon. Which means he can hear everything in the house, even downstairs.  I stay in the attic now, and when I walk down in the morning he has this way of yelping 'hello!' that startles the FUCK out of me. I also avoid the kitchen until he's gone, because small talk quickly leads to him wondering why I haven't finished Crime and Punishment or why I haven't written a book yet (seriously).   And I notice their disappointment, because right now I'm not in school, I don't have a job and I mostly stay home being severely depressed. Everything is a fucking mess.",False,False
