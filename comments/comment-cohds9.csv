I'm sorry you have to deal with the projections of your own father's weight issues. You should just tell him that you have an eating disorder and that it is very triggering to hear him make comments about your food intake/habits. Maybe he's just not aware of how it effects you, honestly, I can't even talk to my own boyfriend about this because he doesn't get it. One day he'll tell me I look ""cancer patient skinny"" but then he will give me crap about binging after 2 days of not eating. He ends up making me feel like a fat fuck and I get so jealous that he can eat whatever he wants and stop when he's full. Difference is, he says he gets annoyed by how much money of his I spend when I do actually binge- especially cause I c/s. Still...sucks.",False,False

Not much to say here except he's an a-hole and you deserve better, lmao. Seriously? Giving you grief over GREEN BEANS?  It's awfully hard to deal with family members who project their own insecurities onto you. In a weird, messed up way, it's kind of their way of trying to protect us, I think - they worry about how other people will perceive/treat you, so they try and prevent that happening, but then something gets lost in brain-mouth transition and what they end up doing does more harm than good.  I hope you can put some distance between yourself and him soon if he doesn't have an epiphany and shape up.",False,False
