My impression is that low-restricting anorexics *tend* to not feel hungry, don't like the feeling of being full, don't watch food-related stuff like mukbangs, etc. I high restrict -- 800 at my consistent lowest, currently trying for 1500 for maintenance/possibly recovery -- and I feel hungry pretty much all the time. There's the 1-3 hours after dinner, depending on how big the meal was, where I feel full, and the early morning hours when I'm never hungry, but otherwise I always feel that hollow, sinking feeling of hunger. I don't really mind though??? It's kind of just part of my life. It's also oddly satisfying sometimes, like... *""I'm hungry but I don't need to eat; I'm in control.""* I get more frustrated when I feel weak and dizzy.",False,False

Something upset me earlier so i skipped dinner. It’s horrible. I’m hungry but i cannot eat.",False,False

Otherwise I eat about as much as I did while restricting.  If it wasn’t for that I’d probably just end up fasting myself to bones because eating isn’t enjoyable to me - I hate chewing and saliva and have never liked eating to begin with so :/ idk.,False,False

Some days (like today), I have no appetite at all. And then there’s occasionally days where I am literally consumed with insatiable hunger. Luckily those days are much less often",False,False
