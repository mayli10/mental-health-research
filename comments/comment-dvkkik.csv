The following should be read at of course your own discretion.   ED YA: Believarexic by JJ Johnson Stick Figure by Lori Gottlieb Does this book make me look fat by marissa Walsh (but it‚Äôs multiple stories with multiple body image themes, ED is just one of them)  Self-harm YA: Scars by Cheryl rainfield Cut by Patricia McCormick  Weight loss YA: 45 pounds by KA Barson Butter by Erin jade lange Huge by Sasha Paley The earth, my butt, and other big round things by Carolyn Mackler  I have lots more that I haven‚Äôt read, but those are some I plucked from my goodreads",False,False

Overall, really good.   *Girl in Pieces* (YA fiction) is on my to-read list but I‚Äôm staying away for now since it centers around self-harm and I don‚Äôt want to risk amping up those urges within myself right now.   I own *Wintergirls* myself but after I wasn‚Äôt liking the initial vibe I went and found the synopsis online - definitely not one I plan to finish reading.",False,False
