Did this by staying at 1200 calories 6x a week with a “cheat meal” on weekends, usually over 2000 cals. Was all great until towards the end when got obsessed with the number on the scale and restricted too low for long. This caused my cheat days to turn to binge eating days. The binge eating became a bad habit I can’t break and my eating has become more disorders while trying to find a middle ground. I don’t think I’ll ever be normal now",False,False

I don’t really know how though.",False,False
