I don’t know about other places, but in Canada I know you can just go to a walk-in clinic and be seen by a doctor by yourself.   If you can’t do that, just tell your parents. If they ask, you were constipated and took them for their original purpose as directed. It’s better to be safe than sorry.  Also, as someone who misuses lax, stop it while you can. It doesn’t affect your actual weight and it messes with your gut so you’ll be more bloated and constipated in the long run.",False,False

I binged on some low fibre foods and so i knew I'd need help getting it out so i took a pill, waited the standard 6 hours.. nothing, took a second one- bloating began, 6 more hours- sudden cramping and a huge asf fart (lol) and then it ALL came out, a lot of water too. So well i know it's late but for future reference don't take 2 of a lax pill especially if they're the stimulant type but now that you have just wait for it to pass out, the cramping is cause your digestive organ muscles are spasming tf out, drink some water and soon you should poop it all out and feel immediate relief, if not then yeah do go to a doctor if possible, it could be something else and Something much more serious",False,False
