Anecdotally, I did have horrible migraines as a child, with nausea and light intolerance.  The migraines usually kept me in bed for hours, until the pain got so bad I  would vomit.  The headache would often be relieved after I threw up....coincidence that I only feel good when I am empty now?",False,False

In my messed up brain I have an image of a ambitious hardworking go-getter kind of girl. I need to have the grades, the looks, the popularity. All of it. Controlling what I eat is a way to tangibly do it everyday. It's like a high for me.
