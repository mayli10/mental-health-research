I work 24/7 then I save up and go to trips and watch Kpop concerts and American music as well. I read fanfics (well written ones) and I sing a lot in the car. I guess that is my escape. Good music.,False,False

I lose a lot of sleep daydreaming (nightdreaming?) when I should be asleep. I think it has gotten worse since developing my ED as a lot of situations I dream about involved my ED in some way",False,False

Especially when I'm listening to music. I'll get lost in my thoughts, imagining myself in various situations, etc. There are probably various reasons why, perhaps because i am bored or maybe because it's a way to evade ""real life"" but yeah, it's definitely something I do as well.",False,False

I think for me it's at a point where it's maladaptive daydreaming. it genuinely concerns me, how much I do it, and the detail and comfort I get from them. It kinda disconnects me from reality a bit. remembering that it's not real is always a little painful, too. I always did it as a kid, but my ed has made my daydreaming worse. Probably because it's isolated me and loneliness/unfulfilled social/care needs are often a cause for it. Man it sucks though.",False,False
