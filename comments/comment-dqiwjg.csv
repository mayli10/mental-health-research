And if they question it, bring up all of that. It’s disrespect. They’re not even trying to actually know you. You’re not comfortable or okay with it. If they want to make those comments or jokes, they’re free to do it anywhere else to anyone else. But not to you. You’re in control of what goes on in your world. And that shit isn’t invited.",False,False

I do sometimes correct people but, they go back to their old ways and do that shit again. But it’s not just the name calling that bothers me, I don’t like standing or sitting or being next to my sister in public because it makes it seem like we are a pair. I avoid her mostly in public, and she does too so it’s a mutual thing.   Next time someone says some shit I’m snapping for real. No one is going to fuck with me again, I’ve had to many meltdowns over this shit and quite frankly I’m over it.   IF ANYONE tries to make a joke, guess what reverse card back on you. You want me to feel insecure? Right back on you. Taste the medicine.",False,True

People don’t cause others’ eating disorders. But that’s a discussion for another time.   You’re in control of molding and expressing your own identity. You have to force people to see it and, essentially, adhere to it. You don’t want to be known as The Twin? Then don’t be The Twin. Correct them. Make them say your name. Say it like a bitch. Make them feel bad for not using it. They should feel bad. It’s fucking disrespectful.   I’m not in the same situation, but a similar, I suppose. My name is, for reasons beyond me, easily confused with about 10 other names. Which is so, so ridiculously *dumb* because my name is 4 letters and spelled fucking phonetically. But I digress.   I’ve had issues with social anxiety my whole life, so for most of it I let it slide. I’d answer to shitty renditions of my name and maybe correct someone once or twice when we first meet. Otherwise, I’d rely on someone else correcting them or them figuring it out on their own eventually. I didn’t want to make things uncomfortable or awkward, you know? But then, I don’t know. It just hit me and I snapped. That they’re not calling me by my name. By **my** name. They’re not taking the time or thought to even learn my actual. Fucking. Name. So I got *angry*. And you know what? I’m *right* to be angry. It is, as I said before, *disrespectful* as all hell to have them address me with something that’s not even close to my actual name.   So now I correct them. Every time. And I’ll sound like a bitch sometimes. Because it’s *my* name. You use *my* name when addressing me. Fuck it if they act hurt like it’s an accident. Good. Then they won’t fuck it up again. My name is apart of who I am. So fucking it up is inexcusable.   So, fuck em. Show them who you are because they’re not seeing it and they’re not going to see it until you make them. You eating or not eating doesn’t have to have anything to do with it. Scream who you are in their faces. Be seen. Have your identity. *make* your identity. So many people think it’s *find* but no. It’s **make**. You **make** yourself. You **build** yourself. You **declare** yourself. You don’t leave who you are in others hands.   Anyway I got on a tangent about this but basically, be a bitch cos fuck other people they should address you as an individual. But you do have to make that happen, yourself.",False,False
