But yeah I know it's just science that I should be losing weight, it's just frustrating when this happens :( And my anxiety makes me panic.  Thank-you for the comment",False,True

Give it like two more weeks and you’ll probably see a whoosh. It’s physics but bodies act weird.,False,False

Two weeks after a carb increase wouldn’t have an effect on water weight if you went back to low carb after, and I’ve never had an issue with diet soda causing weight retention (and I drink way more of it than you).   This is just something bodies do sometimes. A couple weeks ago I was pissed because I’d burned two pounds worth of calories over four days and the scale wasn’t shifting, but after a while I whooshed.   If it were me, I would try the cheat day trick, but obviously that’s up to you to decide whether you can take that mentally, I understand some people can’t. Otherwise you just gotta wait it out. Your body isn’t going to defy physics, the scale will catch up with you eventually. Hope you’re okay.",False,False

I’m 119kg and 178cm. So a lot of fat to lose.   Yep, I weigh and measure EVERYTHING. I normally over estimate to be safe - been doing this for months.   No, exercise is the same. I’ve been doing less the last 2 months because I’ve been feeling so light headed and weak, but it didn’t impact the numbers any other time except last 3 weeks.   I do low carb and when I do eat it’s whole foods. However 2 weeks ago there were 4 days where I went a bit crazy and went over my carb limit for the first (and last) time ever, but it’s been 2 weeks, could that still impact it? I’ve also started drinking diet soda the last 2 weeks instead of eating, so I guess that could be it. I only drank water before. It’s only like 2 calories per drink though and I’ve only had 1 per day max, sometimes I have none. But it seems like it would be a lot of fluid retention if that’s true and i just struggle to believe that. The weight loss has slowed so dramatically.   Thank-you for the thorough comment, I appreciate it.",False,True

Couple things:  1) have you been recalculating your TDEE every time you lose significant weight?  2) have you been weighing and measuring your food accurately or just going by what MyFitnessPal says?  3) have you added any exercise that you weren’t doing before?  4) what kinds of foods are you eating? If you’ve increased your carb or salt intake recently, it’s probably mostly water retention.   If none of the above is the cause then I’d say just try a cheat day or eating above your TDEE for a few days. Tends to shake things up and get weight loss back on track pretty reliably.",False,False
