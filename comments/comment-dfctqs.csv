I owe it all to the months I spent in residential. The professionals there were the ones who set me up with my meal plan and eating schedule, gave me back my hunger cues, taught me to cope with self harm urges, practiced exposures with me, taught me to eyeball serving sizes, built up my self esteem... the list goes on and on.    As for my meal plan specifically -- knowing *what* I have to eat (loosely -- I have to eat certain food groups in certain amounts, what I choose to meet the requirements is up to me) and *when* I have to eat (I eat five times a day, 3 meals 2 snacks, so I don't really get hungry) brings me comfort, and knowing that I *have* to stick to my medically prescribed plan reduces my shame. A lot of my binge behavior comes from shame + food anxiety, and I think that's true for a lot of people. So my plan overall reduces the urge to binge.    I still have bad days where I revert to all my disordered habits but over time it's getting easier :)",False,False
