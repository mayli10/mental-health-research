It's great for breaking fasts too because it's easy on the stomach.,False,False

It's nowhere near as filling as real milk but also nowhere near the calories and has plenty of calcium.,False,False

My mom got Wendy's the other day and everything on the menu is like 1000 plus. Like how do people eat like that? Even if you don't have an ed that shit is so unhealthy ðŸ˜·ðŸ˜·ðŸ˜·ðŸ˜· if you eat three meals a day like that you're def getting diabetes.,False,False

Like my mind goes ""omg id die if i did that"" but then i feel bad for having thoughts that invalidate bed. My binges are more like two cups of greek yogurt and a half carton of almond milk haha.",False,False

What the fuck is maintenance? What do non disordered people eat? How do people not continually lose or gain? How many calories per day do they eat and do they actually count them, do they eat the same thing every day, if they go over budget one day does their body naturally tell them to eat less later? Do they wake up and run 3 miles every morning? I see my slim coworkers constantly drinking frappes and eating granola bars throughout the day and all I can think about is HOW????",False,False

Just recently it hit me that what I used to call a meal I now call a massive binge. And it's weird at restaurants like seeing the menu and seeing everything is like 1000+ calories and people enjoying it and im like ?????????? this is literally days worth of food on a plate and you can just eat it all at once like that????????,False,False
eopsk1o,t3_bsrear,t3_bsrear,hammerprice,1,2019-05-25 03:53:19,/r/EDAnonymous/comments/bsrear/dae_have_such_a_warped_perception_of_food_that/eopsk1o/,"Yes lol. I mean in both ways. I CANNOT serve reasonable sized portions, to myself for others. They always end up massive unless I'm consciously eating less. I literally would not be able to tell you what a normal, healthy portion for an adult is, even if I can guestimate the calories of it, because the portions I want are way too big and the portions I need are way too small.  And then in the same way as you, I'll eat a bunch and I'll freak out and panic about how much I've binged and how I must've eaten so much etc etc and then I finally buck up and put it in MFP and realise that I didn't even break my TDEE. Like, I used to PROPER binge if I was going to binge, 4000+ kcal easy in one go, and now even when I think I've completely lost control I realise that I'm like... at most eating maintenance.  That said I don't think the amount you eat or the type of food is what makes something a binge. Feeling out of control over your eating is what makes it a binge, IMO. So freaking out over eating an apple is not invalidating BED, because if you were compelled to fucking devour that apple even though it made you feel bad, that was a binge, mentally. Conversely, I can sit down and make a conscious decision to eat over my allowance for the day and have it NOT be a binge if I am in control and making a rationalised decision (and not in the sense of ""because I'll fast/exercise purge/whatever to make up for it later"").  So it doesn't matter if it's 80cal of apple, it can still be a binge, while 1800cal of pasta and ice cream might not be if you're in control.  Sorry, I rambled lol. Word binge. But you're valid.",False,False

I forced down a few bites of grilled chicken and some garlic butter angel hair pasta at work (I'm sick and haven't eaten and thought some food would be beneficial, considering all the meds and I'm a waitress so I needed to not be so dizzy) and I logged it as 800 calories and felt disgusting.   It was all I ate all day. Even if it was 800, why would that be bad? But yes I was convinced it was this insane binge. A kids meal. Of grilled chicken and a tiny portion of angel hair pasta. I, a 27 year old woman, felt like I binged on a child's meal.   So anyway short answer, yes.",False,False
