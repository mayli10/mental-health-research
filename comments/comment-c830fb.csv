But its great that you are now feeling more comfortable about trusting your therapist and getting help. Let them know that your food relationship isn’t as healthy as you have always led them to believe, but now you would really appreciate some advice/help about it.",False,False

It is super common for the harder stuff to come out in therapy over time. If she is a good therapist, she will be proud of you for coming forward with it and your relationship will be stronger. You can just tell her at the beginning of the apt you have something you need to discuss and maybe either write out or think of what you will say and what you’d be comfortable sharing. You can do it!",False,False
