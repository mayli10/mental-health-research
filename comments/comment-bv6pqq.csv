I managed to save my computer~The battery is dead but I’ll be able to use it.  I’m really happy it works again. I need particular softwares to work, I couldn’t have worked on a library computer. But the 100$ solution is good to know ! Thank you",False,True

There are several things you can do to try to save it! Articles like [this one](https://www.pcworld.com/article/3067332/when-water-coffee-or-liquid-spills-on-your-laptop-do-this.html) are helpful. I've spilled drinks into the keyboard of my MacBook Pro twice and was able to recover it both times.  I hate how anxiety and depression can make you feel like one tiny mistake is the end of the world. It's not. It never is. Even if the computer is totaled, you have other options. You can work on a library computer until you save up enough to buy a new one. A basic, bottom-of-the-line desktop computer (all you need to work on school work) at Best Buy is around $100, and will serve until you can afford to replace the better one.",False,False
