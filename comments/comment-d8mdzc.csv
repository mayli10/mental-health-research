If you want something a little sweet you can do apple cider vinegar, mustard and the sweetener of your choice (Stevia, honey, agave, sugar, etc.)",False,False

Then figure out what you want to bulk it out with! Fruit like apples and blueberries are good and low-cal, but will limit what else you can add without clashing flavors. If you add fruit, you're more limited to things like feta or granola for the rest of the toppings.   I far prefer savory salads bulked out with veggies. You can add shredded carrots, cherry tomatoes, raw cauliflower, bell peppers, cucumbers, whatever you like! I also like to add a hard-boiled egg to my salads.   The dressing will probably be the most calorie-heavy part- I've been using a balsamic vinaigrette that's 70 calories per 2 tbsp.",False,False
