I allow myself to just eat when I'm studying or writing assignments because I need my grades to be good to pull my weighed average mark up. So I spend a lot of time carefully planning eating and working out around study blocks. I study online, so that means I can set my own schedule. Which helps.  So when I'm not studying, I starve and restrict like crazy. Here, the academic year runs from March to October, so I have January and February (December is a write off because of Christmas and all of the attendant food related end of year junk). So this year I'll fast for 14 days from 27 December, then refeed, because my brother's birthday is in the middle of January and I'll be expected to go to dinner. And then I'll go back to another extended fast, trying to drop my weight and give me a buffer before the academic year restarts in March.  TL;DR I really really relate. I romanticism fasting and starving and I don't really know why, because I'm bad at it.",False,False

I have a physics exam tomorrow morning so I am eating oatmeal now to study... hope the calories help me focus.,False,False
