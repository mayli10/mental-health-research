I'm doing IF/OMAD because it lets me have something but also keeps me from eating constantly. I can put away so much and yeah, not even a binge, I'm just hungry all the time and I can eat so much without feeling full most of the time.  It's embarrassing and so so annoying!",False,False

I can eat so much food that I physically hurt and I still have that “hungry” sensation. Intuitive eating would never work for me. I find that intermittent fasting or OMAD work best for me (I’m “recovered” or not really trying to lose any weight right now, but I have disordered thoughts out the wazoo). The later in the day I wait to eat the less “hungry” I am, if that makes sense. If I eat breakfast I am a bottomless pit all day. If I wait and eat a late lunch or only eat dinner I’m usually okay. But once I eat my hunger level goes from “huh, I’m peckish” to “FEED ME”. I wasn’t always like this, but after a couple of years of constant binging my hunger/fullness queues are gone.",False,False

Every time I read about those challenges at restaurants to eat a large amount of food in a certain time I always think “why is that even a challenge? That’s easy. I’d just hate myself for it” lol  We got dominos the other night after grilling out and drinking at the pool all day. Then on the way home I picked up canes bc I was still starving. Then I ate cake &amp; a kit kat after bc it’s all I really had but I was still SO hungry even after the dominos and canes.,False,False
