Especially if you're female  \-ESPECIALLY if you're lean, you will have more noticeable bloat some days than others/carry a food baby visibly. Personal example: most days, my TDEE is close to 3000. For the past week, I've been closer to 2000, because I've had to drive a lot instead of bike. Visible difference. (Sucks that I'm happier when I'm more active, but dislike how my belly looks when I'm eating enough to sustain that activity)  \-Nobody's stomach looks flat when they're looking at it right down from the top. Nobody's. Well, maybe bodybuilders during comp season get this (actually going to ask one of the ones I know now, cause I'm curious)  \-EVERYONE'S belly rolls a bit if they sit down. Think about it. You'd split open when you stood otherwise.   \-There are different degrees of ""flat""... for instance, mine is fairly flat to my eyes. Others see it as ""extremely flat"". If you let yourself obsess over it, it'll become one of those things where it's never enough.   \-Pictures people take of themselves with their washboard abs are usually taken right after they've gotten up, after they've shit, before they've eaten much, and on a day when they're looking ""dry"" regardless. The more muscle/less fat they have, the less it takes to have this look...but again, see above",False,False

Women also tend to have a much more prominent hip tilt, which makes the ‚Äúpooch‚Äù much more significant. This is why even women with low body fat percentages will often (there obviously are people out there who don‚Äôt because the human body is a fuckin paradox) not reach a full-on ‚Äúflat tummy‚Äù.

But like the other comment- the uterus is layered with other organs and does cause protrusion. It sits between the bladder and the colon, which in comparison to males who do not have that extra chunk, causes a bit of a ‚Äúpooch‚Äù and makes whatever fat may be there look more than it is, and keep a ‚Äúpooch‚Äù even with very low body fat and being underweight. And fun fact- organs are not static in the body. They move around! So some days your uterus could be sitting a bit more forward and an intestine could be squished somewhere it wasn‚Äôt the other day. This coupled with how our hips tilt in comparison to men‚Äôs makes it a lot more noticeable.   Some women, like me, have uteruses that swell during hormonal fluctuations due to medical conditions which make it even more prominent.   Granted, I am talking about the lower stomach/abdomen. Other parts of the stomach could be anything from fat to an enlarged liver.   The human body is goddamn annoying and our brains make it even stupider.
