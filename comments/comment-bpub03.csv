I know with things like potassium it can burn the inner lining of your stomach if it all ends up in one spot. I'm sure different medications can have different effects on your stomach if they sit there with nothing else.",False,False

The reason is it changes the amount of time the drug will be in different parts of your digestive tract and that matters for how the drug is designed to be absorbed and where. So, roughly 50-100 calories is actually all that takes. (I develop new drugs).",False,False

I had to take mine at bedtime because it was supposed to help me fall asleep. Which it did but I didn't stay a sleep. I hate going to bed on a full stomach, it's like a brick. It was supposed to help with impulse control but I was still compulsively shopping on the internet after a year of taking it so....",False,False

I fucking hate when I forget to take it when I’m eating already and have to eat again. I tried it without a meal a few times and my brain goes haywire. Also eating 350 calls before bed SUCKS.,False,False

Antibiotics, iron supplements, painkillers etc. can make you super ill when taken on an empty stomach. So you don’t need a full meal, just something to fill up some space in your stomach. Think in terms of “bulk” rather than calorie amount. Like a piece of bread, some oatmeal, or a banana.   Other than that there are a couple fat-soluble vitamins (like a, d, e, or k) that need to be taken with some fat (like 10-20g) to be most effective. So with these, eat a small amount of peanut butter or maybe a boiled egg.",False,False

I know for Latuda they specifically say at least 300 cal for the med to be maximally effective, but I think that’s kinda an unusual case. Your doc can probably tell you specifically for your med. It’s a valid question for anyone to ask!",False,False
