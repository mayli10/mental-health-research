In any close relationship you should be able to talk openly about what you're going through simply for the sake of understanding. That doesn't mean you are the responsibility of whoever you're venting to. It doesn't mean it's now their job to fix you. The only exception is when you're a child and ask a parent for help. That's the only time somebody else should feel the need to help you get better in whatever way they can. OP's boyfriend isn't their dad though.

And yea, if OP has to miss school so they can get help then duh that’s better than having an ED with the distraction of productivity. Education doesn’t matter if you can’t leave your bed, or you’re dead ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ so many people have to put their education on hold for health reasons and they are able to successfully get back to school after they’re better.   It’s totally reasonable to expect someone to put their life on hold for recovery because for some (dare I say most) that’s the ONLY way. Intensive care, residential treatment, 100% focus on getting better with a care team that can help at every step of the way - I can’t believe you think school is more important. School can be redone. Life can’t.   Again, bf is probably doing the only thing they know they can. They might think that by reporting OP their family will become aware and will be able to help OP get better.

Like if they ends up being told they're not able to go to school they won't have that to help distract them throughout the day. You can even look at it as not just a distraction because I know firsthand how easy it is for your mental health to plummet when you're not able to do anything productive. Plus, why would you *ever* threaten the education of somebody you care about? Like, you do realize how much education matters right? If I were in the BFs shoes I would never want to risk my partner's education because that can lead to so much more struggling in the future. OP knows better what's good for them than their boyfriend does. It's up to OP to get help and OP's boyfriend can really just do his best to support his partner through this awful situation. Plus, getting help for mental illness is really difficult. It's not reasonable to expect somebody to put their life on hold to focus solely on recovery. Even getting help for a physical illness can be an incredibly arduous process. I personally have an undiagnosed chronic illness which greatly impacts my ability to perform as a student, but I also can't just drop out of school and sit around waiting for somebody to decide it's time to help me. What I'm saying is that it's absolutely ridiculous of the BF to assume OP can just get better on a whim and putting OP through this extra stress is only going to make things worse.
