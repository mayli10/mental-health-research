I think my parents got into that self-centered fear of “How did this happen? Are we bad parents?” which can come out in *really* helpful ways. Most especially as anger/frustration, and in the sort of defensiveness and ‘thishurtsmeeetoooo’ crap that it sounds like your mom let herself run with today. I’m sorry she’s doing that. It’s so so so the opposite of helpful. I really hope she’ll figure out how to listen and how to hear you. And hope that other people around you will step up to offer love and support &lt;3",False,False
