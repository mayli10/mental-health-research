I'll be brief. *Bang* after my ""victory boast,"" Food spoke back, said *""So you think you got this, huh?""* Next 13 days (while trying to fast, mind you) I ate *every day,* from 1000aCals to 4500Cals. Yep, binges occurred. But since then, an additional 15 days till today, April 12, I've fasted eight or so times, at 24hrs to 74hrs a pop. So roughly, it's been *alternate day fasting,* a day, two, or three fasting, then a day of moderate eating in a 3hr window… lather, rinse, repeat.  This is working for me! ***I'm still claiming victory.*** It's not that I've kicked Food's butt, certainly I haven't kicked Food to the curb. It's that my adversarial view is gone. Food's not my foe, but my friend.  And this is going just swell.",False,True

My fasting-tracking app is Fastient, and it's such fun — a nice motivator. But the million-dollar question, to paraphrase you, is *What's been different this time versus the rest?*  Well, I've been chasing down the goal of a ten-day fast, feels like forever — and I just haven't come near. Always, I cave inside 5 days, and it's been driving me batsh¡t. Everything else in my dietary life is pretty much copacetic and divine, except *this one gap.* And so I've been fixating on this failure and obsessing over food, cultivating a hatred for food (when ackchally I *love* food) and just feeling like a hopelessly trapped *A1 Loser* — all the friggin' time.  Finally, I've just relaxed and recognized that the way I'm living, a healthy guy aged 61yrs with a pattern I've called ""hybrid AD fasting"" (pretty much like the last two weeks as I've summarized 'em, and perfect for me) is a dream. Why am I demonizing food and making my life one miserable ordeal? No need, *I've arrived.*  Like I said, I could ride like this forever… *And it feels just fine.*",False,True
