I ended up going downstairs to find my cat for some comfort. Well I found him, with a new toy? Wait....... yeah, he’d caught a small mouse - still alive which was found out later - anyway, that triggered my OCD for a few reasons and unluckily I had a major panic attack but luckily that made the urges go away bc i felt so sick over it and couldn’t think of eating.   I could’ve done without the freak out, but hey ho at least I didn’t give in?  I’m definitely going to try your suggestions next time lol.",False,True
