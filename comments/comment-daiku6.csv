You, me, all of us deserve attention love and help specially whenever we are struggling, we deserve it and need it to survive. So come here any time you need to and we will make our best to float you with all the love.   Maybe just ask your bf to do something, think on a movie you want to watch, so you can be with him and hopefully feel better.  You are doing great and stay strong! I clean my house to avoid s.h. and my kitty makes sure that there is always hairs to clean  :)",False,False
