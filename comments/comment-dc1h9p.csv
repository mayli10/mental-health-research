If you care about someone you don't put them down even if they have the ""wrong"" facts. Even those relationships built on roasting each other have their limits because it's meant to come from love, not a need to show off how much smarter/better you are.  If your gf who you know has an eating disorder says she hopes she loses 8 lbs by tomorrow, even as a joke, maybe tell her not to be too hard on herself like, idk, a human being with basic empathy? You deserve better than someone who cares more about being right than actually listening to you and supporting you through this journey. I hope you can heal safely ‚ù§Ô∏è",False,False

Even if you *had* been wrong about something unrelated, that'd have been a douchey, gloaty way of trying to ~enlighten~ you about it. Nobody knows everything, him included. Sounds a bit immature and arrogant tbh.",False,False

Maybe you should tell him not to make comments about your weight or weight loss/gain at all.   Do not let a man make you feel bad about your body please.
