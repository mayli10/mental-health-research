She gets lipo, serious lipo all the time on her tummy. Her boobs are real but she got a lift because they would be saggy otherwise. And she's had a lot of work done on her face too.  &amp;#x200B;  Even after al that work, she still photoshops the hell out of her IG photos.   &amp;#x200B;  She is a horrible influence on women and seriously seems to get off on making other girls feel bad about themselves (I remember her posting a picture of her next to a plus-size friend in a bikini, knowing fully well the trolls would attack her friend). She's deeply insecure though, which is where all the attention seeking and constant surgery comes from.",False,False

Op was kinda putting her on a pedestal, as if op has to try really hard day and night to be skinny while Emily just is thin and doesn‚Äôt try but thats probably not the case at all, Emilys life probably revolves around maintaining her look.
