Periods can be stopped, delayed or even come early because of stress, high BMI, low BMI, depression, low activity level, too high activity level, poor eating habits, erratic sleep schedules, supplements (synthetic and natural) and even MEDICATION (especially anti depressants and anti psychotics).   I find a few sessions of heavy exercise such as long cardio and lifting brings me my period when it is late. Although, that hasn't worked for me.   If it is more than two weeks late, get a pregnancy test ASAP. Preferably, see a doctor or clinic specialist for pregnancy. If it is not pregnancy, see your GP for a standard blood test. If you have been missing a period for more than a few months, see an Gynecologist asap and ask for an exam.",False,False
