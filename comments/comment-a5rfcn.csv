One!!  &amp;#x200B;  I am currently studying abroad. I am pretty deep in my eating disorder, after relapsing this spring. I am having a good time, but it sure as hell could be a lot easier for me to be here, if I wasn't so consumed by this. My academics are failing. I have to lie down a lot, and sometimes it's been hard to physically go to my classes. I am tired. And exhausted. And no matter how much I convince myself that my ED is not affecting my social life, it is. There are some food-related stuff (e.g. eating together every night) that I can't handle participating in, and I especially won't participate in stuff that is planned last minute, as I most likely will not have saved the calories for it.   &amp;#x200B;  The first time I studied abroad, 3 years ago, I was in quasi recovery. I still struggled with food and calories, but the experience was a lot easier than now. I had more energy, I could participate in all social activities that included food, and I just overall felt better. While both experiences have been great and given me so many good memories, my first time abroad was definitely easier to enjoy, because I was focusing on the actual experience. No matter how much we try to tell ourselves that the eating disorder won't consume us, it will. And you will for sure end up focusing more on your eating, than on actually being in Spain.  &amp;#x200B;  You might have more money to go to Budapest if you spend less money on eating. You might also be too tired and exhausted and anxious about food to actually enjoy the trip. I hope you choose option 2. Your eating disorder shouldn't be allowed to take more of your life, than it (I assume) already has. Either way, I hope you get a wonderful experience studying abroad!",False,False
