Even though I've lost over 55 lbs I still feel like a fraud. I go to this speciality lifting gym and it's so hard seeing everyone look perfect and I'm not.   What has been helping me is trying to tough it out. More exposure therapy, trying to challenge myself to talk to them and just not stay inside my head. It kind of sucks but when they are nice and talk back to me it helps humanize it a bit as opposed to a me vs. them sort of thing.   I hope you feel better soon. It's so hard.",False,False

I'm staying home from work today partially because I just can't handle seeing all the beautiful skinny women coming in shopping.   They've been priming me for a great promotion in my department, and I'm thinking about switching to the basement to do inbound and sacrificing what could be a great step in the right direction, just so I can be out of the public eye and not see anyone, because I can't handle it.   Sucks man",False,False
