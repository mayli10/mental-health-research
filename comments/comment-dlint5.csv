Very rarely, my ED is the only thing bringing me down in life, which also sucks, but bingeing helps me when I want to kill myself by making me numb and worry about food and fat instead of suicide methods.

My life is \~actually\~ good and nothing is going wrong--you could even say that I'm pretty privileged, but my depression/mental health/ED/whatever takes priority, and if I'm not thin then nothing else truly matters. I don't have any hobbies anymore (unless EDs are a hobby). I try to play games or watch tv, but 9 times out of 10 I just spend my time looking at ED-related things and triggering myself or just being pessimistic about myself/others when it all just makes me more depressed and unhappy with myself lol.  At one point I don't want to be like this, but at the same time, I can't see myself not doing this, or not having an ED or not obsessing about food/body/weight. I don't understand how something can negatively impact my life so much, but the small positive effects/possibilities can make it all worth it??? I don't even fucking lose weight usually (been maintaining all year, gain/lose same 5 lbs) but when I restrict and lose weight, I feel so much better about myself, and I get that euphoric feeling. But then I binge and hate myself, but eventually get back into a restrict phase again. It's a really weird cycle of abuse :(  TLDR: My life is good but my brain thinks otherwise :D",False,False
