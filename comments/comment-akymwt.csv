Like sure friends and my bf say I’m pretty or whatever but like *I* know I’m not so surely there are other people who see it too :)))),False,False

It's very frustrating since at work we have to do a self-evaluation for performance reviews and people always have 'faith' in me **Why?** Why do you have faith in me, what do you see on this horrible disgusting person that I am?? It just feel so validating having people agree on how shitty I am.",False,False

We're more critical of our own appearance because we have to live looking like ourselves everyday. It also doesn't help when mainstream media puts out images of heavily photoshopped models that no one will ever be able to look like irl. Believe me, you do not look as bad as you think you do. I remember someone saying on here ""you're not ugly, you're just not your type, so it doesn't matter because you're not trying to date yourself"". Also I don't necessarily think that our flaws make us ugly. they make us unique and make us who we are. It'll take a very long time to start seeing things in that light, but you're still very young and going through a lot of changes and personal growth. ",False,False

I do this to myself all the time because I have a wonky face and it makes me laugh in a weird self deprecating way. Artists use this technique to find fault in their drawings ,False,False
