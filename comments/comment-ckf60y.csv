Food is meant to be enjoyed not feared and you deserve to find a little happiness within food :) I hope one day that I can have a better relationship with it again because the little moments of normality make me remember just how good and freeing it is to just enjoy food and not feel bad afterwards or ruining it by eating so much so that it hurts.,False,True

I'm currently not restricting/trying to stay on the wagon, as it were, but I vividly remember fantasising about eating a single Hobnob for weeks on end. As the weeks went by, I'd longingly, lovingly stare at the unopened packet that I kept on my nightstand. I ended up eating one eventually and it felt like freedom.     This is a huge victory, and I sincerely hope you'll enjoy every last bite of that shortbread!",False,False
