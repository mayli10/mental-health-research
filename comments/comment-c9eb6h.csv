I remember comments like that when I was younger but not as direct. Hmm guilt you say? That‚Äôs interesting. Also I have to remember that to most people/ our families them being honest and calling you ‚Äútoo thin‚Äù or ‚Äúanorexic‚Äù or whatever is insulting so they won‚Äôt comment on that.. which my brother has been *blunt* and said ‚Äúit looks like you don‚Äôt eat anything... you look anorexic.‚Äù But I figured out it‚Äôs REALLY hard for people to say the word *anorexic*. Like it‚Äôs just super hard because it sounds mean to them- and I don‚Äôt want anyone to think I‚Äôm going yay anorexic looking but I want to hear the truth.. and if that‚Äôs the sad truth so be it.. hearing that would help me want to recover because all I see is fat fat and more fat. Like how I‚Äôve always looked :(,False,False

Last year, when I lost a lot of weight for the first time, initially I wanted my dad to be worried for me, because all my life he'd told me I was too chubby and needed to lose weight, however the first (and only) time he commented that I was looking almost too thin I didn't feel satisfaction at all, rather a sense of guilt and an urge to recover, out of fear of hurting my loved ones... I think that if he, or anyone else, had consistently expressed concern (that was the only instance of anyone worrying about my weight loss, and like 3 months later they went back to telling me, after I went from underweight to bmi ~21, that i needed to lose weight), I would have definitely been more prone to recovery.",False,True

Side question- do you think if they asked you and acted like they were concerned do you think it would help you recover? If they showed worry or concern? I think I would be more inclined to if they commented on my looks or *something*.,False,False
