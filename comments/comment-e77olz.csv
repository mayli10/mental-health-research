I started out with the goal to eat at least 1,100 (because dieters can eat 1200) and eventually working up to being (mostly) okay with eating at maintenance. I noticed that the times that I am willing/able to restrict are tied to anxiety and that it doesn't actually help at all.",False,False

I am also scared that my hyper focus on food/exercise actually allows me to do better in academics/career development. I am just afraid that if I officially decide to let go of all of this then my whole life will spiral out of control.   How did you get past the fear of speaking about it and acting upon it? Did you wait to talk about all of that stuff until you were truly ready to give it up? If so, how did you know you were truly ready?   (sorry for the rambling, I am just really struggling/stuck right now and I canâ€™t talk to anyone in person about it)",False,True

Maybe it will help to mention your fears in therapy? Ease in if you have to.  I was scared to mention that food was even an issue when I started. I could only say that planning meals was an issue. Baby steps. Even seeing a therapist is a huge victory!,False,False
