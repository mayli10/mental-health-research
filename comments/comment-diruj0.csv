Like this isnâ€™t world war where we are dealing with food shortages and Iâ€™m not living in a country with food scarcity. In fact Iâ€™m in a country where thereâ€™s massive food abundance and unnecessary waste so being irrationally angry makes me seem like an ungrateful bitch. But DUDE the anger that washes over you after finding out the food you had specifically planned is gone is just... unspeakable. Iâ€™ve had my share of bitch fits and they werenâ€™t pretty so I feel you. At least you were able to collect yourself and go up to your room instead of having an epic meltdown or tantrum on the spot ðŸ˜….,False,False
