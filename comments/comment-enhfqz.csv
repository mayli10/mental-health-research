Super triggering since i feel like people are just tend to be skinny from the lifestyle here (workaholic environment, public transit, food availability) but its also important to remember that there are so many people who are more normal weight or larger in NYC but our brains only focus on the skinny ones. Hopefully your bf was just feeling a little out of it today or you were just misinterpreting things and you end up having a better day tomorrow.",False,False
