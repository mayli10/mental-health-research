I’m not sure whether to just pay and avoid the awkward conversation or refuse to pay because I didn’t eat anything and my request was totally ignored.   I’m pretty sure I’m being a bit petty but money is tight I’m a single parent working part time with no financial support and it just feels unfair as everyone else is full time and 75% live with their parents.,False,True

In my head I keep thinking to stick up for myself and refuse. It’s a lose lose situation lol.,False,True

I would just pay for it this time around but next time refuse to have any part of it.,False,False
