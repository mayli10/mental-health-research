Every time I got the urge, I’d tell myself, “Okay, I can purge in 5 minutes”. Then 5 minutes would pass and I’d tell myself another 5 minutes. Etc. I just kept delaying it and trying to distract myself in between. Over time the anxiety and urge would lessen and then I wouldn’t feel like purging anymore.   It took months of doing this and there were times that it didn’t work, especially early on, but eventually I stopped purging altogether. I can’t remember the last time now. It must be at least 4 years.",False,False
