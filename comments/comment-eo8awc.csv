They do it the other way too; if they know you've got disordered eating habits and you're gaining way too quickly they might not *admit* you, but they'll strooooongly push for it.",False,True

A lot of people go unnoticed and unhelped until they're even worse.  Hugs also. I wouldn't want to be admitted involuntarily either. Had a psychologist refuse to see me, said he would recommend inpatient and wouldn't feel comfortable just seeing me in outpatient sessions. Was like welp guess I won't be seeing you then bye.  But yeah. Disordered is as disordered does..",False,False

But if I help you devise a way to avoid it then I'm harming a fellow sufferer. (((((((HUG))))))))  I'm proud of you for being real about your situation.,False,False

Annoyingly the system he's with has a threshold of weight loss where if you drop too much then they *have* to admit you.
