Anyways, I know what you mean about not feeling valid; my tiny monkey brain is always telling me that too no matter if I eat healthy for once or restrict for days. I had the same thoughts about laxes as you do about purging but thankfully my mom prevented me from taking them and now I don't really think about them anymore.  Sending you lots of love aswell, and stay safeüß°",False,False

Forcing yourself to gag is really painful (for me at least, I feel a stabbing sort of pain in my chest) and usually you can't even get yourself to throw everything up. Then you're left sitting in front of the toilet with vomit all over your hands crying because you feel like a massive failure.   It's also a surefire way to fall into a never-ending b/p cycle.   0/10, would not recommend to anyone.",False,False

I'm assuming you have an eating disorder, you have a disordered mentality that, as much as you think you'll be able to, you won't be able to manage your purging if you get really deep into it.   You will waste more money, fall into B/P/restriction cycles, and honestly? You probably won't lose weight, you very well might gain, your skin will look bad, your hair will fall out, your teeth might crack, if you don't lose weight especially you will look (and probably feel) a lot worse than now (although I'm sure you're beautiful) as a result of the severe bloating issues etc that arise with purging. Also more severely you become at a major risk for issues like gallstones, permanent damage of your organs, and have a higher chance of developing conditions such as Mallory-Weiss syndrome for example. You said you know this, and are willing to deal with it, but I can guarantee that it will leave you with a lot of regret. You are _aware_ of the bad side, but until you actually experience it you won't realize just how horrible it is.  If I could give you one piece of advice it would be, if you want to lose weight, even quickly, to take steps towards treatment to manage your bingeing, I know very well that that's so much easier said than done, and I haven't achieved anything close, but it's better than this. Truly, adding on another eating disorder will not only set you up for complete faliure, but will only make you more miserable, and sicker. You will probably just cause yourself to have further to go to get to your goal.  **I'm so sorry you feel this way. I'm sure you're beautiful, I truly mean that. Know that you have the support in everyone here. All the best Xx**",False,False

For me it meant I was a lot less apprehensive of eating foods I wanted and I ended up eating a lot more than I normally did (and a lot of the foods I was going for were very high calorie) which led to my current weight gain. It‚Äôs also not foolproof bc sometimes you just can‚Äôt get things up. Tldr it really complicates your relationship with food even more than it probably already is. More encouragement to not start: i burned my mouth horribly and my whole mouth was covered in sores that i couldn‚Äôt do anything without being in terrible pain but I‚Äôd still end up eating because I couldn‚Äôt stop and I couldn‚Äôt do anything about the food I got bc my go to was to throw it up + no time to exercise. The first thought I got when my mouth got burned was great lol now I can‚Äôt eat then I‚Äôll finally get a deficit but the opposite happened lolol. It‚Äôs not worth it. I have burns on my throat rn and I‚Äôm trying to treat it as best I can but there‚Äôs really no cure lol, all the doctors will give you are anti-inflammatory meds to prevent worsening (on the condition that you don‚Äôt repeatedly wound it and create more problems) and painkillers (that barely work) so the only way to get better is to stop (not happening lmao) so I‚Äôm just bracing myself",False,False
