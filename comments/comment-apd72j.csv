Most of the time, though, when I see people complaining that they're not losing, it's because they're too impatient. No one is losing a pound a day. 99%of people aren't even losing a quarter of a pound a day. Weight loss is a slow process. If you can stick to a diet for a month, you'll see a few pounds down, but no one is going to drastically change their body in a month.",False,False

Also I feel like a lot of this stuff is genetic, like I’ve know people who start with higher BMIs and do crazy restriction  &gt;500 a day and still plateau.    ",False,False

Some definitely eat &gt;4000 cal a day and some &lt;500 cal. A lot of the superskinnies also seem to have high activity jobs/lives. Like the episode of the former marathon runner. It definitely looked like she was still running, but was probably not allowed to compete. I wish they did it like Secret Eaters where they secretly film a day of eating/activity to know what it's really like.",False,False
