But I get what you mean. It's harder to talk about eating disorders than it is to talk about anxiety or depression. I feel like it's so hard to relate to other's experiences and goals since the nature of how an ED affects my life is so different from how anxiety or depression can. And also it affects your self-perception more. Idk. It's like a disability almost.",False,False

Sharing food is one of the most basic communal experiences in life. When your ability to ""break bread"" with people is disrupted, that's no small thing. Shared meals are a gift and a bonding experience, and it's awful to lose that.   Add in the stigma attached to EDs, and it just sucks. EDs are definitely not an ""acceptable"" mental health struggle. Even if people claim to know better, there's often a subconscious assumption that we chose to get this disease, and therefore it's not as legitimate or worthy of sympathy as something like depression/anxiety.  I'm sorry you're dealing with these feelings of alienation. Just know it's very common with this disorder, so at the very least, you're not alone in feeling alone!",False,False

I just refer to my atrocious mental health as ""my brain stuff"" and if I'm really brave, I'll say I struggle with depression.

I‚Äôm so ashamed of my ED that my best friend whom I‚Äôve known for 14 years only found out a few months ago about it (and I‚Äôve had my ED for 12 years). And, no one in my family knows about it either. It‚Äôs so isolating to not be able to talk about something that consumes almost all aspects of my thoughts.",False,False

I realize all I do is think about food at work or talk about exercising and I‚Äôve realized it‚Äôs affected my coworkers and friends. I feel bad that I‚Äôve pushed these thoughts onto them.   I‚Äôm sorry about the situation with your husband. That‚Äôs something I have not dealt with to that extent, so I can‚Äôt imagine how that feels. I have scared enough men off with my ED, so I do understand how frustrating it is to not be able to communicate with those closest to you.  Yeah even though I struggle with it everyday, I feel like it‚Äôs fake. I feel like I‚Äôm being ‚Äúover dramatic.‚Äù",False,True

My husband told me that he can't hear me talk about it anymore bc he's started internalizing these disordered thought. Which totally broke my heart that I was infecting some one else.   And at work, all my co-workers are constantly fad dieting and praise me/pretend scold my food choices or my weight so like... They definitely don't get how bad it is even though I've told them.  And finally, even at the worst of my ED I was still considered overweight and have since gained even more so like I never feel 'worthy' of considering myself a part of any ED community even though I very much struggle with it daily.",False,False

Part of that is because often people with EDs have an over Controlled personality, which prevents us from connecting with people that we may even be super close with. I think that's there's a huge sense of vulnerability with EDs and no matter what, you feel like you're losing (recovery/ED). I'm always here if you want to talk ‚ù§Ô∏è",False,False
