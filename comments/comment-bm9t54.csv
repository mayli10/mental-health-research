I found out when she asked me to help clean her room and I came across a binder with all these hateful words about herself, cutouts from magazines of women she wanted to look like, and other notes. When I brought it up to her, she told me everything and honestly it didn't make much of a difference.  There are so many other problems and obstacles couples will struggle with, and a past eating disorder shouldn't be detrimental to their relationship. In my opinion, if the guilt is bothering you so much you should just tell him and express that you didn't mention it earlier because you thought it would negatively affect your relationship. If he loves you, which it sounds like he does, it won't be a big deal.  People who truly love one another should be able to express any and all topics because that's the person you trust more than anyone to accept and love you for both your perfections AND flaws. That's what being in a relationship is all about.  If anything, it should make your bond even stronger because you opened up about something you were struggling with. Opening up about insecurities or concerns can build trust and comfortability in discussing sensitive topics with each other in future situations.",False,False
