The main one is that the stress you inflict on your body is tiring for the skin and you suffer from the consequences of that. Eye bags, paper-like skin, less shiny hair etc. That's because you're wearing your body out, slowly, and you're aging, making it less easy to recover in a fast manner.   Another reason is that we usually go from one extreme to the other, making it complicated for the organism to get what is required. If you're starving yourself then binging, your body will just assimilate whatever it can, as soon as possible. That is usually refined sugar or highly-processed food, which tends to bring less of the necessary intakes and more of the unnecessary, unhealthy things (sodium, saturated fat etc).   Then, overexercising, longer fast period and purging also are 'unhealthy' (putting this between brackets because it really depends on the intensity and frequency). These shouldn't be used on a regular basis. They are considered bad when done often and have their own set of consequences that are indeed visible compared to someone who does not engage in these behaviours.   Last but not least, unhappiness/depression has an impact on you. Being unable to sleep, self harming (smoking, drugs) or simply the mental burden can have physical consequences. EDs tend to increase those unhappy episodes (the brain is lacking what's necessary to think logically and will react strongly to simple emotions) and that is usually seen on your face or body, such as less elastic skin, more dry/oily hair, digestive problems, a tendency to fall sick more often and sometimes long term physical damages.

It‚Äôs certainly jarring to be back here.  I think that‚Äôs a common fear and I know I have cycles where I‚Äôll eschew exercise for that exact reason.   Nice thing about yoga is it‚Äôs very customizable. You can try just doing short, simple body weight exercises for strength (planks, down dog) that are long holding vs a more iquicj, cardio style vinyasa flow. ",False,False

Yeah sadly I've sort of ""relapsed"" after 7ish years. Probably the stress/depression of major life events. Losing weight faster than I ever have in the past. I was always complimented on my perky, round butt and perky boobs. But unfortunately I can tell it's starting to sag. :/  I actually don't exercise at all because I'm oddly afraid it will make me want to eat more?? And then I'm afraid I'll give up working out and still eat more and gain weight? Weird logic. But I might take up some yoga to tone up. ",False,True

You're pretty much making a trade with the devil. You're sick and your body is devouring itself.

I work at a strip club so I'm around a lot of women with little to no clothes. So I've been able to make a lot of observations. A lot of my bones are clearly visible, especially my rib cage from the back. And I just found it so weird, because this girl who is naturally incredibly tiny has no visible bones at all. She apparently just turned 18, so she hasn't fully grown into her body yet I guess. She's probably technically underweight. But she's tiny with a healthy, softer look.",False,True

I believe, when your body isn't actively losing anything, it can just operate at a maintenance level (if this makes any sense) and it is not all that damaging.
