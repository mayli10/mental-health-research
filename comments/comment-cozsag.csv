And when I bought the pills, I gave them my address then sent a bank transfer, so they never had my card details or anything.  You 100% should do a hell of a lot of research both on the drugs and the safety of the site you're considering using.",False,False

I genuinely enjoy lifting weights, but I so badly want to be strong that if I even miss one gym day I feel instantly 100x more shit about myself. I want to just be 100% muscle and 0% fat lmao.
