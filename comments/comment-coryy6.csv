Do you really love him/ love having him around? Dumping him just because he eats differently from you is probably not the best idea, unless there’s other stuff going on too. If he’s being rude and can’t respect what you eat that’s a different story too. But if it just bothers you that he eats differently than you, it might be your ED talking.",False,False
