My eating and skin changes a lot with my menstruation cycle (example: 1 week before i get my period i'm super hungry and i eat a lot and my skin is angry lol)  But yeah same. Just got a huge skin problem (not in my face but on my shoulders and chest) when i relapsed last time. It slowly disappeared tho i kept restricting.  Good luck with your skin :/,False,False
