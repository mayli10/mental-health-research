People throw non-perishable food, clothes, cleaning supplies etc.   I've talked to the RAs and no one really cares if you take them, because the purpose is to give it to someone who will use it.   I get so much stuff there! I've gotten a mini fridge, microwave, acrylic drawers, desk organizer, large mirrors,  even a first aid kit that still had bandages and headache/ cold medicine in them (don't worry I checked for tampering!)",False,False

I've received comments about my weight from my own family members since I was about 8 years old. On my most recent trip back to China, one of the first things that family friends mention is my weight gain (as if I hadn't noticed it myself lol). I don't think these comments were intended to be mean-spirited -- maybe they were trying (but ultimately failing) to be helpful but pointing it out, even -- but there seems to be a huge pressure for women to stay slim and never get fat.

So I think there's an assumption in place that everyone else is also trying to lose weight (it's not wholly untrue), and blunt comments about body weight are supposed to be helpful. Like ""oh, you've gained some weight since the last time I saw you!"" ""Ugh, I know, I'm trying to work it off. Have you tried so-and-so diet...""  I would say Koreans tend to be straightforward about weight too tbh, although Japanese people will more so tend to hold back those kinds of blunt comments.  It's not meant to be mean, but I think the mean part comes if another person repeatedly tells someone to stop commenting on their body so much and that person refuses. Which happens frequently.",False,False

Skinny Asian girls have similar proportions to skinny Western girls. It's just that Asian people carry their weight differently, it usually goes straight to their abdominal and visceral area instead of chest, butt or thighs. That's why Asians are technically overweight at a BMI of 23 or 24.   I'm not even that skinny by Chinese standards (5'4 and 110lbs) but still fit into their small sizes.",False,False

My University is known for having a ton of international students, especially from China. I usually go ""dumpster diving"" at the end of each semester, to stock up on all the things college kids (especially internationals) just throw away at the end of the semester. It's especially triggering to do that in the international students' dorm, because all the (almost new, pristine) clothes are soooooo teeny and always so cute. I found the most adorable denim dress that's a L in Chinese sizing...and maybe would fit me if I was 11. I can't let go of it though :( ",False,False

Even with a BMI in the 17’s I still have an hourglass figure.  “Smol” is not my goal body. I like to stay fit and have muscle tone. Still weird to see people talk about how they want soft bodies and eat below 500 calories everyday so they don’t develop any muscle.  I usually restrict around 1200 and my lightly active TDEE is 1900~ and occasionally I’m like “why you eat so much”. ,False,False
