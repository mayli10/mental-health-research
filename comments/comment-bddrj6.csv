I've had to be my own advocate for most of my adult life with my issues. I have to push to get issues considered and recognized.   It's really hard because when I would finally admit something is a problem it wouldn't be a huge commotion like I had played it up to be in my head.

You are valid and you are entitled to seek help. Your weight does not matter in this.   You've done the hardest part in saying it out loud the first time. It will be easier next time.   Go to a different doctor. Are you at a UK university? If you can/are not already, register with a surgery local to your house, rather than with a campus service or specific student practice. Or, make an appointment with a different doctor at the practice you're already at. Write down some bullet points (what you've written here) and take them with you - you can hand them over to be read, if that's easier. Make sure everything you've said here is heard by the doctor. It can be really easy to say the first part (I think I have an eating disorder) and then rely on the doctor's questions, but sadly their questions might not be the right ones.   Please try again. You deserve help.   You could also explore what other services are offered by your university, if you wanted some more support.
