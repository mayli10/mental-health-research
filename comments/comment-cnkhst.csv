I'm going on two weeks of eating at or above maintenance (typically 3000kcal), I can't stop. But we're super understaffed this week and next so I can't afford to restrict (due to energy loss, even 500+mg of caffeine won't make up for it), I worked basically 13 hours today... So I can't afford to be lethargic.  Anyway yeah I'm on the binge train and I can't get off.",False,False

I feel so much better today thank fuck.   I found self care really really helps. Like cleaning, sitting down and actually relaxing, etc. And when I feel unable to engage in self care techniques, that’s when I know I’m in danger of b/ping, since that’s normally a sign in becoming super anxious without knowing it.",False,False

I didn't get medically cleared to return to my university this semester either so I'm staying with my parents. My mom's not supportive and constantly curses me out and leaves me alone all day (took my car, and there's no transportation within walking distance), has forbidden me from getting a job, AND her house is full of snacks all the time. Literally all day I'm just desperately trying to distract myself from eating.    also I'm trying to go to an IOP but uh, no money and not allowed to get a job. I'll be calling my insurance, idk.",False,False

Coming up on a week of decent eating following TWO MONTHS of completely balls-to-the-wall binge eating. Stress is no bueno for my waist lmao. But hell, if I can do it, anyone can.
