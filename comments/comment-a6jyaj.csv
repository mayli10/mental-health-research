As for the girl at the gas station: I‚Äôm sure she doesn‚Äôt feel negatively towards you. I used to work at a gas station and you see a lot of people from all walks of life. If someone was a complete mess that gives me bad vibes, I would be customer-service friendly and get through the interaction as fast as possible without prolonging by asking about things like tattoos. She may have engaged with you because she could tell you were struggling and wanted to brighten your day in whatever small way she could or because she liked your energy. I really think the absolute worse thing she felt about you after that interaction would have been pity, not regret or disgust (some people hate being pitied; I really don‚Äôt mind it and sometimes want it). She may have admired your honesty and think you‚Äôre confident for admitting what you did to a stranger. I‚Äôm sure she doesn‚Äôt regret asking you the question. ",False,False

She wouldn't have asked if she wasn't curious, and logically there are plenty of tattoo meanings that could be ""awkward"" to talk about, like a memorial tattoo for someone who passed, tattoos done for ex lovers, tattoos from prison or shitty years of a person's life. It's a part of you, its logical for it to have personal meaning. Just because you're not in a good place right now, that doesn't take away from *who* you are. You recovered once, that's evidence of it - you may be off the wagon now, just like a lot of us, but that isn't necessarily a permanent thing.   And you never know how the other person might feel about these kinds of   interactions. Maybe she thought it was awkward and a little overly open, but even so, when you work a service or retail job like that you tend to forget those moments/people almost as quickly as any other transaction, unless it was really, and I mean *really* out there. Then theres the other possibility that it wasn't a negative interaction for her, and that she either simply had what she considered nice/interesting small talk, or even that she possibly thought it was sweet/human of you to open up about it. When I worked service, even if it was unpleasant stuff, I loved talking with regulars or random people about personal things, way better than the shitty empty ""How are you, good, how are you"" that tends to happen.",False,False
