The idea of my dad (who brews beer and loves food) suffering even a tiny tiny bit on one of his diets has made me cry before, lol. It comes from a place of weird compassion. If only we could transfer it easily.   I've actually returned to counting calories when not doing so felt like it was driving me crazy. Even counting while maintaining. It can be comforting in the short term. Are you in treatment rn?  Weight restoration is a good start, but the mental stuff is the real killer in the long game. Even just having a therapist who specializes in eating disorders (ie instead of doing inpatient or having a dietician) has made a huge fucking difference for me.  Especially w/r/t your relationship. Have you voiced your worries to your SO or explained the anxious thoughts you've been having? I remember feeling really guilty for thinking about what would happen to me if my SO left me during a relapse, but once I told them and they reacted super kindly I felt so much better.",False,False
