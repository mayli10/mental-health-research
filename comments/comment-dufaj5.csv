Society and culture, at least in America, does a real nasty job at convincing that ED is for middle economic teenage females when in reality it’s not just that. I suggest finding an outlet, an ED support group or maybe a therapist. As a guy who also has an ED, you need to find at least someone that you can talk about this shit to because society really doesn’t believe that we guys also deal with shit as well.
