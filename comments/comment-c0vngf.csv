But there are other things that I am stressed out about besides the weight and I couldn't be arsed to go out with them because I will feel like shit and might end up being rude or lash out even. So, I am avoiding talking to them and hope they get that I don't feel like going out or even texting.

And I completely get you :( Sucks.",False,False
