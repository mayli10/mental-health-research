And I bet a lot of us are going through the same thing. I post like mad when I'm UW but let's be honest the real trauma happens when you claw your way back. Starving is hell but crawling out of hell is even worse and it's when we need more support yet can't ask for it. I really hope your therapist gets this, sounds like they do.   I had an identity as a ridiculously acsetic tough survivor/pure intellectual who didn't need to eat...working eating into my persona was a Big Deal and I had to do it alone, despite all the diet culture around me.  Ironically, starved bodies and psyches need even more help as they reach a healthy weight and need just as much care and nutrition as they start healing and repairing. :twee hang in there.gif:  This rambling rando on the internet is wishing you well and giving you permission to eat and rest and survive. You are cool, and if youre bit fragile that's also ok. I just wish you could get more support around you.",False,False

I am seriously crying, thank you SO much for this. It has truly made me feel a little bit more at peace (as much as I think you can when going through this) and reassured. This has helped me so much. I have read it over and over and over again.  It really does feel like puberty again! I just feel insane all the time - it's not as bad as how bad my depression got when I was malnourished, but it's just this awful different kind where I feel so alien and it's coming and going in waves of hormones that are causing me to completely lash out or act euphoric. Thank you so much for the advice for telling my therapist -  I've let her know I feel very much worse on our last visit, and she's so nice and understanding that I hope I don't start hiding how I'm feeling from her.  God, also what you said about having to find a new identity is SO true. Like I don't really know who I am anymore and it's really weird to try and navigate who I'll be when I'm giving up everything that has defined me for the past year in a really intense grip like vice because I really relied on how sick I got from it to give me some kind of personality, and then longer than that before it was so ""intense"", for years I've just relied on my physical appearance and I'm having to give that up in a sense to be healthy.   Thank you &lt;3 I think deep down I know I need the food, I just keep thinking this phase should be over for me. But I think maybe my body is still just healing from all the damage and I just need to respect the process.   Anyway, I've rambled but thank you SO much. This means the entire world to me.",False,True

What you posted sounds exactly like my experience in weight restoration. With all the hormones reactivating it was like doing puberty again and I just felt so vile and wrong in my own body. Depression and anxiety were off the charts when I couldn't numb it with starving, too. I wish I had some helpful advice but all I can say is it gets better eventually, gradually. (I've done it twice so far ðŸ¤¡). You cant be doing it worse than I did ( living on sugar, no support or therapy, dressed like crap- whyyyy?)  Stick with therapy (you've come so far) and make sure they know you are not mentally OK even if you are sticking with recovery and physically improving. I Know...easier said than done.   If you're doing recovery without support you're working so hard. It's like having to find a new identity and figure out how to step into it every day. Without having anyone to understand how hard it is and what you're going through. And losing your coping strategy. And having to adapt to a healthier body. No one who hasn't been there seems to understand what kind of hell it is.   I agree with your therapist; ""binging"" is what your body needs, and is just one of those shitty phases of recovery for a lot of us. I don't know if being aware of this helps with the daily despair, though. FWIW, you do deserve the food and to feel ok about it. You also have the right to acknowledge how awful you feel about it, too.  Wish I could help with the clothes situation. â˜¹  I feel dressing like crap didn't help me but at the same time, ignoring my body as much as possible was all I could do.   Idk, I'm typing a lot of useless words just to say I can't help; but I really hope you're ok. I know it's not much but I hear you and I care and I know this shit is so hard without the support from people around you. You're being really strong, you deserve to feel better and be healthy and I hope you get there sooner rather than later.   Take care. ðŸŒ»",False,False
