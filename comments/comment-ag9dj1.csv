Drinking protein drinks like boost and ensure are an easy way to get nutrients and calories. Also, i make a lot of crockpot recipes. My favorite thing to do is make shredded chicken breast because you can eat it so many ways (tacos, over rice, in a sandwich, w/ steamed veggies etc). Soup, oatmeal, and parfaits are also my best friend when Iâ€™m too lazy to make something.    But I feel this post a lot. Sometimes if I get too hungry, I get so frustrated trying to decide what I should eat. Nothing seems appetizing or itâ€™s just too much work to make so I either continue to fast or buy something (which usually results in a binge LOL). I find also asking my friends for suggestions help too! But you can get over this hump. ðŸ’œ",False,False
