For me it did for sure, but I think it was mostly bc I was unhappy/insecure in my life, and being thin gave me so much comfort, it was my primary self-soothing mechanism I guess. What about you?",False,False

I get you on the changing thoughts, and the fear of plastic surgery (yikes). Idk it's weird, when I was anorexic my beauty ideal was like Black Swan Natalie Portman, but now that I'm more into recovery it has genuinly changed to a healthier one which I never thought it would.",False,False

That’s one reason (among many) why I’m scared of plastic surgery -I wouldn’t want to look in the mirror and see someone else. I know I said I’d have Emily Browning’s cheekbones but really I just wish mine were more defined! Like my BMI 16 cheekbones on my BMI 19 body. I have never been a BMI 16 but I just wish that area looked a bit thinner.   I’m glad you’re pretty happy with most of how you look c: it seems that way anyway.,False,True

I'm 5'7 which is a good length I think, I like my body most in end of healthy BMI, I don't think I would change my body shape(I'm def more slim than slim thicc but that's fine with me). I would change my hair to be thicker and healthier, clearer skin(it's good but who doesn't want?), darker eyebrows(I have dark hair+eyes but quite light eyebrows why??). And I would def change my knees!! That's it I guess :)",False,False
