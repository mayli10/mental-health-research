Inside you just want to say DO YOU KNOW what it's like to constantly be scared? For Orthoanorexia to CONSTANTLY be checking every single ingredient?

Like no, I have never been grotesquely obese, but I have been what we might call as ""skinny fat"" (around 190lb).

Not only that, but many people who *are* overweight are comfortable with their body image; they embrace who they are, and I think that's great. But not everybody fights the same battle the same way. Some people struggle to come to terms with their self-image and because of that, often shelter themselves from society because of their own dysmorphiaâ€”whereas others embrace their size. Plus, some people are more overweight than others. It's all about perspective and how you come to terms with who you are.  ""you don't know what it feels like to be fat"" is pretty much gatekeeping if you ask me, especially if you technically *are* overweight or borderline obese. It's easy to tell somebody that they ""don't know what it's like"" when you're 10-15lbs/4.5-6.8kg heavier, but that doesn't change the fact that they may be struggling more than you in terms of self-acceptance.  But perhaps they're right: I *don't* know what it's like to be 300lbs/136kg. But that doesn't make my struggle any less arduous.",False,False
