I think that's another reason why I don't like to talk about it; people just don't understand how you can abstain from eating. I get it...it goes against every natural survival instinct. Forget even trying to express how that feeling of being empty makes me feel powerful. It's a natural high. In my experience people also tend to think it is more of a choice than other mental illnesses. I might ""like"" how it makes me feel a little better about my body, but I certainly don't enjoy all of the side effects that come with it and I would love to feel ""normal"" for once.  I don't think that my eating disorder was triggered by a trauma, but I have had pretty significant anxiety since I was a child. It was never really addressed so it just kept building until I hit my breaking point last spring and it's been a downward spiral ever since. I didn't even think that my therapist might be addressing anxiety as the primary diagnosis for insurance purposes and I would feel better about the whole thing of that was the case. Thank you so much for the encouragement! I know that I have to work on being assertive and clearly communicating my needs and this is all very helpful.",False,True

It could be that your therapist is focusing on anxiety for insurance related reasons so that you’re not stuck without help once you’re firmly on the path to recovery.    You may have to tell him “yes I have anxiety, but my most pressing concern is the way my anxiety manifests in my eating disorder because it’s what I struggle with most currently” You may have to seek someone who specializes in disordered eating to get the help you need. Also if you believe your eating disorder was triggered by some kind of trauma, I would definitely bring that up with your therapist so you can work through that together. You can do all the workbooks in the world but it won’t help diddly squat unless you confront the root of your issues. Proud of you for seeking help and fighting this nasty thing. I’m confident you will beat it. Don’t be discouraged or embarrassed. It’s a very brave thing to admit you are struggling.",False,False

I know all of the health risks...hell, I just went through a bunch of cardiac and GI testing to make sure I was ok after a trip to the ER for severe chest pain. Which we now think was most likely GERD that started when I finally began eating more ""normal"" after a 3 month period of heavy restriction.   I think I just need someone to say, ""Yes, this is an eating disorder and these are the exact steps we are going to take to start the recovery process."" And no, ""eat breakfast every day"" is not helpful advice. Been there, tried that, and failed miserably.  Thank you for your response and I hope that you are doing well.",False,True

I do feel embarrassed by everything that I am going through (even though I know that mental illness isn't a choice and I don't judge anyone else who is struggling) and talking about it is new and uncomfortable so sometimes I worry that maybe I am just not being very clear. Although , like I said, I was honest about the ED behaviors in our first session and it almost felt like he forgot that I said anything. I think this is where my frustration really lies because the 2 times that I have had the courage to bring it up to a healthcare professional, they just started talking about balanced meals and eating enough fruits and vegetables. Sure, those are great things, but it isn't going to magically cure me. Having them not seem too serious or worried about it makes me feel like maybe it isn't such a big deal and reaching out for help wasn't really necessary. Or maybe I just need to find a doctor and therapist that are better informed on eating disorders.  In the meantime, I will bring up my concerns with my therapist and see how that goes. Thank you again.",False,True

They wouldn't just tell someone with depression that lying around in bed all day can lead to muscle atrophy and social isolation, they'd treat the depression.  They wouldn't just tell someone with schizophrenia that listening to their hallucinations will lead them to make irrational decisions, they'd treat the schizophrenia.  They wouldn't just tell someone with ADHD that being distracted all the time will make them difficult to employ, they'd treat the ADHD.  But when it's an eating disorder, it's always, ""Have you tried just eating normally?  If you don't, all your hair is gonna fall out, so you really should try harder not to have a mental illness.""",False,False

To ease your anxiety maybe ask him what he has in mind for your treatment plan. Is he just going to let you talk every session, or does he actually have a plan and the proper resources to help you? He may be still getting a feel for how to properly help you. You should be able to bring up concerns like this with your therapist — after all you are paying them to help you. You deserve to know how they intend to help you and have enough information to make an informed decision if the treatment plan is right for you.",False,False
