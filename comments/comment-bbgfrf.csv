You'll need to use your pooping muscles to push even if there's nothing in you to push out.  Can be painful if you overdo it.  Osmotic laxatives are basically a salt overdose.  It can be any of a number of types of salt: magnesium, potassium, dioctyl sulfosuccinate.  The excess salt needs to be excreted, but it also sucks a ton of fluid into your bowels that gets excreted along with it, softening (or liquefying) your poo and making it easier to pass.",False,False
