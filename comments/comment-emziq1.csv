Estrogen signaling is somehow related to calcium deposits - idk many details, but your odds of developing osteoporosis and osteopenia increase with every period you miss (for reasons of malnourishment).   If you're a big fan of not having one, I'd suggest looking into an IUD or microgestin oral birth control instead (I've only had like 4 periods in the six years since I started microgestin). Then at least your period doesn't become motivation/excuse to stay sicker, if you ever feel like upping your intake.",False,False

Now I’m 23 and honestly have no idea if I’ll be able to get pregnant when I’m ready to start a family or if I did permanent damage to my reproductive system,False,False
