Went to a drag show last night and spent about half of the evening making out with a super hot woman who‚Äôs curvy and oh my gosh. I just find curvy women with jiggly parts so beautiful even though I despise my own upper arm chunk and everything.    It‚Äôs been well over a year since I made out with anyone and she seriously increased my confidence in that department, especially as I felt so out of practise to start with.   Could‚Äôve gone back to her house but I was tired and my body confidence is still too low (damnit I haven‚Äôt had sex for almost two years) but the fact she even made me feel halfway attractive felt amazing. I told her she gave me more confidence and she was *so* sweet about it and told me I deserve it.   Today? I‚Äôm hungover (I forgot how brutal Sambuca is) and spent almost all day in bed playing Let‚Äôs Go Eevee. Didn‚Äôt even want to eat much which I didn‚Äôt expect as I rarely get hangovers.
