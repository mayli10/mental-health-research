I thought I was disgusting and obese when I was 13. I keep looking back now and seeing how skinny I was. Wishing I could get back to that. Unless your doctor tells you you’re overweight, you’re not. Please get help. It only gets worse from here I swear",False,True

Back in 2018 i got bad for about 3-4 months and since then I've gained 20kgs (44lbs). I try so desperately every day to restrict and get back to how i was. I loved how i looked back then, i was actually happy about my weight. When i was at my lowest weight, i was the happiest i'd ever been. Sure i was obsessed about calories and my weight but before i restricted, i was a depressed mess and restricting took that away.  Now i'm almost at my highest weight and i'm as miserable as ever. In august/september of last year i planned to kill myself over how much i was eating and how much i hated not being able to restrict. All i want is to get back to how i was. I hate to say this but i *want* to be anorexic.",False,False
