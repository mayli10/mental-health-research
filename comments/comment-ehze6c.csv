I don't know how it happened but after christmas dinner I weighed myself and the switch in my head ""clicked."" And I was back to square one.   I'm back to fasting 20+ hours, compulsively exercising at night and obsessing over calories : (",False,False

I was ""fine"" for the last two years and then life became stressful and confusing and now I'm coping by restricting again. And I wonder where everyone went. I've been dealing with this stuff for 9 years. Where is my early 2010s pro ana gang? Did they all recover? Are they posting about health and lifestyle on instagram? I don't want to look at those posts - justing thinking about strawberries and healthy cereal for breakfast makes me want to binge. But all the old tumblr blogs and subreddits are dead or banned. Were are all of you inhaling ed content?",False,False

Been years since I really have done any ED behavior such as purging/ excessively exercising buuuut. Here I am. It’s tough. It scares me that I am finding actual comfort in this again, like the tracking / exercising etc and rules give me comfort in some sick way. Just  be kind to yourself and let’s hope not to fall down the rabbit hole again . I know I was constantly unhappy and stressed when my ED was at its worst.",False,False
