Iâ€™ve been doing this for 7 months now and eating above maintenance is still a chore. I have to make a conscious effort to do it, and I feel too-full and/or nauseous when I do it. The discomfort then leads to a bad mood which makes me feel a little resentful towards recovery which is another challenge. Not easy is it. Good luck ðŸ’›",False,False

I'd solve so many of my day-to-day problems if I could just stop thinking about food.  I think you should treat eating as you would a medicine when you're sick, for example. Like, that really disgusting huge pill that starts dissolving before you get the chance to swallow it and it tastes absolutely *rancid.* But you have to take it. To be healthy again. Try to tough it out. Good news- food very seldom tastes rancid, and if you find the right taste again, it'll be amazing.  Don't beat yourself up over this. Recovery is a lifelong process. This is just another stage of it. You could run to the previous stage, sure, but why would you do that? Just try to teach yourself to eat again, bit by bit. You were sick. You now need medicine. You will be okay.  Stay safe, alright? Recovery is a huge decision. I'm proud of you.",False,False
