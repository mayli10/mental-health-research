I have been considering taking them for a while now but Iâ€™m worried they would make me sick like most vitamins when I take on an empty stomach. Congratulations on weaning off of laxatives thatâ€™s a really big accomplishment!,False,False

Working out is a good way to be able to eat more without keeping the calories, but do you sometimes feel like the calories you burnt off donâ€™t count? Like I feel like I donâ€™t deserve to subtract the calories that Iâ€™ve burnt off working out lool. I feel like what I ate is what I kept on and no workout is going to change the number of calories I took in. WHICH I KNOW IS RIDICULOUS but when you have an ED, do you really use logic? Hahaha",False,True

But I just want to exaggerate how much probiotics has helped with bringing my BM back to normal.   I was abusing lax very heavily 2 years ago. I mean I would have to take around 20-25 pills just to have a SOLID shit the next day (graphic, I know. Sorry!). I slowly weaned off the pills over time, which took a year (25 one day, 24 the next, 25 again, maybe 23 the next, and so on).   Fast forward to now. I take probiotics everyday on an empty stomach before I go to sleep, and am able to shit nicely after a *satisfying* meal.   TLDR; Yes, u can take probiotics on an empty stomach. And they help by regulating your BM to give u big, fat, healthy shits! :)",False,True
