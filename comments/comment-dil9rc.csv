Heaps of family members not due to ED but a shitty British diet of takeaway and chocolate have had multiple heart attacks (still doesn’t stop me binging on the stuff tho). I have a BMI of 19-20 and weighed less and was healthier before my ED like 17-18 without thinking of food so I fucked my body over. I will go to the counsellors office today and just confess....all my shitty eating as my emails I’m guessing got lost or ignored due to exam time and stressed students.,False,True

EDNOS is serious. It doesn't have the ""name recognition"" that anorexia and bulimia have. People don't know what it ""looks like"".   I have EDNOS. My lowest BMI was 18, not 14.5 to be diagnosed with anorexia. I purged, but my binges don't ""count"" as binges. I over exercised. I've fainted from lack of food. I've lost relationships, friendships. I've not done as well on projects in school and at work as I could have. I've obsessed.  I too have felt like if I went to a doctor they wouldn't take it seriously. Or, I felt I didn't need to be taken seriously. I look normal.  You know, people can suck sometimes. You DESERVE help. You don't have to feel the way you do. There are other ways. If the first person you talk to sucks, I hope you find the strength to talk to someone else.  Jelly Bean, I hear you. I take you seriously. You deserve better than what you got.",False,False

EDNOS sufferer here, it's less well known (in the UK at least) and last summer I had stomach issues due to it and my shitty GP told me to cut out a lot of what I ate, ended up in A&amp;E from the pain and had a doctor tell me they'd recommended me completely the wrong treatment for it. I think it's taken seriously but some doctors don't know about it.   I know what you mean when you say you feel like you suck at purging and restriction but that doesn't make you any less sick. Please don't go looking for tips on how to restrict better or purge.",False,False
