I stopped watching it about 6 months back because I was just way too obsessed with food and it was starting to suck, but I've gained 8 lbs since November and am REALLY trying not to relapse back into purging so I'm going to start watching it again on Monday (I keep it up on one screen at work for background noise).  Dr. Jessen is basically a living Ken doll and it's honestly just really informative.  the episodes where they meet with people trying to overcome their own ED's are too hard for me to watch, but the rest of them are great.  you just fall in love with the people in the clinic and at the end, you're celebrating the supersize person losing weight AND celebrating the super skinny gaining weight, so it's feel-good and motivational.",False,False

The tubes are probably the worst part. It shows a week's worth of food and the supersize's one is always super full of gloopy fatty food and the superskinny's is like mostly black coffee and a few slices of apple (which somehow adds up to 1200 calories because nobody wants to promote EDs right). I believe they got rid of the food tubes in the later series because so many people complained about it being triggering. But even still, I find it triggering to watch the superskinny struggle through the food swap. I always know I'm slipping back into restriction because I'll trigger myself with it.",False,False

When they enter the clinic they are weighed and usually told their BMI.   Most seasons there are food tubes to help show how much/little they eat. Based on their food diaries, each of their tubes is filled with all their meals over the course of however many days as kind of a shock tactic. Some seasons Dr. Jessen will show the super skinnies pictures of different medical issues they could develop due to their diets, and sends the supersizers to America (or shows them a video) so they see what could happen if they continue gaining weight. At the end of the week they‚Äôre given meal plans to follow, and then come back for a final weigh-in three months later.  There are other segments that vary depending on the season. In the early seasons there‚Äôs a woman I can‚Äôt stand whose name I have blocked out who does different exercises/social experiments/whatever to get people into shape. Anna Richardson has a segment where she‚Äôll investigate fad diets/procedures/plastic surgery. Some seasons they show a group of people who are being treated for anorexia and bulimia. Some seasons Dr. Jessen goes to America to learn more about the causes and effects of the obesity epidemic.",False,False
