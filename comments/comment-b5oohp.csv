My family loves to comment on what I eat, and it‚Äôs super triggering. I track what I eat constantlyyy on myfitnesspal, and so when I hear that eating four eggs is ‚Äútoo much‚Äù; I have to remind myself that 1,200 calories or less a day.. is not ‚Äútoo much‚Äù. This is a huge reason I try not to eat around anyone, especially when I‚Äôm practicing omad. I wouldn‚Äôt care as much, if I was overweight, but I‚Äôm not. Eating around people can make ed‚Äôs way worse, and I‚Äôm trying to get better, not worse. ",False,True

I watched a childhood friend copy my eating habits from middle to highschool and she went from a good 85 pounds to 150 within two years. We'd raid her pantry, which was chock full of carbs, and hardly  move about.   Looking back, many of my asian friends probably suffered from disordered thoughts/eating patterns.  For binge eating it can be  very obvious sometimes;   - overweight/obese (not saying everyone who is within these weight categories has an ED)  - grabs the most food out of everyone (compulsively), if they're dieting - a difficulty turning down food.  - constantly starting new diet/exercise routines, only to give up in a short amount of time.  I've been pretty open about my problems binge/restrict cycle, and my friends have quietly admitted to their difficulty with food and losing weight. It's only once I bring up BED that they realize it's more than just, ""I can't stop eating lol.""  I've also noticed, girls are usually more vocal about their weight, so I recognize it in them more.   Sorry got a bit rambly ",False,False
