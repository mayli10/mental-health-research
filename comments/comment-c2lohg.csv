From my understanding, this happens to a lot of people if they stop eating dairy for a long period of time. Best way to make yourself get the shits I guess, haha.",False,False

Most ED sufferers tend to get addicted to purging in this way but I haven’t, I use it rarely and only if I feel I really need to. So if you think you’ll start using it more and more and every day, don’t do it, but if you think you can keep it to when you are really backed up it works super fast and effectively.",False,False

So, I usually just eat cheese, lol. Honestly, usually just during a binge to make the food weight go away.  Peanut butter also used to work for me, so maybe that? I usually would have 2 tbsps a day, and it worked like magic!",False,False
