Unless they are super old and sad looking, I get hours and hours out if them. One or two pieces can easily last me all day. And the extra comes in those huge 35 piece plastic packs, which are great — I reuse the container for small-things storage, and the gum doesn't end up accidentally squished in my bag when I toss my metal bottle in there with everything else.",False,False

Especially since I get gum brands that I can chew for 4+ hours. I know they're negligible but I only ever log intake anyway, so I figure I might as well.   I love gum, especially when I'm restricting or anxious (since I chew my lip until it bleeds a lot), even though chewing is said to trigger hunger cues. I've never noticed that, but I also only chew mint gum unless someone offers me a piece of theirs, so maybe the mint counters that.",False,False

(Mine is several hundred calories short of where it should be, judging by my weight gain/loss when I track everything.) I always get the same 2 brands, because I'm okay with 5 or less calories, and some brands don't last through 4+ hours of chewing before tearing into little gum flakes. And I would rather have more calories than those terrible little gum flakes, they're that bad.   He doesn't get frustrated at the time I spend label reading, but that my compulsive checking made him start looking and now he's aware of his calorie consumption. For him, that's a good thing, because he accidentally undereats a lot because he gets distracted so easily and has a pretty physical job. (He was a bit underweight when we started dating, but now he maintains a healthy weight.) The fact that now he thinks about calories when he eats annoys him though, since he gets as wtf as we do about surprise calories. Every so often he'll eat something really calorie dense or just a lot and come home like, ""So I had X and it was y calories, why does that have so many?"" or we'll be eating out somewhere and I'll debate between two things because of the calories and I'll read the numbers and he'll just be like, ""wow, that's more than your total tdee. Get what you want and we can go for a walk or something later? And you can just take some of it home?"" Basically, he's perfect, lol.",False,False

I stopped eating so much fun because I counted each one as five and didn’t want to log 40 calories of chewing gum.,False,False

I them explained how there actually is a calorie count sometimes on the back, and showed him.   He pointed out how you would burn that just by chewing the gum.   Of course, that's why I chew the same piece of &lt;5 cal per piece gum for hours. Easy exercise.   He was unimpressed with my response, if the look he gave me is any indication.   I also refuse to eat a cough drop that isn't sugar free. He seems far mor understanding of that one, for some reason.",False,False
