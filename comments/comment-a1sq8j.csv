We both have our issues but i am really happy we can both be open about them and give each other support.

I'm 5'4 and 130 lbs, which makes me sound like im not that big, but all of my fat is concentrated around my waist area, so anyone with my stats and a better body shape is really disheartening to look at. I'm really out of shape too which doesnt help at all. :(",False,False

BUT: I find the sub super triggering and I love it bahahha!!!!!!!!! SOOOOO HERES MY OPINION:  I feel kinda HORRIBLE when I look at posts where I feel myself 'approving' of the skinnier version of ppl. It happens a lot.Sometimes they look SO HOT. Then I boomarang back and forth, feeling guilty that I find someone more attractive at a much lower weight... The comments are a crazy mind-fuck too. You can tell some people are careful to validate the persons worth at any weight and choose their words carefully... but when someone who was kinda chubby gets to a almost-underweight bmi low weight and they look banging there are SO MANY COMMENTS. it's a reflection of our culture. IDK   this is my perspective as a pretty&amp;thin female who hasn't had to work that hard to be thin. I try to be so carful about working on my fatphobia because I hate the idea of it affecting the way I see people/treat people... but I am so hyper-focused on body image, and I see how people treat attractive people better... so it creates a tug of war    Wow sorry I had a lot of vaguely related thoughts to express I guess   Anyway a possible reason to explain why you might feel this way could be body dysmorphia: you may just assume people ""look better"" than you in general. Or like you say, you hold fat in areas that you wish you didn't (and that other people don't)",False,False

But i showed my husband someone my height and 10 lbs more from progress pics (like, it's not faaaaiiir, this person is smaller than me and weighs more) and he said I was nuts and looked smaller than that person. Cue scrolling through the top pics of people my height and weight-ish and asking ""bigger or smaller?"" Turns out it's just BDD and i'm pretty much the same size as other people my weight according to him. He's pretty brutally honest about how people look so I don't think he was blowing smoke. I still don't see it but idk, I trust his evaluation.   Could it be something like that? I'm not sure that asking someone to honestly compare you is the right thing to do in the case of BDD but it definitely showed me how messed up my self image is...",False,False

I'm 154lbs but I've seen people who are 180 and their body looks like mine. It's really annoying, I feel like my body stores fat in the worst possible ways and even when I was thin I still looked skinny fat.  Unfortunately I am a very lazy person and if I can, will avoid the gym like the plague. I don't mind walking and the occasional racket sport or swimming however any weight training or anything that's going to improve my body shape significantly I hate with a passion. ðŸ™ƒ",False,False
