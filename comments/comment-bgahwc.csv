My boo doesn‚Äôt know (yet) about my issues, but I think he has a hunch. If we spend the night together it‚Äôs usually at his place, and he started keeping what he thinks are my favorite healthy (really just my safe) foods at his place so I can have breakfast with him. BUT, he still has some of my safe foods that aren‚Äôt safe anymore and i have a low key panic attack when I go over there now lol",False,True

And I miss all the other foods that used to be safe like Quorn burgers and sweet potato and grapes and halo top :( now I have such a restricted diet of only a few specific bland things and it sucksssss",False,False

I used to be so anxious about sweets and now pastries are safe???? It‚Äôs a volume thing for me rn. If I‚Äôm going to have one thing to eat, it can be something like a danish. Why? I have no idea. On the other hand, I have a weird French mini cake thing (?) That has been sitting in the fridge for days that I am too afraid to eat. I wish I understood myself.   My wife is sweet and keeps track of what is safe and rn she‚Äôs baffled.",False,False

Now I can eat certain carbs, like rice cakes, tortilla, and more that I previously couldn't eat, though now I struggle with eating meat. I did before to a certain extent, but now I feel like it'll be a full blown fear food soon.",False,False

Also this is crazy but when I first ever started losing weight, like my first 15-20 pounds or so, I was able to eat all kinds of crazy stuff. I'd wake up in the morning and with no stimulants, go directly to seven eleven and have whatever treat I'd been craving the night before. Danishes, donuts, Hostess, etc. I'd have a single breakfast sandwich and....move on with my life lol. Now if I were to touch any of that with a single taste bud I would go *full on binge extravaganza* and have to purge.  &amp;#x200B;  I don't have any fear foods that have switched over! I wish I did, because I feel like my safe food list is now pretty much down to coffee, energy drinks, and alcohol, literally.",False,False
