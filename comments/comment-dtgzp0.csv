I'm amazed at how some men just stay thin with no issues. The men in my family, including my husband, tend to gain weight easily, but at a way slower rate than I do. My brother goes back and forth between slightly pudgy and insanely muscular like it's no big deal. I mean, he's military so he tends to change shape depending on what kind of work he's doing there (excavations, engineering, construction etc.).",False,False

At the time I started dating him I had ditched most of my disordered eating for the previous few years. And then we started dating and the combination of weight gain from eating all the time with him and just watching him eat super calorie heavy on purpose made me feel so panicky. He wasn‚Äôt a teenager but still, watching him just reminded me of my bingeing and made me feel like I was bingeing. Still not fully over the gross feeling I get whenever I think about it.",False,False
