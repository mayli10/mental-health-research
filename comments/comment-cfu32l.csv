I commented that she should be careful because I’ve heard that story dozens of times from the daughter’s perspective, talking about when her ED started.   JFC the comments to me were horrid and finally a mod responded to my comment telling everyone to stop reporting my comment because it was staying.   They couldn’t handle the idea that a calorie counting obsession isn’t a good thing.",False,False

In those years I gained a loooooot of weight so two weeks ago I started keto. Why????? The worst mistake I made for my ed. Starting counting every macro made me obsess again. I started to throwing up again and restrict a lot (I’m around 400cal a day), I can only think about food and how to avoid it again. The worst part is that part of me wants this to continue because fuck it I’m a fat ugly bitch but part of me it’s all depress because I fucked up all those years of recover. So in conclusion keto ruined me again but it’s really fine because I already lose 6kg (13.2lbs)",False,False
