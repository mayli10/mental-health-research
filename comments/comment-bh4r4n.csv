That's probably problematic but at least I'm not sulking about it for hours on end unproductively a few weeks ago. I embrace my muscles even though I'm losing them in healthy ways (I'm trying) via 1800 - 2100 calories a day instead of 2500+ and barely more cardio. Even though this is a minor and relatively ""healthy"" way of trying to lose weight the mentality isn't so healthy, but recovery is a life long process they say.",False,True

Yeah I'm naturally ""built well"" at my higher weights I hold it in my boobs and ass and keep a slimish (not really lol because it can be smaller therefore it must be) waist.
