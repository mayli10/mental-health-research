I havent bought any in my new size and 2. for some reason i feel so exposed in tight clothing even if its a long sleeve high neck and i get even more self concious. I also want to lose more sometimes and so buying new clothes feels pointless but wearing sweatshirts that are 1x when ur not that size at all kinda fucks w how i percieve my body for some reason..But I'm trying to accept my body and feel more comfortabley bc I do like to wear cute clothes and feel nice  ,False,False

This week gave me a chance to actually dress up with a blouse tucked into a skater skirt and I just hated having the waistband touching me, not under any loose shirt, where *gasp* people could see where my waist actually was.

I've lost a bit now and it makes all my clothes look different on my body. So when I try to dress myself based on how I used to dress, the outfits look different on me now than they did in my head, and I panic and see new things about my body I either didn't have or was plainly ignoring before and I throw it all off me and put baggy clothes on instead. I'm way more self-conscious about my waist and my arms now than I was before even though objectively I must be smaller.  On the flip side, though, clothes that I used to not wear very often at all because they didn't fit right can sometimes trigger an opposite reaction. I threw on an old pair of corduroy pants the other day because I was running out of clothes and needed something for work, and I was shocked at how good they looked on me. They fit my new proportions so much better and were no longer tight but just cinched. So I wear them with a lot of outfits now and I feel more confident in them than other clothes I used to wear a lot. Basically my go-to comfy, confident clothes are changing and I gotta catch up.  Maybe it's time to go window shopping and try on some clothes that you wouldn't have worn before that fit your changing body a bit better? Thrifting can also be a great way to get access to lots of differently tailored clothes at once to get a sense of how your body is recomposing itself.",False,False
