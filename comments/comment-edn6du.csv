I told her Iâ€™d cook for myself when I got home bc I wanted it done a certain way. Then she swore up and down sheâ€™d do it my way and then didnâ€™t. Itâ€™s been almost 10 years, but iirc, she also used real butter instead of butter spray.  Sheâ€™s tried (unsuccessfully) to lose weight several times. I guess she doesnâ€™t realize that 100 extra calories here, 50 there, really DOES add up.",False,False

I still vividly remember saving up my calories to get fried rice takeout in the summer and getting home to discover they gave me lo mein instead. I wanted to go back to fix it but my boyfriend refused and when I started crying, said I was overreacting. It's fine for him because he got what he wanted (lo mein).",False,False

He doesn't know about my Ed, he thinks I'm really into intermittent fasting. The way that we both were raised makes us feel guilty to so no to food that someone else made for us, and I hate feeling like I have to eat... And I really dislike being mad at him for being sweet. This thing really sucks",False,False

I remember one time when I lived at home, my mom offered to cook so I could go to some event. I gave her very specific instructions on measurements to use for my food and when I got home, it looked off. She said she just eyeballed it.  Sheâ€™s extremely overweight, so she didnâ€™t get why I was so god damn mad about it.",False,False
