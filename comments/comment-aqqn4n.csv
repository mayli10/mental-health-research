It's not so much wanting attention. Just wanting someone to tell you they care about you and want you to stop. I told a few friends who cared, absolutely. B u t they were almost too understanding. They would say things like ""everyone does stuff that bad for them"" ""it's gonna be okay"" Telling your friends is not a magic cure. But it really helps. Taking away some of the feeling like your dealing with it completely on your own.   I think our friends don't notice because dieting is so common. I told kind of a new friends a few months ago and he told me he just thought I was on a lame diet all the time. Don't wait for your friends to figure it out. They do care about you. ",False,False

Like I had spent enough time on the internet reading pro ana shit that I just decided I would do it. I was the exact stereotype of a preteen girl who wasn’t going through real shit and just wanted to force people to prove they cared. I was only slightly overweight and my self esteem wasn’t shit yet but I was such an attention ass bitch. I would act super good avoidant at home but eat normally/binge eat when they weren’t around. I guess they didn’t notice, or maybe they could tell it was contrived bc I didn’t lose any weight.  Then I felt so much shittier about them not caring that it transformed into a real kinda thing.  As soon as I brought those shit habits to school through my friends noticed &amp; I got anonymously reported to my school counselor by one of them, idk who it was still. I got the fucking attention I wanted but then I freaked out and switched to restricting by only eating when I was around people. It works well and my parents really still haven’t caught on because I gained I think more than 20 pounds committing to binge eating in college (idk exactly how much bc I had already gained senior year and refused to look at a scale). We’re pretty much opposites because now I’m afraid of ppl noticing. I want to lose a lot rn and idk how I’m going to stay discreet if I’m not putting back on weight by overeating again, because I’m absolutely done doing that. I still want to feel like people care but explaining everything would mean admitting that I chose this for myself and that’s too embarrassing. ",False,False

I wish I knew someone I could confide in who would be nonjudgmental but supportive, someone who wouldn’t see me differently. I’ve tried hinting at it again to my mom, who says I can always tell her anything including this,.. and she began to freak out. So I then minimized and blunted it again to calm her down. I said I’m just not finding wnjoyment in eating but otherwise fine. Well that’s kinda far from the truth at the moment. She got too worked up and I wouldn’t want anyone else to have that reaction or think I’m weak and can’t handle myself. My independence is the only thing I can rely on some day.",False,True

It never happened, I went through it for a year and no one was ever the wiser. I desperately wanted help, but I wanted someone to find out themselves and help me. Wishful thinking, I hid it too well, and just seemed ""healthy"" and ""food and portion concious"" to others. I finally had the guts to tell 2 people in my life about it, and their support was immense and so helpful to me. I wanted people to read my mind and somehow know I was sick, but it usually doesnt happen that way. But I do know that thinking and how hard it is.",False,False
