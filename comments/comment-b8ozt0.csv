I once ate a big heaping breakfast before XC skiing because I knew that it would all get burned off and then some.

We were very poor and she had to work hard. She always seemed stressed or upset, so as a kid who liked chocolate because it made me happy, I thought it would make her happy too. I collected pennies and change I found on the floor for a week until I could buy her my favourite chocolate bar.  When I gave it to her though she screamed at me and threw it in the trash and called me a money wasting idiot. Crushed doesn't cover it haha.   So now when people give me food I didn't ask for and don't want. I thank them and try and re gift it or put it away. ",False,False

Then the next day I would work at my job at a pizza place and if someone ended up waiting longer than 20 minutes for their order I would give them extra food for free thinking I was making them happy and I somehow failed to realize my hypocrisy but our society as a whole uses food as such a barrier breaker I guess you could say. It‚Äôs a way of saying sorry, thank you, get better soon, I love you, ect.

It's a constant struggle between *how crazy I seem* to others vs *how risky it would be to partake* and I'm struggling with how much time I spend thinking about it.  I spent an hour this morning before leaving for work thinking about bringing a sugar-free jello pack and a pickle to work for lunch. Just to sit with the crew and enjoy a social chat.  I completely blanked and didn't even remember until I got back home that I had left the lunch out on my counter in the morning.
