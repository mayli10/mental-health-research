I have actually only been in California for a little over a year so the fires still freak me out.  Everyone around me is acting like it's normal, lol, so maybe I'm just being paranoid, but smelling smoke all morning was disorienting. I'm near the ocean and I was told today that there's like no way a wildfire would come to this particular spot, so I'm safe but I worry about anyone who lives near fields of dead vegetation or wherever the fuck they spread to.  Side note, I'm probably going to move to the valley soon but I'm not sure which area. Just the general region because its a lot closer to my work than LA. What's a good place to be in the valley?",False,True
