Any amount of food makes me tired, unmotivated, bingey, irritated and sluggish.    I love the feeling of being completely empty - the slight burn of physical hunger, the lightness, the calmness, the clarity. I feel so connected to my body when I'm fasting.   However I know I'll die if I let myself ride that wave for too long, so I eat mainly at night when I don't have to deal with the consequences as I sleep.    I don't understand how humans get energy from calories because I sure don't.",False,False

It's more like pop rocks, rather than the painful cramping that comes with, well, any kind of bowel movement. Idk.",False,False

I feel so light and thin until I eat each day, so itâ€™s temping to not eat at all. My middle ground is to just wait until I get home from work/class so that Iâ€™m alone for my post-food nosedive.",False,False
