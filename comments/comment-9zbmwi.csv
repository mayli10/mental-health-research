Ive lost and regained the sane 20lbs more than once in the last few years. I know what you mean, it's super dull to lose a pound from your highest. I get that. That's why i usually stay a long time within the highest weight because i can't get myself to ""restart"". It kills knowing you've been where you wanna be and somehow fucked it up. But. If you want to see that lw again, that's just how it's gonna have to be. I had to get myself to accept that before I could go on losing. Now im closer and closer to a new lw finally and I'm super motivated but i spent the bigger part of 2018 within the same 5ish lbs because of this issue. But that's the thing, you have to get this weight out of the way before you can dig deeper into new lower weights. It's just how it is. So in that way, it is progress towards a new lw even if it's still far ahead. You can do it! ",False,False
