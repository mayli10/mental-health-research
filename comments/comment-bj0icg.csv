I am really short and have really low calorie requirements. I am basically always hungry and have always an appetite, which is even worse. When I eat ""normally"" whenever I feel hungry until I don't feel hungry anymore, I would gain weight, because I almost don't have a feeling of satiety. But I try to eat ""normal meals"" or ""normal amounts of food"" and I would still gain weight, because I am so short and obviously don't need as much as a person who is way taller and more muscular than me. With exercise and a normal healthy (lots of vegetables, fruits, salads with (not fried!) chicken or fish, etc) diet it's even hard for me to maintain my weight, because I am so easily gaining.     People always tell me I ""could eat more"", because ""there's no fat at my body"". But I am basically just maintaining my weight by starving or restricting... So I am constantly frustrated, because I actually love to eat, but then I feel so guilty and gain weight. Sometimes I am hungry all day and eat just a little bit of normal food and the next day? I weigh even more and could just cry, because sometimes it feel like I should just stop withholding myself, and just eat whatever I want, because it makes no difference.",False,False
