At first, it made my relationship with my mom a little awkward, but it’s been really helpful long-term because I feel like I can be more open with her about what’s helpful/not helpful and if I need support.",False,False

At least tell her you're a bit worried about your eating habits. You're the only who can guess how she might react though.   &amp;#x200B;  My mom just sort of ignores my issues, not out of meanness or lack of care but just because she doesn't wanna think about me being in pain. I didn't know she would react that way, so it's hard to determine.  &amp;#x200B;",False,False
