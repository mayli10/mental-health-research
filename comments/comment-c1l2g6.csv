They will not place you under psychiatric hold just for having an ED, and they aren't going to magically cure you (if that's what you're afraid of).  It's just good to have a baseline and to have a timeline of where you were at with your ED a month, year, decade ago.  Openly discussing your ED will also help you figure out why you do certain things or feel certain feelings and help you to learn new coping mechanisms. It can also help your therapist tread more carefully so s/he doesn't say anything to trigger your ED.  Also, you can totally say ""I'm re-engaging in past ED behaviors right now but I'm not comfortable talking about it right now unless I specifically bring it up"".",False,False

Plus, I guess I just don't want my therapist to judge me. I know that's ridiculous, but it feels like there's something uniquely shameful about EDs, and I can't deal with being looked at differently if I disclose.",False,False

I see a psychiatrist and psychologist for other issues, and I've been forcibly hospitalized for them before (bipolar mania.) I'm not ready to recover, and I'm terrified if I let my docs know I have any sort of disordered eating on I'm gonna get stuck back in a psych wing or something. It's hard, because it intersects so much with everything else I'm dealing with, but I'm not gonna say a word about my ED until I'm really open to the possibility of recovery.",False,False

But I hate lying and it’s pretty obvious I have a problem, so when she asks questions I do my best to answer them truthfully. She’s trying to help me learn to manage my emotions without resorting to my ED behaviors, but that’s not working out too well. I’m   now not sure if I made a mistake by telling her, cause while initially she wasn’t really trying to force me to do anything, last session she mentioned I need to get to a doc for a check-up (yea, no, barely UW, no reason for that) and asked me to shorten my 9 mile walks by half. So we’ll see if I regret it, if she gets pushy with her requests. I’ve only been seeing her 2 months so don’t fully trust her yet either. Sorry for rambling. Don’t even know what I was trying to say.",False,False

I share most everything with her regarding my ED. It took a while to build that level of trust with her.
