I forget what body fat percentage it is.  You risk nutrient deficiencies if you donâ€™t at least supplement with pills.  Your blood sugar gets very low.  You lose your period and your hair.  Look gaunt.  Of course... I love fasting.  I am doing it right now.  Emotionally it has been the best thing for my anxiety.  Physically I feel well and right now my BMI is in the normal range.  As far as I know as long as long as you feel well then it is fine to keep going.  Please just listen to your body and the moment you start feeling sick/weak/dizzy...eat something.  Anything.  IMO our bodies and hormones are very good at making us hungry enough where we eventually break down and eat.  Itâ€™s just not there for you today.  It will come though, lol.  ðŸ’™",False,False
