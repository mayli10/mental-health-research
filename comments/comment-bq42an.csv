You would think that a therapist of all people would understand the impact their words can have!  I had a somewhat similar experience with my own therapist. Knowing that I have body dysmorphia, she told me that my substance abuse was going to age me. I was so hurt by her comment that I drank three martinis before going to work and got sent home early for being trashed. When I brought it up with her later, she said, ‚Äúwell, I had to hit you where it hurt.‚Äù üò¨",False,False

I‚Äôll never forget how he chuckled and did this condescending head shake and said ‚Äúreally? You fear water will make you fat?
