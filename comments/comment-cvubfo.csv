I can relate, I am a healthy weight now too after being underweight for many years and anyone looking at me would just think I'm a totally healthy normal person, but that is so not how I feel in any way. as difficult as it might be at first try eating more on a day to day basis, you won't gain weight by eating what makes you satisfied as weight gain can only happen with actual binging or eating to uncomfortable fullness for multiple days in a row. you will probably find that not only do you feel better but you have less/no urge to binge. you might even lose slowly as that's what happens to a lot of people when they stop bingeing and eat consistently, their body sort of relaxes",False,False

I'm not sure if it's because I was still mentally trying to track in my head or because I wasn't super committed to it and was hoping I would lose weight without tracking, but I was still obsessed with food and hungry all the time. I know that tracking calories can be a huge trigger for a lot of people with ED's, but if I don't track calories, I tend to go into ""fuck it"" mode and binge beyond what I need for satiety, for weeks on end.   That said, the approach seems to work for her, and I don't think my experiences can speak for anyone else's, and same with her experiences",False,False

I’m well aware that we’re not made to eat 1500kcal. For an active woman it’s roughly 2,000 and for me would probably be even more, as I workout quite a lot and lift. I’m 24, F, 170cm 57kg - BMI approx 19.7, so I’m a paragon of health, but my relationship with food is messed up. I’m not afraid to eat more, but my brain is hard-wired to pursuit weight loss. My mindset is this - if I eat too much or if I don’t burn the calories, I gain fat. In the best case scenario - I maintain, which is still a failure for me because I’m not happy with my shape and weight and I’m obsessed with losing and burning. There’s no doubt the with if it wasn’t for my binges, I would be skinny and possibly anorectic again. But since I no longer have the superhuman self-control, I can’t restrict for long and end up binging.",False,True

This sounds crazy to a lot of people but in the past I have maintained my weight, even when it was around 10lbs underweight, eating around 3000 calories a day, this was when all the exercise I did was walking and yoga. I am tall so I know that has something to do with it, and I didn't really eat processed food ever (probably wouldn't make much of a difference but my orthorexic mind says it does) but also through some research I've done it also seems like most healthy women actually do eat much more than what we've been told is 'healthy/normal' like 1500-2000. I know a lot of people say they would definitely gain on higher amounts, but part of me thinks they've a) never tried it b) they temporarily gained some extra food/water weight and they freaked out and thought it was actual weight or c) their metabolisms have become suppressed so they'd need to build up slowly.  &amp;#x200B;  A huge part of my anorexia developed because I believed stuff I read online and what ""experts"" said was a normal amount of calories to eat, I did eat that much and I kept losing and losing weight. I remember being dangerously underweight and still thinking ""nah there's no way I'm going to eat more than 2000 calories, NO ONE needs that much!"" literally as I looked down at my protruding rips and hips, that I had gotten eating a ""healthy and normal"" amount of calories.  &amp;#x200B;  Calories go towards all sorts of stuff like healing wounds, immune system function that is constantly working on different pathogens we come in contact with, hair growth, stress modulation, etc. I genuinely think that a huge reason a lot of people fail on diets and binge and develop EDs is because they've been taught bullshit information that is bound to make them sick at some point. Just my 2 cents, don't attack me lol. I think if she can show that women can eat a lot and still maintain that would be really good for a lot of people to see.",False,False
