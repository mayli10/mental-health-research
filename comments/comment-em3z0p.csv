Birth control, basically. I was told by the obgyn that it would ""restart"" my cycle so I would cycle again. If you go to your doctor, they may also give you a progesterone test, so 10 days of progesterone to see if you bleed or not. I could just take the pill but from what I read it doesn't do much for maintaining bone health or mitigating bone loss.",False,False
