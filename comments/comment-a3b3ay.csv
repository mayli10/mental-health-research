I watch a lot of recovery youtubers and they all seem to believe in it.  It makes me feel a lot better to know that lots of people think you can be recovered without ever 100% returning to the person you were before, and just making sure you're healthy instead. I've always felt like most people in recovery and most drs were pushing fat positivity but I wasn't sure if it was just my ED telling me ""they just want you to get fat"" or if they really were!!",False,True

Have you read/heard about Cognitive Behavioral Therapy as it applies to other mental illnesses? The principles applied there give me a lot of hope. I've been in CBT for anxiety and it didn't ""cure"" my anxiety as that's impossible. But it made my life 200% better. I feel like a similar treatment should be used for EDs more. ",False,False

Me every morning: ‚Äúhmmmm...but is living REALLY worth gaining a few lbs???!‚Äù  But for most eating disordered people (at least this is what my therapist says), it‚Äôs not *about the food.* it‚Äôs about switching out ‚Äúnormal‚Äù and healthy emotional processing for restricting, binging, purging, etc. Which is so appealing because, get this: it‚Äôs SO much easier to starve yourself or eat an entire sleeve of Oreos and throw them up than to feel deeply painful grief. And loss. And anger. And resentment. And frustration at the fucking universe for making you this complicated human with so many damn feelings.  So (again, as my therapist says), recovery is mostly about dealing with those very scary emotions- either by voicing your feelings and confronting people who upset or hurt you, or processing past trauma, or repairing broken relationships with family members, etc etc. And realizing that you are NOT alone in this scary process- that you have friends, family, a community (online or an in-person support group), and hopefully a therapist who are supporting you the whole way and reminding you that you are not defined by your emotions, no matter how overwhelming they can be. That your worth is not contingent on you handling every stressor in your life perfectly. That you can be honest about how scared you are almost 24/7, and that the people who love you will not let you be swallowed up by your fear again.  Anyway, that‚Äôs just what I‚Äôve found to be true for me personally. And as much as I wanna say that BOOM now I‚Äôm cured lol, I‚Äôm going to fast today after binging all weekend üôÉ so trust me, I know it‚Äôs WAY easier said than done. But I guess that‚Äôs the hallmark of recovery right? Make a shit ton of mistakes but ultimately take a shit ton of steps forward. And that‚Äôs what counts in the end.üíõ",False,False

I have no idea what recovery will look like for me, but it'll probably include some OCD food behaviors, hopefully just being a 'health nut' and maintaining a gw. I just want to reach a nice middle ground.   I think for you, recovery can just be finding a way to manage your thoughts and tendencies without endangering your health. Being able to be moderate about your fear of getting fat while still enjoying life and not denying yourself everything you want.    Also: having seen lots of posts on fatlogic about the 2018 eating disorder conference (ICED?), I swear to god tons of clinicians don't really 'get it'. Lots were pushing fat positivity.

I think it mainly is acheiving a state mind  where your ED is no longer holding you back from living life the way you want to.   Recovery might not bring you back 100% to who you were pre-ED, but the recovered you is likely going to be so much more  calmer, healthy and functional than you were deep within your disorder. At least, thats what my goal would be. Obsessing over all these numbers and bullshit really robs so much time from you.  Also I think that even a recovered person could still watch their calorie intake, but the difference is that it is without all the emotional baggage that the ED drags into it (guilt, competitiveness) . Seeing food as fuel, Numbers as just numbers. And striving for health, not arbitrary perfection.  kind of a ramble, but just my 2 cents.",False,False

Recovery doesn‚Äôt look like someone who‚Äôs never had an ed just like a recovering alcoholic who‚Äôs now teetotal doesn‚Äôt look like someone who‚Äôs never had a drink. Recovery is a lifelong commitment. That‚Äôs my opinion anyway! I‚Äôd love to be wrong on this... I don‚Äôt like hard work haha.,False,False

I've tried recovery for the last couple of months and got up to a normal weight. It's been hell. I'd rather be underweight and unhappy than normal weight and unhappy. Maybe I just didn't try hard enough. I think full recovery is possible though, not just for me at this point. ",False,False
