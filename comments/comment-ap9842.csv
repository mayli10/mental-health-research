But still, sometimes I get a fear that I'm a unicorn and I'm gaining or not able to lose not-because-of-CICO.  The rest of that I know very well.  For me it's the sneaky calories that I'm not counting.",False,True

I *lived* off of bacon sandwiches and subway every single day but because I still ate less than 900-1,000 calories I maintained a thin physique.

It’s impossible to maintain or gain if you’re eating less calories than your body needs. You might still see the scale going up occasionally due to food weight or water retention, but don’t worry about it, if you know you’re under your tdee then it’s not real weight.
