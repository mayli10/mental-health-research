Together with the coracoid process it extends laterally over the shoulder joint.  The acromion is a continuation of the scapular spine, and hooks over anteriorly.  It articulates with the clavicle (collar bone) to form the acromioclavicular joint.  ***  ^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&amp;message=Excludeme&amp;subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/EDAnonymous/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot)   ^] ^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28",False,False

Like one time I was waiting for my food at Taco Bell and a huge crowd of people just happened to come in behind me. So lots of people were also waiting for their food with me standing in front of all of them.
