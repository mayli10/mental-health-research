People always say it’s good that I’m aware that I have a disorder and that my relationship with food isn’t normal but idk. Sometimes it makes me feel like I don’t have any disorders and that I’m only faking it because I admit that I’m sick, especially since I went back to my normal weight after trying recovery... it sucks",False,False

Like my boyfriend will feed me like I’m an infant in an effort to get me to eat more carbs. Now I’m so thin and sick and tired and over this, but not sure how to get my family and friends to drop that identity.",False,False

I do try and drop a ton of hints to my sister though (she's anorexic). She's definitely caught on a bit but I don't think she's fully realized,False,False

Ok so it's a problem when that happens. Then you're concerned. Noted. Will adjust goal weight.,False,False

My stepmom said something about how easy it was for me to lose weight and it pissed me off so bad. That's about when I stopped trying at all.,False,True

The friend that caught on can relate a lot to me. It's nice to have someone who gets it, but I'm scared to talk too in depth about it",False,True

It's pretty normal to diet and stuff and workout when you eat too much, but the difference is how much is too much and if it's compulsive vs an active healthy decision and all that.",False,True

It’s so normal for women to say things like “well I’ll eat this deep fried shit and then I just won’t eat tomorrow and I’ll workout twice as long LOL” and everyone just shrugs it off.

My friends are more like 22-27, but literally all of them have said or done things that are seriously disordered. I think the difference is maybe just the prevalence and ongoing, extreme distress and hyperfocus. It definitely makes it easier for ED to slide under the radar, because I don’t think many even generally healthy people get through life without having some of those moments, so they just assume that’s where you are too maybe?",False,False

My core friend groups are all 27-33 year old moms and the amount of food issues that are normalized/badly disguised as diet culture in conversation is insane. It’s a bigger issue than I think is really understood right now if that makes sense?,False,False
