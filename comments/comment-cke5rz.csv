It was SO refreshing to see a movie about eating disorders that focused on the mental side of it rather than just the food or body image aspect. I feel like out of every ED movie I've seen it was more true to the complexities and obsessions involved in an eating disorder than any other movie.,False,False

It personally for me was less triggering because of the lack of tips like with to the bone and also the way the story carries out is so different from the typical 'oh this all started because I hate how I look' but rather takes a different approach and shows how she developed an ED as a coping mechanism.,False,True
