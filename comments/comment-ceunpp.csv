Theres a lot of cute ways to do it, in general i think word tattoos by themselves never look as nice as a picture. (come from someone who has multiple tattoos)",False,False

If you're not settled on a design yet I'd think about something subtle that'll make you feel good whatever stage of recovery or not recovery you might be at in the future. Plus then you can put it wherever and tell people why you like the image without having to explain its significance.",False,False

I put it on the place I go to when I want to s/h, so that I would be destroying the tattoo forever if I even did it once.  I chose my forearm, because I see it all the time (and it was the proper location mentioned above). I chose a plant, because nobody can be offended by the outline of a plant! If you want to have it in a visible place, remember that people WILL ask you about it. They will assume things about it, and ask you again and again about it lol. Make sure it is something you want to explain, and it it's not, make it something you can brush off. I tell people I got the tattoo because seeing that plant always makes me happy, so this will always make me happy; they don't need to know the real story all the time.",False,False

Also shoulders/upper back/upper arms can be covered easily depending on your outfit.   Personally I wouldn't get a NEDA tattoo because it's literally a logo, but I understand that for most people it's just a recovery symbol and lots of people get that.",False,False
