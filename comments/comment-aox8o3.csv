It's cute.  I have those cupboard tidy shelf/step things from IKEA - the little wire steps you get for putting tins or cans on in your cupboard, for creating a kind of second shelf in the cupboard to maximise space? I use that so rather than stacking the tins on top of each other and having to lift them/risk them toppling over and knocking them all down like skittles, I've basically created a 2 tier set up along the back of the desk which keeps it all tidy and out of the way and it's only one tin deep on the desk - it's 2 tins high - one on each shelf.   I've got an under desk heater, a fleece zipper (rather than a hoody, so it's less casual), black fingerless gloves for when I'm super cold, and a bug tartan scarf/shawl/blanket (your mileage may vary on that one - it's borderline professional. I do lose it and just shiver when the big big boss is in the vicinity, which is rare, because it is approaching hobo)   I have a surface pro and a docking station/monitor situation so my boss despairs that I've got more ""crap"" on my desk than work stuff.
