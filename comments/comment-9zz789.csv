I'm so glad that you're alright and that you had your awesome friend to keep you safe!  I guess all us ladies should take this as a reminder to watch our drinks like HAWKS.,False,False

Did anything happen to you? Are you alright?? Don't be afraid to go to a hospital if you're worried about something happening to your body. You are worth advocating for yourself.,False,False

It happened to me a few years ago and it was awful, I woke up in hospital with no idea what happened and I just felt so upset for quite a while afterwards.      If you haven't seen a doctor, please try to go. But do your best to take care of yourself. Take it easy, spend time with loved ones if you can and try to process it in as healthy a way as possible. When it happened to me, my brother flew down to stay with me for a few days and we went to cinema, watched a lot of movies at my place and just hung out - it really helped a lot. Look after yourself, you'll make it &lt;3",False,False

If you are comfortable with it I would take a trip to an urgent care. A spiked drink can come with some lasting issues. Either way I hope you are okay.,False,False
