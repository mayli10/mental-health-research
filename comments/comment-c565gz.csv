I present myself as someone who has their shit together - education, career, closes, regular gym goer, makes healthy food choices etc. It's other women that bother me. If I'm in a restaurant for example I expect 'yeah you would get a salad' looks so feel pressure not to, to prove them wrong.   We're stuck with this thinking because we'll decide:   If you're underweight: they want to see what you're eating to justify their opinion that you don't eat if it's a salad. They'll decide you're having a 'treat' if you're a level above a salad, and you're 'out of control' if it's anything above that.   If you're overweight: They don't think you should be eating, and how dare you do it in public.   If you're in the sweet spot - just outside skinny, low end BMI. Congratulations you're in the special 'have you shit together club' and curiosity will be further dialled up from the 'how does she do it' group.   All probably completely irrational thoughts but I try to work with them and think 'you can potentially get judged at any weight so might as well say fuck it and ignore it'.",False,False

I used to never eat around anyone and had super high anxiety at family dinners and such.  Eating alone is hit or miss: I can eat nearly nothing and not have anyone get bothered or concerned ‚Äî or I eat a bunch of junk.  With eating now, it depends on the day. I eat alone or just casually in the main space almost always so that goes okay, and I eat majority of my food/meal around the evening/night. On a good or neutral day, I can eat around friends and not worry too much about the various aspects, and even do a happy wiggle. Sometimes I barely think about it at all. Other times I completely avoid food related activities or purposely restrict before the plans and/or restrict calories during. Eating with or around people I have even a potential crush on? Oof, yeah no. That causes extreme anxiety but it‚Äôs also difficult if they insist bc if you keep denying, it ends up seeming strange and sets off alarms. uGH",False,False

It's a constant battle.  &amp;#x200B;  It's not ridiculous it's completely the disease. I guess maybe start eating in front of people that you love, and not someone who judges/watches that you eat enough! That's the worst I think even if they mean well. And then you maybe get accustomed to it in a more comfortable environment. And then baby steps to realizing no one actually cares what you because everyone has their own shit to deal with and the people who do only project their own body issues on you so fuck them.  &amp;#x200B;  But yeah I'm also still struggling.
