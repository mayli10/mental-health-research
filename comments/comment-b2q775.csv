I get to hang out with my partner and chat without the distraction of just watching TV or something while eating. My parents would always make me eat at the table and while I found it annoying at the time, as an adult I realised I do actually find it important in connecting with your partner/family at the end of the day, not to mention getting to actually enjoy the food you make (also, it makes eating dinner while watching a movie seem like a fun treat when you do it).

I'm pretty lucky to come from a family that barely eats so meals aren't stressful with them haha.",False,False

One time I went through the effort of cooking a special meal for my family and my twin brother just took his plate upstairs. I was kind of offended, and I'm usually very hard to offend. My mom was at least sitting in the same room as me and not ignoring me, but I showed her how she could download a copy of this game she used to play years ago when she still had the disc for it and she was playing while we were eating together. Like I do sometimes eat while playing video games, but only when I'm all by myself. It is kind of my own fault though because she used to love that game despite being somebody who almost never plays video games, so I should have expected her to be excited. (*Literally the only other games she plays are rock band and guitar hero. She played Legend of Zelda: Wind Waker once when she first bought the game for my brothers and I and that was a huge shock to me.*)  At my dad's house everybody does eat at the dining room table, but it always ends up that my older brother brings up something about politics, usually US politics which extra sucks because we're Canadians so all it will do is make us feel bad, and then as soon as everybody finishes they just toss their dishes in the sink and leave. In fact, my twin brother usually actually leaves the house immediately after dinner. And that's not even mentioning the fact that they're just leaving all the dishes for my dad to do instead of cleaning up after themselves. I like to actually sit with my family and talk to them, but none of them care for that. Maybe it's different for them since they all live together still, but I would have liked if we were a more normal family even before I moved away for college. I feel like proper family dinners would have greatly improved all of our lives.",False,False
