I relate a lot to saying you are a happy and positive person. But you know what, you don't have to be 100% of the time for people to still think of you as that.   I would like to say more, but I don't want to say anything that would inadvertently make you feel worse, because I understand how easy it is to do that to someone in your headspace. But suffice to say, I've been there verrrry recently, and my ED and negative self talk are still bad, but suicide is now no where near a consideration, and that feels like a really good thing.   One thing that helped me, was to get angry at the thing in my brain trying to kill me.   Feel free to DM me anytime if you want to talk more.",False,False

I have told my closest friends but I don’t speak much about it because I don’t feel the need to put my problems onto anyone else.  I know that I will have an ok relationship with food one day.  I am seriously considering killing myself, and I have been planning it. I could  go do it right now but my anxiety about how my friends and family will deal with it is the one thing stopping me. I think this is a separate issue and I’m not sure who to talk about it to. I think this is too much for any of my friends to handle and I don’t want to tell them that I have planned out my suicide. Consider that I seem to be a very happy and positive person from outward appearances and me showing my sadness is a very rare occasion. Me lashing out today was a rare occasion. My parents are completely unsupportive of anything and I do not want to tell them about my ED  I don’t know what my suicidal thoughts mean. I go through phases that last a few weeks where I am intensely happy and have no issues (this was me until last week, and recovery was going well), and then I have depressive phases that last the same amount of time. No matter how much exercise and self-care I do, I still feel like shit during these phases. I passively thing about suicide whenever I get like this but I am fine when I go through my happy phases.",False,True

If that doesn't work, go to the hospital. It won't be fun, but saving your life will be worth it.   That is your to-do list if this is an immediate danger/musing.   If this is less of an immediate thought, you should still reach out to those people, but also remember that recovery is full of set backs, and you can keep moving forward anyway.   I wish I had better advice to help. &lt;3",False,False
