One time I grilled 6 medium-sized shrimp (without any oils or butter, just plain) and went to enter it in to MFP. Well, shrimp is incredibly low calorie, like 80cals for those 6 pieces.

My disordered ass was convinced that it tasted too good to be that low so I added 3tbsp of butter “just in case some old food rubbed off the grill”",False,False
