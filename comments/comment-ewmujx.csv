Huge fear foods and binge foods for me, but nuts and edemame and beans are safe since I know that they are helping my skin and hair. I love bread and pasta so much that I can't even eat them in moderation or as a treat.",False,False

I felt like carbs were the only macros that tasted good enough to be ”worth” their calories. Basically i just ate a lot of sugar. It’s a hard habit to break, but nowadays i have a better balance and i have noticed a difference. I don’t feel as tired/exhausted and my mental health and mood swings have inoroved a lot.",False,False

Probably because my dad was just obsessed with “Did you get enough protein? How much protein have you had? You need more protein!” From the little bit I know, protein is important in large part because it contains the amino acids our bodies need for building. Cells are constantly dying off and being replaced, so in effect we’re always under construction even when we’re not growing per se.   Getting some fat is important to facilitate absorption of fat-soluble nutrients. (And probably lots of other stuff I don’t know about.) The caloric density can be scary, but many people find fats help them feel fuller for longer.   Carbs can offer great stuff too though! I really don’t think they deserve to be vilified. Just like fat didn’t deserve to be vilified a decade ago. There are some super crappy highly processed foods out there, but that’s not the fault of carbohydrates or fats. If the carbs you’re eating feel good, that’s a good thing. Maybe just try to ease into finding some sources of protein and fat that also feel good to you.",False,False

I’ve slowly gotten over my fear of fats and I’m getting better about protein. My biggest motivator right now is that I want to keep getting stronger and I know I feel my best when I’m eating lots of plants with generous protein and fats added into that equation.   But you are definitely not alone! I’m not vegan or vegetarian, but I essentially ate that way during most of my restriction because I was terrified of meat. Keto would still be my nightmare and I’ll never adhere to a super low carb diet.",False,False
