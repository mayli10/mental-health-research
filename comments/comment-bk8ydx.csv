Fucking people blaming their metabolisms and thyroids for the reason they can or can't gain weight and believe you'll go into starvation mode; that your body will eat all of your muscles instead of fat like fat isn't our emergency energy stores.",False,False

While all we see is food-this, food-that, calories in and out, water retention and OMG my fatass cannot fit into size 0 cause ya know... you have bones... and organs... and they require space in your body even though your brain would gladly take them all out just to fit a certain size... they don't see that. I barely remember the time I wasn't as bothered by a fucking number as I am now. Doesn't matter I look 5 years younger and wear my 13 y.o. sisters clothes.  The point is, if you don't have this mindset, you do not see things this way. You just do stuff and tell yourself ""nah, maybe I'll try something else tomorrow"" and happily bite into a pizza",False,False

My situation is slightly different but yeah. I work with mostly women and we're all in our young to mid 20's. EVERYONE is dieting rn and going to the gym and talking about losing weight and it is so god damn triggering, especially because most of them have great bodies as is. It drives me insane sometimes. I feel like I have to be so careful about inputting anything into those conversations because I'm afraid I'll say something weird.",False,False

I'm like the most two faced bitch about it though.   Like on one hand ,I'm very knowledgeable about weight loss. No bullshit.i do appreciate that people I work with come to me with genuine questions about fad diets and what to do with their meal preps and all that. I like helping people especially when it's to steer them away from dangerous stupid shit.   But also I work as a chef and most of these people are coworkers so I know exactly how they eat 50% of their day and how much they drink. It's pretty hard to listen to some one complain about losing weight but then ask you for extra cheese and mayo on everything. I don't say anything however unless they ask ( since I generally know the macros on many things/ how to find them)   Then there is the jealous part of me. I know she has a few beers, I know she got a burger and fries the other day, I know how much fill sugar soda she drinks. And she looks way better than me- cue that whole drama.   And then there is the diet I can't really ever bring up in that conversation. I try pretty painstakingly hard to make sure my diet is mostly healthy. But if I openly discussed it in it's full glory people would think I was crazy/ was far more unhealthy than I am.",False,False
