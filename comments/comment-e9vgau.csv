I've started asking ""Why am I lucky?"" and then they'll kind of pause and say something like ""oh that you can eat all that junk and be thin.""

It completely discounts people's self control/hard work (for people who exercise) to just write it off as ""luck.""",False,False

Stop glamorizing it. Making it sound cool. Or like it's hard work. It's a compulsion that is out of control.
