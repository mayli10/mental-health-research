To avoid calorie counting, I'd recommend having something dense at night before bed in addition to the rest of your regular daily food, like a clif bar or a few spoonfuls of peanut butter. Then after a few weeks you could try weighing yourself (if that wouldn't trigger you) to see if you're still going down, then add a little more extra food if needed.",False,False
