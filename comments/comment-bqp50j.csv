Even at my lowest, my arms were disproportionately large. (Like wtf that's so unfair)  What I've noticed though, is that literally *no one* gives a shit about my arms. No one. I mean, fair, no one says ""they're like sticks"", but no one also points out how big they are.  What did your dress look like? What did your hair and make up look like? Focus on that, if you can. It helps me!  Also, the best things for 'accepting' my arms being larger (and I can only go on what you are saying, I don't know what you actually look like) was just accepting that was the way I was built.  I watched the ballet yesterday, and I noticed that the *ballerinas themselves* had different shaped arms and calves. Some were larger, some were tinier, and these were *ballet dancers in the Bolshoi*. Notoriously skinny. It got me thinking, I only notice because I'm super in tune to it. And it was like a ""huh"" moment, these are freaking dancers and *they* have different sizes.  Take a deep breath. Yesterday has gone. Today is still going. Tomorrow is a new day. You don't have to punish yourself. You're okay. You'll get through this.",False,False

My friends all talked about how fun it was, but every moment was terrible for me and my self-esteem hit an all-time low after prom.   I ate all my food, but none of my friends did. I feel like a fucking fatass.",False,False

It was no fun explaining how no one broke up with me, or hurt me, and I wasn‚Äôt drunk; I just had to leave because people were taking photos.   I‚Äôll tell you that everyone who claims high school is the best time of your life is a huge liar. It gets better.   I‚Äôm sure you looked beautiful, but I know exactly what it‚Äôs like to feel like you aren‚Äôt AT ALL.   You deserve to be happy and to be kind to yourself. It‚Äôs not easy doing any of the celebrations when you feel like this, but life is worth celebrating and YOU are worth celebrating.  Keep looking forward, and take a breath and enjoy your life.
