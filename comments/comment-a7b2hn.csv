My protein macro is a bit high and my fat is more moderate, but I do keep my carbs under 20-30g a day. I feel full consistently, it helps with hunger cues, and with my other neuro issues.   But it's definitely a strict, difficult, restrictive, and very lacking diet that I don't recommend to everyone. It works very well for me, but I think it's a bit too extreme/unnecessarily imbalanced if the benefits don't outweigh the costs for you.

Junk food terrifies me. The closest thing to junk I'll eat are things like quest bars, halo top, and other healthy-ish substitutes for real junk.   I'm really into cardio, so I eat really high carb. Like, 2/3 of my calories at least come from carbs. Mostly in the form of grains and vegetables... this is not out of anti-bread sentiment, but out of a tendency to binge on bread if I have too much of it handy. Then I also eat a fuck ton of protein to maintain the muscle/fat ratio I have somehow managed to build despite chronic under-eating. And then pretty much the minimal RDA of fat. mostly from peanut butter and fish.  Tried to be vegan-ish (as in I stopped buying animal products in my groceries, but didn't otherwise forbid them) for a while, and I liked it ok, but my IBS just didn't allow it.   If you're really active, I can't recommend high-carb enough. Your energy levels will amaze you. Just make sure they are filling carbs, not white flour and sugar. ",False,False
