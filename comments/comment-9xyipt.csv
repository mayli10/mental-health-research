""Oh no, this hurts. But I haven't hit my 3.1 mile mark and my cal goal!"" I get so irritiable if I have to change my gym routine and it puts my whole week out of whack and I hate it.   I'm also super obsessive about making sure I get enough protein to offset my intense workout, which often leaves me needed to eat very large amounts of food right before bed, and my bf is trying to convince me I can skip a day, but I can't or I risk muscle loss and injury. It's a super fun cycle (as you can probably tell).",False,False

I have to avoid the gym because I have to outdo everyone since I pick the machine in the back corner to see what others are doing. I will push it too far if I'm outside as well.  &amp;#x200B;  As far as how to get more healthy, have you tried any in-home programs? I found that if I picked a workout program to do in my living room it was helpful. It has a specific start and stop and if I pushed myself hard, I knew I was getting a good workout. It helped me keep some additional boundaries in place.",False,False

My spouse won’t let me rejoin a gym or go to one without supervision because of my marathon workouts -___- Endorphin rush+soothing OCD with counting reps+long history of working out for 8 hours a day=recipe for disaster.
