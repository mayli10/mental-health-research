Do u use to purge it or because you have a constipation problem.      Well for me, i have also been trying to over come laxative abuse when i tend to binge. I had initially started with  Dulcolax   one strip, then two strip, then three and now four.  The effects have stopped on me because of which i had to keep increase the dosage.   &amp;#x200B;  I have read a lot of books on binge eating and realized they we tend to binge eat when we plan to get on a diet program or restrict our self. I  Introduced my self to IF and dont restrict my self for what i crave. That helped me to get better and i am getting over binge eating.   &amp;#x200B;  Regarding constipation, Chia seeds + ACV with a dash of cinnamon does wonders.   Some days i also take psyllium husk too.   Fruits have also helped.",False,False

I'm pretty sure I triggered mine with the lax abuse, and the consequences of my actions were probably a lot more severe than other regular people who don't have that easy ""potential"" in their genes for gastrointestinal issues. The worst of it took about a year, about a year and a half in, maybe, and then for the last two years I didn't have to take care of myself as much. However, about 2 months ago I went through a prolonged stressful situation which triggered the gastrointestinal issues. I think it'll take me about 6 months to recover completely, but the worst is over. The takeaway: I don't usually have to watch my nutrition \*that\* much, but I definitely have to on vacation (because I eat very differently than I do at home) and during prolonged stressful situations.      What I can tell you: It will be super awful. You have to be ready for the constipation and the farting and the bloating and the frustration and the stomach pain. It will happen, and it will probably last between a couple months to perhaps a year, like me.   &amp;#x200B;  BUT IT WILL GET BETTER. I promise. IT WILL. You have to be ready for it to be terrible and KNOW that it will get better in the long -run. I say this so that you can be in the mindset and overcome temptation to relapse back to laxative abuse because it will be an easy short-term fix. But I promise it will get better, and once you stop, you can't touch laxatives ever again. But it will be so worth it.",False,False

I am so, so happy to be lax free as of today. The raw vegan diet helped me get of them.  I always start my day with watermelon, and after about one hour I usually have to go. I drink a lot of water and eat a lot of fruit. It got me of laxatives. (i used to take 10 daily).  Seriously, try eating watermelon in the morning. A lot. It will eventually get things going.  Good luck, it's so so worth it to quit lax. No more bloating, no more constipation etc.",False,False

My advice: go to a professional. A stomach doctor to get his advice.   My experience: I took Dulcolax every day for a year. Went up to 7 pills a day at one point. Even dehydrated myself dangerously one time. I weaned myself off over a month, forcing myself to only have a pill or two every 3-4, then went cold turkey. That was over three years ago and swore to never take a single laxative again. I haven’t, and though I have many gastrontestinal problems, they come and go and are manageable with how I eat.   Maybe you can give yourself a time frame to weane yourself off off them and stick to it, no matter the constipation. And it will happen, and you have to be ready for it. Sometimes I poop once a month. Sometimes 3 times a week. DM me if you need support!",False,False

He had me stop taking them cold-turkey and replace them with the metamucil, then gradually decrease the metamucil, but I definitely wasn't 100% compliant with that and did still sometimes take dulcolax during the weaning off process.",False,False
