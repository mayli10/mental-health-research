I'm very glad you're recognizing a spark in yourself to live, and if you need to talk, we're all here for you, sunshine.  I believe in you.",False,True

I may be a bit too sensitive but I can't bring myself to do so yet  Why are we like this sometimes?   I mean, I'm not anorexic, I have a different kind of disorder, but I've had my own moments of deep denial (never as bad as hers tho) and even then I've seen reason to at least try and get better",False,True

Not to be rude or insensitive but I don’t want my life to get like this. I can’t lose my hair or look skeletal. I don’t want to die.   I’m still a normal weight, I can get out now.   she’s so young and there’s still so much potential. It’s heartbreaking, the level of denial.",False,False

Looked through her stuff and the denial is crazy strong. She has thousands of people already following her and commenting on her photos with encouragement and that’s not enough to make her see. She strongly believes that she has no choice or say in the matter of her getting better. When you deny your own agency and don’t take responsibility for your own life, you can’t recover. Very sad to see but I would advise you not to engage with her content. At best, she would just ignore it and it would be a waste of time. At worst, you validate her ED and help her make herself sicker.",False,False
