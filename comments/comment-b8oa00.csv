You need to talk to them and let them help you. They will feel one-thousand time worse if something happens to you and they could have helped if they’d only known. *Please* let your parents help you; to them you are always their little girl, no matter how grown-up you get.   At least if you go to them now, you’re still somewhat in control—unlike if they get a call from the hospital or worse. Take care of yourself and good luck! I hope you’re able to get the help you need.",False,False

I don't know. What are the downsides to talking to your family? Keep us updated. ,False,False

The doctor I see is actually the campus nurse practitioner and I also see the on-campus psychiatrist for clonazepam and I have a therapist I've been seeing for years, but none of them specialize in eating disorders.  My family definitely doesn't suspect - I go to school on the opposite coast and haven't seen them since January. My dad is coming to town this weekend though, which is maybe why telling them is on my mind. I've lost a lot of weight since I've last seen him but I don't think he'll say anything. ",False,True

They can put people on psych holds sometimes but the rules differ by state and country and stuff.   So you're in college - is there college counseling?  Do you think your family suspects at all?,False,False

I’ve seen people with BMIs 11 or 12 insisting they “feel fine” when plenty of people die with BMIs 18+. Your parents might be relieved that you’re getting help. I know mine were.,False,False

In high school I was admitted to an intensive outpatient program for depression and things had to be SO bad for me to get there. And it totally broke my parents' hearts, I don't know how to do that to them a second time. ",False,True

Think of it this way, the longer you put off IP/PHP the longer it will take for you to get back on your feet. I did PHP over winter break after getting out the hospital for a suicide attempt at the end of fall semester and managed to be able to start school right away again in January. Your professors will work with you to get your end of semester assignments/tests done. You can’t graduate in December if you’re dead, and if you put off treatment now you’re more likely to end up in treatment when you should be getting ready to graduate.",False,False
