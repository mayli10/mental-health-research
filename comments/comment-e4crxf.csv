Love finds you when it finds you - there is no “right time”, and we shouldn’t have to sacrifice our whole selves to our disorders. We will honestly probably always struggle with this in some way, and the future will roll along, pulling us forward into it no matter what.   If happiness is tugging at your arm, maybe you should follow it.   I wasn’t expecting to fall in love either. I had my whole life sorted out, new city, new job, happy marriage, and then, ! I was just struck by it, out of the blue. Conversations like you describe, not light, but easy. It sounds like the two of you have a potential for a special connection. These do not happen every day.   We are still worthy of gifts, of divinity, of serendipity from the world. YOU are worthy of the happiness you can eke out from that which finds you.",False,False
