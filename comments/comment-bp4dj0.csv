However, I don't know if she can technically can make me go.  I feel bad because I've tried to work up the courage to talk to her for the past month. I know I should pull off the bandaid and talk to her at my next appointment. I think she is more reasonable than my current therapist, so I hope it will go well.",False,True

It sounds like you don't want this. But I want you to know that you're worth it. &lt;3   With regards to your concern, this is not the same therapist that made the 100 lb ultimatum, so maybe the same rules won't apply? If you tell the therapist what is happening, maybe the two of you can work through it without having to go inpatient? ALSO, maybe a different therapist altogether is best? Especially since you don't feel like this one helped you back a few years ago?   Whether guy or girl, your struggle is still valid, though I understand, partially, what you mean about it complicating things.    no matter what, I'm going to keep you in my thoughts.",False,False
