Don't try to undermine your struggles with this thought. One cannot give themselves a disorder. We can, however, convince ourselves that our disorder ""isn't real"" and that we must have ""gotten it intentionally"". A normal, non-disordered person doesn't think ""Oh, I'll try anorexia"". That is what someone with an eating disorder would do, because only disordered people would start disordered eating habits.   &gt;now I want out but I can’t. I’m too deep in this.   The fact that you want out is a good thing. It's a hard thing. It's the worst part. It's the most difficult part to handle. It's you, realizing the danger. Realizing the scary reality of the situation. Lots of people lose that feeling, they get complacent in misery. You want to get better. You can get better. You will get better.   There is no place so far gone that you cannot come back. Your struggles are real. They are valid. Your suffering is real. But it is also not permanent. Things can improve. You deserve a life that brings you joy.",False,False
