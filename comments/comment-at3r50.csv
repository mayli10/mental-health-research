I think at times I find it helpful to read, although I don't read it every day as suggested.  It worked in a way because since , then I've felt okay maintaining for now.  The really shitty past ED behaviours and consequences shouldn't be forgotten to remind yourself how hideous it can get.  Of course, other times I think fuck it and can't even imagine ever being more content and healthier but that's eating disorders, eh.  I know my position isn't ideal, but it's better than it was.    I don't believe you're incurable.  I used to think restricting and starving was the only thing I was good at, but I thought that when the ONLY thing I thought about and did 24/7 was be anorexic, totally immersed.   It doesn't give you any way to express yourself through interests or socialising or whatever to find out you're pretty good at other things.  It's usually the case that nobody's ever told you they thought you were good at such and such so you think you must be lousy at them.  You then get diagnosed with an ED and you're bombarded with confirmation you're ""good"" at weight loss.    Sorry for the ramble.  I really hope you get something out of your letter.  I spent ages on mine, it was so difficult to write.  You can do recovery.  I believe you can.  Also, you're good at writing, so there you go.  x  &amp;#x200B;",False,False
