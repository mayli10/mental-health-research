Korean Barbecue All You Can Eat for $15.... yes.  smoked a metric fuck ton of weed, then went to the kbbq place. bruh. i dont even know how much we ate. i had at least 3-4 piled high plates of food. she gets up, says ""watch my stuff, i'm gonna go get rid of this."" completely deadpan. she goes in the bathroom, you can lowkey hear her vomiting, she comes back. high me thinks, ""Outstanding Move."" gets up, goes ""ill be right back,"" and i proceed to also purge in the same single stall bathroom as my friend that also Highkey smelled like puke.

""close enough"" i think. i douse that shit in a dishsoap/vinegar/water solution. pat pat pat. more anti germ/stain concoction. pat pat pat. i do this for 30 minutes, until you can barely tell the stain was there. Covered it in baking soda, let it sit for a day, vacuumed it up. More disinfectant. Never smelled, but there was a slight... discoloration. i text my roommate that i threw up from the stomach flu and may have stained the carpet. i Pay to get it cleaned when we moved out. she keeps it. she uses it in her current room. she doesnt know. her friends dont know.... but I Do.
