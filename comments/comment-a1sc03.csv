I LOVEEEEE oatmeal, can't go a morning without it. So I switched to this [Hot Cereal](https://www.hodgsonmill.com/products/multi-grain-cereal-with-quinoa-flax) that is not good to eat raw so I'm not tempted to eat it unless it's cooked for breakfast.       It still is like oatmeal, slightly different texture, but still the same nutrition and calories. It's not the same but a darn good replacement and worth all the prevented binges! ",False,False

After participating in a thread about safe foods and mentioning out loud that I had retired some of my safe foods like oatmeal, bananas and nuts made me feel like I had acknowledged the silly notion that some of my favorite foods had power over me and I brought them back about 4 days ago and eating them with success.
