It really sucks at first and can be pretty overwhelming. But you'll feel so much better almost immediately!  And you'll get really good at checking labels, it'll just come in time. Be aware fwiw that gluten free alternatives are a lot of times higher calorie and less fortified than what they are replacing (bread, muffins, etc.). We're lucky in that Gluten Free is a fad diet now, so labeling and general awareness is 10 times better than it was say 10 or 20 years ago, so we could have it worse. ü§∑",False,False

Sneaky gluten is sooooo freaking annoying. My biggest WATCH OUT tip is anything teriyaki/soy/asian flavored (like nuts, beef jerky, salad dressings, marinades) because they 99% of the time are made with regular soy sauce. Even if the label doesn't explicitly say so, soy sauce is usually the wheaty kind, and if it's not the ingredients will usually call it tamari instead of soy sauce. If you have a hankering for asian flavors without the wheat, my fav is the Annie's organic sesame ginger dressing (it's made with tamari!).   Also, as you've discovered, barley isn't considered a top-10 allergen, so they don't even have to bold it on labels üôÑ it's usually found in things where they want to add a ""roasty"" or ""full"" flavor. Most ""hard"" beverages (like hard lemonade, hard ice tea, hard soda) etc are malt, aka barley malt. That's another annoying sneaky one.  You'll get a feel for it soon though. Mostly it's just getting in the habit of double checking ingredients, even when they *should* be safe. I've glutened myself many times with an ""eat now, check later"" philosophy hahaha.   My other big tip is don't read celiac message boards lol (i'm assuming you have celiac). They're full of people who supposedly have refractory celiac (something like 75% of cases of refractory celiac are actually dietary non- compliance), who blame all their health woes on it, who have eliminated a crazy number of foods ""to be safe,"" and who are afraid of picking up gluten from door handles (I swear I read that on a message board, this woman wouldn't touch door handles in public cause of possible gluten).  You won't feel better right away, and that is normal! It took me prolly 2 yrs to feel 100% again. As long as you are doing what you should in your diet and avoiding cross contamination, it doesn't mean you have refractory celiac or anything. It just means you're still healing. I have found it very helpful to keep my house 100% GF. If that's an option, it helps assure that home prepped meals are safe. Otherwise anything porous or with small, hard to clean areas should have a second set for GF only- cutting boards, plastic or wooden utensils or servingware, colanders, and scratched non-stick cookware or cast iron cookware can  hang on to gluteny bits.  Also i was sooooo paranoid at first cause there is so much WRONG information out there about what might contain gluten. Distilled liquors and vinegars, modified food starch, glucose syrup- all can be made from wheat, and all are definitely processed to the point where it would be scientifically impossible for gluten to remain. It's easy to get caught up in the paranoia but it's not worth it. Live your life. Eat carefully, but don't let it take over everything! We've got enough food issues as it is, you don't need that craziness in your life, haha.  I was so scared at first, I felt like my life was over. Now it's just routine, it's no big deal. Eating GF isn't really even difficult once you're in the habit. I miss some things sometimes but for the most part I don't really feel like i'm missing out- 99% of the gluteny things I turn down are just crap anyway. Like, why would I even WANT crappy grocery store donuts? Lol. ",False,False

Isn't it bs that celestial seasonings puts BARLEY in TEA? I found that out the hard way, my dumb ass didn't check ingredients until after I drank a cup (cause it's TEA, how could there be gluten in TEA?). Aaaaanyway watch out for most of their ""dessert"" flavors, it's not just the sugar cookie sleigh ride that's poison.  Tazo makes a vanilla bean macaron flavor that I think is nice in the same way and gluten free :) they also make a pumpkin spice chai that is to die for if you are a pumpkin spice kind of person.
