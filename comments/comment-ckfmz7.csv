Same story, great friends in high school and a little beyond, she was actually my little ana buddy back then and we’d steal hydroxycuts with ephedra (I’m old) and get into nonsense but she was always the prettier, skinnier, more liked friend. Cut to a few years later and we’re roommates and she turns out to be an absolute nightmare to live with. Giant falling out, she shit talks about me and I consider stealing her cat because I was the one caring for him anyway.   A decade goes by and I’m leaving Walmart as she’s walking in, it looks like she’s wearing a literal fatsuit the likes of something from the nutty professor. Part of me wanted to tail her and take photos.   I don’t feel shitty about it and neither should you. It’s just a part of human nature to get schadenfreude from someone who was bad to you. Ultimately they’re living with their choices, perhaps if they were better to you then you would have been there to support them and make better decisions.",False,False

She was terribly manipulative and us breaking up was the best thing for my mental health.  Checking up on her makes me incredibly happy especially because she would always give me faulty nutrition advice that I could never call her out on, guess she's learning now.",False,False
