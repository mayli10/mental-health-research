I smoke weed every day and it helps melt away food anxiety, indecision, gives me an appetite, helps me keep the food down and not think too hard after I eat.    As far as prescribed meds, Wellbutrin helped me out of a binge phase because it annihilated my appetite and made every food taste bad. Honestly I stopped taking it a month ago and this is still lasting. Anyone else experience this?",False,False

I also have a nasty tendency to binge-and-crash with alcohol. It's more related to my other issues (bipolar and anxiety) than my ED though. I use the pot to calm me down and the nicotine to level me out when I'm manic/pick me up when Im depressed. I've always viewed my ED as an addiction itself so it's never surprised me that I overindulge in substances like that. ",False,False

The main ones I got into from my ED were coke and amphetamine. They get you skinny at first, but after 5 years or more of regular use the weight somehow creeps back on, I’ve seen this in myself, in friends and I’ve noticed that at least 50% of celebs who have long term habits with either of these two are overweight, especially if they’re over 30. Neither of them helped with my ED and just gave me other bad habits on top of the losing too much weight habit. They’re quite psychologically addictive and not easy to quit so I don’t recommend them.  Atm I am into psychedelics, and these things are helping me gain insight to my disorder and give me the tools to work on fixing myself. They’re not an easy option by any means though and they can be merciless when not used properly. I think they’ve done wonders for me but would advise others to tread carefully, use with respect and responsibility, and to wait until at least age 25 (when the brain is fully developed) and avoid completely if you are susceptible to schizophrenia or some personality disorders.",False,False
