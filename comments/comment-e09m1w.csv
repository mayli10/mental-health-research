Blonde roast coffee + blonde espresso are both smoother and lighter flavors as far as coffee goes so they’re a nice way to get the taste without the acidity.",False,False

I don’t have a coffee maker (fingers crossed for Christmas) but tomorrow is a road trip and I know my husband will have us stop at Starbucks.  Thanks for the ideas!,False,True

I honestly prefer what I make at home with my $15 Black and Decker.   But that aside, a light roast usually has a milder flavor than a dark roast. My favorite caloric splurge for coffee is to add a couple teaspoons of half-and-half. It only takes a little to totally change the flavor profile. When I was first starting to drink coffee I’d mix in a little hot cocoa powder. Eventually I just switched to drinking it black - cheaper, easier, and in short order I even liked it better :) Enjoy your coffee adventure!",False,False
