I need to post a write up one of these days with all my feelings.   When I look in the mirror, I feel like I’m just seeing a pump. Even after a couple days, you know how your muscles still have a little extra tension in them? I feel like that’s all I have.   When I look at pictures, I feel like it’s just better lighting and posing. I feel like an instagramreality catfish. I feel like I’m not even fit, just look hot automatically because I am a 23 year old blonde chick.",False,False

I can look okay in a picture if I use a self timer. I can look okay in a mirror.   and then just look wide as pickup truck in a mirror selfie.  It does help to stand back farther though, when you're close to a mirror you get some foreshortening which isn't super flattering",False,False
