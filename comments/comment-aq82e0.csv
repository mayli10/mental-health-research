I try REALLY hard to not throw away homemade food, but I did. Not a lot, mind, but I had to get it out.  It’s the worst fucking feeling. I wish I could tell my mom not to make so much but she’d ask why and I’d have to tell her either a bullshit lie or the truth, and I hate the thought of either.  I just need to have the control over what I eat and when, and I can’t fucking do it when people give me homemade food. I have no idea the calorie count, plus my mom has a habit of adding tons of butter/oil to everything, and I can’t bear the thought of slowing progress. Even more than I can’t bear the thought of being a wasteful, ungrateful shit.",False,False
