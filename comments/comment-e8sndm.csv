My ED started like 8 years ago but I was in pseudorecovery for the last 2-3ish years of that. A smaller accident was what prompted me trying to recover on my own that time too. I have a lot more resources this time and I’m glad to at least know what’s going on. Just wish it wasn’t the case!!",False,True

If you wake up with your arms sore then you need to start eating some sort of candy and a supplement in the night.  Cause it means your are seizing in the night. I had to have my finger pricked three times a day because mine was so bad.,False,False

My glucose has always read normally or low normal but the last time I was in, 6 weeks ago, it was very low. I didn’t get those labs because I have health anxiety so they only share what I need to know at my appointments. So I had no idea. I was in today and turns out it was a hypoglycemic episode. Yeet.",False,True

I have an extensive history with severe anemia but idk how quickly that can come on?? At the time I thought it was stress/coincidence but now idk.   I coincidentally see my primary care and therapist tomorrow so I’m sure it’ll come up either way.",False,True

Came home and ate some oatmeal with my puppy. I’m grateful to have backup financial support that I know will be available if I can’t make it work alone.   Thanks for the support too!! I’m feeling a lot more grounded.,False,True
