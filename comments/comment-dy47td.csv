Mine was probably DSPS and if I went to sleep ‚Äútoo early‚Äù (too early for me was any time before 3:00 AM) I would have exactly this happen. It wreaked havoc on my life.   Now I‚Äôm on Adderall so I‚Äôm awake during the day and somehow also able to fall asleep and stay asleep.   I also have panic disorder which I‚Äôm medicated for.   Could totally be low blood sugar, just throwing out my experience because this sounded so familiar to what used to happen to me!! Good luck üíï",False,False
