I completely understand what you mean about practically begging yourself to eat because you're so exhausted and you know you need the fuel to function, yet ultimately deciding it isn't worth the self hate... And oh, the fear of gaining weight... I don't know how I can go back to eating normally, how do people eat like that and maintain healthily without much exercise? I'm trying to recover (well, forced to really, my mom noticed but I'm trying to embrace it... Trying...). I used to skip breakfast and lunch and purge dinner, though now I eat a small breakfast and normal dinner. I hate myself for it all. But the energy is amazing. I don't quite beat myself up so much if I eat a lot or eat calorie-heavy foods over weekends, but that voice is still there loudly. I have gained some weight, and it terrifies me, but it's less than I thought. I'm still undereating slightly though on average. I don't know.",False,False

It just gets so loud and tangled and eventually it’s too much. I was abusing alcohol and sleeping meds to try to cope. I’m so glad I finally found a therapist who listens and tries to understand what I‘m experiencing when I say “My brain is loud!” but struggle to explain beyond that. Have you considered accessing any support services your university might offer? I ended up seeking help during graduate school because I was so crippled by depression that my ability to complete my program was in jeopardy. It was really scary making that initial phone call, but I’m glad I did.",False,False
