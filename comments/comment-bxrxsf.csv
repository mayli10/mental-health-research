They may be able to help by finding ways you can cope with the compulsions. My therapist helps with that and she also works with intuitive eating. With overeaters, that can be difficult at first because it seems like your body is always telling you to eat, and a therapist can help you work through those compulsions to figure out when you are really hungry or just feeling a compulsion.  Hope that helps, good luck!",False,False
