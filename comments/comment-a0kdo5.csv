I too have an abusive best friend who uses and manipulated my misophonia with none other than chips. Literally will go out of her way to buy or find chips in any situation we are together to get in my head and get what she wants :^) love it (not),False,False

I think that's a shift made by recovery in the past few years.   I really fear oil though because it's a sneaky little fucker and can be added to foods without you even realizing it's there. I'm not talking fried food but just even 'healthy' sautes, dressings, salads. Nuts, dairy and avocado are the same...I really panic when salads are a healthy option at catering things and I see they have oily dressing, avocado, a type of cheese, some nuts, eggs and their yolks and even a dried fruit.  Might as well offer me a double cheeseburger, fries and a non-diet soda.",False,False

Snacks are an apple, cereal bar, raw carrot, dry cracker or a low cal yogurt.  I panic over anything else.  My biggest panic would be oranges/orange juice, anything with sugar, rice, potato and god forbid something like pizza.  Same foods over and over for YEARS.  Always COLD.  The Christmas Markets are hell right now because of the smell of the hot food.    I'm totally fine with pasta though.  I lost weight eating it and now I'm maintaining eating it, so it's safe for me.  I have to know the calorie content though, so buy ready made pasta.  &amp;#x200B;  &amp;#x200B;",False,False

The kind you order from the chain place down the street.   It is so dense, so bingeable, and not filling at all. I can easily eat a large one to myself.   Just last night though, I went to a pizza place I wasn't terrified of and had a huge one for 600 calories that made me stuffed. So it's not always bad. When I had more spare money I also used to make mini pizzas at home a lot, in the toaster oven with pita bread for crust.  &amp;#x200B;  \-Chips. Same principle. Fortunately, I don't usually find them that tempting. And there are a few brands I'll eat when I really want a chips fix that are actually a decent serving size for the calories.  Adding to this fear, my narcissistic, abusive ""best friend"" gained 20 lbs binging on chips last winter. Loudly, because she knows I have misonphonia. She constantly goes on about chips, about different kinds of chips, about how they're really an extremely healthy food, sends her boyfriend down the street in the middle of the night to obtain chips, etc. Fuckin chips.
