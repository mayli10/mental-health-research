Then had Sunday dinner at my brother‚Äôs and ate sort of normally. It was so good. I weighed the exact same the next morning which was a relief, but I‚Äôve been stuck at this exact weight all week which is annoying.  Then was meant to fast yesterday and just eat how I wanted today and tomorrow, then Boxing Day onwards I was gonna follow my pre-planned &gt;!100-250!&lt; restriction schedule to get myself back under control. But then yesterday I fasted, then it got to 6pm and I ate &gt;!290!&lt; calories. I was pissed at myself but decided it‚Äôd be okay and I can still enjoy Christmas Eve/Christmas then get back in schedule. It‚Äôs weird I‚Äôm super excited to eat normally and enjoy food today and tomorrow but I‚Äôm also super excited to get back on a restriction schedule.   Anyways there‚Äôs my life story no-one asked for lmao",False,False
