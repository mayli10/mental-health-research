I just isolate and destroy my relationships and dont bother to further my life in anyway. I thought it was bad in college but fully living as an adult like this is so lonely and empty and fucking pointless.  I'm so sorry you feel so alone this shit is insufferable and frustrating and no one should have to deal with it. If you ever want to talk message me if you're feeling alone or just want to talk or vent.",False,False

Basically have no friends, live alone, work a solitary job and after a bunch of trauma I put myself through last year the only thing that makes me feel in control of what my life has come to is restricting and binge drinking every day. Please reach out to me because I am starving for friends more than anything &lt;3 take care",False,False
