I left that session ready to take control back in my life. I decided to have literally a cup of steamed chinese broccoli from a restaurant down the road but halfway through I had a panic attack because it tasted like they used oil in the sauce so I ran to the toilet and purged YaY rEcOvErY!!! Then my bf bought himself KFC chips and left them by my bedside and I woke up at 2am to feed my son and ate like 200 calories worth of disgusting cold fries while I was half asleep!!! I feel putrid today and I want to recover because this disease is controlling me but I only have 6kg until I hit my goal and I can‚Äôt let that go? Why the fuck can I not just get rid of this cunt in my head that is killing me????   And fuck halfway through writing this post I went to go have my morning cigarette but realised I didn‚Äôt have them with me and I had a complete sobbing breakdown in front of a student nurse üôÉ over a fucking cigarette üôÉ because it‚Äôs a crucial part of my morning routine and it sent me into a complete panic attack üôÉ   So she sat with my kids while I went down to my car and now I‚Äôm having a smoke and feeling okay again and completely shame spiraling for looking like such a fucking wreck. Why can‚Äôt I be stronger?   Life is shitting on me. My 4 year old has fucking brain cancer and I don‚Äôt know if she will even see her 5th birthday.  I have developed panic disorder now, plus my anorexia is back in full force and I‚Äôm fucking tormented by it. And I was fucking sexually assaulted again recently which brought back all my ptsd and I haven‚Äôt even begun to process that because it‚Äôs just too much. we‚Äôve been in hospital for so long and I have my 3 month old with me all the time and my SO has spent a grand total of 15 hours here because he‚Äôs struggling real bad with his own shit. I have hardly any support and I am so close to losing it. I went through my phone contacts to see if I had anyone to call who could come help me and there was no one. I feel so alone.   Thanks to anyone who reads all this. I‚Äôm so fucking lonely I just need a friend and I have none because for some reason when your child gets cancer everyone fucking disappears! Fuck",False,False
