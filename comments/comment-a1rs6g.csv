I am not a huge holiday person either, they stress me out, but I love decorating and giving gifts. I think it's fun to spend holidays alone, I cook and have the day off from work and watch holiday movies and spoil my dogs and SO all day. ",False,False

Tbh I am starting to prefer that. It's like a magical day (off from work!) you can do ANYTHING you want. I like to think of it as an opportunity because if I were with my family, I know I'd be miserable on that day, but instead I have a chance to really enjoy life by doing my favorite things, eating my favorite foods (or not!) and hanging out with my animals.  Don't think of it as lonely, think of it as peaceful! Make a plan for that day, don't just let it 'happen'. Remember tons of Jews are not celebrating and instead are going to see movies and getting Chinese food! You could do that too. Christmas alone is underrated!!! ",False,False
