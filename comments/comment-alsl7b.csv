I don't really understand how its that related to what op said but anyway  &amp;#x200B;   I hope this explanation might help:   &amp;#x200B;  Triggers are individual things. Sometimes they follow a trend (old haunts/watching others do related behaviours) but they are individual. A trigger is something that kinda ""activates"" or ""reactivates"" anxiety related to a trauma or disorder. So for example, a lot of  alcoholics may get triggered by being in a bar watching people drink, but that does't mean EVERY alcoholic will be triggered by that. Not every person with PTSD will be triggered by the sound of a dog or a gun, but some will. Some bulimics may feel drawn to a compulsive behaviour by seeing thinness, but this doesn't mean you  ",False,False

Sometimes seeing skinny people makes me binge (like some weird rat brain in me says you’re never gonna be like that anyway... or conversely I think i project and subconsciously think I’m the same BMI as them so I’m entitled to a binge lmao) or can make me hard core restrict.   Even I don’t know which way the switch will flick.,False,False
