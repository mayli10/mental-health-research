It means so much to me. I appreciate your suggestions for other ways to cope, and it’s really changed my perspective to hear that my broken leg is the only thing that needs to be ‘cured.’ I’m grateful to have found this community tucked away in Reddit",False,True

You know that now you don't have the option to purge, yes you might gain weight because you still binge – but lack of the release might lead you to reduce your binge-eating.   I think there is good conditions for you to face your feelings in this state  – those feelings that you're usually trying to binge-eat &amp; purge away from. Binging numbs you, or brings something that's in your life that's missing – while purging provides a release, relief and a sense of liberation.  In my own journey, I found that I go into B-P cycles because in those specific periods in my life I find feelings and emotions too much, so it's that same numbing-releasing mechanism I described above. I really hope that in the state and circumstances you are in you will find another coping mechanism (journalling, meditating, crying (love that... the best calorie-free alternative to bulimia, that I personally found), talking to someone, receiving hugs) – that would replace your usual ED pattern.",False,False
