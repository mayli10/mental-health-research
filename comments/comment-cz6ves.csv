Maybe it depends on having a particular subtype of young body that isn't burnt out yet? In college, I could eat nearly nothing, be on my feet constantly, get As. Now that I'm a little older, I eat one meal a day and I can barely think or move most days.

I also have mostly morning classes (10:30-12:30) and then one afternoon class (a 1:30 MWF and a 4:00 TTh) and it works out that I can take a quick nap on the break, and ill have my coffee and a piece of fruit before my morning classes to get me through.
