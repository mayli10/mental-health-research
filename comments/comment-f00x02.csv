Instead of being upset I like to find humor in the situation of our little passive aggressive calorie war ðŸ˜‚,False,True

She never kept food in the house so I couldn't secretly terrorize her like this. What we liked to do was watch the movie she hated most and quote it word for word at the same time. She was a bitch on wheels that I get chills up my spine when I hear her name.,False,False

Itâ€™s understandable to feel upset or hurt when someone is being judgy, but guerrilla caloric warfare doesnâ€™t actually improve that situation for you? And, I mean...(a) think how devastated youâ€™d be if someone did this to your food, and (b) is messing with each otherâ€™s food a door you want to open? Passive aggressive communication has a tendency to escalate to bad places and engender even more hurt than at the start.   Iâ€™m sorry sheâ€™s being hurtful to you. I hope youâ€™ll be able to set a good boundary and really hope she will be mature enough to respect that.",False,False
