He feels like you're neglecting him, so explain how you aren't. Maybe he'll react bad, maybe he'll react better than you could've imagined, but it sounds like keeping your struggles a secret from him is only going to make things worse with time.",False,False

It was a short relationship, he felt I wasn't keen on him but really I thought he was so amazing and attractive I'd stress about getting slim and looking good for him which would result in me stress binge-eating every time I wanted to go see him. Then I'd bail, and feel so horrible, binge again, wake up bloated and still not want to see him because of how disgusting I felt. I's such a sad vicious cycle :( I totally understand you.",False,False
