Stimulants mess with appetite like nothing else. The hunger I feel if I don‚Äôt take my Adderall is the most frantic, disembodied yawning gluttony-monster I have ever experienced. If you take another rest day, at least now you KNOW that you‚Äôll be up against that feeling. It‚Äôll be expected. I don‚Äôt know if that will help, it often doesn‚Äôt help me, but it‚Äôs something.   I have very low bp normally, so I don‚Äôt THINK Adderall has changed my bp since it‚Äôs still low. You can always call ahead and ask- better to know either way.   ",False,False

I felt like a failure. Thank you for sharing that with me.  And no no, they didn't tell me to skip my Vyvanse for these appointments, but, as I already kind of normally have high bp, I'm really scared being on Vyvanse will artificially increase it and they'll think something is wrong with me. Has your bp ever been high because of adderall?",False,False

Long story short, this fucked me over.  That‚Äôs messed up that the doctor cancelled on you! I know firsthand how much ‚Äúrest days‚Äù from stimulants SUCK. I always ALWAYS binge on my rest days and I can‚Äôt function normally without my medication so I end up laying on the couch shotgunning bread into my face feeling like garbage. I don‚Äôt take many rest days now that I have a kid. I feel like I can‚Äôt afford that lack of productivity or momentum anymore.   Are you sure you have to forgo the Vyvanse to have your bp taken? I‚Äôve never had a doctor say anything to me about my bp requiring me to forgo the Adderall before. ",False,False

All that came up was purple water from the tums and water I had, so I realized I was freaking out for no reason. Started to get freezing. Sat in front of my super hot heater. Got super dizzy and felt like I was going to faint. Binged again because I wanted to stop the faintness. Collapsed in exhaustion and feel asleep for over 9 hours.

For about two weeks near the beginning of January, I went on vacation to a place where it was basically unavoidable to eat everything in sight. So I figured why the fuck not give myself permission to since I had no choice anyway?  I gained 6 pounds in just shy of 2 weeks. Which I'm annoyed about but I did this to myself. I figured I'd lose the weight in like 2-3 weeks. But now, two weeks after my return, I'm only down a pound. A. Singular. Pound.  Before this vacation, I'd low restrict and/or fast completely without thought. I now can barely even eat below maintenance since my return. I'm now hungry all the time! I'll have eaten and an hour later, it's like I had nothing at all!  I tried so hard to be on track today but I ended at 50 cal over maintenance and what pisses me off more than anything is I'm. Still. Starving. My tummy is growling. I'm grumpy. I'm bloated. I just want my eating habits back! Why is this so hard??  I knew before the vacation that I'd be setting myself back like a month. And I was mad about it but it was better than outing myself. But now, after? I almost wish I'd not gone at all. Cuz I'm not set back a month. I'm set back indefinitely until I can make my stomach behave. And who knows when that will be??? I feel like such a failure!",False,False

I told them my issues were ""anxiety and an eating disorder."" Just typing that out to send was super scary. Hitting send was even scarier. Recovering from my ED seems like the next step to being a Happy and Healthy Adult (tm), but it feels like both the right and wrong decision at the same time. I know the doubt is just my ED showing its ugly face, but it's hard to rationalize in my head.  As someone who's always had disordered eating but didn't fully develop an ED until about 2 years ago, I've always felt some sort of dislike/disgust towards my body as a whole, but especially the cellulite concentrated on my thighs/butt. Even now, being only four pounds away from underweight, they're still lumpy and dimpled. How the hell do I even start to make peace with them? Is it even possible? I suppose that's what recovery is for.",False,False
