When I was super thin people always told me how models are tall and willowy and how I fit the bill. Also felt more powerful somehow haha. I probably would've liked it if I was over 6ft too.  Now since I usually pass as a guy I'm just average but that's alright too",False,False

I went from almost always being the shortest person in any group to being taller than most girls I knew so I struggle a lot with height dysphoria. I think it has more to do with being trans than my eating disorder, but it definitely has played a role here.
