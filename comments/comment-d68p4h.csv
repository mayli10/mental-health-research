I was just replying what Iâ€™ve been told, so now that I realize, it makes no sense. Sorry, it was like five am and I was really tired, and lately I cannot think straight.

When you do not eat or skip meals for a while, the next thing you eat doubles the amount of calories because your body is like going on letâ€™s call it Apocalipsis mode and tried to absorb as many calories and nutrients as possible because it doesnâ€™t know when itâ€™s next meal is going to be. I repeat though, I do not know if this is true, but Iâ€™ve been told this a lot.",False,False
