Personally, if my parent made me an appointment without asking me I'd feel a bit encroached upon and probably wouldn't go. To be clear, I'm 100% pro recovery as no one deserves the shit we go through with our illnesses. But I feel like to be effective, you have to be the one that decides to get better, for you.  As far as options: you could not go as you didn't set the appointment, you could go and lie as you stated, or you can go and be honest, and likely, continue to go with the aim of recovery or at least improvement. However, I'd encourage you to be honest with yourself. Is this something *you* want, that you want to work hard for? If it's not, I'd be concerned about the effectiveness of treatment. Which isn't to say it won't help at all, it very well could, but it might not go as well as it would if you were 100% in it.",False,False
