I replied mostly to see if you knew anything further about how liability is determined in more casual cases of research and study like this, as I have absolutely no idea.   I've noticed these kinds of posts are becoming more common lately, is that just me? Is this sub coming out into the light too much? I wasn't on /proed for long so idk how often posts like these were made there.",False,False

I dunno???  There's a big difference between informally handing out research surveys to your class/high school versus recruiting subjects for a study in an anonymous, global platform. The potential for harm and legal liability is much higher.  The teacher should definitely know better.  Either he doesn't know the student is posting here, he doesn't have enough expertise under his belt, or he's teaching his students to ignore the most basic ethics requirements for human research.",False,False

I took AP Capstone too, and a component of my project was sending out a survey for other students at my school to respond to. It's not a university study or official research project, though at least in my course we published our findings on a website we made throughout the year. Not sure if there are legal implications, or if what you're requesting still applies, just trying to provide more context.",False,False

Does your primary investigator/teacher have IRB approval for this study?  If so, he should have told you to include this information in this request.  If he does NOT have IRB approval, posting this study in a public forum like this is putting him and the school in danger.    This is NOT intended to critique you, OP.  You obviously are in the beginning stages of your career.  Your teacher has all the responsibility here and should know better if he has a master's degree.",False,False
