It's like when you have a big zit on your face and somebody goes ""what's that on your face?"" and then you feel it and think about it for the remainder of your waking hours. Except I'm relapsing from recovery and moving in and out of binge/restrict cycles, so I know that nothing is actually WRONG with feeling full, that it's 100% normal. I'm just gaslighting myself and it sucks. ",False,True

I believe it depends on WHAT you eat!   For example, if you eat protein rich foods, they can help you sleep.   Carbs can interfere with melatonin release and Insulin in the pancreas, so you either sleep worse or even better because some people say they sleep better with carbs in the evening, maybe related to Serotonin release!   Digestion works better after some time of fasting, but how you feel with food in your system still depends on what youÂ´ve eaten.  Also the TYPE of Carbs!   Better non-Gluten grains, no simple sugars. Maybe starches and fiber would give you a better feeling. ",False,False
