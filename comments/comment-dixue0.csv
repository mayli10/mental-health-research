It's basically a bowl of parsely with some stuff.  The only truly calorific item in it is the olive oil, and when you make it yourself u can control that",False,False

The brand I buy is called Near East and you can find them on the isle with mashed potato instant meals. I really like this dinner below because it has a lot of veggies and makes me feel pretty healthy.   The one I get is 190 calories for 1/2 cup uncooked+1 tablespoon of the seasoning. I wish I knew what the seasoning was individually but unfortunately they don’t say!   I make the couscous according to its instructions and when it’s almost cooked all the way I put some freshly diced onion (20 cal worth) into it. Once the couscous is fully cooked I add an heirloom tomato (33 cal) and some pepper and I let the couscous warm the tomato.   Then as a side I lay out spinach (30 cal worth) and have that with 10 baby carrots (which I high estimate as 50 calories).   The whole meal is 325 calories (rounded up from 323) and it is pretty big! It takes up a one of my large plates at home with the couscous going over top a bit. Wish I could attach a photo I just had it tonight!  If you want to round out the meal more I would add already cooked kidney beans into the couscous! It tastes so good! You can halve the couscous if you are worried about too many calories adding up. Also, I will sometimes use curry, or tomato (15 cal for tablespoon) or pepper paste (15 cal for tablespoon) in it for extra flavor.",False,False

Then scoop out the flesh of your tomatoes and add it to the pan. Let everything simmer until you get a stuffing sort of consistency and season the mixture with salt and pepper. Then stuff the tomatoes and top with nutritional yeast, salt and pepper. Bake at 180°C for ~20 minutes or until they're done. * ""Bibimbap"" (Korean people plz don't kill me) - sautee two cloves of garlic, a ton of mushrooms, a diced carrot and 1/8 of a zucchini. Then add your cauliflower rice and sautee until you reach your desired consistency. Finally turn off the heat, add some spinach and give it a good stir. Then I mix it with this sauce from this recipe https://www.lazycatkitchen.com/vegan-bibimbap/ (using SF syrup) and add in some kimchi (sauerkraut works too tbh) * Barbecue zoodles with mushrooms - from a post from a sub we all know and love but cannot link. Just look for ""huge bowl of delicious mush"" on there. * Pumpkin stuffed peppers - https://meatfreeketo.com/low-carb-vegan-pumpkin-stuffed-mushrooms/ (I forego the walnuts, use only 1 tsp of flax seeds and use peppers instead of mushrooms)  I have a few more but I'm on mobile right now so oof. Anyway, these all total up to 400 max I think, and they're pretty high in protein and fiber. And they're voluminous af, which is the most important part for me",False,False

I also love smoked salmon strips (you can get them in the seafood section) in the oven for 10min at 350F.  Banana/oat pancakes are good! You can find tons of recipes for them online. Smoothies are sooo underrated. I even put tofu in my smoothies sometimes. Yoghurt, nut milks, different frozen/fresh/canned fruits and veggies really gives you a lot of options.  Roasted veggies are amazing. You can roast them with a minut amount of oil or water and cover with foil. Have fun with herbs and spices! Experiment!",False,False
