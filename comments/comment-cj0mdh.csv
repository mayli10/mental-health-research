I can eat a piece of cheese and gain 2 pounds. The only thing that has ever worked for me was fasting, literally NO diet works for me besides this. I'm starting on now since nothing else works for me. I understand feeling ugly and shamed for being overweight and not being able to do anything about it.  If you dont know what fasting is, its basically not eating for long periods of time to let your body heal itself and use the fat it has stored. I really hope you can find something to help you because it know how horrible it feels. &lt;3",False,False
