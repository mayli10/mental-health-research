Ive been staying with my friend who is also my ex but Im not attracted to him at all anymore so were just friends. He still lives with his mom and their roommate so I don‚Äôt really feel comfortable eating unless the food is specifically for me or if he offers me food or asks if Im hungry, but even then I feel bad eating. Hes like naturally underweight and usually only eats once a day if that. Ive actually suspected that he has an eating disorder but he denies it. Which means that *I* only eat 1 meal a day now and possibly some snacks.      Now Im going to be going to stay with another friends where I feel even less comfortable eating there, so Im probably gonna be starving myself for days on end cause of it. Ill have to pick up some of my Oasis smoothies so that I can at least get vitamins.",False,False

I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs bc we‚Äôve been spending more time together in general or bc I‚Äôve lost weight recently and he likes what he sees... üôÉ in any case my binge urges are almost all gone,False,False
