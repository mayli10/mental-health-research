I think the main issue is that I'm not anything special. I'm not pretty, I'm obese, not exactly the kind of girl who guys wanna show off.   Of course I dont want someone who doesnt want me it's just that I honestly dont think that such a person exists.   This isnt just a rough patch. It's been like this my whole life. I'm always the side bitch. Everyone around me is being normal and setting down and I cant get past a dozen or so dates before I'm either outright rejected or treated like shit.   I betcha if I was at my goal weight he would held out for me.",False,True

Besides, you don't want anyone who wouldn't want you. You'll eventually find someone who knows you're a prize. I don't think there's a single person on here who hasn't gone through these exact same rough patches &lt;3 You're not alone. You're not worthless.",False,False
