It's softened and ""glamorous"", for all the memes about it. When you see someone living with being underweight IRL you have to face the reality of all the problems that come with it; the coldness, the boniness, the discomfort and the stares, how gaunt you look. That when you're that thin, you aren't just thin for the time it takes to take a photo. You are bones all day.",False,False

She had a tube in her nose and used one of those rolling walkers to get around campus. The tube specifically made me automatically assume ED, but I'm sure it's possible there are myriad health issues that might require such measures. Anyway, I was in awe. I remember thinking, ""damn, that's sad."" It never occurred to me that I might end up looking like her one day. I figured I could never get that sick. She was always smiling, though.",False,False

It was a friend of mine's sister and she was in a wheelchair. She looked so close to dying, being only in her 20s. I asked if she was sick and if it was why she was in a wheelchair (when not anywhere near her). My friend said she was fine, just didn't eat much and it made her too weak to walk.  It's why I had to spiral really fucking hard before I could even stomach bonespo. Anorexia is terrifying when you drop too low and it's been an issue for years.",False,False
