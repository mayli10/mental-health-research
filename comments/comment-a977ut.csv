I'm sure your family loves you being there and at the end of the day, it's about family at holiday time. Not saying I know your situation or what your family is like, but I'm sure they love you very much and enjoy having you. Plus, we still have control over what we let into our bodies....it's hard, not gonna lie, all the great foods tempting us, but we still have control. We can do this. Before we know it, we'll all be back in our safe places at our own apartments/dorms/houses.     Remember to take time for yourself this season, take a walk by yourself, take a nap, and enjoy the season as much as you can. ",False,False
