Then I remembered I didn't eat yesterday.  My mom and I got into an argument yesterday and my body just went nope. I told her today and she saw me try to eat. She said she does the same thing too when she's upset. So she was understanding and such. I work tomorrow so we're doing new years dinner tonight. And I still don't wanna eat. But I know I need to, so I'm gonna just eat slowly and eat what I can. ",False,True

Back in 2016 I had a really bad breakup and that is sort of what started the eating issues. It's something that's gotten more noticeable to myself recently. ,False,True

Something traumatic happened to me in March of this year causing a downward spiral into the worst depression of my life. But somehow in focusing on the depression I became sick to my stomach every day. I lost 42 pounds in a little under 10 weeks. When it was happening I was in denial, people asked if I was okay and I pretended I was. I was also naive, not knowing how much this disorder would develop and snowball into what it is now. So, yes, I would say depression can cause an ed, and I wouldn’t wish the combination on my worst enemy.",False,False

If you don’t get diagnosed though, don’t feel you can’t seek support for your disordered eating! Even if it’s just a chronic issue that only appears during a depressive episode, it’s still hell.

So I'll definitely bring it up. I'll have periods of time when food gives me aniexty, I hate the way I look, ect. Then everything is ok and I'll eat and be happy with things. ",False,True

If you haven’t already, I would explore the topic with a therapist because EDs are tricky to diagnose because they vary from person to person. For example, I don’t *really* have fear foods and in the beginning I didn’t really track calories. But if your relationship with food and your weight becomes the only thing on your mind and it starts to affect other parts of your life (work,school,social,etc) and fuels your depression, then it’s definitely a disorder.

I'm over weight according to bmi, while my doctor has assured me that I'm fine. When I had lost the weight I did feel better, but still really wanted to be smaller.  For some time I did use restricting as a form of self harm.  I struggle with that as well.  I've gained the weight back mostly because of my boyfriend taking me out to eat. But recently I just don't eat. I haven't stepped on my scale because I know seeing the number will make me want to cry. I'll just fight through the hunger pains and maybe eat one meal the entire day if given the chance too.  I see what you mean with disordered eating and it may be something to look into. ",False,True

I think to decide if your not eating has developed into an eating disorder, you have to take a look at your relationship with food. Do you have any anxiety towards food or weight gain? Do you have body image issues? Those are traits that are unique to an eating disorder as opposed to just disordered eating imo",False,False
