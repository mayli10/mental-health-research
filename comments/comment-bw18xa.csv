Although I know this post and any like it are meant to be extremely positive and inspirational for all of us and her, I feel kind of bad. Most of us know firsthand just how painful and upsetting it can be to have anyone comment on our weight or body, and even ""you look so healthy"" can spiral someone into a relapse. I worry so much for her that she is going to receive those types of comments on a massive worldwide scale. I honestly hope to God she deletes her YouTube/social media.   I know that makes me sound kinda negative but for someone as deep in their ED for as long as Eugenia has been, I think it's a real pipedream to assume she'll come out of one inpatient/residential after a few months and have made such a profound unshakable recovery that being bombarded with comments about her weight gain and changes in her physical appearance won't affect her. I wish the best for her and I'm very happy she's no longer on the brink of death but it's almost a guarantee if she returns to YouTube literally all her comments will be about her weight for months, maybe years if she keeps her old vids. If she deletes her old videos, she'll lose a huge revenue source but imagine being recovered or weight restored and having to regularly see vids of yourself at your LW- even worse, with millions of ppl watching them and comparing it to your body now in newer vids (then commenting about it). Onision and other awful people are no doubt going to publicly say something about it, maybe even make a video.  Plus as awful as this sounds, a big part of her channel was her ""look"". I genuinely feel this stood in the way of her getting help. Tons of girls saying she's ""goals"", admiring her body, even on here/MPA it's not at all rare to see someone admit they only subscribed to her or looked at her content because of how thin she was. It drew many people to her channel, even if they thought very negatively of her appearance. She got a lot of publicity because of it. I have a feeling if she returns and tries making the same type of content, she will see views/subs drop and I feel so so so sad about it but if we're being realistic it's just so likely when her extreme appearance was the main draw of her channel. It happened to alyrealrecovery, she was insta famous while deep in anorexia and even moreso when controversially faking recovery publicly but once she actually became weight restored, her followers dropped off. Super sad to watch. Especially because she knows it and has even posted in the past about it, saying things like no one cares or reads her stuff anymore and she has no fans or followers or anyone who pays attention to her at a normal weight :(",False,False
