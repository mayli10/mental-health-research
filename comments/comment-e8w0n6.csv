It was unfinished and kind of painted it in a positive light so my bitch ass was like... Shit I'm disgusting I need to stop eating. I got more into ED media- tv shows, movies, social media communities (lmao) and started eating less. I got a calorie tracker app and the rest is history. I lost 2kg in 2 days after severely restricting and it felt so good that I kept going. That was only a few months ago and now I've lost 15kg and I'm worse than when I started. Now I even purge which was something I never did when I was in my weird little lapses",False,False

He really wanted me to be a skinny ""twink"" so he would constantly tell me things like, ""I wouldn't like you if you were fat"", or ""if you get fat I'll stop talking to you"", and other things like that which he said were jokes but I could tell he was serious. I have a few memories of being at his place eating and he would actually take my plate away because he thought I was eating too much and would get fat.

But recently my body image got worse since I started working at the pizza shop, I was yet to reach my highest weight and going ""obese"" ( right at the limit of overweight ). A workmate then asked me what my weight was and my mom told me ""all you're eating is sweets lately, haven't you noticed?"" and anxiety kicked in. I feared getting obese and even diabetes at that point. So I snapped and made my tradition of punishing myself through starving a couple days into my lifestyle  I'm 7 kilos down from what I was at originally but I feel worse once I see the weight increasing even by a little.
