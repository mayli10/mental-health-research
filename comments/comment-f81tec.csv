Where I am from, people don’t even know there is something as an eating disorder.   And I deeply hope I find some help. It feels like everything in my life is falling apart even this and I think if only just this part works out I may be able to handle everything else..",False,True

He might be sacred of you having an ED so might be trying to downplay it to reassure himself and you? If eating is having a negative impact on your life I encourage you to get help if you feel you want to. Someone will be able to help you feel better, that's what health  professionals are trained to do. If they make you feel embarrassed they are a shit doctor. I've had bad experiences but I know there are good ED specialists waiting to help people like us.",False,False
