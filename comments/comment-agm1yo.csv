The ""last binge"" is never the last binge. After you're done with this stress another stressor will come along and be your reason to binge . I cant offer any good advice because I'm stuck in the same cycle as you. The longest I made it hinge free was 52 days, and that for fucked during Thanksgiving. I haven't gone more than two days since.   Something that slightly motivates me personally is downloading one of those quit smoking apps and using it to measure how long it's been since I've binged. It doesn't really work the first few days cause I just think ""oh fuck it, it's only been 24 hours"" but once I get to three, four days, the idea of having to reset it gives me this feeling of dread that seems to help me control the urge to stuff my face with shit I don't even really want to eat.

I think about food from the moment I wake up until I go to sleep at night. What am I going to eat, where am I going to eat, will people be watching me stuff my face and think I'm fat... all of the above :( I'm sorry you're going through this too.",False,False
