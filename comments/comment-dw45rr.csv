Sure, that's fine.  Is it okay for your doctor to comment on whether or not he finds you pretty and give his opinion on what he thinks the body weight of a 'pretty' girl is? No sir it is not.   That was super unprofessional of him regardless of his intentions. It's not his job to have an opinion on whether you're pretty or not and saying something like that is only ever going to make you feel shame which could trigger a whole bunch of disordered behaviours. I'd seriously consider putting in a complaint and requesting a new doctor.",False,False
