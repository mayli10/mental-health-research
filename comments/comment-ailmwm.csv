I had hated vegetables until i learned to cook and just got WAY into it.  I started to get stomach issues, which I am guessing came from the overabundance of fiber, and I had chronic daily diarrhea for years.   After a few months of not being able to leave my house, I stopped eating one thing at a time, hoping that would be the cure I needed.   This went on for probably 5 years, I got down to a BMI of 14.9 at my lowest.  I don't think I really had the ""traditional"" AN, but I certainly became very afraid of most food.  And I am sure that the low body weight exacerbated the stomach issues, too.",False,False

Still have a few mystery GI issues but also IBS. So I knew that if I ate too much or something filling I would be in tons of pain. ,False,False

I always had problem with stress-eating. Whenever I eat greasy food or a bit too much I would get bad acid reflux which led me to purging.   The fact that I can purge led me to more binging and so on and so forth. Its a terrible cycle üò∞,False,False

It sucks because there are periods of time when i just do want to eat, but it just fucking hurts.   And then when the pain kinda goes away I tend to be so excited about it and eat wayy too much lol no regretz",False,False

For the past 2 years I‚Äôve been dealing with IBS-C which leaves me bloated &amp; feeling full all the time. One point I just started barely eating because it seemed like everything upset my stomach. Then the weight loss began and well here we are üôÉ,False,False

That sounds horrible - I hope it‚Äôs not food allergies or something :( I hope they can find a solution soon ‚ù§Ô∏è",False,True

I'm working on getting a referral to a GI specialist but I'm certain it's not normal. Like, there's times where I even purge 0 cal shit like diet soda or water because I immediately look pregnant and can't walk without waddling. It's had a massive affect on me- for me it's 50% whatever the fuck that is and 50% low self esteem, attention seeking, impulse control issues, and an inclination toward risk taking behavior.

Since 12 i've had poor body image and some disordered eating but the last 2 years have gotten so much worse because of on-going mystery GI issues.

I cant digest sugar correctly, which ironically makes me craving them more. (frustose and sorbitol). Well, so there is me, a child, who got denied the sweet, even worse, sister gets it but not me. I sneak up, jealousy, to get some. They trigger me, i crave more and eat more. I get fatter. Family refuses to give me sweets, i sneak more.   An endless cycle till i was a BMI 40.   The irony is, my family didnt refused it because i had problems. But because i was getting fat. Instead of helping me they bullied me. I just learned a year ago that i have to abstain from basically a kind of sugars. But i can see the pattern since then and its hard to stop a life long binge habit",False,False
