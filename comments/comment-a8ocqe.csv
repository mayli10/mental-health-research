I've yelled at nurses before because I was SURE their scale was wrong (still convinced it was 10 lbs off lol).   Honestly it's a good thing to just get rid of a scale. Whether you're in the depths of an ED or trying to recover, it won't help anything - aren't we all just obsessed with image anyways?",False,False

I miss the high of hitting a new LW on the scale but I forgot how horrible the scale could make me feel too. I just fast and restrict without thinking too much of the numbers I wanna lose, it feels incredibly boring and routine but also so natural and almost kind of safe, I'm scared that I'll be forced to give up this safety net.",False,True
