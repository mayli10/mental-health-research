Probably not eating over a dozen eggs though. I feel like at that point you might just be eating way too much cholesterol. With just two eggs though, that sounds like it would be an amazing deal. At the very least it would be more filling than similarly priced/similar calories meals you can buy at a lot of places.",False,False
