As a result of using, I’ve developed such a serious, painful health issue that I can’t work at the moment, and now that I’m broke, it feels awful knowing that I put $35K up my nose one year. My husband couldn’t deal with me at my worst and my addiction almost destroyed our marriage... not to mention that cocaine made all of my underlying mental health issues 100x worse. I don’t mean to be patronizing, but please be careful. If I had a time machine, I would slap those straws out of my hand, because back then, I never could’ve imagined what a devastating impact coke would have on my life. My late best friend was an addict as well, and at one point she switched to heroin because coke stopped being fun for her... a few months ago, she passed away from an overdose.",False,False

I have a highly addictive personality and every time I’ve done it I’ve friggin loved it so it’s a good thing I’m always so broke!,False,False
