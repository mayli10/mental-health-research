When I was 20 lbs heavier &amp; more muscular from cheerleading my entire life I would wear crop tops &amp; low rise jeans/ shorts. Or high waisted with crop tops whatever. Then I was like 1-2 lbs underweight or very bottom of normal weight  Now Iâ€™m like 20-25 lbs underweight and I feel too fat to wear it. Like once I eat (or ate more the previous days) my belly looks so round and bloated to me. It looks round in my high waisted jeans. It looks round in my shirts w low rise jeans  Having kids ruined me. I paid way too much attention to my body, stopped working out. Blehhhh",False,True

I'm glad high waisted is making a comeback. They hide the muffin top. Now that the 90s are hardcore making a comeback at target I understand why I felt so bad about my body growing up. High waisted skirts, low rise jeans, crops tops, shirts with a stripe across the shoulder and chest, chunky sweaters, and straight skirts look fucking terrible on my body type. ",False,False
