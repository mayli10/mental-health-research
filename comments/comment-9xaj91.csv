ea12xg8,t3_9xaj91,t1_e9r3yp9,LittleLightFawn,1,2018-11-19 06:36:54,/r/EDAnonymous/comments/9xaj91/i_feel_like_we_need_to_replace_all_the_helpful/ea12xg8/,"Okay, it's been a few days but here you go:  \[Just an FYI I found this by chance - I was checking out a ProED mirror someone posted and stumbled upon the selenium post and remembered your comment! Here's the mirror if you ever need it: [https://goutiest-zorse-5012.dataplicity.io/](https://goutiest-zorse-5012.dataplicity.io/)\]   &amp;#x200B;   Guys, most of us already know that anorexia has the highest mortality rate of any psychiatric disorder. The main causes of sudden death in eating disorders are those related to \*\*cardiovascular\*\* complications.      There are a billion nutritional deficiencies common in EDs (potassium, sodium, chloride, etc), and a billion conditions that come with those deficiencies (hypokalemia, hypophosphatemia, anemia, etc), but considering that:      A) \*\*Heart failure is the leading cause of death\*\* and      B) \*\*Selenium deficiencies\*\* \*\*\*can\*\*\* \*\*and\*\* \*\*\*will\*\*\* \*\*cause heart failure,\*\* are \*\*so prevalent\*\* (1 in 3 patients with restrictive subtype, 1 in 4 with BP subtype) and NEVER mentioned in terms of care for anorexia, I wanted to make the SparkNotes version of an informational post to remind everyone to keep an eye out.     Selenium is an antioxidant that plays parts in myocardial health, mood regulation and protection against infection. It functions collaboratively with other antioxidant micronutrients such as vitamin E and C.      \*\*Selenium deficiency\*\* can cause (among other things) oxidative damage to many organs, which can take the form of skeletal myopathy (\*\*muscle atrophy\*\*) and cardiomyopathy (\*\*heart muscle disease\*\*), such as white muscle disease. \*\*Observable symptoms\*\* include muscle weakness, hair loss, fatigue, mental fog, weakened immune system. (Note: Hair loss can be caused by many deficiencies like iron, zinc, protein, and vitamins A,D, and E, but selenium is definitely on the list. Might help if that‚Äôs a symptom you experience.)     All of those are symptoms of fasting and prolonged starvation as well. All of them. Selenium deficiency has very few observable symptoms to begin with, and it‚Äôs even harder for us to notice those symptoms, so it‚Äôs more worth being vigilant.      The¬†National Institutes of Health¬†recommends that people over the age of 14 try to get \*\*55 micrograms\*\* (mcg) \*\*of selenium per day\*\*. It‚Äôs most often found in seafood, meat, dairy, and grains, which unfortunately make up very little of restrictive diets and is likely the cause of such a frequent deficiency. Your best bet is likely mushrooms or spinach if you‚Äôre looking for the lowest calories.      \*\*Selenium rich foods\*\* in vague order of lowest to highest calories:     \* Spinach: 1 cup - 16% DV   \* Shiitake mushrooms: 1 cup cooked - 65% DV   \* Portabella mushrooms: 1 cup cooked - 48% DV   \* Eggs (60% of the selenium is in the yolk, only 40% in the albumen, so if you can manage the whole egg, that would be ideal): 1 whole egg - 21% DV   \* Cottage cheese: 1/2 cup, 1% milkfat - 15% DV   \* Firm tofu: 1/2 cup - 40% DV   \* Shrimp: 3 oz - 57% DV   \* Turkey: boneless, roasted, 3 oz: 44% DV   \* Chicken, light meat, roasted, 3 oz: 31% DV   \* Tuna, yellowfin, cooked, 3 oz: 131% DV   \* Ham: roasted, 3 oz - 67% DV   \* Oysters: 3oz - 238% DV   \* This is my favorite one: Brazil nuts are stupid high in Se. One nut is 30 calories and more than 100% your daily intake. One nut     A quick Google search (or the lists I have linked below) will yield more comprehensive results.      A lot of the times \*\*100% of the DV is already in daily multivitamins\*\*, which I would recommend taking if you aren‚Äôt already! I would check the ones you have now. Otherwise, it‚Äôs often in thyroid and antioxidant-centered supplements.     My main reference was the first link listed below in the citations ‚Äî Micronutrient Status in 153 Patients with Anorexia Nervosa, a study done on 153 patients with AN-R and AN-BP published in March 2017. The \*\*most commonly occurring micronutrient deficiencies\*\* in AN were \*\*vitamin B9, vitamin A\*\*, and \*\*selenium\*\*. I would keep vitamins B9 and A in mind too, do your homework, etc. I was so thrown off by selenium (which I knew shit-all about until now), that I wanted to give it a personal shout out. With a disease that‚Äôs very easily life or death, the more you know about it, the better.
