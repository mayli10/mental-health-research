But I've never been a heavy drinker so going sober wasnt that big of a deal for me.  I now overexercise and smoke weed whenever I feel like shit about myself. Seems to work well enough.,False,False

If I'm heavier due to a binge cycle (like currently) I tell myself I don't deserve to experience the euphoria of being drunk.,False,False

Then I did the calorie math. I now rarely drink for numerous reasons. Remembering the calorie cost helps keep me from drinking. I mostly cope with negative feelings through exercise and writing now.,False,False

I don't like the feeling. I want the buzz to be contained, which often means I eat food so I don't end up overboard, and I hate that too...",False,False
