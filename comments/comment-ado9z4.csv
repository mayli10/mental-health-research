This was normal. All of my other friends had also hit the same weight but for some reason when I did I cried. I cried in the lunch room in the 6th grade the first time I sat down and my legs touched. I obsessed over how I looked and my weight. I canâ€™t explain it but for me it started very young. It makes me sad to know that itâ€™s still impacting young girls and will continue to do so. I just wish there were a real safe place for them to get help online without creeps lurking in the background. ,False,False

That picture could literally ruin her life in so many ways. There are very sick people who lurk eating disorder forums, pretending to be ""ana coaches"" to get nudes from underaged girls and boys, and maybe even worse. Like the girl on MPA who got kidnapped by her ""ana coach"". It's too bad young people have the ""that couldn't happen to me"" quite often.  I always feel so bad when I see very young people on ED sites looking for tips and tricks. Not too long ago on another ED forum where I'm a very active poster I received a PM from a very young person asking me to help them lose weight. They sent me their measurements and a full body picture (with clothes on, phew) and they were so slim, like kids tend to be. It nearly broke my heart seeing so young people in the early stages of this disorder. I kindly told them to get help while they still can recover easier, and that there's absolutely not a single milligram too much of fat in them, at all. They haven't PM'd me since and I really hope they got help.  Shit, sorry for a long ass post. This subject just gets me to emotional, haha!",False,False
