Today I went out to eat for the first time in a long time, ate a black bean brownie, a vegan cupcake, and half of an entree. Looks pretty sufficient to those around me, but it’s the first time I’ve eaten something that doesn’t consist of basically all raw vegetables, and under a restrictive calorie count in over two weeks... and now my last two brain cells are telling me if I still want to fit into those tiny pants I put on this morning, we aren’t eating tomorrow. Even though the grand total of my binge comes out to maintenance calories. I think people see anorexia portrayed in a certain way through media and don’t realize anorexia and other disorders look different from case to case, but have similar core issues such as guilt, obsession, rituals, fear, restriction, etc. but that can manifest in a multitude of ways. I work with at risk youth, and one of my coworkers got in trouble for letting an anorexic teen eat candy, because “aT lEaSt ShE’s EaTiNg SoMeThInG...” but doesn’t realize that the candy bar he just gave her is going to send her spiraling into even more disordered behaviors. You’re valid. Your eating disorder is real.",False,False
