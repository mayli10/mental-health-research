I felt like a liar and that I was ‚Äúfaking it‚Äù. Although I will say a huge motivator for me to get into recovery was because I thought I‚Äôd be healthy and get skinny haha. In my experience I found the only time I wanted to recover was when I was stuck in a binge cycle.   Eating issues suck and they‚Äôre valid at any weight. I was very lucky my gp took me seriously straight away and I told her I do not want to be weighed, I want no emphasis on weight. I think for some people weight restoration might be an important part of recovery, but even then I‚Äôd argue that focusing on weight is incredibly unhelpful. When I was connected to my current therapist I said in my first session I do not want to focus on weight or numbers and she respected that. Though I will say that the first person I was connected with was not right for me but sometimes it takes a few goes to find the right person. If this is available to you I highly recommend reaching out. Just remember though that isn‚Äôt everyone‚Äôs experience and if you go to someone who doesn‚Äôt take you seriously then see someone else (again if this is available to you) otherwise I would suggest calling a phone service they may be able to give you confidence to reach out. And depending on your country or if you‚Äôre currently studying your uni may have a mental health service too.   I honestly know exactly how you feel, I felt like such a drama queen when I first reached out for help because I wasn‚Äôt underweight. But that doesn‚Äôt make your experience invalid, you‚Äôre worthy of help at any weight and it‚Äôs not about the numbers  ‚ù§Ô∏èüåª",False,False

I‚Äôve been saying that to myself for years - for some context I only got ‚Äúofficially‚Äù diagnosed last year but have been disordered for over 10. Remember that your ED thoughts will cling on to anything to keep itself alive and punish you while trying to act like your friend. Your feelings are valid and your experiences matter, having a therapist has helped me so much so if it‚Äôs available to you I recommend it to anyone who‚Äôs ready to receive it. Otherwise please feel free to talk to me, I‚Äôm always happy to listen and remember this is a judgment free zone nothing you say will make me judge you. We‚Äôve all had horrible thoughts and done terrible things because of the ED voice. It‚Äôs powerful and at times really truly awful ",False,False

Even eating disorders in general. You can absolutely ‚Äúfit‚Äù into being bulimic with the binge episodes and then fasting for long periods of time but it‚Äôs because of the binge. I think the biggest difference is the binging - my unprofessional opinion might I add.  I also think that labels aren‚Äôt always helpful I know for me when I was diagnosed bulimic and not anorexic I felt like a failure (please please note that is my personal experience and I absolutely do not impose that ideal onto anyone), so really having eating issues should be the big focus and not each sub section of it.  I hope that‚Äôs helpful!  ‚ù§Ô∏è",False,False
