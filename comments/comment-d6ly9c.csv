Is that from some kind of device to look at while working out? I’m super sedentary but I did a bit of long distance running for a while and might want to start again. Thanks!,False,False

As long as you keep your pace and HR low by not going crazy, it makes your body more efficient at burning fat for fuel, which is why, as ultra-marathon runners, carb-loading and going all out during every workout isn't going to help you run long distances at all. It took months to build up. Just gotta start small (like a 10-15 min run, and build up from there. Don't even look at pace, just stay in that fat-burning zone (zone 2) and see how fast you progress :) eventually you'll be able to just run comfortably for 10, 15, 20 miles, even breathing from your nose or holding conversations.",False,False

Once made the mistake of going on a run 4 days into a fast, I felt like death and had horrible pain in my chest. I stick to walking which I do a lot of for work, still get the chests pains, but it's easier to manage with the lower intensity.  A lot of it is a façade, in no way do I function well. My brain fog is bad and sometimes I get terribly dizzy. I just stand and look like I'm thinking to mask what's really going on.",False,False
