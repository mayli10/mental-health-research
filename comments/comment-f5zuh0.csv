This first reason may be odd but I think I look at it as finally 'being seen' because if I'm noticeably smaller than people within my surroundings, people sort of notice me. Most of my life I have felt unimportant, unworthy, and ignored by others. I feel disconnected from people and that second of eye contact from someone comforts me in a way. I don't seek out or want the negative attention like ""oh you need help, poor you"" sort of thing because I'm not one to pity myself and I don't want to be considered a victim of any sort. I just want to feel as if someone could interpret that I may be struggling and they could potentially care about me or my health even if it's only for a fleeting moment.   The second reason is probably more common. During childhood I was bullied very severely and one way people identified/referred to me was being ""fat or overweight."" I think I just want to get as far away from being considered that term as possible both in other peoples eyes and my own. I was really affected by comments towards my body growing up and it has stayed with me in adulthood.",False,False
