I can't see myself enjoying 2 spoons of ice cream it feels really wasted and unnecessary if I'm not bingeing I'm not really craving that shit. But when it hits it's like, all the flavors and all the food just filling your mouth in a way I don't allow myself otherwise and I just feel so comforted, I wouldn't get that from 2 spoons of ice cream.",False,False

Even if the IF / omad is all healthy or not junk. The second I start eating in the day, the more I want to eat. It’s like a hunger compulsion I guess. If I fast during the day or have a VERY little breakfast and fast till late at night I basically don’t even think of food. Once I eat something I just can’t stop thinking of it. ",False,False

Something about the eating-fasting schedule makes it easier to resist the terrible multiple-day-long binge cycles. ,False,True

Or make it like a mono (even though those never really do work lol),False,False

The ravenous binge where your brain turns off and you just eat and later you keep recalling foods you ate as if it’s the day after a drunken night out and you remember things you said in a stupor at the pub. “Oh shit ... I said *that*?”  I’ve tried telling myself “okay brain, I know you wanna binge now, and I’m gonna let you BUT”  Then I try to modify my binge somehow, like, “only binge on stuff you can bake” (I made 1 almond flour pizza, and 3 trays of oatmeal cookies). “Only binge on zero carb foods” (thawed out 3 slabs of bacon). “Only take 1 bite every 20 seconds”...Etc.   I was hoping this would either reduce the scope of the binge, but usually it just becomes a “warmup” before the ravenous binge starts with unmitigated fervor. Sometimes,  though, it has actually averted a full pantry clean out.   ",False,False

The actual binges are probably only enjoyable in theory. Like when you're planning for a big trip, and then during the trip a bunch of things dont turn out as great as expected but you're still a good sport trying to trick yourself into enjoying it because you hyped it up for so long, but then after you get home you're struck by what an actual shit sandwich the whole trip was and theres no denying it.",False,True
