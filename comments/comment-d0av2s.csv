Its hard enough for regular vegans without health problems/EDs but for us... Even before my ED I felt I couldn't eat anything because of my fucking IBS shit ...,False,False

Turns out I'm allergic to wheat, so no bread/pasta/crackers/whatever. I can't even have the gluten free versions of anything, either, bc they're usually high glycemic, and a lower glycemic diet is the only thing that gives me clear skin.   I feel guilty even telling people about my diet, bc it's insane to expect anyone to accommodate it.",False,False

I recently went full plant based after a lifetime of vegetarianism (and a couple years with no milk/ice cream/soft cheese and no eggs I didn't buy myself). And even though I went in slowly, yeah, it's hard. I live in one of the most vegan-friendly cities in the world, and chances are still high that I'll show up to events/parties/whatever and have literally nothing to eat. Plus, it's tough being That Guy who can't eat any of the old family recipes, has to reject grandma's potato salad, etc. Especially since many of my family members assume I'm implicitly judging them as unhealthy/animal haters/eco unfriendly, or something, even though I haven't said one word about my diet beyond stating that it exists.",False,False

I'm also going for vegan. Vegetarian? Super easy, I can do that in my sleep. Take away the dairy and it's so much harder.
