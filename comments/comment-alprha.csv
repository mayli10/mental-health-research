I also recommend drinking water with electrolytes. Propel water tastes good and contains electrolytes, Gatorade as well. You can also drink plain water and try adding salt? I used to experience a lot if lightheadesness when I first began restricting. Water with some salt helped. I also get extremely hungry after purging and eating again helps the headache and the feeling light headed but if I can, I dont eat and just  drink hot chocolate (60 calories) just to give my body a little something to hold on to and help with feeling weak.

I don't have binge/purging cycles anymore because I have binge/purge/binge cycles instead. And the only reason I have the second binge is because I can't handle the light-headedness and dizziness that comes after purging. I like can't think straight or anything. And this still happens even when I've quit purging for months and ate healthy. Do you have any experience with that at all?,False,False

Our brains calibrate appetite based on how much energy has been digested from a certain amount of food in the long term.  So, if you regularly binge 2000 calories and purge 1500 of them, over time your brain will calibrate 2000 calories eaten equating to 500 calories digested. Appetite and hunger will be ramped up and control over eating decreases. This is how appetite and hunger naturally work and self-regulate for people without EDs, but for us it just escalates b/p.  There's really no other way to come out of it than to bite the bullet and gain some weight in the process of calming down the binge urges. If it only was that easy though.",False,False

I nearly purge everything I eat, even if it's super low calorie.  In the beggining it was all fun and games but now its consuming. My whole day revolves around purging, don't even have to binge. I'm plateauing and I. 6 pounds away from being underweight.  ",False,False
