We talked and he genuinely apologized for being insensitive and smothered me in hugs, so I think he knows to be more careful about my tum now (an abusive family member used to grab it too) . I hope you have a good day too and know that you’ve made this internet stranger feel a lot better.",False,True

I think it was wrong on your partner’s end to say this! What you’re feeling is definitely valid, I think most people would actually be a bit bothered by comments like this. It’s definitely not something that “people just say about bread,” and if he is aware of your ED history, it might’ve been just a slip of the tongue/mistake and you should address this with him. Let him know that even though it might seem like a harmless comment to him, it’s actually dangerous for you. Also, I know it’s hard but try not to punish yourself by not eating because of this incident. Have a nice day :)",False,False
