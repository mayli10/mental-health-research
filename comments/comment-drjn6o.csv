I am at a small local gym, so there isn't wait time for machines/weights, which helps. Sometimes I'll just do machines, sometimes free weights, or follow a fitness YouTube workout (Blogalaties has great muscle isolates). I just make sure to follow my rotation of groups, abs, arms/shoulders, legs, and back. If I do an extra day I'll do cardio and a long stretch routine.",False,False

First set at a ""warmup"" weight, and then increasing each set. By the end of my third set I am struggling, so if I only get 8 in I'm okay with it.

It would usually take me 1.5 to 2 hours to get through everything, depending on how many people talked to me. I typically rest 3 min between my main heavy lifts (bench, squat, deadlift) and 30-60 sec between accessory lifts. One good way to keep yourself moving and get stuff done faster is supersets. I think the best way is to pair exercises for different/opposing muscle groups, e.g. bicep curls &amp; tricep kickbacks or RDLs &amp; goblet squats. I usually wear a basic sports watch that shows the time with seconds, so I just take note of the time after a set/superset to know when I need to start the next one.  I will say that I did very high volume strength workouts. They‚Äôre not for everyone, especially if you‚Äôre fairly new to lifting, and you can definitely build muscle doing less than that. The main keys when it comes to building muscle are compound exercises using proper form, progressive overload, consistency, and sufficient/surplus calorie and protein intake.",False,False

How long would your sets take you? Sounds like you had even more than me but my problem is I take so long. I don‚Äôt feel I rest too much it just ends up taking forever. I want to reduce to maybe 3 exercises per body part if that would still help me gain a bit of muscle.   And I just call it glute day because I have a bit more emphasis with thrust exercises. As for delts and triceps I put those in my bicep day :),False,True

My leg days contained fewer exercises than upper days because leg days contained more compound exercises, making the workout more taxing.   One comment on your current split: you‚Äôre going to be hitting your glutes with almost any movement, unless you‚Äôre just doing leg extension/curl machines. I‚Äôd do a quad/hammie split instead. If you really want, you could throw in a little glute isolation both days if building your booty is most important to you.",False,False
