But dude, this sounds 100% as something my mom could say. I even read it her own voice. She tells me that every time I tell her about my friends and their struggles.

In many ways, I actually use my mom as accountability lmao. Like when I still used to live with her and started to relapse and wanted to lose weight, I told her ""hey mom, I'm going on a diet. If you see me eat anything sweet or high calorie, please stop me"". Or I made her stop buying certain food items for me. Or we made a pact that neither of us would eat x. Stuff like that. If I told this to any of my friends/non-Russian adults in my life, they'd probably freak out and become concerned. But for us, and the rest of my family, constantly talking about dieting and losing weight is 100% normal. To be honest, sometimes it gives me comfort in the sense that I don't feel so alone in this ""dieting"" hell. That I can talk so openly about it with my Russian family and friends. But ONLY as long as I don't mention the word ""eating disorder"" or start talking about the bad mental health effects of dieting. It's kind of wild",False,True

This is actually something I talk about to psychologists and counserlors whenever I meet them for the first time - that I suspect that a huge part of why I am the way I am is the culture I grew up in (I moved away when I was 10). And even now, I travel to Russia frequently and have Russian friends and follow Russians on instagram and it's so true. I see so many clearly underweight people and people that are struggling, but all of this is normalized and their parents &amp; friends encourage them and praise them for being tiny and beautiful. I actually think that what first introduced me to eating disorder behaviour when I met a Russian girl who recently moved to this country (5 years after me). She had this culture of dieting ingrained in her and displayed sooo many ED behaviours (looking at thinspo, sitting on diets constantly, only eating 1 apple a day). At first I thought it was disgusting and weird, but she normalized it for me and in the end I ended up becoming exactly like her.  I can still remember how I visited my grandma some years ago, and she talked about my best friend &amp; neighbour from when I was a kid. She described how she looked now, 8 years later, and she CONSTANTLY kept mentioning the word ""tiny"". All. the damn. time. Like: ""oh, she looks soooo tiny and thin now! Like a princess/model!"" and man it made me want to die inside because I was just normal bmi (23 or something) and it was hurtful to hear my own grandma praise being thin and dainty.  Man, I love Russia and I still consider it my home country and I love my fellow countrymen a lot (most of them, at least), but in many ways, Russia just SUCKS and I'm so happy I don't permanently live there anymore. I think I'd have it 10000 worse if I still lived there today. I can't even imagine.",False,True

Like whenever I start to even complain about something my mom hits me with the ""oh but I had it WAYY worse than you and I was hungry and we didn't have food and nobody babied us and look: I'm fine!!"" as if it's supposed to fix my problems. It makes sense that our parents behave this way though. I think that, when you survived something as chaotic and hard as living in the Soviet Union, the fall of the Soviet Union, and living in Russia (or another ex-USSR country) the time after that, it's very easy to look down on anyone these days who dares to complain. Maybe it's subconscious bitterness because their generation couldn't ask for help and going to a therapist wasn't a thing - but our generation has much more resources to get help. What they don't understand is that they SHOULD have gotten help with their problems back in their time. But just because they had no way of receiving help, doesn't mean that our generation doesn't deserve help with our issues. I don't know if that makes sense but yeah. Just because something has been done in a certain way for many years (e.g. living a shitty life and not being able to get any mental health help when you really need it), doesn't mean that it's the best way of living and that all the next generations should continue your way of living.   Russia has so many unhappy people (objectively) because of a certain reason. And I suspect that it's exactly this and all this trauma that all these generations have lived through without any professional help or support - the only form of therapy being gathering together with your pals на кухне and drinking vodka and forgetting any sort of pain lmao.",False,True

Like it sucks that your mom is exactly the same, but at the same time it's kind of nice to hear that because I thought that I was just overreacting and complaining about nothing/that maybe my mom being this way is 100% natural and I shouldn't be complaining about it.

How I understand your woes. But let me point something out that I didn't see in your post - women constantly being on diets to be as skinny as possible is the way of life over there. Idk how old you were when you moved or how much you remember but there's a prevalent ""women don't eat after 6 pm"" bs (so basically women are IF since they're like 13? 14?). My grandma called me ""like you're not fat but you're puffy"" when I saw her last at my HW - my BMI was 23.5??! It's a whole culture of ""women should be as small as possible"" that's so ingrained in society that compulsive dieting and counting calories and all of the bs we do isn't seen as ""mental illness"" but just a way of life. When I was my LW (barely normal BMI like one lb less and I'd be UW) my mum was encouraging me with diet foods and exercise. It's seen as normal. Pair that with ""mental illnesses except for super bad ones like schizophrenia don't exist, you're just lazy"" and of course there's no support and women go their whole lives with an ED thinking it's completely normal. My DMs are open if you ever wanna vent about our culture haha",False,False
