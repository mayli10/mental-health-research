That way, I get an idea of fluctuations after my treat meal on the weekend and generally get a good idea of the overall downward trend.   Also, this way, if I weigh xxx on Thursday and then xxy (higher) on Friday, I know that it could be food weight from Thursday, but as long as the weight is less than the previous Friday, then I should be on track to become an overall lower weight next Friday.    It just keeps me sane.   That being said, I've had a really bad month in August - basically broke a long plateau in July, but then the scales I've been using for the past 6 months broke, and the new scales say I'm 3lb heavier than the old ones did. Now I don't know if that's because I've put on weight, or just because it's a different scales. I also had a week at my boyfriend's parents house which made it super hard to restrict, and I'm not sure if the weight I've ""put on"" is from all the food I ate there, or from the new scales. It's really messed with my head.",False,False

Over 7 days I take the average and say ""this is my weight."" If it goes up I try not to worry, if it goes down I try not to get excited. This is honestly pretty easy because I know I can go up 5 lbs for no fucking reason overnight so I usually dont believe the low numbers I see exist.  7 days later I compare that average to the other average. If it went down, I know I'm doing something right. If it goes up, I have to think about what I did this week and what I would like to change going forward. If it's a period week I try to be easy on myself without deluding myself that it's all period weight.",False,False

I don‚Äôt technically weigh *myself*, my SO weighs me. Getting the info from him, good or bad, is much easier to handle emotionally than getting it directly from the scale.   I have a scale that measures water weight, body fat percentage, muscle percentage, bone density, etc. So if the number does go up, I know why.   When all else fails: full on breakdown. Once the scale randomly jumped up by four pounds for no reason. Hadn‚Äôt binged or anything, couldn‚Äôt figure it out. My SO was baffled.
