I don't think your own struggle makes you a hypocrite. I think it's always easier for us to be gentle and logical when thinking or dealing with someone we care about over ourselves. ,False,True

The moms talked and it gave my friend less freedom at first, but eventually she had the support of her family to help her escape.  Initially she hated me for outing her but eventually she was okay with my lame version of support.  The silly thing to me is that she is the only real life person I've told about my eating disorder. She has long since recovered and I haven't and the last time I saw her I was at one of my lowest weights.  I'm a total hypocrite.",False,False
