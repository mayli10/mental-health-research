You should all be able to work together to find foods that you WANT to eat, because you should be re-learning how to listen to what you actually want and need, and you should be able to negotiate foods that you would rather have so long as the caloric and nutritional profile is more or less the same.  You should not have to be eating the point of feeling sick or guilty. It sounds like they're jumping in the deep end with this when what you need is baby steps. Disordered eating is often about a lack of control, and this is just taking control away from you again in a different way. I hope they can see the merit in the considerations you're asking for.",False,False

Like, what part of ""fear"" food did they not get? How are you supposed to overcome your fear of these foods if they're sabotaging them?  I know your parents must be terrified, and have probably felt helpless/powerless for a long time watching you struggle. And I get that the temptation to finally be able to ""do something"" was probably too much for them to resist after so long. But if possible - and it sounds like you have a pretty open relationship, which is wonderful - you need to sit them down and explain that there needs to be 100% honesty and transparency for this to work, from BOTH sides. They expect you to be honest about relapses, exercise purging, etc. and so YOU need THEM to be completely and utterly honest about what's in the food they give you.  If you feel like your trust in them is shaky or broken, then you're going to end up withdrawing from them in the long run, and then they REALLY won't be able to do anything to help you.  Good luck. I'm really glad you're trying so hard with them and I'm sure they're just doing what they think is best, even if it's completely misguided. Don't let this ultimately overcomable issue set you back from what you know you want for the longterm.",False,False

You have to relearn food, eating and trust. That's not done via bullshitting you but via showing you that milk isn't the devil just because you could substitute it with water - for example.

I had similar moments where trust was broken and I was essentially ‚Äútricked‚Äù into eating extra. It just further ruined my relationship with my mum.

I think if they were lying about the hot chocolate that is extremely damaging and it needs to be talk about. listen to what they have to say and why they did it, try to express as well as you can why it bothers you then.

Scary and it will probably cause a lot of stress for everyone but it‚Äôs better than having mistrust and feeling disappointment or fear every time I eat.
