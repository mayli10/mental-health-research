Heâ€™s actually trying to gain weight because heâ€™s unhappy with how thin he is. Eating more is an effort for him (he does walk a lot and took up running, so his TDEE is pretty high), he naturally just eats below his maintenance calories, and itâ€™s not like he eats super duper healthy or anything either. And my chronically obese ass is just like... ??????? I canâ€™t comprehend it, he may as well be an alien to me. I donâ€™t understand how people can just... eat the correct amount???? Or even *less than* the their maintenance *without thinking about it*????? Whatâ€™s that even *like*????",False,False

She is like 5'8 135lbs and doesn't consider what she eats at all. Just, if she's hungry she eats. She grew up on junk food and poverty food. The only time her weight has like every fluctuated was when she had jaw surgery she dropped 15 lbs, which she gained back slowly and healthily after. She didn't even know her weight, or even a ballpark, until she got weighed before surgery.  It blows my mind but I'm jealous and I hope her relationship with food is bestowed on our kids if we ever get them.",False,False
