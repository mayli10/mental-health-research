If they're making ED content at all (unless it's a recovery video) their goal pretty much is to romanticise it. It's showing off their disorder to the world, which is not typical. They romanticise it to make a profit whether that is with views or money, and they want to look ""good"" to other people. It's incredibly harmful and portraying this myth that it's not entirely bad to have disordered eating and it's okay that they do it as an everyday thing, they're encouraging it.",False,False

I used to (still do occasionally when I‚Äôm especially feeling rough) watch those all the time because I was a novice cosplayer who really loved anime and kpop at the time.
