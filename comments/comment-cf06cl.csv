It's easy to overthink and freak yourself out over nothing. You're gonna be just fine, and this meal might actually give your metabolism a little kick in the ass :)",False,False

So even just slightly more will mean you'll maintain for the day, and not likely to gain, so don't panic. If you've been restricting other days you probably won't gain from today even if you go over like 2000",False,False
