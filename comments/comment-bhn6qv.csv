My GW TDEE is 1430 and I eat at least 600 cals under that per day. I know I’m disordered, but I genuinely feel satisfied and not as hungry (even full!) if I eat large portions of low cal vegetables and lean protein. If I skip protein in my lunch I’m much more likely to be craving food for the rest of the evening. I have never been able to eat a small portion of junk food and feel satisfied. It’s all or nothing for me.",False,False
