I don‚Äôt think ‚Äúhaha, the homophobes have to see gay people‚Äù is Reddit‚Äôs intention by making it difficult to block specific subs from your recommendations, and as an LGBTQ person I would rather not be a target for the misdirected vitriol of some bigot stumbling in from all",False,False

Fuck their feelings. My right to exist frankly trumps their stupid beliefs.   Quite a different story from someone with ED seeing subs that might trigger a relapse.   I think you can block someone on the same screen as reporting them. Or at least it gives me that option when I report on the app.,False,False

Again I want to be like, ‚Äúmaybe you could set up a bot to auto-ban anyone who messages it‚Äù so you wouldn‚Äôt have to see those messages, but 1) that would require the people doing this to actually read which I don‚Äôt trust and 2) that‚Äôs STILL putting the onus on the users??  Reddit is really weird about blocking/banning in general, you also can‚Äôt block an individual unless they‚Äôre in your inbox. So even if you know someone is block-worthy because they keep posting inflammatory stuff on the subs you visit, you‚Äôre forced to see their posts unless they directly contact you (or a mod bans them, which depends on how the mods feel about it). It‚Äôs absurd. I honestly think it‚Äôs because of Reddit‚Äôs prevailing twisted understanding/defence of ‚Äúfree speech‚Äù aka. ‚ÄúARE YOU TRIGGURED!?! ü§™ SUCK IT UP!!‚Äù :/ Basically protecting subs and individuals who WANT to shove their posts in other people‚Äôs faces, because every other social media platform allows you to at least ‚Äúignore‚Äù people at-will.

I moderate an LGBT sub as well that has some posts get onto the front page or get featured on r/all and you might be surprised how many asshole homophobes send mod mail saying ‚Äúyou people are disgusting and terrible please ban me so I don‚Äôt have to see your content on the subs I actually want to see.‚Äù   it‚Äôs exhausting, most of them say something like they wish they could opt out but haven‚Äôt figured out a way to actually do so  So their recourse is either showing up on the sub and being a complete piece of shit, or sending a modmail and acting like a complete piece of shit?
