You deserve to look that good and you shouldn't let it be ruined by anything! Just put it on and then start listing all the thing you like about the outfit and especially with yourself in it. As soon as something negative pops up, just swoosh it away. And then at the family gathering just convince yourself the entire time that everybody has positive thoughts about you - instead of thinking: Omg there is my skinny cousin she prob thinks i'm a fat cow and is going to make fun of me for wearing a crop top... THINK: Oh look there is my cousin who is staring at me in a weird way... she prob thinks this color goes really well with my skin. (or something like that)  I know it is going to be really hard - but it is really important that you wear the outfit despite maybe not feeling too confident in it now. It can show everybody that you love yourself and are comfortable with yourself (even though you're maybe not at that exact moment). Also if you are accepting of yourself, other people are also going to be more accepting, because you are acting as though there is nothing wrong with you (AND THERE ISN'T!!).   Lastly, i think you should really go talk to you sister. Of course I have no idea what your relationship with her is, but it is important that you communicate to her in a really calm and mature manner that such a comment is just not okay.   I wish you much strength!! x",False,False
