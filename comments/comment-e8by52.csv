I don’t think it’s just my perspective because the gym teacher last year read the names and BMIs of some of the kids who did well in something or other. The lowest was 15 and the highest was like 21, and most under 20. Even though those were only the people who had done well at gym class it kind of confirmed the idea I’d have to get to a BMI of like 14 for anyone to notice it at all. Probably just because we’re all teenagers and not adults though.",False,False

I often feel the same way but then I remember that I live in the midwest and there's just no way the majority of people are skinny.  Tw lots of numbers: &gt;!In the US, for women 18-24, the median weight is 147, which is BMI 25 if you're the average 5'4"". Again for the average height, BMI 19.5 is 114 lb, which only 12% of college aged American women are at or under. And some of that 12% are short women at a higher BMI. So unless your college is very exceptionally health/sports focused, it seems unlikely that anywhere near even half of women are at that BMI. All those stats are from [here](https://dqydj.com/weight-percentile-by-age-calculator/), sadly I can only find stats about weight and not BMI!&lt;",False,False

I’m just way more likely to notice/focus on/remember thinner people.   I feel like with my constant insecurity-fueled comparisons I have stronger emotions when I see someone I wish I looked like, so my brain is getting a little zap saying “intense emotion = important = remember this”.",False,False
