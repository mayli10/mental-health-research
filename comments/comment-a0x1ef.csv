My bf is always willing to be my excuse to get out of stuff if I need him to. Recently, he told his family we couldn't go wine tasting after I gave him panic face. I can only have like 2 glasses anymore before I get sick, and I don't want the calories anyways. He'll physically remove a plate so I don't eat after I feel full (former binge eater) and he always makes sure that I feel ok eating whatever I want, even if something else is for dinner (I make him ask what's for dinner so I don't look rude when I walk in with my safe foods instead of dinner). The right kind of support is so important, and honestly, I credit him with enabling me to feel normal every once in a while. But I know my neuroticies are super annoying after a while and i wish I could just be normal and not drive hom crazy like I do. ",False,True

My SO knows I like ""baby"" plates and knowing what is in everything. I don't think it's enabling, tbh. They will list off a ton of ""do you wants"" when they notice I haven't eaten that day until I agree on something. (Which is better than not eating at all.) I don't expect them to cater to me but it's nice that someone listens to me without judgement. (Although sometimes they use not so ""PC"" phrases like ""you're being anorexic right now"" I understand what they mean and try not to take it personally.) It's all a long road and a hard battle, it's nice to have someone by your side during the fight. Honesty is important in your relationship. Even if everything ""goes right"" in your plan... It's best to let them know. Would you want them to keep their mental illness from you? Sending lots of love and courage to you. ",False,False
