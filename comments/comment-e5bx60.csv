I canâ€™t fast like I used to without getting super nauseous.   Iâ€™m 3 months into a bad bad bad relapse and Iâ€™m hitting a wall. No energy canâ€™t get warm feel like death. :/,False,False

Also took me a while to get really bad. Started recovering 7 months in. I relapsed 3 weeks ago and I immediately began fasting for multiple days. Consuming maybe 100 calories but working off all of it. Which would have taken a lot of restraint and effort then. But now it takes almost nothing.  I felt like I had to tell my therapist. Last time I didnâ€™t. Heâ€™s not specialized in eating disorders and he says heâ€™s extremely concerned. Concerned enough that if I donâ€™t up my caloric intake by my next appointment, heâ€™s going to refer me to the eating disorder clinic.   So I would say that the more often you relapse, the sooner it gets worse.",False,False

Now I'm 23 and had a relapse for the first time in 2 years after a breakup 2 months ago.  If I fast for 2 days I can't even get out of bed to get to class and I have the worst splitting headaches.  And forget the gym or interacting with other people at all or keeping up my gpa.  Getting old sucks, recovery time is longer, my stomach hurts from fasting then binging then purging then fasting, and I'm not even losing weight like I used to ðŸ˜ž",False,False
