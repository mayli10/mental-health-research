It has flax seed ground up in it so you don't need to add an egg or anything when you make it. So everything is measured out just once and when I make some I just put the correct amount of the mix in a measuring cup, mix with some almond milk and cook in a pan.   That way you don't have to measure out all the ingredients every time, just when you make the jar full of multiple serves and because you are measuring out larger portions of each ingredient for multiple serves you might not feel as self conscious (for me it's measuring tiny portions that make me feel weird).
