So basically whatever it is will go away on it’s own hopefully.   I’ll be careful, as soon as I start getting any side effects or dizzy I eat a bit more for little while until they settle. Thank you heaps though x",False,True

The minute I start stressing about my weight all of a sudden I notice the scale creeping up, which just makes me stress more. It’s a nasty cycle.",False,False

Don't stress :)  Have you been exercising more lately or did the temperatures rise in your area? You're body can bloa like hell for a few days but it always goes away. Can also be your fatcells filling up with water since you are emptying them from triglycerides. They will empty eventually and will lose quite a bit of weight overnight.  Please stay safe, 400 cals a day is way to little for anyone. Please consider taking it a bit slower if you must❤",False,False
