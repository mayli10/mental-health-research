I'm giving you an e - hug 🤗. I know it's difficult to have such a strict father and how it affects you mentally.  Stay strong ❤,False,False

I can practically hear my therapist saying, “weeeell, maybe there’s a more compassionate way to frame that.”   I think the experiences we have and the messages we receive in childhood can have a profound impact on us. They get incorporated into the very foundations of how we view the world and ourselves. I know my parents never *meant* to hurt me emotionally, but that doesn’t mean they didn’t hurt me.   You’re probably right though, that meting out blame (whether on your dad or on yourself) isn’t the most effective thing. But the pain we carry is real, and that deserves compassion as we move forward.   A friend of mine likes to say, “My problem isn’t figuring out how the donkey *got* in the ditch. My problem is figuring out how to get the donkey *out*.”   (...though, he uses a different word than “donkey”...lol)",False,False
