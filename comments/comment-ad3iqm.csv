There was a binge, but over-compensating with an exercise purge tomorrow may roll up to an even worse binge in the next week. But do whatever you need to do, gently, honestly, to feel peace.  If you over-punish, you continue to focus on the binge all day. And then, the binge continues to win. It keeps its stupid claws and roots in your brain. And makes future you suffer for this one little mistake. It would be a very, very great challenge to simply let it go. You can let it go. You're *allowed* to just let it go, and release it's grip on your brain, and your body, and how you feel about yourself.  You're allowed to forget about it. It's okay. You're okay. Everything is going to be ok, no matter what you do.  I wish you much peace and rest ðŸ’• ",False,False
