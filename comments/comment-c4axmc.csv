My dietician told me it might help to have fewer smaller meals but it sounds like you’re already integrating lots of snacks. Maybe try adding something super calorically dense, like chia seeds, to hit your goals without eating a lot of volume? Again, I totally get where you’re at, but just remember that the more uncomfortable you feel right now, the more you’re distancing yourself from your ED in the long run!",False,False
