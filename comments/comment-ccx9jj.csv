I lost my mom last fall to cancer. We were looking at old photos of her, and all I could think was how beautiful and thin she looked in photos  from my childhood. But I always remember how fat she thought she was, and how she was always on a diet, doing slim fast or whatever else. It broke my heart to realize how warped her self image was that whole time. She did have a few weight fluctuations throughout her life. She was a bit heavy as a child, but then grew out of it. She gained weight before my brother was born, but looked bomb in photos after I was born. One thing I still can't forget is an old signature book from her 1st grade year. A boy wrote ""you're kind of fat but  kind of nice"" I want to find that guy and kick him hard.",False,False
