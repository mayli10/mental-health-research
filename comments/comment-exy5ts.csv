We spend so long restricting that it slows down sometimes, especially with weight loss.  That's why a lot of athletes have a day where they refeed, I think it's called?  That aside, you'll be okay! One splurge won't ruin you, I promise.   It takes a lot more to gain actual weight.  And remember, the scales may increase to show water weight, cortisol (stress hormone), constipation etc.  Don't panic if it goes up.  You have NOT gained weight from two slices of cheesecake.",False,False

Remember that occasional jolts of calories is healthy to maintain a high functioning metabolism. If I were you, I would drink plenty of water, and end the night with a green tea. You wonâ€™t balloon up from one unhealthy choice. You are still on track, despite one slip up. Plus, you deserve a splurge every now and again. :)",False,False
