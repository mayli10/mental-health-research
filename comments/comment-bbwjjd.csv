I told my bf that I would work on my eating disorder with the therapy, but I feel you. I don’t really want to be recovered. I understand that the constant, invasive thoughts about food and my relationship with it is unhealthy. I know that it’s not okay that I’ve been reducing my already reduced calorie intake for the last few weeks. But even though I’m not at my new goal weight, and I understand that I’m running the risk of dropping said goal lower and lower..  I haven’t felt this good about my body in a long time. I feel like shit, I’m tired, and still striving for more.. but I still feel that much more confident in my own skin with my ED and I just don’t want to give it up. I hope all goes well with your predicament, and I hope that no matter what, you feel happy, present, and healthy.",False,False
