There are so many anorexics online I know will have I least mini binges, so I have I hard time wrapping my head around the fact that I really think this woman is the stereotypical anorexic.  For instance, she has literally never had an apple in her life because it's been a fear food for her whole life. Or that her husband gives her a box of chocolate covered strawberries every Mother's Day, and she's never actually eaten one. So when she was challenged this year to change that, she only ate one, and no more than that. Or that to her, victory is eating half a banana every morning instead of skipping. And I've seen her eat her lunch in the ED lunch group..she had a yogurt and a container of seeds. During the course of 45 minutes, she would spread some seeds on top of the yogurt, eat the top, and repeat. She only ate half the yogurt. And I'm talking about one of those tiny ass 90 Calorie single serving yogurt containers. I thought that was gonna be her starter; I was so shocked when she didn't bring out a bowl of lettuce and maybe some chicken for like a 50 Calorie salad. This woman literally does not eat.  And I say this as someone who usually eats OMAD. She does not seem to be eating little during the day then eating like 500 Calories at night.  She's a 14 BMI at most, but I honestly don't understand how she is still alive and is so functional with the way she eats (which isn't very, but she can still walk, talk, etc.).

I've been in plenty of group therapy and none of us ever talk about our specific diagnosis or behaviours. The core feelings/emotions/intent behind behaviours is all the same.  And inevitable bingeing DOES make sense whereas inevitable restricting doesn't. ""Eating too much goes against biology"" - yes, maybe, in individuals who have not been depriving their bodies of the nutrients (aka any kind of restriction).

Bingeing is an inevitability when you restrict your food intake - you're fighting your biology. It's literally the only normal response to a period of restricted food consumption. It's why there used to be an AN binge/purge subtype... because severe restriction --&gt; bingeing --&gt; purging (exercise or vomiting) in people terrified of weight gain/becoming fat.    And honestly, I think all of the diagnoses are kind of bullshit in the end. They're different sides of the same coin. That's why so many people vacillate between diagnoses. I technically would have met criteria for bulimia and EDNOS at different stages of my life, but what remained the core of my issues was always restriction (and why my diagnosis is always anorexia or anorexia in partial remission)",False,False

Even the restriction itself is pretty gross. It's feeling bloated and completely unsatisfied after forcing yourself to eat bland meals of vegetables or fake noodles just to feel full. Being underweight isn't delicate or dainty or any of that aesthetic bullshit. My skin was grey and sinewy. I looked like a bobble headed gremlin.,False,False
