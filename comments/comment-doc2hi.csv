I asked if this was something I ever did, taken a back, and he was like ahaha no we're just making jokes about things that didn't happen.     The tension in the conversation earlier was due to a comment on my knowledge over things which wasn't really banted as it was a genuine attack on my knowledge and was mentioned just to make fun of me for being unaware on the topic, and a previous jab at me for chewing on an ice cube with a comment on ""calories"". The ice cube thing was just because I had an ice coffee.. but previously I'd admitted to eating plain salt when wanting fries because I didn't want the calories of fries. In hindsight that was the dumbest fucking thing for me to ever admit, and in a way I guess I set myself up for the comment on my ice cube chewing but it genuinely felt like an attack that wasn't his place to bring up.      Guess this is what happens when you tell someone about your issues and they don't consider their words. Kinda genuinely felt like an attack so idk.",False,True
