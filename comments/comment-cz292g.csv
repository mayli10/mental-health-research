This helps reduce late-night binges.  \- Eating regularly throughout the day so I never get too hungry.  \- Taking care to stay away from places/situations where I would binge or buy binge foods. Eg. After eating an adequate portion for a meal, I'd try to go to the library (no food allowed!) and find a comfortable place to sit down and work on something else to distract myself. I also avoid going to the supermarket when I'm remotely hungry, or else limit the amount of money I have with me.   \- Eating with someone else. I know this might be difficult or triggering for others, but for me personally it helps me feel more sane when I eat with ""normal eaters"", and helps me be okay with eating a normal portion of food.  \- Reminding myself that if I still want the food later in the day/the next day, it will still be there and I will allow myself to eat it. This reduces the ""omg gotta finish everything NOW"" mindset.  \- This might be not be the healthiest way to think about it, but whenever I enter the ""I ate one (1) thing I shouldn't have so the day is ruined and I might as well eat everything in sight now!!"" mindset, I use exercise metrics to remind myself that 300kcal is very different from 3000; I tell myself that the former can be compensated by just a bit more than half an hour on the treadmill, whereas the latter would require wayyy tougher and tiring measures to tackle and I would hence def regret it.  Good luck friend!! &lt;3",False,False

Or should be, at least. Bingeing is no fun and I don't think there is anything wrong with asking for help to stop or minimize it.   Anyway. Personally, I have a few things I do to try to keep myself from going on a binge fest. One of them is to eat healthy foods when I feel a binge coming on. I will readily gorge on pizza, for instance, but a bowl of veggies, I tend to eat until I am satiated, and that is it. It isn't just about restricting calories, it's just that my bingeing is absolutely centered on me eating for pleasure or whatever rather than because I'm actually wanting or needing food. So finding the healthiest thing I can enables me to eat, but I never want to overeat them.   Other than that, I just try to distract myself. Read a book, play a game (on my phone or ps4), etc. Those methods don't always work for anyone and they definitely don't always work for me, but they're classic go to distractions most people turn to for a reason, I think.",False,False
