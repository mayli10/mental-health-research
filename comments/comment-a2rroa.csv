I'm trying to separate myself from number right now, so I haven't been weight myself or foods and I'm not being super meticulous about counting calories. even though I'm still anxious I think it's a pretty ok system because even if I do over indulge some days, the off days balance it out. Def don't think I'll be losing but if I gain I don't think it'll be significant.",False,False
