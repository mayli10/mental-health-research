What they're trying to do is get you a healthy relationship with food, so you can diet and not kill yourself.  God, I would love to feel normal about food, wouldn't you?",False,False

But inpatient treatment isn't about necessarily gaining weight - disordered eating happens at every size. What is is for you is a place to help you learn how to better manage your disordered thoughts and behaviours, which are things you definitely have. It's not about being ""skinny enough"" to deserve help. It's about the fact that these thoughts and behaviours are *miserable*, and nobody wants to live the way people with ED do.    If you think you're ready to be happier and less disordered, then you belong in recovery. It really is as simple as that. And if anyone tells you you don't, tell me and I will punt them into the mesosphere. That goes double for you telling yourself that. Do you wanna be in the mesosphere? No. It's cold up there and there's no wifi, and frankly you don't deserve to be there. You deserve to be somewhere that will help you learn how to feel like a person who deserves good things. That's not the mesosphere, that's treatment.   Tldr: you got this. Go forth and learn happy. That was a dumb sentence but I'm really tired and you get the sentiment, right? Good. ",False,False
