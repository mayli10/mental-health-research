You're under a lot of pressure and it's okay to vent it out. I wouldn't have replied if I didn't want to hear you out. My boyfriend had this issue with his last ex girlfriend and they never got over it, but that doesn't mean you can't! You guys should try to talk out how it's difficult for you to maintain this and possibly get to the bottom of why your girlfriend never seems to think you spend enough time together. Maybe by getting to the root of it, you'll be able to come up with a viable solution that works for the both of you.",False,False

However, she still gets frustrated if we're not like the other couples who supposedly spend all their time together and make-tf-out 24/7   Like, i'm trying my best to balance spending time with her and spending time on school work, and constantly playing catch-up on late work because of missing school due to medical stuff and other things. I make sure we hang out for several hours every weekend, and I see her at school every day that I'm there. But it's just not e n o u g h for her.   I've told her that I'm trying. And she acknowledges that too, but still gets upset",False,True
