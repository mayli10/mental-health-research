And yeah, the whole diet culture did it for me, it became such a normal thing, I’d have relatives “going on diets” even though they wouldn’t be that serious about them, and I’d always read about different diets in my mum’s magazines so I started one a couple of years back, even tho i had no idea what i was doing so it would really count as actually being on a diet. That until i found the whole “counting calories” thing. And *then* it all went downhill.",False,False

Everything started as a diet for me, I just wanted to lose a couple of pounds, nothing major, then ot quickly escalated into an obsession and I got emotionally involved. Food for me is a coping mechanism, it's the way I deal with my problems, I don't binge just because and I don't restrict just because either, there's always something wrong underneath my disordered behaviours (depression, anxiety). Moreover I feel like no one will love me if I am fat, no one will ever call me pretty, that's why I am deadly afraid of gaining weight. I don't want people to think ""look at that fat girl"". It doesn't make sense, I know, but that's what my ED says and my stupid ass listens.",False,False
