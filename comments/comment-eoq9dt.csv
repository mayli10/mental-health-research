ACK! YOU DO THE ROOM THING TOO?!? I THOUGHT IT WAS JUST ME!! But I don't jog, I'm too lazy too jog. I just pace up and down until I burn 500 calories using my pedometer on my phone.  I should totally get back into canned soup! I used to me obsessed with them 10 years ago when I was a pre-teen trying to get my dad to stop calling me fat üòÇ. It's time to awaken the child once more!  It's strangely spooky how cheese and salt and vinegar rice cakes are also your favourite. And the baby snack thing?? I was looking at those 2 days ago!  With mushrooms do you just eat sauce and mushrooms? I tend to stay away from fibre bars (most of the time) have you ever eaten 15 in one sitting before then went on to buy junk food later on that same day? Biggest trigger food for me :(.  I see! I should get into wraps too! Thank you so much for your help!!",False,True

And I wasn‚Äôt too like..off the rails then, so to speak haha. Then I got super fatigued from some medication I was on and stopped exercising and got more and more into restricting, and was just restricting more and not exercising.   Then Christmas just happened, and for like a week after I kept going over my goals and I gained weight from Christmas, so I freaked out and started exercising calories off using my FitBit. Just jogging in my room like a freak lmao. And I‚Äôm still doing that. If I go over I use my Fitbit to exercise off specific calorie numbers (even tho I don‚Äôt trust the Fitbit 100%) and if I don‚Äôt go over, I just use my Fitbit to do 30 active minutes.  But like, this is new behaviour. Usually I just restrict and make up for days I‚Äôve gone over by restricting more. I‚Äôve lost weight doing exercise and doing no exercise,  but I think the exercise is helping a bit now.   Ohh I love canned soups. So easy to use, taste good and there are low calorie options. I know sodium can be scary, but it is temporary weight impact. I‚Äôm on Australia so don‚Äôt know if specific brand recommendations will help, but most countries have low calorie soup options, just check it out!   I also love flavoured rice cakes and corn thins. Cheese and salt and vinegar are my faves. They‚Äôre like 25-35 cals per slice and can be filling. Sometimes I eat too many tho so I have to hide them lmao.   I like toddler and baby snack bars too. Sounds stupid I know lol but they‚Äôre yum and low calorie.   Sugar free jello is yum.   I love mushrooms. So low calorie can be used in curry sauce/pasta sauce etc.  Fibre One Bars are yum.   Low calorie wraps are super helpful, with a little deli meat and sauce. Or just loaded with veggies and sauce. Low calorie wraps and bred can be a life saver.   And laughing cow cheese triangles!   I‚Äôm also into cheese and crackers with ham lately. Not necessarily low calorie, but I portion my sizes to make it work. Meal prep can be super helpful too!",False,False

Don't worry I'm not triggered! I'm the one who asked after all but thank you for your consideration! :) Do you do any exercise to compliment your restriction or is it just pure restriction?   I certainly have binge-eating tendencies (haven't been diagnosed... Still on the waiting list to see a psychiatrist D: )  If fasting isn't for you then it isn't for you, you know? I feel like if you go over your calorie limit for the day there's always tomorrow to get back on track. But then again, you sure know yourself better than I do so take my advice with a handful of salt XD!  Ah, I do that too! I find it's a lot easier to restrict/fast when the food isn't there in the first place. I've never really thought of having a safe food since I'm afraid I'll eat the whole damn thing, no self control. Can you recommend me some of your favourite if it's not too much to ask?",False,True

Tbh I was morbidly obese to start, like 360+lbs or something. So the weight loss comes off a lot easier at that weight. I just became obsessed with calories and restricting. I also cut out carbs because I was diabetic. It fell off super quick the first few months when I was eating 600-800. Now I eat even less, but it‚Äôs coming off so much slower.  I honestly think i lost so much because I had so much to lose, ya know? I still struggle and many days I break my goal and hate myself - but I don‚Äôt struggle with serious binge eating like some. I ‚Äúbinge‚Äù over my limit, but can usually control myself. Idk how to give advice really haha, I guess this is a mental illness that impacts us all differently!   I find planning my mess in advance helps. And I find when I fast (or try to) I end up breaking it and eating more than I would have if I‚Äôd just restricted, so I‚Äôm trying to get out of the fasting mindset. But then when I fail a goal I feel I have to fast? Eurgh I hate it.   So please don‚Äôt let me trigger you. I was very obese to start. I lost most of it when I started out restricting for the first time ever in August, and the 2 months following. It‚Äôs been slow since then and I‚Äôve struggled a lot. Sorry if this isn‚Äôt helpful, im a bit all over the place right now lmao.",False,False

You've lost so much!! That's amazing I'm so proud of you!! Take all of my virtual hugs!! I really struggle with losing and keeping it off tbh, last year I was fighting with the same 10kg but now I've graduated and moved down a front digit... I'm fighting with another 10kg :(. I really wish I could stay disciplined you know? I don't like fighting for control than losing it in the blink of an eye. Can I ask you how you stayed so disciplined to lose so much so quickly? I feel like I'm immune to my own insults now, or I'm self sabotaging so I subconsciously aim to make myself miserable by not staying on track?",False,True

I‚Äôm obese too, which brings a whole new dimension to dealing with this eating disorder. I‚Äôve lost &gt;!110!&lt; lbs since July too, but I don‚Äôt wana share with anyone for fear of them realising how or for fear of them starting to become disordered too. Being obese helps the weight fall off a lot quicker!   3 days is a great fasting achievement tbh, I think my longest is 36 hours. I never break them insanely, but breaking a fast is breaking a fast. I get so depressed, but I still keep trying to do long ones lmao.
