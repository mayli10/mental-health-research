I don't know if I would call them filling, but they're satisfying AS FUCK. Seriously just feels like dessert. I'd call them a large snack more than a meal. However, when I'm restricting, it's nice to eat half of one when I start to feel hungry and then half again when I start to feel hungry again. That seems to make the ""full"" feeling last a lot longer. They do definitely take away the hunger edge pretty quickly.  If you get the brownie ones, they're really good microwaved.",False,True
