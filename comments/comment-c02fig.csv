Does that make sense? Like if you haven’t seen someone in years and they lose weight, it’s immediately noticeable. But if you see them every day you may not notice for months and months!",False,False

I will try and tell her next time, when i'm less freaked out and upset. It feels like a betrayal, but hopefully it can be worked through, or at least, forgotten about if I refuse to speak of ED stuff again until I can trust her again with it. Thanks a lot for being here and responding &lt;3",False,True

I've told her that. She keeps asking though. But when I tried to explain today that talking about my eating/weight is awful for me she said 'i know'. I don't know if her method of 'trying to challenge me' (if that's what it is) is helpful at all. I have a lot of trouble speaking about it and she kinda forces me to speak more. otherwise I'd never mention it.   And honestly, I can't really see anyone else. She's been helpful in other ways. and everyone else in my area is just so shitty in terms of mental health. I don't know if i can bring it up again, without sounding silly or feeling embarassed. she's kinda all i have in terms of support. but it's a big deal. I'm sorry for the rant. Feel like my tiny heart is crushed.",False,True

I’m not saying they’re a bad therapist but just because they are a therapist it doesn’t mean that they’re a good one, I do understand it takes a long time to qualify and of course it’s rigorous but that comment is seriously hurtful and wholly unprofessional. Honestly if I was in your position I would consider seeing a different therapist, 50kg is a huge amount of weight and you did amazingly well to lose it all, even if it wasn’t done in the healthiest way, and of course it’s unfortunate to put it back on but losing that 50kg is an amazing achievement that can’t be taken away from you by anyone! Stay strong!!",False,False
