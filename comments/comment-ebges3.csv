It felt very wrong when I started eating foods with more calories lol. It might help to try to introduce a more calorie dense “small” food to help you reach your number.

Once you can make yourself do that, try going two days in a row at 900. Once you’re doing 900 every day, add another 100 every other day.   It’s hard at first. You might feel like a failure and have doubts. I regressed a few times but I came back to it. I’ve been eating 1000 calories for about 4 months now and it’s no longer difficult. I’m planning to go up to 1200.   One issue with this I experienced is that I was still losing weight but wasn’t noticing it. My brain is still so convinced that eating 1000 calories means I must GAIN weight, even though my deficit to lose healthily is quite a bit more. I really only noticed it when I went to the doctor last month and she got upset with my weight. Then I went home and body checked and realized and I was almost at my lowest weight either (no binging now that I feel satisfied by food).  So yeah, just wanted to throw that little warning out there. I feel a lot better at 1000 though. I feel normal.

BUT DAMN if being empty for days at a time doesn’t feel amazing. I’ve tried to explain this to friends that don’t struggle with EDs in the past and I always just come across sounding crazy and vain. It’s an addiction, a high, a euphoria, and a sense of pride and accomplishment that I’ve yet to match with any other successes I’ve had in life.  That being said, i know it sucks that I’ve felt this way for almost 30 years without ever being able to stick to recovery. But I don’t want to stop. I never have and that scares me if I let myself think about it.
