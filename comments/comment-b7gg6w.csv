I can definitely relate -- even before cutting out sugar I always craved carbs so much more than sweets. I'm guessing that might change if I keep up a monster habit, but daaaaaamn that appetite-suppressing superpower is no joke. So far, seems worth it.  Definitely noting your caffeine warning, but I'm already hooked to coffee and tea like an iv so might be a little late for me hahahaha. Best of luck to you on your slow crawl away from caffeine!

I drink “pure zero silver ice” rockstar, daily (it tastes like Fresca on crack, I freaking love it) as well as Coke Zero. I didn’t drink any soda at all, other than the occasional red bull, just water, like I use to drink 3 L of water a day but it didn’t suppress my appetite the same way sodas did soooo😅😅 I started drinking diet and zero sugar drinks. I didn’t intentionally cut out water, bc I really love water, but my water intake has gone down a lot as a result of high soda intake.. my body is really not happy with me for the water cut back haha😅😅.   Any-who! Before I started drinking it, I didn’t even really want sugar ever- if I had a junk food craving it would be for potato chips or other salty snacks (Potato is my safe food which is wild and makes ZERO sense but here we are 😂😅)   Now I find myself actually craving cake and candy, which is wild to me because ALL of my life, I’ve never enjoyed cake. Even pre ED childhood I would request chips instead of a birthday cake! But now at 25 hooked on rockstar, I’m actively craving cakes and shit.   I am sort of attempting to reduce my caffeine consumption now, because it is an expensive habit 😂 I am trying to wean myself off it, slowly. So that’s something to keep in mind as well. Caffeine withdrawal SUCKS. The last time I went cold turkey I couldn’t get out of bed for 2 days due to a debilitating migraine induced by lack of caffeine. ",False,False

It's great to know your experience and I'll definitely consider these things and watch out for them if I start up this affair with energy drinks :) ,False,True

I find that at 140mg of caffeine, Monster Zero Ultra makes me feel fine and I prefer the taste of it to coffee. Bang (300mg) is slightly too caffeinated for my tastes and drinking too much too quickly can jump start my heart rate in an uncomfortable way. Meanwhile, diet sodas (e.g. diet Coke, 40-50mg) don’t provide much energy at all to me, so Monster is a nice medium.  I do feel like my sugar cravings have increased since I’ve started drinking energy drinks. Usually I’m able to satiate my cravings with protein bars, but I also notice that like, *all* of my binges are exclusively on sweets. Despite that, I’m still gonna stick with my energy drinks because they work for me and I don’t mind artificial sweeteners, but I would be cautious if you’re avoiding sugar.",False,False
