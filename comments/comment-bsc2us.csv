Either that or just trying to get in more dietary fibre are what I'm thinking of for next steps. It'll probably end up being a supplement like metamucil though, just because they entirely control what I eat at day hospital.",False,True

It's supposed to be helpful for both diarrhea and constipation (I have IBS-D and it can be really helpful).

I am going to bring it up tomorrow, and honestly I'm a little excited to do so. They are a fantastic team, but put up a front of being infallible, which is totally understandable. They need people to trust the process no matter what. However, I am definitely feeling some schadenfreude.",False,True

Do not be afraid to tell your treatment team that this isn't working for you. You're already fighting hard enough with your disorder. You ought not have to fight your body too.
