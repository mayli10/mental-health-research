I would actually hold onto more weight if I ate a ton of vegetables and grains, this could be from water retention and carbohydrates being my prime energy source  Ik this from experience, I only gain actual fat when I eat mainly carbohydrates, I stay pretty lean when I eat less. But I’m also male so hormonal responses are probably different.  TLDR: yes, you can gain weight from eating only vegetables or healthy foods in a large amount.  Instead of eating primarily vegetables, I would eat those plant foods that are nutrient dense like nuts, when I was vegetarian I felt sick from only eating cabbage, spinach, carrots ect",False,False

Weather that’s 4 donuts or 4 pounds of carrots. Just because it’s healthy doesn’t mean you’re body won’t store it as fat if it’s excess calories than what your body needs  It’s safer to eat fruits &amp; vegetables just because they tend to have less calories than other food groups (think 4 oz of red meat vs 4 oz of Brussel sprouts). Plus they’re loaded in vitamins and antioxidants",False,False
