But I really overdid it today. My plan now is to start eating really healthy tomorrow. I’m gonna make a soup with a lot of kale in it and eat that for the rest of the week. I find it so much easier to eat right when I have a lot of soup..,False,False

Allegedly I need residential. First of all, I doubt that. This is for OCD, not ED, and my case is not overtly severe, so like...now I wonder if I totally messed up the intake screening. I'm always convinced that people won't take me seriously, so I feel like I unintentionally exaggerated my symptoms because I was so worried I wouldn't get recommended for treatment at all. Like fwiw, my therapist is pretty confused that I was recommended for residential.  Regardless, I can't go to residential halfway across the country at an exorbitant price. I literally can't. I can also guarantee I'd check out AMA if I even tried, because I chafe so strongly against controlled environments, that it leads to me not being able to focus on anything but my desire for escape.  So, now I can't get treatment. Somehow, it's better for me to not be treated at all, than to accept a level of care I can't afford, and believe would be actively unhelpful in my particular case. Boy, that's super logical! I just love interacting with the mental health care system!",False,False
