The last time that happened I got bitched at for eating before I was about to go on break at work and I had a full on meltdown. Like the voices screaming at me to starve myself weren‚Äôt enough, now someone from the outside world is doing it too. I hadn‚Äôt eaten in like three days, I was so mad.  But yeah this is me like every other day.",False,False

I feel like I‚Äôve been feeling just so frustrated and just a huge freaking emotional mess lately.
