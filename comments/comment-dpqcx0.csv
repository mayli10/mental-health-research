It worked out just fine- no one really gets how much effort it takes to look normal nor that I can eat normal appearing foods for very low calories. I’m better than I once was- I can actually hear the conversations going on around me now and participate where as at my worst, I missed out on all of it despite being physically present.",False,False

Nobody really knows about my disordered eating cuz I'm ""normal BMI"". They're just being inconsiderate",False,True
