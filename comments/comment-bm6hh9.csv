I‚Äôm a competitive powerlifter and after relapsing with AN this year my strength is garbage. My lifts are all down, and I know what I need to do to fix it but goddammit it‚Äôs so hard. :(",False,False

I powerlift and as a result am pretty muscular but not lean. A bodybuilding woman I met at a party said (as a compliment) that I was huge and I think I clenched so hard my entire body was sucked up through my asshole :-(,False,False

There was a thread about protein requirements the other day I commented on where someone was all ""well maybe if you lifted you'd have to worry about macros, but since you're *just* running it probably doesn't matter."" Meanwhile, all the recent exercise physiology and sports dietetic research indicates the RDA for endurance sports is *higher* than in strength sports.    It's almost like none of the people who claim that it's impossible to lose body fat or that you'll just be skinnyfat doing cardio have never actually met a runner who isn't impressed by their 28m 5K time or 2:01 HM‚Ä¶the women who run middle distance are more ripped than half the men I see in the gym, and even some of the distance runners these days have pretty killer abs.",False,False

The amount of memes I‚Äôve seen comparing women who lift vs. women who enjoy cardio is sad.   And I was in a similar boat while running track in college. Lost a ton of weight over the summer just from running and light lifting, got shredded, then had killer times but once the season started I wasn‚Äôt allowed to do everything that helped me lose the weight so I gained it all back",False,True

I'm at the point right now where I can eat 2-2.5k/day and maintain perfectly at 19 BMI or kill myself to sit in the high 17s/low 18s and end up struggling to hit paces during workouts and on top of more injuries. I keep vacillating back and forth between the two and the constant stress is killing me :(",False,False
