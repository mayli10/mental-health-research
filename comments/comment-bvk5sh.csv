It’s your body trying to survive.   I recommend that you just try to eat at maintenance if you can, or stick to a conservative (under 500 kcal deficit). PLEASE DO NOT restrict really hard or you might get into a vicious binge restrict cycle. (I’ve been through it before and it is the worst thing ever).   Also, remember, it takes 3500 kcal *over* your tdee to gain one pound.  One pound is not a lot. So in my opinion, one binge isn’t going to set you back a ton. A binge is not the end of the world!",False,False

If I feel up to it later I’ll have vegetables for dinner.  Thanks so much for the help, I guess mostly I just have to wait until I feel better.",False,True

It’s really rough.  Fortunately, this is 100% temporary. It’s just the food hanging out and digesting, making gas which fills up your belly making it “hard” like a balloon. The cramps and aching are just your body working hard to digest and clean it out.   Drink a lot of water, not too much salt, and eat something with a good amount fiber if you can, it helps speed the process along. Weirdly fasting doesn’t help me get rid of it quicker (I think fasting makes digestion slower? Idk), but restricting for a few days with mostly fruits and vegetables does. Peppermint can help as well, a few big mugs of peppermint tea always gives me some good results the next day. A lot of people swear by yoga and stretching, this hasn’t worked so great for me personally, but it wouldn’t hurt to try it.  I hope this helps, binge body is such an unpleasant feeling. Don’t beat yourself up too hard, your body will do its thing eventually and clean it all right out. Binges aren’t failures, they happen to a lot of people, remember you’re not alone in this. Good luck xx",False,False
