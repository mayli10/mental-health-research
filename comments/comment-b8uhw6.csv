That’s no different than someone walking into a visibly underweight person and thinking/telling their friends “omg I walked into someone who looked like a holocaust survivor today lmao”   Like Jesus Christ.

She was a manipulative little psychopath. Just.... all in all, not a good person, at all.   She was a tiny little thing and used to go out of her way to make sure it was known that she was the cute one in our friendship. (She actually referred to herself as the cute one. No joke. She made fat jokes about me all the time... I'm 5'7""... and have always hovered around 135 lbs.)   Anyway, I finally broke away from her towards the end of high school. Now, years and years later, I recently saw her. She has gained a LOT of weight. Like, I didn't even recognize her.   I try to be a good person, and I usually don't judge anyone based on their weight. But that just felt like some kind of karmic reward. ",False,False
