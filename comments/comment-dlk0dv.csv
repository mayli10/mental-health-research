Those are exactly 400 calories and I love those because it's nice knowing it's exactly 400 calories, and that it covers at least 20% of my nutritional requirements... but it's so annoying because they purposely made the calorie count so high! They add oil and other added fats specifically to up the calorie level of each bottle (beyond just covering all the nutritional bases), which I guess makes sense since the soylent-drinking demographic is mainly guys (esp techie guys) and their daily maintenance calories are so much higher.  I know people hate the whole ""pink"" washing thing - but I think there's actually a good justification for having a Soylent-for-women line, that doesn't deliberately hit a high calorie level to get 100% nutrition. Like maybe around 1500 calories? I can only dream of a customizable-blend service where you start with the same complete nutritional base, and get to specify how many calories you want your daily supply to contain, and split into how many bottles/day. They would make sooo much money off of the meal replacement crowd and also bring in people who want to meet all their nutritional needs but at a specific calorie deficit. And also makes it appealing to OMAD people or others who only want 1 or 2 shakes a day, not 5 (which is such an absurdly high number and all that plastic/waste makes me cringe).  I think you can pretty much do that at Complete Foods (used to be called diy soylent) so maybe check that out.  The only issue with Complete Foods that I think is why they haven't taken off/overtaken soylent, is that it's too complicated/involved to get started - it's not hard, but the average customer is not going to bother figuring out all the details. People like soylent because all you do is pick a flavor, no other thinking required. Someone could make a killing by providing the same exact service as complete foods, but extremely simplified and through a UI that's extremely dumbed down but polished.  I swear this sub gives me so much entrepreneurial inspiration that I will inevitably never follow through on lol",False,False
