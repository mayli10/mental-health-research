We didn‚Äôt have the correct size pan, so we made them in a muffin tin.

It‚Äôs a pretty popular trick you can do with both box cakes and brownies. It‚Äôs a half a can per box. So you aren‚Äôt adding anything like eggs, oil, or water to the recipe. Just 6 oz diet soda.

Occasionally I see posts that are just compilation videos of cookie and brownie treats being cut into with utensils to where they ooze out. It's close to pornography.

I could go onnnnnnn and onnnnnn about smelling Starbucks pastries and drinks while ultra fasted.   Our new everything bagel debuted about 3 weeks ago. The old one had Asiago cheese on it so it kind of smelled sweaty in a good way while it toasted. But this new one- it‚Äôs so oniony. I can smell it as soon as I open the shrink wrap. It‚Äôs intoxicating to say the least. It swirls around me as if to wholeheartedly taunt me with its tasty empty carbs. ,False,False
