It's very hard to recognize it in yourself, but if you saw someone else with your body I'm sure you'd think they warrant the diagnosis.",False,False

I guess what I was trying to say is that when I was bulimic, I wasn't hesitant to call myself bulimic (even before I was diagnosed) but now, I don't feel like I can call myself anorexic because I don't think I look like it. Weird ED feeling like you have to prove yourself behavior I know lol and internalized ED hierarchy   Also, I'm Asian and Asians are ""naturally skinny"" because of our ""fast metabolism"" Its a little frustrating because people just see me as being normally skinny for an Asian and one is really concerned about my weight hahah. When my BMI was at 16, my mom told me I look like a normal, healthy girl. love it.",False,True

One of the other hallmarks of anorexia, by the way? Meeting the behavioral and BMI criteria, yet being convinced you still look normal/healthy (or even fat), and that you aren't actually anorexic.  I am not a doctor, but this absolutely sounds like anorexia nervosa. Either way, it sounds like you need help. You also don't have to go back to that particular pdoc to get it, unless you are in a very isolated area or something...it sounds like that was not a good fit.",False,False
