I remember having eaten too much of something and my stomach hurt from being overfull. My mom taught me how to put my fingers down my throat to throw up and feel better. I did it pretty regularly as a child. I was always comfort eating/binging (bad home life). And then at some point as a teen it turned to be more about weight control than just making myself feel better from overeating. I still can‚Äôt ever feel overfull or my body is immediately primed to purge.",False,True
