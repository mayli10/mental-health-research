This is mainly what I’ve always struggled with. I rarely ever binge. I just eat a bite too much, my stomach feels too full, and it’s gotta come up. It can be minutes after, it can be hours after. I don’t think it’s ever helped me lose weight, but I *believe* it’s helped me at least maintain.  My therapist actually treated me like I was crazy today when I said I purged 3x this week because I felt too full but not because I binged. Oh well.",False,False
