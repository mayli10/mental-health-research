I do think it would be helpful to see a therapist, though. Especially if your appetite doesn’t improve in the next day or so. Try to at least drink soup or something to try to trick your mind into thinking you’re not actually eating if you can’t make yourself eat.",False,False

From what you’re describing here, your symptoms seem related to that rather than an eating disorder. This doesn’t mean that you definitely won’t develop an eating disorder in the long run, that might always be possible, but it sounds like a common effect of grief and depression. I’m so sorry for your loss. Take good care of yourself and reach out for help when you need it.",False,False
