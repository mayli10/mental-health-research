This is actually really scary but I know somebody whose mother had anorexia for decades before he was born (I‚Äôm not sure if she was anorexic during the pregnancy but I think yes) and he has severe mental and physical underdevelopments as a result. He can‚Äôt even talk.   I know that I will have to push my eating disorder to the side even if it‚Äôs just for 9 months but I absolutely must. I want to eat healthily and workout and be fit and healthy for my baby through those things, rather than sickly. It will be such a happy time and maybe my mind will be able to rest for a while.   If it helps, my husband‚Äôs coworker definitely as an eating disorder and she is one of my real life Ana goals people. She has 2 kids but she is still insanely skinny so I think you can always bounce back.",False,False

I refused to restrict, I loved my baby and wanted a healthy pregnancy.  The day I gave birth I weighed 25lbs heavier. Baby was 7lbs even, I lost every single lb by 2 weeks PP.   I even breastfed for 3 years which amps your appetite up to ridiculous heights.  I exercised every day and ate healthy during that pregnancy and felt better than I ever had in my life.   So I had some extreme weight related fears but they were totally unfounded.   Hopefully that helps ease someone else's mind.   My second pregnancy ended in TFMR at 21+5 because of severe spina bifida which I'm not so hesitant to say was probably diet related. Don't fucking starve yourself if you want a healthy baby ladies.",False,False

I had been purging before I found out, but was able to stop once I knew I was pregnant. I taught fitness classes through the pregnancy, but still gained 43 pounds, which I actually didn‚Äôt totally freak out over. Days before going into labour, I did have a bit of a breakdown over having to ‚Äúgo back‚Äù to always watching what I‚Äôm eating if I wanted to get back to my old weight. Fortunately, the weight came off fairly quickly from breastfeeding, and I had dropped 50lbs from my highest pregnancy weight in about 8 months. The hard part was when I went back to work and stopped breastfeeding, my metabolism sucks on its own, so now I‚Äôm back to constantly thinking about weight and food. But it was really nice to have a break from the crazy during the pregnancy. And despite gaining 43 pounds, I felt more beautiful than I ever had in my life.",False,False

So happy it worked out that way for you. I feel like pregnancy would actually help me a lot because right now, the only person I have to look after is myself so it's easy to be selfish and just care about what I look like, but I'd like to think I would be able to let that go when I have someone else's needs to look after.",False,False

It wasn't even a conscious effort; everything was about what felt healthy (with some treats thrown in), and gaining pregnancy weight didn't bother me at all. I gained a healthy amount (didn't ""let myself go"", but also didn't restrict) and lost it easily afterwards.  I know that's not how it is for everyone, of course, but for me, it really did go down just like you said. Baby came first, and it didn't occur to me to have a problem with that.

Getting pregnant legit cured my ED, like, overnight. I put on a healthy amount of weight for my size, my midwife was happy, I ate healthfully. After I gave birth, I ate healthfully and mindfully, and lost weight easily (due to nursing and milk donation). For the next 10 or so years, I stayed in a small range of low-healthy BMI and was really content with my body. It's amazing how carefree I was, without having ""let myself go"" and been happily indifferent to my weight. Lose a couple lbs when I needed to, eat to maintain, make smart choices -- it was so easy!  Hard to believe how I slipped back into old thoughts and patterns after a decade of being functionally cured. Not just cured, but happy. Normal. Healthy.  Recovery *is* possible, I just gotta find a way to get there that doesn't involve, like, you know... bringing another person into the world.",False,False

This is probably been the most relaxed I‚Äôve ever felt about my body and the farthest away I‚Äôve been from all my disordered eating. I was scared going into it, but it really does change your perspective. I‚Äôm not running mile after mile to punish myself but running a more normal amount to stay healthy. Not so sure this new attitude will stick after the baby is out, but for now, it‚Äôs about someone other than me and it‚Äôs been a wonderfully freeing feeling.
