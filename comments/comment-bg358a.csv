If you are not active and all weight loss comes from restriction, 53 is NOT OKAY most likely. A doctor may find something different for you specifically so you definitely need to see one",False,False

Just don't panic. Your body is incredibly resilient, which is not to dismiss the danger of ED behaviors, but to say look, you aren't doomed, you can come back from this. It's not hopeless and it won't be this way forever.  I just got through several months of refeeding and I'm here to tell you it feels great, once you get through the initial misery. Hang in there!",False,False

I’m not even kidding I’ve only been eating Halo Top, rice cakes, and yogurt. My nutrients are definitely out of wack. I’m gonna take a laxative to try and get things going hopefully. (Not as a way to try losing weight). Thanks for your kind advice! :)",False,True

As a runner, my RHR when I'm at a healthy weight is usually 42-44.  I've had doctors see it as low as 39 at my LW and no one was chucking me in the hospital. Don't freak out unless your normal RHR baseline is like, 70 or something.  I would say, focus on hydration and getting some electrolytes and nutrients from your food, when you do eat (fruits, veg, protein...not rice cakes and Halo Top). Twenty pounds in a month is extreme, it's no wonder your body is protesting. Hope you feel better soon &lt;3",False,False

Can’t I just eat more instead of going to the doctor and risking hospitalization? Idk if this helps, but I’m a dancer with a decent amount of muscle mass which could make it lower. (Not trying to be difficult I’m just really scared). I’m really nervous to gain this weight back.",False,True

It’s not in the range that would *usually* lead to immediate hospitalisation, but it depends very much on what your pulse feels like, whether you are orthostatic when they examine you (they need to do your heart rate and blood pressure in two different positions to determine this - you usually can’t tell on your own at home), and what shows up on your EKG. It is certainly low enough that you could be at risk of serious complications, or even cardiac arrest. Please do get checked out; I know it’s very hard to make the decision to see a doctor, but it sounds like you truly need to.   You may be experiencing a degree of slowed gastric transit / gastroparesis, which is a frequent complication of restrictive EDs. There are other reasons why you may be feeling nauseous, this is just one common one. The god news is, it can go away! :)",False,False

I can keep food down, I just get uncomfortably full and a little nauseous. Is 53 that bad? I’m still on the higher end of my BMI. (5’3 127 lbs) so I feel like I can’t be in that much danger.
