Apparently, when you lose more than 10lbs a month on average, you're more likely to get gallstones. The gallbladder is on the right side, so that checks out.   I mean, I would not trust my opinion because I'm an idiot and know next to nothing about health, but that's my guess. Maybe you can look it up and rule out the symptoms?   Good luck! ",False,False

Painful/tender? Have you been straining recently (maybe a hernia?) Has your digestion changed recently (could be indigestion, constipation, gas)?  There's a billion questions to be asked- I haven't heard of this before as being an ED-related thing necessarily. So yeah going to a GP sounds like a good idea imo- even if you don't feel any other symptoms, it doesn't mean you don't have to check it out necessarily.  Take care, hopefully someone else will comment whether they had something similar :/",False,False
