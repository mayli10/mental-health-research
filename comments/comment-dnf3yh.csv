Also we won and we're state champions :) we're very happy,False,True

Who knows why he‚Äôs doing it. I usually try to give the benefit of the doubt and think it‚Äôs good intentions but bad follow thru.   A lot of cultures/ppl show love thru food. When they offer you food they‚Äôre trying to show they care and when you don‚Äôt eat, they take it personally. Some cultures take it as an insult, some take it as maybe I‚Äôm just not cooking well.   When I restricted a lot, some people just tried to cook food or give me what they thought was super yummy food to get me to eat bc they were worried about me and that‚Äôs the only way they knew how to help.   Maybe have a 1 on 1 convo with him and let him know it makes you feel uncomfortable. Maybe something good comes out of it. Maybe it doesn‚Äôt. Either way, you‚Äôve drawn your boundaries.",False,False

You can explain to him that he violated your boundaries by touching/forcing something down your throat and that in future you will not tolerate such behaviour, as well as comments about your eating. You can absolutely do this without talking about your ed.   ‚ÄúHey X, it‚Äôs been so cool getting to know you better! I had a really good time watching the other bands with you, but I need to let you know that when you physically forced something down my throat, I felt really uncomfortable and a bit scared! I really don‚Äôt want this to affect our friendship so I‚Äôm just letting you know (you‚Äôre not a mind reader!) that I have strong boundaries that include touching and talking about my personal habits such as eating, and I will need you to respect these boundaries üíó thanks X, see you at _____!‚Äù",False,False

If you prefer not to talk about eating/food related stuff then that is ok! Good friendships do involve degrees of openness but he \*does not\* have carte blanche. Once you tell them that, they need to respect that boundary. Full stop. And in my book, it is never \*ever\* ok for anyone to put food or beverage into someone's body without their consent. That's just a basic human respect issue to me. (Heck, if nothing else, many people have food allergies/sensitivities that might not be common knowledge!)  Best of luck today and the competition and in general. &lt;3",False,False
