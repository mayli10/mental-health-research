I know how shitty it feels; the guy I'm seeing mentioned that his ex ""got fat"" ONCE, and now I stalk her Instagram constantly so I can compare my body to hers.   I know it's really hard, but try to remind yourself that 10-15 pounds really isn't that much; I'm sure you still look amazing and if he has a problem with that (it doesn't seem like he actually does -- guys can make hurtful offhand comments sometimes but they generally don't mean them or understand how hurtful they are) then he's not worth the trouble.",False,False
