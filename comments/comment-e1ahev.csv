I used to think it was because I was lazy but once I pushed myself to take a shower, and I passed out from exhaustion. Fortunately the running water was draining well or else I might have drowned that day.",False,False

I got a Himalayan pink salt night light and I shower with the bathroom lights off and just the night light on. It's a nice soft dim light which makes it harder to look at my body but I can still see well enough to do what I need to do in the shower. If I'm not shaving or grabbing something I close my eyes sometimes, too.",False,False
