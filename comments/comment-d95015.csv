And I had talked to her about thinking about purging before, so I understand why she would have said it. It does make me regret opening up to her though.",False,True

Your mom may just be suspicious and making up a story to see if you'll confess.   I'm only suggesting that bc my mom did something similar, but instead she lied and said a childhood friend of mine had an ed. I'm not entirely sure why she did it bc she never actually confronted me on my behavior. Furthermore, I wasnt even in the middle b/p cycle?   Anyway, just try to take this confrontation with a grain of salt. I'd be surprised if that conversation actually happened.",False,False
