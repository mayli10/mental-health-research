eielhmj,t3_b0d18k,t3_b0d18k,coffeehearts,1,2019-03-12 22:13:17,/r/EDAnonymous/comments/b0d18k/former_skinny_legend_learns_to_bake_gains_20/eielhmj/,I know exactly what you mean. I made an entire coffee cake and a pie this weekend for two people like a maniac. But then I came to my senses and put half the coffee cake in the freezer and gave some away. Lots of baked goods freeze well!  Another thing I‚Äôve been doing is trying to perfect one or two recipes a month instead of going apeshit and trying out a bunch of things. I find it‚Äôs easier to say no to have just one helping if I have already had it before. Some weird part of my food fixation is the experimental aspect of trying out lots of new recipes. So that way the baking is more like ‚ÄúI baked us a dessert‚Äù and less ‚ÄúI‚Äôm a fucking food addict and I‚Äôm going to torture myself by keeping a bunch of tempting  new delicacies in every corner of the kitchen!‚Äù  I am really stressed out and I see my old patterns emerging so I‚Äôm working on listening to my body more instead of the tiny gluttonous gremlin that lives in my brain.,False,False
