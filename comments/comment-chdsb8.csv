Best example is anything by MIKA.  The songs have absolutely  nothing to do with EDs, I think it's because of their voice and the sound of the music. The artist is an incredibly  attractive gay man that I both want to hit and want to look like. And the music just sounds so light and glamorous and fun and extroverted, it sounds how I feel when I've been restricting enough to get near my LW.  There's a few other bands that make me feel that way like Electric Six and Grouplove, but MIKA is definitely at the top.",False,False
