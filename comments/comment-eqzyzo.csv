I don't struggle with purging, but from friends who have, I hear getting a stable meal plan can help (because you dont over/undereat,  and it takes stress out of the responsibilities/choice of food, thus reducing the risk of binges) it may be worth talking to a dietitian about. If you dont have access to one, there are example meal plans online that can help you create something individualized. You are strong &amp; motivated. Don't let that determination go, keep picturing you on the other side, free of the ED.",False,False
