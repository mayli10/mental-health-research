Itâ€™s like 180 cals depending on the fruit you use and the yogurt brand &amp; variety. Not too bad/scary, good protein, some good fiber (especially if you add chia seeds or something like that), and good for your gut biome. Itâ€™s also genuinely tasty and satisfying.   Iâ€™ve been wanting to try making my own yogurt in my instant pot for better probiotics and control over sweeteners and all that. Iâ€™ll have to report back on how that goes. :)",False,False

It's a bit high in fat, but it's fine in terms of nutrition and calories. Well, I take a multivitamin, but it's hard and expensive to actually eat healthy.   If I could afford to and was able to exercise I would follow a similar plan that's better. It would be around 1800-1900 calories, so no longer restricting, but I would exercise so that it would be net 1500. I would have some homemade oatmeal with maple syrup, cinnamon, an apple, a handful of almonds, and just a little blended spinach (2 tbsp) for added vitamins with an orange on the side for breakfast. For lunch I would have a Clif Builders protein bar. I know there are lower-calories bars with just as much protein, but I wanted to avoid taking supplements for everything except D3 and this bar is healthier. For dinner I would still have the McDouble combo because those things are surprisingly healthy for how little they cost and for being under 400 calories. Plus, the fries are a great source of potassium. As a snack I would make some hot cocoa with unsweetened cocoa powder and unsweetened vanilla cashew milk, but then I would actually sweeten it with a chocolate syrup. The syrup is also nice because cocoa powder clumps really easily and can be hard to mix, so using syrup reduces the amount of cocoa powder needed. It isn't as healthy as the cocoa powder though. I find the right balance to be 1.5 tbsp cocoa powder and 1 tbsp syrup in 1.5 cups milk and 0.5 cups water. For drinks I would have a meal replacement shake at some point and probably also 2 cans of diet soda and maybe even some tea before bed. I do sometimes like to make a cup of tea for myself using one ginger and turmeric tea bag and one chamomile tea bag. The ginger and turmeric tea I have is flavoured with cinnamon while the chamomile is flavoured with honey and vanilla. I don't actually like chamomile tea, but the flavours of the other 5 ingredients overpower it so it's actually a good combination. Lastly, although I said I would avoid supplements it was inevitable that if I wanted to be perfect I would need something. I already mentioned that I would take D3 because it's nearly impossible to get enough from food and I of course live in Canada where most people are D3-deficient at least during the winter if not all year. I would also use two scoops of whey protein powder. I would shoot for one with around 24g of protein per scoop. I know finding that exact amount might be tough, so I expect to find one with 21g or maybe a little more than 24g. I'm not sure if I would put both scoops in the oatmeal or if I would put one in the hot cocoa. The mug I already drink hot cocoa from just barely holds a full serving with my recipe, but a scoop of protein powder isn't big so maybe with a flavoured powder I could replace the syrup and it might work out. Or I could get a plain powder and keep the syrup. I would have to try it out. Protein powder is expensive though. I think it would be like $50 for a tub that lasts a month. Of course, I'm not even sure that my body could handle so much food, so I'll have to see what happens when I'm finally able to try this.",False,False
