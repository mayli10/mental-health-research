And 123 lbs isn’t a lot either. That wasn’t ok for her to say. Don’t worry, you’ll be fine and one little binge won’t hurt you. ",False,False

Lets just say this girl said hell no to the body fat measuring. ",False,False

We did it when I was at school, except there wasn't even the pretence of anonymity; we were supposed to get on  the scales in front of everyone. I was already developing an ED, and I'd been bullied for being fat since I was about 6 or 7.  Igot up and walked straight out of the classroom, and bunked off every lesson till the project was over. At some point my Head Of Year caught me and asked me why I wasn't in lessons. I told her the teacher was making us weigh ourselves in front of the class, and she gave me permission to skip till the following week.",False,False

I think I’ve told this story in this group before so apologies to those who have read it.   In my collage lab we were doing a project where we had to “anonymously” put our weight on a chart in front of the whole class. I was so petrified I skipped class that day and failed the assignment. Later I went to the department head and told him about my ED and how even though the numbers were “anonymous” it’s a class of 15 people. It’s pretty obvious which one is mine. He was mortified. He had the professor give the whole class an A for the project then had it removed from the curriculum for forever.   I think if I had gotten pushback on it I would have pushed the issue that I’m fairly certain it’s a HIPPA violation to require me to disclose personal health information. ,False,False
