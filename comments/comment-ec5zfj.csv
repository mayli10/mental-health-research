I'm going to work on keeping shut when it comes to food or diet or exercise of my friends or family since I don't have anything positive to say about it.  I feel like even explaining why I did this would be excusing it or down playing the rudeness, but I had no excuse to say this to her.",False,True

It was maybe a mistake in the moment but you seem genuinely caring of your friend. :) maybe you could bring it up to her just so it can be laid to rest. You could just say something like, “Hey, you know that thing I said the other day? I hope you know I didn’t mean it as shaming you. I’m sorry I just felt stressed thinking about chips and eating and what not. I didn’t mean to relate that to you.”",False,False
