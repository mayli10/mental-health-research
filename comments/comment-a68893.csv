It's worth a try, tbh it's not like she can make your situation any worse.   But rather than asking for something directly in the email, try to arrange an in-person meeting if you can (this shows you're dedicated) to explain yourself and ask if she can suggest any solutions. You might be able to re-take the final rather than the whole class. And maybe your school's mental health services can pull some strings? Because dropping from a steady 98% to a 32% looks like you have a legitimate reason for failing the final, not that you didn't try or don't understand the material.  Ugh so sorry you have to deal with all the stress! Good luck and let us know what happens &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3",False,False

It might not accomplish anything, but just an email explains the circumstances certainly can’t hurt. If you had 98% before, and explain that you were going through a tough time with your health (it’s okay be vague, or more specific if you feel comfortable) then might be willing to pass you.

So sorry this happened to you :/ try talking to your academic advisor or maybe your dean and try to explain the circumstances... maybe even say you had a panic attack or something... I’d try telling them sooner than later so they can help you move on and not have to worry about it. Good luck!! Xoxo,False,False
