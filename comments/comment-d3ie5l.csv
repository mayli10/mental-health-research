I remember going to Disney Springs for my birthday last year and I felt ugly and miserable. This year, I am going to Disney with my boyfriend for my birthday and I feel so much pressure to hit a certain pant size by then. Consistency is key. I keep the goal in mind and make positive decisions each moment to make nutritious, low cal eating choices. I am currently on a pretty small limit of calories during the week so I can still have a couple treats on the weekend and still lose weight. Eating healthy 80% or more of the time, small portions, limited or no snacking, and light exercise and strength training is my go-to to prep for the trip. I have kept it up for over a month now and have about a month left to reach the goal. Wishing you luck on the trip, I hope you will have fun. It sounds like it will be amazing and you are most lucky to be engaged!",False,False
