I drink less often, I exercise regularly, I eat healthier, I don't get hangry anymore, and I've decided to go to a psychiatrist *and actually got on meds that are seriously frickin helping.*  However, I'm constantly obsessed and stressed about the fact that I'm so afraid to gain weight. But my meds help suppress the anxiety of the stress tho so I guess it evens out ",False,False

When Iâ€™m deep in ED mode and losing weight, Iâ€™m also losing all my humor and thoughtfulness and personality. My obsession with avoiding food overwhelms all other considerations. Iâ€™m spacey and irritable and sad and scared - and skinny. When Iâ€™m in a better headspace, less ruled by my ED, those traits are still in me but theyâ€™re more muted, less intense. The change is real but itâ€™s also temporary. ",False,False

Iâ€™ve had anxiety since I was like 16/17 but didnâ€™t really understand it or focus on it if that makes sense? Around 20 yo was when I started restricting heavily and exercising excessively and occasionally purging when I binged. It was like I somehow channeled all of my anxiety into one outlet, calories in + calories out= weight loss. It was like a sure thing that I could count on and as long as I was skinny nothing else mattered. Not the smartest, funniest or prettiest girl in the room? Well I can be the skinniest. That sense of impending doom feeling that you get with anxiety could be quelled by the reassurance that Iâ€™d only eaten 800 calories everyday for the past week. Or I could just step on the scale and see the number go down or be super low and Iâ€™d feel like everything else was okay.  Itâ€™s pretty fucked up and I donâ€™t feel that way anymore. Sometimes I miss it because when my anxiety is really bad I feel all over the place and I miss having something I could rely on but obviously an ED is an extremely unhealthy coping mechanism. I definitely had really bad mood swings when I was restricting heavily and I missed a lot of important events and just nights out with friends because I wanted to stay home and exercise or something else dumb. For reference Iâ€™m 27 now, not going to waste your time with my life story for the past 7 years tho haha",False,False

Iâ€™m always thinking about food or how to get thinner. I donâ€™t feel like I have any goals anymore because my main thoughts and most of my energy goes towards changing my appearance. Iâ€™m definitely way more anxious and my forgetfulness is unbelievable at times.   Itâ€™s crazy how much this disorder makes you believe you can have it all amirite,False,False
