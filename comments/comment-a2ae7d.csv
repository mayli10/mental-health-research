Maybe it's because sharing a meal makes me so anxious - I have a history of using food as a way to cope with anxiety.",False,True

Ive always been ashamed of my binge eating and can never binge in front of people. Always do it as alone as i can. Dont want others to see whole boxes of crackers downed in like 2 minutes.   But reading on here ive now seen multiple binge eaters who enjoy eating in front of people. Thought most try to keep it a super secret..guess i was wrong,False,False

I hate that. And I like to be social by biking, indoor climbing, etc....but I get called out by my friends for that. They're all like, ""You only want to hang out if we do exercise."" And in my head I'm like, ""You only want to do stuff that involves eating and drinking!""     But I don't, I bite my tongue and go out with them and just don't drink or eat while I try to maintain a positive attitude when I don't want to be there. ",False,False
