Healthcare have just had the biggest power trip over everyone- it's been going on for years. I don't know if it'll ever stop. They're probably using techniques from Nazi Germany to brainwash people  People have had to initiate changes within their own lives divorced from traditional help to take power back over their bodies and overcome eating disorders- if that's what they want to do. It's your choice- no one is judging you for doing one thing or the other  Not everyone can do it on their own or even collectively/responsibly- it's the blind leading the blind. There are a lot of movements going on in hope to achieve this. They're unspoken because the lines of communication have been shut down  People who have the power to help and change people are abusing it. It doesn't matter what you do or don't tell your Psychologist- they're getting paid. Whoever is in charge and making decisions for everyone will do what they want to do,False,False

Happened to me after my dietitian reported on my weigh-ins, and I've never felt so completely betrayed as I'd had a history with my psychologist and didn't expect the of ultimatum she gave me.
