I’m terrified of feeling like I can’t even walk and I’m going to collapse at any given moment. I gave in yesterday and ate intuitively at dinner, but today we’re back to the same old 2 pieces of sushi with the rice picked off kind of day. Much love to you and thank you again. I’m not religious but you’ve inspired me to try and return to meditation over the weekend and see if that helps.",False,True

To be honest though, after all that I just felt worse ): the only thing that has helped snap me out of it at all recently is spending time praying and upping my calories all the way to maintenance level or higher. It feels like as soon as I try to restrict to under 500/fast even just for a couple days, I start feeling like I'm about to pass out all the time.  Also - i noticed in one of my forays toward better health last year that even after starting to consistently eat at or above maintenance, I was just as dizzy and out of it for the first few days, and it still hit me occasionally even a week or two after. I'd encourage you to press on with it - the woozy vibes do stop eventually if you stick with 1000 or more calories a day, in my experience.  Sending good vibes your way ❤️",False,False
