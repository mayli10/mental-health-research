And honestly do feel like being skinny shamed is worse. Hear me out.  I was fat. Constantly bullied for it as a kid. Constantly bullied in general (shy awkward etc) but i always figured oh if i lose weight at least they wont call me fat anymore. At least i can finally escape all the comments about my body and how constantly SELF CONSCIOUS i felt. Thats all i wanted to get away from. I wanted to be ""normal"".   Like that makes sense right? If im not fat then people have no reason to comment on my body.   BOY, that was wrong. Im sure u guys are all familiar with how NO MATTER WHAT U DO people have SOMETHING to say about your body. Even when i was a healthy weight and working out regularly (like in a recreational way not an ED way lol) people would tell me i looked anorexic and my body was (LITERALLY SOMEBODY SAID THIS TO ME) ""disgusting"". People would say this to me IN FRONT OF OTHER PEOPLE. And no one stood up for me. Because i'm skinny right. Because that must mean i have it better. Is it really bullying if youre making fun of someone for having something that is desirable?  No. Fuck that. At least when i was fat i felt like i could tell a teacher. People recognized it was fucked up. People would empathize with me. Even when i tell people how i hate being called skinny, it still feels like no one really gets what im saying. And its bullshit. I would rather be skinny vs being fat, but as far as the SHAMING itself goes, being skinny shamed, for me, is far far worse.",False,False

Absolutely not.   And while our society is adjusting to accommodate larger bodies (with 40% of the population clinically obese they didn't really have a choice), culture is still lagging behind, and stereotypes and prejudices linger.

While it feels shitty to get comments on my body, and it's definitely harassment, it would affect me *so much more* if I were called fat *because already, that's something that I don't want to be*. Not because it's negative in the eyes of those who called me such, but rather because it's negative in my eyes.  It's sort of like how I would feel if someone said ""you have horrible fashion sense"" vs ""you have horrible acne"". If I pick out my own clothes then I would be like, ""well screw you I like my clothes!"" for the first one but I couldn't be like ""well screw you I like my acne"" for the second since *I don't like the idea of having acne*.  However I also agree with u/veronica-marsx that part of it is caused by the disorder. I think a lot of skinny, non-disordered people have less extreme ""goals"" for how they want their body to look. I *want* to look ill sometimes because of the disorder. Even the notion of being called ""healthy skinny"" or ""fit"" makes me sad because I want my ED to be ""validated"" in a way.  Also for me personally part of it is gender-related; I really don't want to have larger thighs, boobs, or a butt. If being skinny leads to those things, then yay! If people said I don't have a butt I would be like ""well screw YOU for objectifying me, but it's not like I want a butt anyway"".",False,False

I do. But I think it’s colored by the disorder to an extent.  Whenever I’m “skinny shamed,” I’m mostly annoyed but some part of me is like, “This means I’m skinny so joke’s in you bucko.” I’ve always thought other skinny people felt the same. Annoyed but slightly comforted by the fact that they are skinny enough to elicit such ~jealousy~  But the crazy thing is... most thin girls I know genuinely hate being thin. It’s not talk with them. They were really bullied and hate their bodies. My best friend literally eats two bowls of oatmeal in the morning so that she’s bloated in public and she describes her flat butt as “disgusting” and says she can’t look at her back and arms without crying. I honestly think she WOULD prefer being fat. She’s constantly admiring Torrid mannequins... of course, she’s definitely not the norm, but I have three friends and two cousins who are actively overeating until they’re sick in order to “look like real women.” One of my friends in high school cut herself over the bullying she endured from being skinny.  When I was getting weighed in at MEPS, one of the girls there told me to my face she would hate to have my “body type” and then described her super perfect friend’s “smashing body.” “She’s got curves in the perfect places. She’s got huge thighs and a perky butt. And of course she’s dating a pro basketball player because she’s so insanely perfect.”  I could attribute this anecdotal evidence to California being weird as fuck (not hard to believe). But I lurk r/xxfitness, and there’s an astonishing amount of women who post before and after pictures in which I personally waaaaaay prefer the before. Like some of them were legit thinspo before they got into fitness. They think they look way better with thick legs and there’s constant posts asking how to bulk “chicken legs” and I’m out here like damn I wish I could sell you my thighs.  My point is... skinny and fat shaming aren’t on equal footing, but I don’t think the disparity is as large as we think. Our disorder distorts reality to an extent.   Idk I’ll probably get downvoted for this. I just wanna give a voice to people who genuinely have deep mental issues stemming from their hatred for their own skinniness. I recognize they don’t have the universal bad rep that fat people have. I just don’t think it’s right to minimize their abuse either.",False,False

I don't think it's really fair to say that being thin used to be the standard and so it's less valid. Centuries ago being overweight was the standard because it showed that you were wealthy and lived a lavish lifestyle. In the 1900's being skinny was treated the same way that being overweight is now in magazines and other advertisements. There were ""gain weight fast"" products just as there are now ""lose weight fast"" products. Trying to go by past beauty standards as a way to determine the impact of modern standards is just unreasonable because at some point in history every body type has been considered preferable.  I do agree however that in our current society being shamed for being thin is not nearly as bad as being shamed for being fat. It's far less prevalent, it's not institutional (*mostly meaning that doctors won't ignore you and it won't negatively impact your career*), and in some ways there are actually benefits to being thin rather than fitting the ideal beauty standard (*kind of a terrible reason, but you are less likely to be victim to misogyny or baseless slut-shaming as a thin person*). Not only that, but it's really not uncommon for people to say they still prefer thin girls over the current standard. I've never heard of a single way in which being bigger was socially beneficial. The two simply aren't comparable on any basis more than that body shaming is wrong. I've been thin my whole life and can honestly say that's never been a problem for me. My brother wasn't thin, but never overweight and I saw how that effected him. People would treat him differently because of it. You're right that I absolutely would never want to trade bodies with somebody who's fat because I've seen how much worse that is for them.",False,False

Being fat has employment and income consequences, particularly for women. Being skinny does not. Fat people are routinely subjected to sub-par medical treatment and have their health concerns minimized as just being due to their weight, as you mentioned. This is all well documented. I can shame a skinny person for their body type and do damage, but that damage will probably not be compounded by employment and medical discrimination. So while it's bad to shame a specific person for their body, regardless of their body type, skinny shaming is not nearly as systemic and isn't part of a larger system of discrimination like fat shaming is.   So like, don't be mean to someone because they're skinny, but also don't assume that getting comments on your weight when you're thin is the same as what fat people experience. (And I am aware that this distinction can be harder to make when you have an ED, but I think it's still important to make it.)",False,False

No one should be shamed for their body, regardless of what they look like, how they carry their weight, or if they're conventionally fat or skinny. But while people who are considered skinny may receive negative comments, I guarantee you none of them would be willing to switch bodies with someone who's fat, because guess what? Fat people really aren't treated well, are often the butt of jokes, and are rarely, if ever, depicted as the attractive person in media. Two people may have similar eating disorders with similar behaviors and pathologies, but the skinny person will likely get a lot more comments of ""please get help!"" and ""you're beautiful!"" and ""please eat!."" The fat person will probably be encouraged to keep doing what is clearly disordered behavior or told to modify their diet, but continue to restrict.   r/fatlogic may disagree, but honestly, life sucks so much more, just in terms of societal perceptions, when you're fat than when you're skinny. And honestly, I sincerely doubt most people actually believe that skinny shaming is just as bad as fat shaming.",False,False
