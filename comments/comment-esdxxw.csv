I said protein because that's more filling and foods high in protein are generally more nutritious, but you're right, food in general would definitely be a great step for OP right now.",False,False

And food (other than veggies or low cal food) would be good to counter this state! OP don’t feel like you have to eat certain foods now, just feel free to eat whatever you please or what you can handle, anything is better than nothing.",False,False

A cracker with some cheese on, for example, would be great. Or a portion of peas. Anything you've got with protein will help. I know saying ""jUsT sToP ReStRiCTiNg"" isn't going to help, and if you go from this to eating a lot of food it could make it worse, so start small. One cracker, with cheese. And/or one portion of veg. Hell, if the cracker is too much, even just a couple slices of cheese on their own will help. You need some of that PROTEIN in you; that's why you're getting lightheaded etc.  And ofc, if it gets worse or you can't keep any food down seek medical attention.",False,False
