When we are taught about diseases, we’re told they’re really bad because they could kill you. But then it kind of makes us associate diseases with the end-stage right before death.  I’m sorry about your triggering experience. You probably already know this but external factors like skin and hair are only one way you could be healthy or unhealthy and just because you could have had healthier-looking skin and hair doesn’t mean that you didn’t do damage to your body otherwise. You can’t tell someone’s health just by looking at them, which is why doctors won’t just look at you (that’s why X-rays, MRI, blood tests, etc exist).",False,False

Like when you say “cancer” it conjures up the image of someone on their deathbed but it’s of course possible to have cancer and go into remission. I hate it since it prevents people from getting help if their illness doesn’t seem life-threatening yet.,False,False

If you didn’t look 50 at the age of 15, you weren’t REALLY anorexic.   One thing that gave me really bad body dysmorphia was this girl on EDC who had my exact measurements — same height, same weight, though smaller hips and larger waist by like 1 inch. Same measurements. But she looked like a holocaust survivor. She had leathery skin, zero fat on her face, and her bones protruded through her skin. Her hair had mostly fallen out and she had noticeable lanugo in all her photos. She looked like the walking dead. It made me think... is my scale broken? Am I a fake anorexic? Why is she so much thinner than me? It didn’t help that I never lost my period and she had lost hers before she even got underweight.  The truth was she likely just lost weight faster than I did and thus was completely malnourished. But God I envied her. She was a real anorexic. I was just ~healthy~",False,False

My bf could guess that I weigh more or less than I do because he literally doesnt know and is terrible at guessing. I wouldnt take offense though because I know his faults. Numbers is one of them lol im pretty sure he guessed that i weighed like 100lbs before (which I'm nowhere near) and I was like ""uhhh seriously?"" You cannot tell how much someone weighs by looking at them. I *look* like I weigh less than I do, but I'm stocky so people are shocked when I tell them how much I really am.",False,False

I hate it when people say these things, even if it's unintentional.  The notion of being at an ""unhealthy weight"" is more immediately associated with being overweight than it is with being underweight. Since he could've been thinking about it like ""you aren't overweight like the girl you hate,"" it could've just come out as ""you're healthy; that girl isn't.""  Tbh I hate this mentality as well although I understand the reason for it. I know a lot of people want to be called healthy but to me it just means that I haven't done enough damage yet.",False,False

When my BMI was 14(!!!), my husband’s hyper in-shape friend (very into body recomp and uses bodybuilding strategies) came up to me and asked, “What’s your fitness routine? You are seriously the fittest woman I know.” I had not exercised ONCE. I was sedentary as fuck.   My husband’s favorite description of my body was/is, “You’re super skinny but not anorexic.” BMI 14 = not anorexic.  Even random strangers (men of course) would tell me I looked soooo ~healthy~ and fit. Again, didn’t workout once during that time. Nowadays, I workout 6x a week with a BMI of 17 (fuck the military ugh) and I get 60% less comments on how fit and healthy I am. Lol.  Moral of the story? Men have no clue what a healthy woman looks like. I think body fat contributes. I had 7% body fat at BMI 14 which I guess is low for women but high for BMI 14, so I could fool the untrained eye.",False,False

I’m literally obese, well over 200 (kill me) and guys are always like “oh yeah you’re chubby but you’re not like FAT” because I’m not a literal tub of lard  And when they see someone who’s like 400-500 pounds they’re like “wow!! I bet she weighs like 200 pounds!!!!” And it’s like bruh what? Do you know what numbers mean??  All this to say that to them girls either weigh like 120 (if they’re thin), 150 (if they’re chubby) or 200 (if they’re morbidly obese) because boys literally have no idea what any of those weights look like on anyone.",False,False
