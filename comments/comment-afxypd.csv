I'm just glad she's not üòÇ Maybe my bf prefers thicker women too. I remember telling him I liked a corset I was wearing because it made me look skinnier than I am,  and he just smiled at me and told me I don't need to be skinnier. I just took it as a sweet compliment but still disagreed lol. And when I told him how much more I wanted to lose,  he said there would be nothing left of me.  So my awesome logical  brain tells me to lose weight to be super tiny so I'm ""better"" than his ex who I think I'm already better than,  even though he loves me the way I am.  Why am I like this lol",False,True

She's not gorgeous but not super unattractive either and I find myself wishing she was fatter and uglier lmao just so I could feel like I'm waaay better than her, not just a little bit better. But then again I've never seen her in person, I kind of wish we'd run into her while we're out somewhere that she and him used to go,  just so I can see if she's one of those people who doesn't look as good in person as she does in pics.  Maybe she looks even heavier in person. He did let me have some of her old clothes that she left behind,  and I couldn't take the jeans because they were several sizes too big for me.
