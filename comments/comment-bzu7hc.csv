I wear maxi skirts almost exclusively in the summer. I actually get a lot of compliments on my skirts, people think it's cute and feminine and they have no idea that I'm not wearing them to cultivate a feminine aesthetic but because I hate wearing shorts.",False,False

I've found good options at Lane Bryant or Torrid. There are also a ton of online options, even fashion nova curve has options.  The big thing to know is that you are being way harder on yourself than anyone else. You know when you see overweight individuals at the gym? No one is thinking wow that person is so overweight and shouldn't be here. They're thinking way to go! Our thoughts about ourselves are always much meaner than the thoughts of those around us.   Be happy, wear shorts! Find some comfy ones that you feel good in and wear them! And lastly be nice to yourself!  You got this!",False,False
