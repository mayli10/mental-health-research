I got real into the control that OMAD provides. I never thought that you could be anorexic unless you were already underweight. But after putting weight on again twice since then, the way I feel when I remember how thin I was and how guilty I feel for eating and doing this to myself and have to look in the mirror every day and being reminded of it, I realized that it’s not about being healthy physically, it’s about the obsession with food and/or avoiding it. My whole day revolves around food.",False,False

Eating disorders affect people of all sizes, and eating disorder behaviours are serious problems regardless of weight. Are you able to speak to a doctor or therapist about this? They may be able to help you on a path of recovery, which you deserve regardless of weight.",False,False
