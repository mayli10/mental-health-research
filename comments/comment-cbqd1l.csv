I remember chatting with my older brother about drug education in schools and how a classmate of mine remarked ""They make the high sound good, how is this supposed to be discouraging drug abuse"" and my brother pointed out ""Yeah, but if they lie, then you will discover the lie and think that the stuff about the dangers will be false too."" Same thing. Everything has to be transparent.",False,False

The study also found that the people who had bigger binges topped out at absorbing 1,200 Calories. Most people had like 1,000 Calorie binges and absorbed like 500 Calories iirc, which would technically explain the “50%” statistic, but the more you binge, the more you can purge, so that number goes down a lot.  I also remember the biggest binger topping out at about 3K Calories, which honestly, to me, seems like nothing lmao.  Only so much can go through your intestine at a time, so yeah, pulling a 5-7K binge would have deflated that statistic drastically. It really is a scare tactic.  I always look at the study and go like “lmao, who calls 1,200 Calories an objective binge to study BN?” but I suppose if I was being watched, I wouldn’t eat that much either, not to mention the fact that if I try to force a binge while not being dissociated, I can’t numb out the pain of my stomach being stretched too far.",False,False

You're right it obviously isn't as cut and dry as I've simplified it to be :) AFAIK glucose gels are absorbed via oral mucosa + in small intestine since it is swallowed afterall, which is how glucose gels could still work for diabetics (although tbh we're still split on the efficacy of glucose gels with some organisations advocating for them, and others recommending against them). This is in comparison to something like a buccal glucose spray which is mainly by oral mucosa.  I came across [this 2009 study](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/38030945_Impact_of_buccal_glucose_spray_liquid_sugars_and_dextrose_tablets_on_the_evolution_of_plasma_glucose_concentration_in_healthy_persons) that suggests that buccal glucose spray (oral) are ineffective at increasing plasma glucose as opposed to glucose gels (oral + intestinal), but this is nitty gritty stuff haha.

Anecdotally, I went from a normal weight (didnt weigh myself back then but it was about BMI 21 - 22) to BMI 16 in one summer by b/ping 3-4x a day on high-sugar junk   According to my (very rough) calculations I absorbed about 200-300 kcal a binge if I purged exactly one hour after my first bite  Either way, I get why they tell us that because its an extremely addictive and damaging thing to do :(",False,False
