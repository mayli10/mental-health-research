I never get scared of things like pictures or autopsy reports - you could show me a livestream of a brutal drug cartel beheading or something, and I wouldn't care. But this hits home. I've been so full I legitimately couldn't breathe, food came up unchewed right after I swallowed, and it felt like I needed to vomit, but I couldn't. It has happened multiple times. Sometimes it was with family, and they kept encouraging me to eat more. Sometimes I won't be able to escape from it. This video is going to stop me from bingeing, 100%. But fuck if I don't have nightmares for the rest of the week. I need a hand to hold and someone to cuddle.  I wouldn't wish this on anyone.",False,False

Her body is bruised &amp; she is leaning/slouched over the toilet bowl. You can’t see her face but it’s very graphic.   The video itself is great and if you don’t want to see the image there is a big warning right before she puts the image on the screen and if you skip past you won’t have to see it but if you’d rather not take the risk then that makes sense - its not something that you can unsee.
