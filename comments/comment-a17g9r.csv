I eat around my family any chance I get just so I dont tip them off that I restrict or purge. Same with my friends. They gave no clue and when they ask how I'm losing i just tell them I'm exercising and watching my calories! ,False,False

Enjoying the social aspect of eating is important to me, and I can plan my week around it to accommodate it. I don't pay close attention to calories / try to choose low cal options either. I just eat what I want as an omad.  Surprise food from others is a whole different story. I can eat 'normally' for days on end when I visit my family, but freak out over one impulsive lunch with a friend. ",False,False

On Thanksgiving I ate as much as anyone else there and just didn't eat the next day.

When I go to dinner at someone's house or eat out, I don't like disappointing people and also don't want people to ask questions/think I'm not eating enough, so I eat normally.

If I know I have plans that night, I’ll do OMAD and get soup and a low cal app or salad. It’s always nerve-wracking but it’s the only way I can keep my cover.  Restaurant dependent, I can feel moderately alright about it, and even before the advent of my ED, I would generally exclusively order appetizers because I liked them better than actual plates, so it’s never aroused any suspicion. I’m grateful for that. I’m just hoping people are picking up on the fact that I’m ordering two things instead of the fact that the two things aren’t particularly calorie dense.",False,False

I always have this weird feeling like I must be ""faking it"" or don't really have a problem because I love eating out and it doesn't scare me (as long as it's only occasionally).   It works out fine tbh because:  a.) it usually only ends up being once a week max that it's like, a restaurant thing with big portions/super calorie dense foods,   b.) I am either alone or with my boyfriend during meal times otherwise, and he knows I'm ""dieting,"" so saying things need to be lower calorie/smaller portions doesn't seem weird...so I can either heavily restrict or avoid eating pretty easily the majority of the time,   and c.) I just restrict a lot as my usual mode of operation/for the rest of the week so that my weekly calories even out to 700-900 ish daily on average.   I don't struggle with binge eating either, so that helps too—it's always planned and controllable, and I just compensate by restricting accordingly. I'm lucky that I don't have fear around these situations and have a, uh...""system"" that works for me I guess, but it does make me feel like a fraud sometimes (like ""shouldn't you *not* want to get dinner??"" etc.).
