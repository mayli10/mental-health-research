I'm antsy trying to eat any of it because it's not one of my known foods and hate guesswork + hunger.  I grabbed a gram listing I saw online off of fatsecret for some unknown homemade beef and vegetable soup which may have been too high because I was ravenously hungry so today I tried using the once recipe I know for sure which was a taco soup from Weight Watchers way back when that I made with a family member. That soup involved 3 cans of pinto beans, a can of corn or two and a pound of 80% lean beef with some peppers. I'm guessing the taco soup is about the same amount of calories if not more then the soup my grandfather made. It's actually a decent soup and has some heat to it without being too spicy. I just don't want to gain weight or stall because of the soup but with the way the grocery situation is for me it's a better bet to try and stick with it compared to other anxiety inducing things in the house.",False,False

Apparently it’s going to be okay and the estate agent is going to try and sort it. She says she’s 90% sure it’ll be fine but I’m petrified.  I can’t afford anywhere else and if I move back into my parents, I have to give up my cat. She’s literally the only thing keeping me alive anymore and I don’t know what to do.   I want to sleep so that it’s tomorrow and the estate agent will get back to me about a new tenancy agreement but I’m petrified. I don’t know what I’ll do. I’ll have to leave straight away and I have nowhere to take my cat. I can give her to friends as I don’t think their cats will like her and I’m petrified she’ll hate me.   Today has been literal hell and in this state of mind I’m just tired of still breathing. I just wish she’d done things properly. I asked her 5 years ago, “do I need to be on the agreement” and I asked several times, it was always fine. Now it’s super illegal and I don’t know what is going to happen. I can’t stop panicking and I just don’t know what I’m going to do. I can’t give up my cat, she’s the only reason I didn’t end my life earlier this year. But I’ll have nowhere to go, and if I take her to my parents she’ll just get hit by a car. She’d have to stay locked upstairs and that’s not fair.  I know it’s probably all going to be okay.

I made this account specifically to rant about this because I have no one else I can go to right now. I don't want to disappoint my family by admitting that I've barely eaten in two days. I know I need to suck it up and tell them and figure out a plan to keep going despite my lack of motivation, but it's so difficult. The worst part is that it's not even about my weight. I just don't want to eat. I hate the chore of preparing multiple meals every day, I hate my stomach feeling bloated, I hate second guessing every last thing that I eat because even after months that stupid fucking voice in the back of my head ranting about calories and macros and micronutrients won't shut the fuck up. It's so much easier to just fast all day and come home and eat a single piece of toast and lie in bed watching youtube videos.   In the beginning of this whole recovery attempt I honestly missed food and enjoyed getting to eat all the things I'd cut out, but now I feel like I've got that out of my system and it's like my body is ready to restrict again. I feel broken, like I've ruined myself for ever being able to eat normally for longer than a few weeks. Seriously, how do normal people do it? I feel like all the recovery inspiration I see is aimed at people who love food and eating despite their disorder. What happens when you don't?   I'm sorry for just barging in and dumping all of this nonsense, but it feels really good to at least articulate in some way.",False,False
