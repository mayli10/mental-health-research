I left without anything and cried in my car.   I also wanted recognition for being small but once it started happening and people started making comments or asking questions it was so humiliating.   I thought I would feel good enough and loved if people noticed how sick I was and wanted to help me. But really I ended up just feeling like an outcast and a freak that nobody knew how to talk to. They just watched the train wreck that was me and didn’t try to intervene. Very lonely times.,False,False
