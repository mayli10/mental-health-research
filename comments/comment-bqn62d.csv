I am very suspicious that I gave myself a bezoar from too much psyllium husk and not enough water (kill me pls). I'm gonna try 3L of diet Coke + 2000CU cellulase per day to dissolve that since that's a common remedy (supported by NIH research) but if it doesn't clear up I might have to go to the doctor.   So if you're having this problem and have been fucking around with psyllium husk this might be your issue. :///,False,False

I like the brand enzymedica digest gold, and I use it exclusively, so i can’t vouch for any other brands.   But the enzymes help me whenever I’ve overeaten or eaten something I’m sensitive to. I had some serious ibs when I first tried going through recovery, and the enzymes straight up cured all of my gastro problems. I just had to take two enzymes with every single meal.",False,False
