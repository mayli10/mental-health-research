I made sure that I ate a meal before and then had a snack before I went to sleep.  I know it sucks having to eat but I tell myself if I’m going to drink I have to unless I wanna ruin everyone’s time and have to get taken to the hospital.  I don’t drink often but when I do alcohol quiets down the ED voice. It doesn’t get rid of it but it helps. A LOT,False,False
