My chest literally hurt for almost a week. I thought about her every single day for months. In the beginning I thought I'll never get over it. But then I realized every day I think less of her, and then I would think about her every few days, and so on. Now when I think about her I don't feel any pain. I just had to accept it wasn't working and it's better off this way. I know it's stupid but it does get better. Give yourself time. I wish I could help, but I can't. Surround yourself with friends, go out. Cry, watch a nice movie, keep yourself occupied a little bit. Hang in there ❤️",False,False

I'm mentally such a fragile person, so being in love feels like having my head on a guillotine.  I don't have any groundbreaking tips, only the cliche ones that actually did help for me last time I was getting over someone. First I hid them on all social media and forbid myself from ever checking their profile. ""Out of sight, out of mind"" actually works after some time. The second thing is to stay busy and hang out with people who care about you.  The only thing that actually heals you though, is time.",False,False
