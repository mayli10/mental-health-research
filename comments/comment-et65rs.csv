They are my favorite cookies, Russian tea cakes, the best cookie in existence. I love them they are the only cookies I make.   But because I was lazy I rolled them big this time and once I went back and looked at the recipe and did the math, I realized they were WAY more calories than I wanted or intended &gt;!200 per cookie!&lt; . So now I have to limit myself to one a day. Last time I made them I ate them all over the course of two nights. I specifically put them in the cabinet because if I see them out I will eat them all.",False,False

I love making pretty much any food, but desserts in particular are nice. I like the process of making them and being able to think about food and be with it without the threat of having to actually eat it. And I like watching people eat the things I make. That's partially like living vicariously through them, but I think part of it is also me knowing they are okay and won't be hungry for a few hours at least",False,False

I love the process of making things, but I always get this feeling of dread when I think about actually eating it. I typically allow myself a piece or two and then I let other people eat the rest. Sometimes I like making things for others that I wouldn’t personally eat myself cuz then I can just give it all away",False,False
