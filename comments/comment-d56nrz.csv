Some can manifest in different ways than most think. Body dysmorphia is probably the most likely- but again, without being a registered psychologist, we can only give it a temporary name and fight the way we find on our own.   Again, if it’s effecting you to the point of stopping you from living life- *it’s real* and it’s *serious*. No-one will doubt you; and if they do, they’re not worth talking to.",False,False

If body dysmorphia isn’t accurate enough, then idk what would be. I bet the majority here thinks I don’t have it, and that I’m just being a teen. If I don’t have body dysmorphia, then idk what I even would have. My bad body image interfering with my daily life to the point where I can’t function properly, because I’m scared anybody will see me. I feel like not going to school for a year, and skipping school days the years prior, thus ruining my whole education, is serious.  If I don’t have it and me feeling like this is just a character trait or an “oh well everyone hates their body to some degree” bad/just inconvenient opinion, idk what I would do. I bet the majority thinks I just don’t like my body as most teens and that’s it. Or that I’m faking it to put a fancy name on myself. Or me trying to be a part of a community so badly I’m self diagnosing myself for no reason.",False,True

If you are having issues with something to the point it’s effecting your life, then it is a real, actual problem.   “Self-diagnosis” is only a problem if you run around acting as if that is absolutely what you have, and generally it’s only an issue (in my experience) or “attention-seeking” if you’re using it as an excuse and feeding into it. (eg, “I’m depressed!” And proceeding to wallow and seek pity).   A self-diagnosis like this is a *start*. You have an idea of what you’re struggling with, and your struggles are *real*. It can help give a name to the monster and help you overcome it and find ways to cope. And obviously, going to a professional is the best way to go about it. They could even figure out something that’s more accurate than body dysmorphia and give you much better tools to work with when dealing with it. In my personal experience, my doctors are fine with me coming in and telling them “I think I might have this, here are the symptoms I feel match up with it. Is there something else it could be? How can I get help for these issues that are getting in the way of my life?” Rather than “I have this. I will not consider having anything else.”  It sounds like this weighs heavily on you, so don’t let yourself get in your own way of progress. If self-diagnosing helps you move forward, then there’s absolutely zero issue with it. You definitely don’t seem like you’re seeking any sort of attention- only help.",False,False
