I do try to tell myself I eat alright, but then I fear that i’ll exploit the reassurance and start binging unhealthily (As in 2500 and up)  I just wish I wasn’t thinking about food so much.   I went to the toilet and body checked and tried to tell myself it’s not so bad. My boyfriend does tell me i’m perfect just the way I am just i’m afraid he might be lying because he doesn’t get irritated by me calling myself fat and it’s as if he’s trying to distract me from an alleged (by my brain) fact",False,True

Focus on the wall in front of you, try to get your thoughts off your body and on the wall. Keep breathing nice and gentle.   You're doing great. Eating 1400 kcals is not only good and reasonable, it's amazing and you deserve as much every day. Your ED lies. Your current weight is irreproachable.   You can cry. Get it all out. Then take a moment to compose yourself, think about how lovely you already are, even if you're not where you wish you were.   Take care, I'm proud of you for seeking help when you need it.",False,False

I know it might not help you but something that helps me is to repeat to myself that ""nobody s thinking about me the way I'm thinking about me"" because it's true. I never walk around thinking about other people's weights unless I'm really deep into ED behavior. Most days I will walk around and find curvy girls very attractive.   Today is a day for love and self love. Make sure to nourish yourself well and enjoy your date. Try your hardest to sweep any of those negative feelings into the dust. I'm sure your date would find confidence sexy no matter what size you were. My boyfriend stared dating me a year ago in 3 days, when I was 160 something lbs and never once commented negatively about my weight. Even though I weigh 30ish lbs less now he really doesn't care and said he honestly didn't notice I was loosing until other people pointed it out. Much love xxx",False,False
