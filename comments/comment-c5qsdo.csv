I've gained the weight back but I also have Seroquel to thank for that. I just started keto again in hopes of losing 30lbs it helped me lose 80lbs before.,False,False

Now that I can eat fairly normally without gaining (I actually seem to be losing, and I'm not counting calories, so it's a win-win), I don't find the scale to be anxiety inducing at all!",False,True

I have it too, and for a few years after I was diagnosed, I had given up hope of losing any weight and stopped trying, thinking it would be impossible... but then I met my now-wife, and she has it too! But she had an eating disorder and managed to maintain a low-healthy weight despite the hypo... so I realized it was totally possible for me to lose weight too. And now that shes on medication, she can eat more without worrying as much about gaining too.   &amp;#x200B;  One tip they don't always tell you about the medication... yes, you have to wait an hour to eat, but you have to wait *four hours* before AND after taking it, to eat or take anything containing iron or calcium, or it will inhibit absorption of the hormone. And many things are fortified with those, especially breakfast foods, so watch out. Don't take any vitamins in the morning containing those, take them in the evening. They didn't tell me this for the first year, I found out from my pharmacist like a year into it, when my dosage kept being increased cause it wasn't working. I probably had been fucking it up lol.",False,False
