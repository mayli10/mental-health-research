I was with an emotionally and sexually abusive partner for 7 years, who cheated on me the whole time (hooray for self worth issues), and who was a feeder, making me fatter to keep me from leaving him. After breaking up with him over two years ago, I was all kinds of set on dating for a while. I wasn’t ready to get close to anyone, or god forbid, have someone see me naked?! But then I ran into someone from my school days, and things progressed. We both have some body image issues, but this person constantly tells me and makes me feel that I’m beautiful and worthy of happiness. We put each other first and are going very slowly. I finally got my libido back as well and it has been very satisfying having a partner who wants to please you as much as you want to please them. We’re in this crazy person, recovery from mental illness game together, and it’s extremely rewarding.",False,False
