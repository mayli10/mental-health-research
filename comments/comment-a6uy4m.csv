That's why it was removed from the diagnostic criteria. Hell, I get my period right up until my BMI drops below 14. Not too long ago I was purging 8+ times a day, every day, had multiple hospital stays in a single summer, and was *still* getting my period. I have an aunt who's been anorexic for 20 years and still managed to have four kids. Nobody's worst is less worst just because they have a particularly persistent reproductive system.  ",False,False
