But hey, I'm no dietition or therapist so I don't know. It's just my personal opinion as someone who is also trying to recover from an ED.",False,False

She might be trying to help you become aware of hunger/fullness cues to prevent any other symptoms from arising on your recovery path. However, bringing everything to her attention will help her understand the way that you interpret her advice.",False,False

When I would tell her that I ate junk food/sweets or that I ate a lot of food and I didn't 100% indicate that I was physically hungry in the moment, she'd ask why I ate the sweets to make sure it wasn't emotional eating. She's fine with me eating sweets, just in moderation I suppose.  I had to get an AN diagnosis for insurance reasons. I don't think she fully realizes that there's still a lot of compulsions that haven't been addressed and that I could pretty easily just slip back into things even though my weight is ""normal"" now. I still feel pretty fat and like I need to lose this weight, this is my HW.",False,True

Most of what I was eating was junk food since I was trying to listen to my body, but those cravings were starting to taper down and that was when I started relapsing. It's pretty confusing since everyone around me has basically said the same thing with ""don't eat junk food all the time, you need to start exercising, you need to eat healthier"", etc.",False,True

This sounds like someone who has never worked with patients with eating disorders. I would personally stop seeing her and find a dietitian that aligns with your recovery values. My dietitians would take me out to dessert because they knew how afraid I was of eating a dessert, and they would call me out if I ate exclusively ""health-conscious"" foods.   Despite the lack of DSM V classification for orthorexia, it is very real. That dietitian should not be working with patients with eating disorders if they are going to give those types of suggestions. Everything is okay in moderation, and I hope that you can find your way back toward recovery.",False,False

If you want to eat sweets, eat them. Of course you will eat 'healthy' foods as well but as long as you are getting enough calories and nutrition and you feel good, then you are doing the right thing. Some people don't realise that a comment like that is all it takes to send you spiraling back into your eating disorder. Honestly, this person may be a good dietician but they are no psychologist. Keep going. Listen to your body and give it fuel when it's asking for it.",False,False
