I freaked out so much about the new meal plan that I just ate tons and tons of nuts and seeds and granola and then threw it all up and it was so painful. I'm so exhausted of all this. I told my friend I had no mental energy for a conversation and then he told me some really bad news he just got, and I just felt super extra shitty because I can barely even handle my own life and i dont know how to handle the news he gave me. I'm so so tired. And then he said that he would ""hijack your *(as in, my)* ability to escape concrete change, mark my *(his)* words, coward üòù"" basically force me to change. He has been jokingly calling me a coward a lot, when I am too stressed to eat more. Well. This is what happened when I tried. I'm so fucking fuzzy headed. Already decided I'm skipping classes tomorrow. Gonna get really really high. And then just walk all day around the whole city and fast.",False,True

I hate it when people try to talk me into eating. Like hey, I know it'll taste good, dude. You don't need to convince me. People don't get it a lot of the time and I'm so sorry you're dealing with this.  If you're up to it, please consider telling your friends how their comments are affecting you. Sometimes all you need is communication. If they don't listen, they're not really your friends.   Sending love and good wishes for your new meal plan ‚ù§Ô∏è you can do this!",False,False
