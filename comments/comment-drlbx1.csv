I sometimes do electrolyte packets to add to my day, which get depleted from your body when you fast. That’s potassium, sodium and magnesium generally.   Also, not a necessary inclusion but one I really enjoy, is finding a protein powder with added greens/nutrients. I like the Garden of Life meal powder. It’s still very low cal but has a ton of nutrients to help make up for... not eating lol.",False,False

If you doing it for any amount of time longer than 1 day or so this is key! Also if you take any supplements/ medication that requires food after your shake is the best time to take it.   Straight up sea salt + potassium + lemon juice + water is a life saver. Not getting in enough salt can make feel like utter shit.   The important thing is to listen to your body. If you feel like you should stop, feel faint, can’t sleep, super foggy or very sleepy it’s time to break the fast. You can always learn and try another one with tweaks another time.",False,False

A good low sodium brand is The Miso Master. Gets me through a fast. Also, raw cacao (powder) mixed with lion's mane mushroom (powder) and maca is really really good when you're restricting a lot. Lots of magnesiummm",False,False

At least one a day. They are low cal and will seriously save your body and your hair. If you’re going to do a low calorie diet you need at least some nutrition. I can’t recommend anything else than that.,False,False

I stick to a fuckload of water, tea, and coffee. Others incorporate broth. Some do protein shakes. Some do those drinkable soups. Everyone has a different idea of liquid fasting. For some it's keeping calories as low as possible if any (water fasting). For others it just means what ever calories you consume are in liquid form.",False,False
