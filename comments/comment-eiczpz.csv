I can sense in a weird way your mom's approach because I'm watching my own go thru it with my sibling in a different way.  Take care of yourself. You know what's good for you.,False,False

I really just personally wouldn't consider ice cream a meal.   I can empathize knowing that means something entirely different to me than it does to you. Your battle was not disclosed in your OP.   I had a weird thing about 10 years ago where I nearly died... I lost about 40 lbs (as a 22M) in less than a month. I should have realized at the time. Literally, they opened me up and pulled everything out to save me... Its an ironic thing in comparison- me worrying more about losing weight than gaining it.  I apologize, again...",False,False

Anything that has calories and is chewable is food. I‚Äôm just pissed  how this had no payout for me. They always tell you in recovery to ‚Äútry ‚Äú; and this is what I get. It‚Äôs fucking awful and that‚Äôs why anorexics like me are stuck in a fucking rut of not wanting to recover.,False,True
