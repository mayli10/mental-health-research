You have so much you're dealing with right now, and for as much as you may be afraid, or ashamed, or lonely right now, the first step is absolutely to look out for current and future you -- and filling your meds is a good start to that.

It makes it so easy to accidentally torch your life to ashes, and not just easy, but tempting.  Sending hugs your way. ❤️",False,False
