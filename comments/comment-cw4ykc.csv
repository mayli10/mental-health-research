Puberty made it even worse. Being 80lbs at age 12, and then 130lbs at age 13?   By the time I was 14 I was at 150, maxing out at 155. I always remember having a stomach. I would sneak spoonfuls of peanut butter at night, or make myself baked potatoes loaded with mayo and butter. I remember just eating because I was hungry and not thinking about calories. My mom was always on me about my weight so it shamed me into eating less. She would never keep sweets around, so the little sweet stuff that was around, I‚Äôd binge.   By the time I was 17, I managed to be 125lbs and 5‚Äô4. This was me being left to eat to my own devices. I was active too, walking everywhere. Then I got my first boyfriend, and suddenly all the restricted foods like pop, McDonald‚Äôs, cookies and chocolate were just at my fingertips. I went ham. Shot up to 175lbs but I had some sort of body dysmorphia where I didn‚Äôt see the weight gain. My size 4 jeans not fitting anymore? Whatever; just buy a bigger size! Back then I didn‚Äôt care about weight gain!  Broke up with the guy about a year later. Still overweight, but still got attention from guys so I didn‚Äôt see a problem. But I remember seeing a photo of me at the amusement park. Wow. I was actually fat and I saw it. So I started losing weight the natural way, just eat less and exercise more. I lost about 10lbs in a month and people noticed. They were happy for me.   The moment my ED clicked in me was being made fun of, publicly for finally realizing how fat I was. Having your crush go upto you and pinch your arm fat in a huge group of guys? And congratulate you for ‚Äúfinally losing some god damn weight‚Äù ? Fuck I cried for ages. I felt like I was humiliating myself by being fat. And I vowed to never be considered fat by anyone ever again.   That‚Äôs how my first round of ED, I lost 50lbs in 3 months. Had a relapse where work stressed me out too much so I lost another 20lbs. And now I‚Äôm at the weight where I‚Äôm at now. Losing weight made me feel amazing. I felt powerful when I was able to fast for 4 days at a time and only eat on weekends. I was the ‚Äúskinny girl who ate real food‚Äù stereotypes on the weekends.  And now I‚Äôm underweight, still see the fat girl and chasing that dragon. People honestly treat me better now that I‚Äôm skinny. People actually want to hang out with me and be my friend. They care about my feelings. I never want to let go",False,False

I spent too much of my childhood envying the girls who could hunch over sat down and not have their stomach look like uncooked dough attached to their abdomen. Or the girls who didnt need a cardigan or jacket handy for ""after they ate"" if they ate that day to hide the stomach bloat.   I'm finally getting there, and I appreciate it so much more than I'm sure they ever did/will because I can remember what it was like to have to tense my stomach every time I sat and plan outfits around what made which part of me buldge the least. When I get dressed, when I can wear any of my clothes, I know I did that to and for myself. While they may have gotten that feeling naturally, I worked for it, which (I hope) makes it all the sweeter. Or Splanda, I guess.",False,False
