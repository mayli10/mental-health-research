He has literally said ""I just forget on purpose so that I dont have to deal with the pain of missing you"" (as in missing seeing me in person) except he said that while we were still dating and now he said he is trying to not do that. The problem is, if I do something and dont tell him till later (like days or weeks later) he will say i lied to him by not telling him. But a lot of the time he will just ignore it when i do tell him  Ugh. Idk. He says shit like ""now that I've lost you i know just how much i need you in my life"" but I dont feel supported very often. Idk idk. I'm so whiny and stupid",False,True

Perhaps you could discuss some helpful tips for him, like sending cute pictures, some help care tips, or just some emojis immedietly after reading the message to know he's listening and there for you and will speak you to about this later (or just in case he forgets).   It can be hard to know what to do or how to handle mental illness, especially when they don't understand the mental and physical toll that purging had. I'm also sorry you felt that way and can promise, you are not a burden to the person you love.",False,False
