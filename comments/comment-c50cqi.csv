I was chubby growing up (I loved chocolate and peanut butter, turns out I’m intolerant to both now anyway, hah) and my family had a wedding to attend. So my mom decided to make me go on walks with her and limit my portion sizes. Which sounds fine, except that she’d half my food intake and would walk much faster than me until I was crying trying to keep up. I was, what, 10? 11?  Finally when I was a teenager I developed my first “full on” ED, ana, from how my mom taught me to restrict. Yikes.",False,False

For me, yea definitely, my dad had depression my whole life (he said it started basically the day I was born, thanks dad...), and I'm not sure if he was anorexic at one point but he was extremely skinny.   He would berate me everyday for eating and call me fat, he would criticise my mum for eating and tell her ""you've had enough"". I remember he would get annoyed at me looking at myself in the mirror and told me I was weird for doing so while brushing my teeth. My family's nicknames for me were literally Number 3 (third child), and a variation of the word Pig - I was a normal sized kid the entire time and I'm average in looks, but it's lead to deeply ingrained body dysmorphia and I can barely look at myself without being disgusted in every way.  I think he treated me like that because of his own upbringing and I don't hate him for it, but dang it really hurts. In a way I hope he knows how much he fucked me up mentally, but then that's a heavy burden and I love him too much for that (even if I don't like him).",False,False

My Dad had very high standards for me which I internalised and has PTSD and could be unpredictable, hence my eating disorder coming along as a way of creating safety for myself.",False,False
