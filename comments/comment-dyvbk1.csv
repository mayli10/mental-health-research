I have some that I wear on occasions (or would if I wasn’t too fat for them) but wearing them everyday can cause problems with everything shifting. Honestly, I’m not sure how much damage but when I looked into it I was an amateur aerialist so needed my core as strong as it could be. If you are going to wear corsets then decide if you just want to wear them as a fashion piece or if you’re going for tight lacing, which visibly changes the shape of your body over time. Do your research and get a decently fitting corset, which you will need to take measurements for. If it hurts, ease into it and don’t start at the tightest you can stand. Eating and drinking in them is weird. As I’ve only worn mine for occasions and stuff I have no personal experience eating in one but some gave me a soda at a photo shoot and it made me incredibly gassy - glamorous!",False,False
