At first I thought we would just eat at some buffet where I can just choose my own food - so I wasn't that worried. But it seems like we'll mostly eat ""normal"" restaurant meals where I can't change anything (and we all know how um.. healthy restaurants are).   Lmao I'm sorry I'm no help.  Sorry I'm just kinda scared too, this is the longest cruise I've ever been on and idk what to do.",False,False

I‚Äôm sorry üòí  If it makes you feel any better, the serving sizes on my last cruise were a lot more reasonable than I had remembered them being a few years ago. Maybe it‚Äôs just my imagination but I do think they‚Äôve decreased at least a little bit.",False,False

My parents are going to force me to eat at both and buffet and the formal restaurant for EVERY meal. And they expect me to clean the plate otherwise they get angry that I waste food and make them look bad. That‚Äôs what I‚Äôm really worried about, plus the serving sizes are so big. ",False,True

And idk about the ship you‚Äôll be on, but at least the ones I go on have a sports deck with basketball courts, ping pong tables, mini golf (ok, not the worlds greatest workout, but still better than just sitting around), rock climbing wall, a track for walking/jogging, etc.   As for food, are you going to eat in the more formal dining room or the buffet? For the formal dining room, there are always ‚Äúlight‚Äù options listed on the menu, and you can also request a bunch of veggie sides instead of an entree (which I do whenever I don‚Äôt like the vegetarian meal of the day). For the buffet, there are always healthy options hidden between all the junk. I wasn‚Äôt actively restricting the last time I went on a cruise, but my intake wasn‚Äôt all that high just because I ended up filling up so much in the healthier stuff that there wasn‚Äôt much room left for the rest of it. It‚Äôs definitely possible to get through the week without gaining.  I know how hard it is to be surrounded by so much food when that‚Äôs literally all you can think about, but try to focus on having fun with your family, go to some activities/entertainment, do some sightseeing, and remember that it‚Äôs just one week. It seems like a big deal right now, but in the grand scheme of things it‚Äôs really not. I promise.",False,False

Walk everywhere, never take the elevator, and work out in the gym first thing every morning! I lived off of salad and fruit and alcohol and had a blast!(And my room steward commented on me working out every day, then awkwardly said he liked my body, haha!)  You totally got this! Just because the food is there, doesn‚Äôt mean you have to eat it. And honestly, people watching discouraged me nicely from eating (that‚Äôs mean and I‚Äôm sorry I‚Äôm a person who thinks that way).  I was also able to get away with bringing a travel scale‚Äîwhich is how I know I reached a new low weight! ",False,False
