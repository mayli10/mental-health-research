And a lot of women don’t think they need to lose weight or maybe they just become comfortable at a higher weight. Plus a lot of people gain way more weight than necessary during pregnancy because they use it as an excuse to overeat. Like I think you only need to gain 20-30 lbs but a lot of people gain double that.  Afterwards, they might try to diet once and fail because they’re not counting calories correctly, or they think they can lose weight just by going to the gym. Then they think it’s impossible to lose weight after trying once or twice and never try again. I also think when you’re staying at home you might be the one doing all the cooking and it can be isolating and stressful which will lead to more overeating.",False,False

But definitely obese people staying inside didn’t even cross my mind.",False,True

It usually happens because people gain too much weight during pregnancy and then they don’t know how to lose weight afterwards or think they can’t. Plus people tend to use food to cope with stress and you get stressed out a lot more when you have kids or from work. I think obesity and overweight rates are much lower for young people, especially teenagers. A lot of people play sports when they’re young and then stop playing them during/ after college and put on a lot of weight because they don’t change their eating habits. The other thing is you won’t see obese people as much because a lot of them stay at home most of the time due to limited mobility.   I will say as someone from the west coast I noticed that there were way more fat people in Florida. I don’t think Florida is that different from the rest of the south.",False,False

You end up noticing something specific more than others because that’s what your brain picks up on more than other things, even if it’s not that prevalent. Especially if it’s something new to you (ie, recent switch to ED mindset or in general, thinking more about thin people).",False,False

Also this is from 18-up and people tend to gain in their 30s, 40s and 50s. So the women you notice and meet are the ones your age and they are under the average.",False,False
