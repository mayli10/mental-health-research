I was relieved but at the same time worried about my bone health since I went so long without a period. But at this point, I find it hard to care about that when I don’t even know if my bones are in bad shape. ",False,True

The one I'm in is Microgynon 30, so maybe talk to your doctor about trying that one.  It's not explained how they caused it in general, and I think doctors do a disservice by not doing that.  Some can cause increase in appetite or water retention. Just stick to watching calories and keeping hydrated, keep up with vitamins and electrolytes and it should prevent that.  It shifts your body into thinking it's pregnant, which explains the appetite increase. A lot of people don't notice that part so it's just assumed to be automatic. ",False,False

I also had PMDD (with some symptoms I think I'm actually still experiencing, though to a much lesser degree now), and honestly since my period stopped it's been such a relief to be spared that misery. I've had six consecutive missed periods now, and in a really perverse way, I almost feel like celebrating each time it fails to appear!   The only thing that frightens me is that I already have severe osteopenia from a past flirtation with anorexia, so I'm a little nervous that my bones are at the point of irreversible damage now. This is the longest I've gone without my period, and just knowing my bones were already in a bad state before...well, yikes. If I didn't feel like I was already screwed in that respect, I'd probably be trying harder to get it back.",False,False

To the best of my understanding, amenorrhea has a lot to do with overall energy balance and body fat levels, as well as possibly hormonal effects of excessive exercise in athletes.  I'm actually orthorexic, obsessed with maximizing my nutritional intake. I've been averaging 1350 calories a day for the past eight months, while running/exercising at what I think is a moderate level. My BMI dropped from 20 in April to as low as 16 in November (it's currently at 16.4, though) and I haven't had my period since July.  [Relative energy deficiency in sport](https://uncexchanges.org/2017/04/06/what-is-relative-energy-deficiency-in-sport-red-s/) is a thing. Body fat is responsible for regulating estrogen and progesterone, then there's the possible impact of ""excessive"" exercise relative to calorie intake (creating an energy imbalance). I'm honestly really proud of the quality of my diet, I even take multiple supplements to get trace minerals, etc., and yet... at a certain point, simply staying in a calorie deficit for too long is just in itself enough to fuck you up.  &amp;#x200B;",False,False

I'm not sure if it's being triggered or not, but it is infuriating. I lost it for 4 months and it came back close to the end of what would be the 5th. While I was temporarily worried something was genuinely wrong with me, I didn't want it to come back. I really, really didn't. I think I have PMDD if I'm honest, and the 4 months without the two week period (each!) of bleeding and wanting to blow my brains out was bliss.. I still had it at a BMI of 15, so I assumed it wasn't directly tied to my weight, and thinking that and having the dumb cycle of crying and bleeding temporarily stop made me want to purposefully eat a worse diet.

I always used to to convince myself I wasn't really *that* underweight because *clearly* my body was still working fine if the baby factory was in order. Been trying to convince myself that the absence of menstruation was removed from the diagnostic criteria for a reason but still, it's just *ugh*.   There's a lot of anorexic chicks in my family and we all tend to get our periods even while very underweight. Hell, my aunt had four kids without ever recovering. It's just a *thing* but it's a shitty thing.   Plus, all the things that go with it (bloating, bad mood, etc) are also triggering asf.
