So I just wanted to kind of make sure you knew I was trying to come from an objective yet supportive spot.,False,False

I know I'm 100% being a little bitch at the moment and that I shouldn't think of her as overbearing. I just wanted to explain a little more why it feels like that",False,True

I apologize. But she very well could be. I just thought you were saying that because she wanted to cook you food after you cooked her food.",False,False

I know she just wants to be nice and return the favour but I want to cut her off and tell her I'm sick before she starts cooking or something because I don't want food to go to waste :( Thanks for the advice!",False,True

You cooked for her, she wants to cook for you. That seems like a good trade off. She seems like she just wants to return the favor. That is understandable. 2) my go to would maybe be to say you're coming down with something. Lying isn't good, etc etc, but all's fair in love and EDs, right?   When people say they want to cook for me,  I either crazy restrict and exercise to try to make up for the food they make me, or I try to come up with some excuse. Like being sick or something.   I have also claimed I ate a ton...I  packaged it up in a lunch bag ""for later"" and then tossed it elsewhere. Wasting food is V bad, I know, but they see it is dwindling and have no idea you aren't eating it.   Idk, being deceitful is the only way to get through it without being honest and saying ""I have issues with food, so I can't eat other peoples cooking."" That one doesnt always have to result in an ED confession either. Just general anxiety. Idk. These are all just the things i have gone through when I had others who wanted to cook in return for the cooking I did .. sorry for blathering on. Haha",False,False
