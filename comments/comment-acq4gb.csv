She does WIEIAD videos, but they are really rare and she kinda half-asses them bc she isn't hyperfocused on food anymore. Her youtube is underrated af, but her insta is dead.  I watch a lot of recovery youtubers but if they upload WAY too many ""what I eat in a day"" videos I generally start to get a lil sus. I'm only halfway (or maybe 3/4ths) recovered and even I am already wayyyy less hyperfocused on food than the ""fully recovered vegans‚Ñ¢Ô∏è"" who upload perfectly done WIEIAD vids fuckin daily.

I don't understand the mindset of why they do it.  It reminds me of one of the two Physical Ed teachers at school who was a large woman.  Never saw her actually do any exercise but never saw her out of her track suit either.  She was responsible for teaching all the girls in the entire school the importance of health and fitness yet she wasn't a glowing example of health and fitness.  So, yeah...same with someone underweight.  ",False,False

Do whatever you want... but I would never hire a health coach that looks like s/he doesn't practice what they preach.

I wish there was a recovery blog where their ED isn't the main focus and you see them getting their shit together in all areas of their life instead of taking half an hour arranging a plate of carefully displayed uber healthy food.  When they're posting ONLY food it sets alarm bells off because they're obviously still obsessed with food to some extent (if not a great extent) to go to so much trouble discovering the healthiest foods and making them look so fancy.  I think of those type of blogs/ig accounts as facebook accounts where everyone tries to make their life sound better than it is and everything's wonderful.  I want to hear about them rebuilding their lives and getting back into their previous interests and how difficult it is to actually get a life back as well as get the ability to eat and get your health back.  I'm not nosy (much!) about others lives, but I want to see how you actually do get a life outside of obsessing about food.  &amp;#x200B;",False,False
