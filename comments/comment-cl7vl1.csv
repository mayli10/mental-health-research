Maybe once he’s aware that the binge episodes set of the purge episodes, he’ll try to stop/redirect you when you start to binge instead of partaking in it.",False,False

You aren't doing this intentionally - some people are. You can pump the breaks on this and make yourself more conscious of any influence you have over your husband going forward. You have the power to reel this back.  Also, don't put all the blame on yourself. You can lead a horse to water but you aren't forcing him to drink. If he's choosing to overeat to the point of gaining weight, as a fellow overweight binger, that's still consciously his choice. You can't force him to make the right decisions - he has to have the power to say no, too. I'm sure the two of you can work together to pull through.",False,False

I have an obsessive personality, with many obsessive behaviors since before we met, so I think he just thinks I’m quirky,  He knows about the exercise part of the purging, and that that I am weird with food, obsessed with my body, weight, and food. I cry about it quite a bit, but I think he chalks it up to hormones? He just thinks that I love exercise and that it makes me happy, which it does, but I don’t think that anybody should do 6-7 hours of cardio after a binge....  I’m just reflecting on how I’m not just fucking with my own health and life, but also with his. The saddest part is that he just wants me happy, and binging (on the outside in the moment) seems like it makes me happy, but then the self hate kicks in, as we all know—so he feels like he cannot win. I need to shut the fuck up, and stop this shit for him—he doesn’t deserve to have this shitty, selfish wife. He is so much better than me and what I deserve.   Thank you for the love in this community. Y’all might help me save my husband.",False,True
