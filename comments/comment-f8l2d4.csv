I definitely don’t want to make ED content because I keep a lot of that to my self. And I don’t care to be famous but I really want to inspire people and make their day better.,False,True

Censor yourself accordingly   - if you are going to talk about eating disorders, please try not to make it triggering for other sufferers. (I can't stand all those arrogant ana bitches with their ""my ED story **with pictures!!!**"")  - there might be people watching who are going to say mean things. Especially if you will be talking about EDs, you're giving the trolls enough rope to hang you with (can you stand it if a troll calls you fat? If they call you skinny? If they tell you you suck and go kys? There are lots of nasty people on youtube).   - you have to be careful with giving personal information. Don't show exactly where you live etc.   - it probably won't be popular. Sooo many creative people are starting youtube channels now, and the youtube algorithm doesn't really show small or new channels.       Make videos because you like it, not because you want to become famous or rich. If you can deal with possibly getting negative attention, it can be really fun to make videos. And you can also get very sweet and heartwarming comments of course!",False,False

Like who am I even, I feel like my entire personality revolves around my eating disorder and dance. But other times I’m like okay but wait I bring more to the table. I’m intelligent, I’m funny, I look at things creatively..idk",False,True
