My partner is several years recovered from severe AN, but when he's stressed out he has disordered urges again. I don't want to talk to him about my ED issues unless he's not stressed at all (which is never).  My ex (that's still in my social circle) is in total denial about being ""recovered"" from their ENDOS, hiding it under OMAD and fasting and ""planned"" binging. I don't want to talk to them about ED issues because they just love trying to feed me while they are in the middle of a fast, to get that twisted joy from seeing me eat more than them.  My roommate doesn't have an ED, but definitely has some disordered eating patterns. I don't want to talk to him about ED things because my restriction/binging cycles seem normal to him, and that normalization just encourages me to restriction more.  Everyone around me either has/had worse ED symptoms (so I feel like a shitty friend talking to them about my less traumatic ED) or less impactful disordered eating (so I feel like a shitty friend pushing my burden onto them). I just keep quiet most of the time and commiserate by hanging out here.",False,False

And a semi- boyfriend who had an eating disorder who'd refuse to eat unless I did/ sort of blackmail me with not eating. We were all pretty young, though. I never figured out how to interact with them and food without it being stressful, so hopefully someone else has advice.   It can be triggering when you have an ED to be around someone who isn't eating, but it's more distressing to be forced to eat/ feel like you've lost control of your body. Maybe you could tell your friends that you're handling your own eating, and if they don't make a big deal about it, it would be more helpful to you?",False,False
