Just stay busy and engaged with what’s going on around you. Try to be nice to your family, it will give you something else to focus on.    I was in the suicide watch mental health unit 5 years ago through NYE. I relapsed with my drug addiction and OD’d.  This time of year is always bad and I always think of that time, and the years past that I don’t remember at all. Try to make it special and do something for you. Running is good if you can, or maybe just clean something you wouldn’t normally if you can’t get outside (like the insides of the cabinets or the windows).     I hope you are ok! I’ll be thinking of you and here to talk if you want!",False,False

I'm a runner myself but cant run rn...broke my toe over something small and I was a bit hangry and now have to pay the price. Yeah any body weight exercise is a good compromise as long as it's not to compensate or is compulsive (I used to do this). Also glad to hear u have pro ppl helping. U have a support team by the sounds of it so utilize them sicne I have the resources to do so if u r stressed out. Happy to help. Have a happy holidays :),False,False
