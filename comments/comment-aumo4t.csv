I'm usually fine if the foods I eat have a lot of protein or vitamins, but if I eat anything sugary or devoid of nutritional value, I just want to purge it, like it's not okay to process the calories from the sugar since it's a waste but it's totally okay to fuck my body by purging lol. Even when I have healthy food beforehand, if I eat something 'bad', I still have the urge to get rid of it. Your last sentence is such a mood too: if I mess up, or plan on eating bad things, might as well go all out so I only have to purge once  .",False,False

Literally purged dried pineapple and mango bc it's high in calories for how much you eat. After purging I realized that I miscalculated how much I ate and it was less than I realized and there was no point to purge it. It was hard af to get up, too. Plus even if I had calculated right and not purged I would have been 500 under my TDEE anyways but it ""wasnt enough and wasnt healthy"" so I purged.  Gotta love EDs",False,False

I suffer extreme orthorexia that I will have breakdowns whenever i eat a krispy kreme donut or some nice sugar loaded cookies. During birthdays and celebrations I only eat the most healthy option I cam find such as lean meats, salads and fruits. If my friends pressure me to eat cakes and other bad desserts I just eat them and throw up in the bathroom later just to keep myself from crying and breaking down ",False,False

When I was ""recovered"" all I did was track macros, got more into superfoods and wellness all for the sake of being able to push myself through strenuous workouts just to go and b/p on said healthy foods and sabotage myself anyway. Like it's quite silly to actually be healthy and adequately supply nutrients to your body and then to purge like I don't get my brain. I'm happy I got through that though. Sucks it took ulcers to realize.",False,False
