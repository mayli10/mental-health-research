There is so much wrong with standard eating disorder treatment that I could genuinely write a whole book about it. After that stay I was so afraid of doctors that I never again sought any real treatment and struggled completely alone for years. I can't put into words my horrific experience in that hospital with the heartless and honestly, just very very stupid doctors that ""treated"" me there. It was only 15 days but I will remember how much it scarred me on an emotional and spiritual level for the rest of my life. For many of us, especially highly sensitive people, that kind of highly monitored, scheduled, conveyor belt treatment does 1000x more harm than good and is beyond words damaging and inhumane.",False,False

To this day, butter is still one of my big fear foods.   I can really relate to you about the whole ""radical opinion"" thing. I would bring up perfectly reasonable points, but no matter what I said, it would be discounted because I had anorexia and clearly couldn't think straight about ANYTHING.   I remember once in recovery when my parents were still being pretty strict about the whole thing, my dad goes, ""It actually IS a lot of food, I'll give you that. I'd have trouble eating all of that too."" And I just felt such a huge sigh of relief because for once someone was acknowledging that I wasn't crazy. It wasn't my eating disorder not wanting to eat 3500+ calories a day...I was just straight up FULL.  However, like you, I came to not trust anyone when it came to food, especially my parents. My dad started ""eyeballing"" the proportions after a few weeks in recovery, and I just lost my shit. He figured, she's not really gaining much weight (if any), so what could a little extra peanut butter do? Meanwhile, I was going to exhausting lengths to hide food, and I couldn't handle any extra.  You're right though—thinking back, some of the behaviors are pretty funny (in a messed up sort of way haha).   Thanks for sharing your story! You made me feel less lonely/crazy too haha.",False,False

I don't think it's going to make me heal, dwelling in the past too much. I guess it all depends on if it's just dwelling or if you can learn something from it and move forward from that place.

I see my own history in a lot of what you're writing. Especially how you experienced increased sneaky behaviour after being hospotalized. I have the exact same experience, and in a lot of ways I think a lot of it made more damage than good. I feel like eating disorders are far from understood, and it's so much focused on the eating, the food, and gaining weight if youre underweight, that the actual underlying cause is forgotten and not treated. I also started hiding food, I was trying to find ways to get rid of food or throw up, I even had this disgusting habit in a treatment home of doing a motion with my finger over my sandwitch to catch some of the butter, and then I smeared the butter under my chair, like WTF, who does that? It's so weird. I also drank insane amounts of water before a weigh in, like you're describing. And I also believe that a lot of it was a direct consequense of feeling extremely controlled by people around me, like care givers, my family, hospital staff, and so on. I dont think I would have developed this kind of strange behaviour otherwise. I also often felt like no one was listening to me, no one was taking me and my feelings seriously, it was all about me gaining weight and food. Even after achieving a healthy weight. If I wasn't agreeing with the treatment I was receiving, it was ""because my illness was taking over and controlling me!"" I was no longer a freely thinking individual with opinions of my own, now any ""radical"" opinion that I may have had was a symptom of my illness. Like for example, I was questioning the point of sitting down for a whole hour after every meal. I was questioning how helpful it actually is to keep weighing in someone, noting and micro controlling their weight constantly, every week, when you're talking about a person who already is trying to control their weight too much. Or the eating schedule we had, 5 meals per day (including two smaller ones), all of them with very exact proportions, carefully measured. It even got to the point where I no longer trusted my parents to prepare a plate of food for me, because I didn't trust that they could possibly give me the correct amount like they could at the treatment home or hospital. When I think back I cant believe some of the things that happened and some of the things I did, and you writing about your experiences makes me feel less lonely, so thank you again. Also, can you sometimes think back and find it all kind of humorous? I mean putting weights in your sportsbra, that is very sad, but also kind of funny and clever in a way? Like the butter under the chair thing, not that thats clever, just gross, but kind of funny.",False,True
em5lbf2,t3_bj2np1,t3_bj2np1,squirrels-rule,1,2019-04-30 12:50:01,/r/EDAnonymous/comments/bj2np1/trauma_from_ed_treatmenthospitalization/em5lbf2/,"I'm so glad you brought this up, and I have a similar story. I was first diagnosed with anorexia/EDNOS at 16 while I was running cross country. Similar to you, I'm 25 now and at a ""healthy"" weight, but I still have incessant eating disordered thoughts, and I struggle with food every single day, even when I eat ""normally"".  Anyway, I was hospitalized for two weeks at age 16 when I refused to get better. Frankly, I had just been going through the motions. My parents sent me to various specialists and nutritionists, and I could usually talk my way out of it...until one doctor insisted on hospitalization. I spent my 17th birthday in the hospital and finally came home on Christmas Eve.  I don't have to tell you that the hospital was horrible. They woke me up at 5AM every morning to take my vitals, and they wouldn't let me stand or take a shower for the entire first week. I was finally ""rewarded"" with a shower and a wheelchair ride (wtf) for good behavior. The nurses were horrible and power-hungry, and they insisted on getting a doctor's permission just so that I could stand up and brush my teeth. The whole thing just seemed extreme.    In terms of lasting trauma, I think the worst part was the sneaky behavior I developed post-hospitalization. Although I had lied about food in the past, the lies and deceit really spiraled after I came home from the hospital.   I was pretty pragmatic about the whole thing, and I decided that if I could just get the doctors to *think* I was getting better, everyone would leave me alone. As much as it killed me, I figured the fastest way to get out of the hospital was to follow orders. I ate the meals and snacks, all the while hating myself and dreading how difficult it was going to be to lose this weight once I was out of the hospital.   After I came home, my parents were extremely strict about following the recovery regimen, much to my horror. My dad would even come to high school and sit with me in the principal's office to make sure I ate my lunch. Slowly but surely, I was able to convince them that I could eat on my own, but they still supervised meals while I was home.   In the morning, my dad would cook me a HUGE breakfast—eggs, cereal, orange juice, bagel with a ton of peanut butter, and fruit on the side. I would have to eat all of that in a typical morning. As I gained back their trust, I simultaneously started hiding food and lying about eating. For example, I would grab a pile of scrambled eggs or blueberries and shove them in my pocket while my dad wasn't looking. I'd also eat really slowly, and then realize that I was going to be late for school and shove the entire bagel + peanut butter in my mouth, then proceed to spit it out upstairs in my bathroom and flush it.   Once I convinced him to let me eat lunch with my friends again, I just started throwing my entire lunch away. I told myself that I deserved this because I let it get this bad. This was my ""punishment"" for letting myself get to the point of hospitalization. My sicko brain had the goal of hovering just *above* the point of needing hospitalization.   For my regular check-ins with the doctor that orginally sent me to the hospital, I became a master manipulator. Initially, I would waterload like crazy (6-7 bottles). But I needed to show more ""progress"", so I started wearing two sports bras and two pairs of underwear so that I could hide literal weights on my body—even when they made me wear the gown. I was truly desperate.   My plan worked, and I lost weight despite everyone else's best efforts. I'm surprised my doctor fell for that shit tbh, but she rarely looked at me (she was very numbers-oriented). My dad suspected something was off, and so did my best friends, but they had no real proof. Once, my dad insisted on weighing me again when I got home from a doctor's visit, but I protested and claimed that it was traumatizing and against my recovery plan. \*eye roll\*  Although this plan worked for a little while, it was extremely exhausting and contributed to anxiety and depression. Like many anorexics, I eventually snapped and swung the other way. I binged constantly and then turned to bulimia to try to undo those binges. I struggled with severe bulimia my entire first year of college, and I even tried to get help at my school's health center, but they just set me up with a dietician. In the end, I was able to get myself to stop purging without anyone's help.   Ultimately, I think there was some other, potentially slower recovery plan that would have worked better for me long-term. The hospital may have worked short-term, but it contributed to damaging behaviors in the long run.   TL;DR   I was hospitalized at 16, and now I'm 25 and ""healthy"", but the trauma I experienced in the hospital had lasting effects on my mental (and physical) health.",False,False
em4xc08,t3_bj2np1,t3_bj2np1,puddlenymph,1,2019-04-30 08:34:48,/r/EDAnonymous/comments/bj2np1/trauma_from_ed_treatmenthospitalization/em4xc08/,"Hello. I think I can relate somewhat....sorry if I'm off base. I wasnt hospitalized for any extended periods, however I was deeply stuck in the system and eventually sought a different path, which has resulted in frustrating pushback.  My mom is mentally ill. My family experienced a lot of illness and death when I was 9-10 and she had a hard time. By the time I was 15 or so she was in therapy more than at home and we were emotionally enmeshed. I think shes a narcissist maybe...its unclear and ongoing. We dont speak anymore.   Enmeshment during my childhood resulted in projection, doctor shopping, and my very own matching bipolar diagnosis, complete with copious amounts of medication and hours and hours of therapy a week. This isnt to say doctors didnt notice what she was doing, there just wasnt a mechanism to stop it. I had several therapists who helped me a ton BECAUSE they saw what she was doing. But the message that need drugs and would never be Okay™️ And while I'm not opposed to drugs per se, I didnt feel it was a sustainable lifestyle for me. I wanted to cope with my own mind, whatever state it was in. I believed, and still believe, that because I am the only one in here I am the only person really capable of changing my own mind. And that I can.   By 18 I had been hospitalized 3 times and had tried to commit suicide twice.  So I left home, junked my meds (unsafely. Taper your meds!) and began a long process of trying to ration with the world. It has been a journey but an EMENSLY positive one.  I realized that I wasnt mentally ill in the way that the doctors meant it. I realized that I had no healthy coping mechanisms or skills because I had never really established any and as a result, didnt know how to be healthy. Emotional abuse and manipulation by my parents was so pervasive I hadn't really had time to be Me without layers of unhelpful stress responses, one of which included disordered eating. My issues were, I believe, in response to the warped world I found myself in and for years I had been told that I WAS the problem.   Now this isn't to say I'm so ableist as to think that mental illness isnt real. But I do think that the world is not a healthy place for humans, or much else at this point really. We are sensitive, highly social creatures capable of complex expressions of emotion. I believe most people are just stuck in their responses to this deeply unhealthy emotional landscape that is western society. And rather than change the world we try to change ourselves. And when we are unable to do so ourselves we seek help. And money jacks everything up after that. Illness is profitable and we need people to work correctly so get in line and take your soma because it's the only conduit society has to help.   So fast forward 15 years or so. Diet is hard to fix! While I have processed years of emotional garbage and grown much better in this time I still struggle with restriction. My body's hunger cues are out of whack. My digestion is shit. I've been restricting with little way to think my way around it since I was nine years old. Ive gotten better, a lot better, at times but when the pop hits the fan it's still a big hurdle for me. But I dont fit an eating disorder mold either so the two doctors I actually tried to ask for help downplayed my problens. They told me it was stress and that if I meditated and took a good hot bath my appetite would return and I would be fine.   When I then delved into how I got here the response felt almost threatening. I was told that my reluctance to accept my diagnosis is symptomatic of bipolar disorder. I was told I was incapable of recovering in any meaningful way without significant medication and a team. I was told that I was damaging my brain by not taking medication.Which to me was a real messed up way to respond to someone asking how to seek out a nutritionist. It's also, frankly, offensive.    I'm not perfect but I'm also not that kind of sick. I do have some serious physical and emotional issues as a result of my crappy eating. I have issues tied to my menstrual cycle and hormonal imbalances which are connected to my diet. But most importantly these issues are untreated because the doctors want to check tidy boxes instead of listen to me and my experiences in my body and on the world. I cant seem to get the help I need without accepting a ton of baggage (and bills) that I dont.   So I saved money, quit my job, and now I study anthropology and the evolution of the human mind. I had to understand the ways in which the world effects people and people effect each other. And its helping. I have more time to focus on self care and to focus on being the best mom I can be to my daughter. These problems are passed from parent to child for generation after generation. I had to spend this time focusing heavily on breaking that cycle. And the only way to do that was to change. So I'm changing. Everything. And life is sweet.  And no matter how rational I feel I am, there are still people on my life 20 years later that want me back in the box, playing by the ""rules"" and submitting to their brand of recovery. It's been hard to find the help I do need because doctors judge how I got here.   We aren't fucked up. The world is fucked up and we are a symptom of it. As are they.   I am sorry if this sounds really ableist. I always afraid people will think I'm some hippy who is against psychiatry and Im not, it just wasnt the path for me. And frankly when it comes to my Self, I am the most important element.   I am sorry that you were hurt by people who thought they were trying to help you. None of us should have to go through this. It's a messy, imperfect, impersonal system. You CAN find your way.",False,False

I went in for major depressive episodes and can't remember much of my time there. I feel like I was in such a vulnerable state and was so medicated out of my brain I has just blocked it out. Plus from what I do remember it was incredibly boring so even if I tried there is not much of significance there   However, from before being about 20 I can't actually remember much of my life. Is it from all the stress and trauma? maybe, but to be honest I have so much that makes me feel depressed now I don't think I want to remember every detail and emotion from back then too. I try and encourage myself to focus on what I'm currently living at the moment rather than searching for further things that are there.
