People can say whatever they want but it's not real until you see it in action.   It was certainly helpful for me to hear. I always hope people will like me better, romantically or otherwise, if I get smaller but deep down I know both logically and from personal experience that I just suck no matter what the scale says and while there is a sense of futility involved in that it still allows me to relax a little more with food to have been reminded (: ",False,False

It did take me back to reality. I guess that this had to happen for me to get better someday.

It was very liberating and a lot of recovery came afterwards.

She was pushing 300 lbs and was around 5 feet tall. I was 105 lbs at 5 foot 4 and he used to call me ‚Äúmiss piggy‚Äù.  They stayed together for about two years before eventually calling it off.
