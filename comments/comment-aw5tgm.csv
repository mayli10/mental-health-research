I am working on keeping my thoughts out of the relationship and getting better :) ,False,True

He probably isn't seeing the weight loss, but rather picking up on your attitude/confidence, even if subconsciously. You may also be making yourself ""more available"" (that sounds gross but I don't know how else to phrase it) by initiating contact, not pulling away, and so on.",False,False

Not my SO, but I totally do this with my best friend/FWB. We hadn't had sex for like 3 months and the next time we did I had lost a significant amount of weight and he kept touching my hip bones and ribs and did that while we were cuddling too. It made me feel awful. Realistically, men tend to not notice weight loss (at least in my experience). It's really good that you can separate your own thoughts from the ED thoughts and realize that it's not rational!",False,False
