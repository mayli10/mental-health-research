I myself have pretty bad OCD. Just this morning, I had breakfast. A fav of mine is 2 eggo waffles with a thin layer of peanut butter and some syrup. Well, I seem to be developing an intolerance to peanuts so I got a PB alternative called WowButter. Its soy. Well. The texture. And taste. Were so disgusting that 2 hours later I am still gagging when thinking about it. And it is 100% the texture being ""wrong"" that I want to purge it so I can have a breakfast that is ""right"". Not about the calories being wasted- even though I do somewhat feel that way, but about the texture. I get shivers and gag when I replay that texture. Bleh.   Similarly, if I have 2 foods, say, cheesy potatoes and peas, the cheese cannot touch the peas. That is ""wrong"". I dont know why. But it is a huge struggle to eat two foods not baked in the same container if they touched. It's ridiculous and I try to ignore that ""wrong"" feeling but it is there. And it has nothing to do with how my body looks and everything to do with some unknown ""wrong"" about two foods touching",False,False

Don’t try to self diagnose (and don’t let me diagnose) go see a doctor,False,False
