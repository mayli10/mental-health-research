I've been relapsing under the guise of ""eating healthy"" lately. My husband doesn't know that most of the meals I make are below 250cals a serving because I use low calorie veggies to bulk up my meal to make it look like more than it is.  I'm doing my best to calculate my calories as accurately as I can, but I know I'm off without being able to accurately weigh.   But if I buy one and start weighing out my food he'll know what I'm doing and interfere with my plan to lose weight. I love him dearly and I know he wants the best for me but I so wish he would just back off sometimes instead of forcing recovery on me. It just makes me want to hide things more. ",False,False
