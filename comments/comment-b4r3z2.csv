I'm so sorry you had to go through that. Hell, it only adds more stress and trauma onto the situation.

I mean, I know it helps people and there's merit in it but omg everyone who ends up in one of those wards seems to have a horrendous time. And it seems like nothing tangible is being done to fix it. It's sick.  &amp;#x200B;  Anything you post here doesn't need to have a point! Feel free to let of steam or just talk, that's what we're all here for really. :)",False,False

Good to hear you're feeling a bit better, even if things still seem pretty bleak. Have faith in yourself, I don't know your situation but there's always hope!",False,False
