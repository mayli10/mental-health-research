Last night, I ate three brownies and a shit ton of fast-food because I was at a party and I didn‚Äôt log it at all. The guilt was weighing me down, but at the same time, it felt kind of liberating. But then most days I‚Äôm so ridiculous I weigh every last piece of lettuce and onion because I‚Äôm scared that somehow it‚Äôll put me over maintenance? My ED logic really makes no sense.  The fact that you haven‚Äôt gained anything is strangely comforting to hear. Probably the reason I‚Äôm so scared of regaining the weight is because I hang around calorie counting subreddits on my main account, and I‚Äôm used to seeing people talk about how they gained all their weight back after they stopped counting. I‚Äôm terrified of that! I know being larger isn‚Äôt a bad thing (I was never overweight, though I got close to the ‚Äúoverweight for a minor‚Äù cutoff), but I‚Äôve always had body issues, and since losing ~25 pounds, I‚Äôve been so much more confident in myself physically. It just sucks that I had to develop an ED alongside that (I haven‚Äôt been formally diagnosed, but my relationship with food and with my body has become painfully unhealthy).  Your story gives me hope, regardless. I might force myself to not count for a few days. I need to stop treating days where I decide not to count as an ‚Äúoh well, I can eat ridiculous amounts of foods that I barely want, I‚Äôm gonna be in a deficit for the next ten days anyway!‚Äù thing. It just ends up making future me miserable, and I‚Äôm sick of it. Gotta relearn my relationship with food, somehow.  Thank you üíï",False,True

I've been through so many phases where I've started and stopped tracking calories. When I get into it, I'm obsessed and it becomes my #1 priority. It makes things such as cooking dinner a 2 hr process because I have to weigh everything out .etc for accuracy. Like you mentioned, I am constantly thinking about food and my next meal. I also get super irritated if my food plan needs to deviate for any reason.  This year I really started trying to eat well, like actually just nourish my body, eat what I want within reason and not consume my mind with calorie counting. I also don't have a scale right now (still have a food scale for emergencies lol) and I weigh myself at the gym only on occasion. I was shocked but my weight hasn't gone up, if anything it has stayed more consistent which I'm ok with. And trust me I have had some pretty binge tastic days here and there too.  I promise it will be ok! You could always try taking a break from the app for a few weeks to see how you feel, and the app is always going to be there if you need. But give it a shot. You can do it and you deserve to be happy. üíï",False,False
