(started out pretty fat so don't look at me like that lol. 10 lbs in October, 10 lbs in January) I'm not sure about bloating because, once again, chunky kid here. Most of my bloating I attribute to the food I've shoved in my face.   I gained more weight on depovarian but maybe it's because I started using depo and weed at the same time. ðŸŽˆ",False,False

I initially gained weight, but I think that was due to overeating. I've been on birth control since I was 16, when I was very skinny, so I don't have much to compare it to.  I do know someone who had really serious psychological effects from hers, so do not doubt that your symptoms are quite real. If you can, switch it out with something else that would help your periods. I bet your doc can offer suggestions.",False,False

I think it is like any birth control - it's really individual how your body responds to it. However, any puffiness or swelling I get I attribute to my endometriosis rather than the Mirena itself.  Honestly I would stick with it rather than deal with the extremely painful periods, but I totally understand how the fluctuations and bloating can fuck with your head - if fucks with mine as well",False,False
