I didn‚Äôt really understand EDs much until I was in a long term mental health treatment facility and I met people with EDs and developed friendships with them, and saw how much they were suffering. They weren‚Äôt all skinny people, as I‚Äôd previously assumed, and they challenged my previously-held negative beliefs about people with EDs. If you wonder what I‚Äôm doing on this sub, it‚Äôs mostly to understand people with EDs better, and to understand my own, increasingly-disordered relationship with food (fasting, fad diets, etc).  All my life, I was never skinny, but never really ‚Äúfat‚Äù either. For most of my adult life I maintained at about 135 lbs, which I was happy with. About five years ago I was prescribed antipsychotics to treat severe mental health issues. I can‚Äôt really describe the hunger those meds cause - it‚Äôs like you‚Äôre burning with hunger 24/7, you could eat an entire buffet and you‚Äôd still be burning with hunger. So my weight ended up ballooning. After a while I got my hunger under control, but at that point I‚Äôd become a fully-fledged alcoholic. I‚Äôd go days and days without eating because I was drinking a liquid diet, and I was still gaining weight. At my heaviest, I‚Äôd gained 100 lbs.  I started to experience life as a fat person for the first time. And I actually became jealous of people with EDs, as bad as that sounds. I‚Äôd ask myself, ‚ÄúOf all the mental illnesses I‚Äôve been cursed with, WHY couldn‚Äôt I be cursed with one that makes me skinny?‚Äù I realize, looking back on it, that it was a really shitty and selfish way of thinking. It didn‚Äôt help that a lot of my friends got into this podcast with two anorexic hosts, and one of the hosts in particular is always bragging about how skinny she is and how it makes her better than all of us gross fat people. The more I think about it, the bragging is probably a coping mechanism, and I shouldn‚Äôt judge her for it. But it increased the burning jealousy.   The short and simple answer is, a lot of the stigma surrounding EDs come from people who are bitter about their weight and have a poor self-image. I‚Äôm definitely guilty of it, which is why I know what it comes from. I hate being fat so much. I hate it with every fiber of my being, and even now I still feel so jealous of skinny people.   I‚Äôm sorry that we‚Äôre like that. I‚Äôm sorry that we‚Äôre so bitter. I‚Äôm sorry that we tend to make other people‚Äôs struggle with EDs all about ourselves. It‚Äôs not right and it‚Äôs something I‚Äôm still struggling with. You all deserve so much better.",False,False

It would be like if someone said, ""I feel like I am coming down with the flu"", and I replied, ""I know you feel sick, but how do you think I feel"".

There‚Äôs often a weird hush when I let people know, they get very uncomfortable (even though I‚Äôm usually very comfortable sharing when I do). They treat it like you‚Äôve been hiding this big secret from them, and now do not trust you to be able to handle yourself or ask for help with it if you needed it.   Like, other mental disorders are just something you have to deal with - hell, you‚Äôre even stronger for dealing with it.

The fact is that fat people, and other people who don't fit ""The Norm"" are at best, underrepresented and at worst, outright hated. So much so that it's internalized by the very groups who are tortured by it. I mean, just take a look at /fatl*gic, where most of the people who post those awful things are fat and trying to lose weight. That's how they think of themselves, too.   Even for those of us who aren't fat, it can be really hard sometimes to notice when our behavior and our words could hurt someone else who is, especially if we've never been fat and don't know what it's like and what even could be hurtful. I'd been a few pounds overweight for much of my childhood/adolescence and even then I could feel the judgement and often outright bullying, but a lot of that was also subconscious, seemingly harmless comments on other people's own bodies. I have no idea what it's like to be big, and I can't speak to that, but even at a high-healthy/just-over weight I was hyper conscious of other people's bodies and eating behaviors, and what they might think of mine. Which is why comments on your body, while totally about you, may make someone else reflect badly on theirs. Hell, I learned to hate my body as a child from my mom, who openly hated hers. Now I try my very hardest to not make ANY comments on myself, other people, or food if someone else is there, because you never know how someone listening might take it.
