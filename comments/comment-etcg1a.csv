It’s not exactly easy and you need to practice doing them when you don't immediately need them so that you’re actually able to do something else in the moment. I know it’s hard, but try not to beat yourself up too much for coping with all the shit in your life the only way you how to. Obviously i don’t mean that restricting is a healthy or good way of dealing with it, but it’s not your fault that you weren’t ever given any healthy ways of managing stress. It’s never too late to learn new ones though!      This talks a bit about some different types of coping skills and why we use them. There’s so many different things that count as coping skills that it wouldnt be possible to list all of them, but this might help you figure out what types of coping skills would be more helpful to you:     https://www.semel.ucla.edu/dual-diagnosis-program/News_and_Resources/How_Do_You_Cope",False,False

I'm so sorry to hear about the pain you've lived through. When we're in crisis like that, I think our brains turn to whatever they know to try to help us feel safe. To protect us from the demons, within and without. You (both the conscious and instinctive/subconscious 'yous') are doing the best you know how to do to get through each moment. &lt;3 Often that means falling back on maladaptive ways of coping. Things that sort of get us by in the moment but prove ineffective in the long-run.   Is accessing therapy resources an option? Trauma-informed therapy (talking, DBT, EMDR) might be really helpful in both getting stable, getting to a physical and emotional place that feels safer, building up new ways of coping, and then potentially resolving some of the trauma both recent and in childhood.  Sending zen hugs out to you. Wishing for you to be and to feel safe and protected  &lt;3",False,False
