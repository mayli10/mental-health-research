I've decided to recover on my own in April and started eating everything i would encounter (maybe it was also extreme hunger after months of restricting) which caused me to bloat up like crazy but i dont know how much weight i gained as i was too scared to weigh myself. Through that i wanted to actually recover by eating healthy and eat regular meals. This however already made me cut out certain things i would like to eat but i wouldnt allow myself because i was scared i would bloat up again. It worked for about 2 months but at some point i became more and more aware and scared of ""bad foods"" again and here i am again going back to restricting occasionally and being scared of certain foods. :) So i occasionally enjoy food but then restrict to maintain. (i also dont weigh myself at all because i think then would really spiral back into full ED mode)  Literally everything i eat i have to tell myself that its ok to eat it. The ED behaviour is constantly creeping up to me again and even though i notice it its hard to fight it sometimes...",False,False

So I'm frequently surrounded by super delicious fattening meals and dessert every night. I probably go between numbers 2-3 pretty frequently.  I also exercise a lot so I can eat more.   If it helps, remember that a few days of eating over your TDEE will not cause significant weight gain. Your body can compensate for those kind of fluctuations by temporarily raising your metabolism (and/or decreasing your hunger so that you don't want to eat as much at the next meal). I just went on a 4 day vacation and (with lots of anxiety) ate whatever I wanted, 3000+ calories a day in meals and alcohol. It took only couple days back at home of eating normally, not even low restricting, to go back to my previous weight. The hard part is like you said, we are always surrounded by this food so if I ate everything I wanted all the time I would definitely gain weight.   Also, kind of along the same lines as what the other commenter mentioned, not everyone needs to be a BMI of 20 or under - there is a range for a reason. I used to feel great physically at a 23-24 BMI, now I'm at a BMI of 19 and freaking hate my body and my life, so there's that. I understand it's so hard to just turn these thoughts off though.",False,False

I’m not mentally ready to give that up yet, but as I get closer to goal weight I feel less anxious about slight gain or setbacks in restriction because I can fix it. Kind of hoping I can feel okay at my goal weight and restrict occasionally to stay there with less stress, that’s where my idea of “half-recovery” I suppose is coming from.",False,True

So you get mentally well enough to feel you are fine just as you are even if your body isn't stick thin.  It's really difficult to get there and the chances of long term success are impacted by your willingness to let go of the need to remain skinny.  Cause if your self worth is based entirely on your weight/clothing size/measurements then you really aren't recovered I don't think. Best of luck! It's hard, I'm sure we all feel like that sometimes.",False,False
