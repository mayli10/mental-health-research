Eating under 1k cals/day isn’t that bad if you have a petite frame. 2k cals/day is a give or take for average nutrition but 5’4-5’6 is also an average height. I’m 5’1 and I’ve found that if I’m sedentary and eating 1200 cals I just maintain weight.,False,False

I’m a fucking dietetic student too so I know how bad it is to eat under 1k cals a day but I still try to aim for it :(  Good luck 💗",False,True
