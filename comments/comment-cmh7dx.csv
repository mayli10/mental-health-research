Then when you go back to your living space, you can either have it at a later day or get rid of it without the stress of your mom thinking you are wasting it. Specifically say, ""I'm full but I dont want to waste this so I'll take it home with me and have it as leftovers some other time, thanks for the food!""",False,False

For this reason, I love going out to eat with my boyfriend. He watches how I interact with the food on my plate and if he sees my mood dropping or my internal frustration, he‚Äôll put his hand on my arm and whisper ‚Äúyou don‚Äôt have to finish it‚Äù or ‚Äúwe can just take it to go‚Äù. It‚Äôs the reassurance of not having to succumb to learned childhood eating patterns that makes all the difference.",False,False
