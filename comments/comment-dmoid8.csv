I was returning something and the cashier initially gave me shit for it (still annoyed cuz it was unnecessary. She was just power tripping because Costco has a good return policy) BUT upon seeing my membership card picture from like 10 years ago she was aghast and was like “this is not you!” She couldn’t believe that the picture was me but Costco pictures are very grainy and they’re black and white and you can barely see anything so I didn’t really understand what she was getting at but she was all like “it looks like you lost about 40 pounds! you lost weight didn’t you?” She kept asking me about weight loss questions then so I told her “yeah I mean that’s a long time ago, I did lose weight from back then” and she kept insisting that I should take another picture because i don’t look like the one on the card. She also asked for my ID because apparently she couldn’t believe that it was me... it was annoying. I wanted to leave but I had to wait for her to complete the return. That entire conversation tho was unnecessary. Her coworker was looking at us and so were the other people in line... ugh.",False,False

Like this was before my ED really materialized so I just wasn’t hungry or chose a light option and she would make some judgemental comment. Eventually I got mad and just yelled at her “do you HAVE to comment on everything I eat????” She was speechless lol so satisfying,False,False
