OP you need to take care of yourself for your sake not someone else's. He can't threaten hurting himself to force you to ""recover"". It's not real progress, and will just screw you up mentally even more.

The best course of action is to talk to him; but she needs to stand up for herself.

What part of what I originally said implied to you that she should not voice her concerns? What new deal is to be made? The other comment suggested maybe OP could agree to counseling/treatment, but what if OP isn't ready for that. I think most of us can agree that forcing recovery isnt ideal and it really needs to be OPs *choice* because ultimately op has bodily autonomy.
