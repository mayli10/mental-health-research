My last name has ""sink"" in it, so I'd constantly get [name] sink-a-ship which is really stupid now that I look back on it as an adult but at the time it was humiliating",False,False

It sucked, it's done, I'm in a better place now, whatever, y'know? But it's definitely big contributed to the development if my eating disorder. I had the misfortune of having a first name that rhymes with ""fatty"" and I was often called fatty-first-name. It's so engrained that I don't even go by my first name anymore because it genuinely upsets me to hear it. It sucks that shit like that will probably affect me for a long long time.",False,True

I considered them friends- I had no real gauge otherwise, I was trapped in a cycle of self-loathing and bullying; it's hard to make genuine, good, friends when you're bitter and have become destructive towards yourself and others. That being said they were all very grimy dudes and I will never speak to them again lmao.  Even worse, a lot if girls came forward from my friend group and said one specific guy I had soent a lot if time with had sexually assualted or harrassed them in some way or another. Being fat and ugly was the only thing that protected me from that, interestingly enough. I am angry at myself that I was so desperate to have any kind of friend I didn't notice the red flags.",False,True

It does suck to feel like everyone else is having fun but you got to go to the beach with actual boys! You got to go to a dance! I'm not trying to one up (one down?)you or anything, just saying, cherish the good memories even though they weren't perfect. And fuck the bad memories, they made you a stronger, more caring and understanding person.     Also you are still young and have plenty of time to be held up in a bikini on a dudes shoulder ðŸ™‚ if you're skinny when you're my age (I'm 10 years older than you haha) you're practically a unicorn at least depending on where you live. Suddenly you'll be the skinny friend because it becomes rarer and rarer to find people who keep their figure over having kids, the stress of work, slowing metabolisms of age etc.",False,False
