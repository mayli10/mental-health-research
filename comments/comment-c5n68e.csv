You dont have to be at a dangerously low weight to have an eating disorder.",False,False

I feel like people with legitimate eating disorders have an actual mental illness and deserve support. I’m chubby, greedy and a fake lol.",False,True

That’s how I feel but I stay on this sub for support so that it doesn’t morph into something worse :),False,False

It feels like everyone has these thoughts and only people with EDs take care of them. Thanks so much though!,False,True

I'm 5'1 and it's the absolute lowest I'm allowed to be before I'd be underweight. You have a legitimate eating disorder and the fact that you don't believe you do is *surprise* part of your eating disorder,False,False

I also recently gained weight (think I'm PMSing) so I'm more like 100.7 lb. My weight was 98 three days ago though and I looked fine. Ok this is silly your point is valid. Healthy people can have weird views of their body too!",False,True

I'm objectively fat now: my boobs are massive and my hips and thighs are disgusting and I feel like a sex toy after recovery. I hate looking in mirrors and knowing that I've let myself get this way. I'm trying to restrict and get back down to my LW, but I'm binging so much it's not working. Everyone in this community has legitimate eating disorders that interfere with their lives and I feel like a fraud.",False,True

You’re allowed to struggle- you’re not faking just because it comes and goes. It’s like with physical health, just because chronic pain comes and goes doesn’t mean it’s not really there. So either way, whether you feel like you have a problem or not, you’re still valid and welcome here in this community. You sound like you’re doing pretty well, and I hope it continues!",False,False
