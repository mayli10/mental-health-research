Remember that your body is just a bundle of organic matter and is temporary. Nothing, from how you feel to how you look, is forever. You can get your head above water and gain the focus you need.   IMO, slowing down the binging is number one priority. Take some time to think of what causes the binges- it can be multiple reasons. Feeling worthless, feeling too hungry, feeling empty. Try to focus on what‚Äôs behind what causes those. Are they avoidable? If not, what steps can you take to make things easier on yourself? Some things can‚Äôt be ‚Äúfixed‚Äù right away or completely- like living situations or relationships. Keep in mind what triggers you and do your best to move past it. Let words and situations and personal troubles flow over you like water off a ducks back.   Re-think yourself and set yourself up for success- you do deserve better. You *are* better. Set realistic goals and do your best to put time to the side. Toss out as much stress and pressure you put on yourself dealing with your weight as you can possibly handle. And then take baby steps. Jumping straight into cutting calories or fasting can be a lot at once, especially when you‚Äôve been yo-yoing between the two spectrums. Don‚Äôt feel ashamed to take your time. Hold your head high and ignore your own negative thoughts- you cannot be your own worst enemy when it comes to this. It‚Äôs not worth destroying yourself with food.   Get your head and heart aligned as much as you can, and the body follows. It‚Äôs hard, and frustrating beyond belief, but it‚Äôs necessary for change.   Good luck and stay strong!! üíï",False,False
