They are uneducated about the risks  ""Naturally thin"" gets abused- out of self-defence- there's nothing natural about being.. when it gets into weight loss territory that is seriously abnormal and disordered from a health perspective  I worry about people who were like me before society's obsession with being thin screwed them up and the messages they're getting- who were just normal, athletic  With some insecurities that were accelerated and influenced through people defending themselves against thin shaming- it probably had nothing to do with them but they get dragged into it  Carrying on and on past underweight and past emaciated with a lot of illusions around it- thanks the right wing conservatives. Their denial of being thin and inability to accept it is so deranged. They're like Jehovah's Witness. They've got really dry personalities and they want to be like Nicole Richie and they judge people for looking at magazines  They make decisions about people who are supported financially for having mental illnesses, and they're influencing perceptions of the unemployed and people with eating disorders  Their idiocy is invalidating towards people with eating disorders who can't get help- they think because they can do it, everyone else should, and they're very judgemental- if you died from your ED, they'd say it was natural causes and cover it up  They think anorexia is a myth, no one is anorexic, and if you think you had it years ago you were just obsessed with mental illness documentaries and you needed to get a life/get a job- they're in Parliament deciding who gets money/support, etc  It has some role in maintaining the status quo, the extreme denial of it. I don't think you should have to make a public statement about why you are whatever you are, or justify it, or pretend you're doing something you're not  I think there are social pressures to justify it and explain yourself and take a side, and you don't have to do that- to cover up or whatever  I think people freak out and think something is going to happen if they don't.

I've also been hating the popular trend in the last few months of projecting our EDs onto everyone and anyone around us. It's so common to see posts here insisting fasting is disordered, everyone on 1200/1500/dieting subs etc must have an ED, mocking posts on their subs or complaining they're triggering when imo it's disrespectful of us to invade their safe spaces and complain our EDs make their threads upsetting when there are whole communities devoted to fasting/IF/veganism/etc nutrition related stuff that explicitly say they can't accommodate EDs and the forums aren't meant for us. Fasting is not inherently unhealthy, it can be religious, spiritual, lots of evidence to suggest it can even contribute positively to health. And many people on places like 1200isplenty are extremely unhealthy, have a lot of weight to lose, and are literally dying and suffering mentally from the opposite of a restrictive eating disorder. I hate seeing people here drag their whole forum claiming they're all disordered or that their community is unhealthy/unsupportive because their posts can be taken out of context and applied to a restrictive ED in a toxic manner.  Idk if I'm explaining myself well but I'm scared to post stuff like this on here bc it seems to get mass downvoted nowadays if you don't go along w the fasting = disordered, dieting = thinly veiled anorexia, 1200isplenty = edanonymemes in disguise hivemind. Hate to say it but context does matter. Sure, you can take an overeating meme from a 1200 sub and post it on anonymemes and get upvotes/relatability from both communities but it's just not the same. An obese person who desperately needs to lose weight medically and is struggling to do so posting for support and ""tips"" from their weight loss community is simply not the same as the exact same post on this forum coming from an underweight person with AN. I think it's projecting to the max to say keto, IF, fasting, or any lifestyle with any thought to eating habits whatsoever *must* be eating disordered just because those of us with literal eating disorders may use those lifestyles or eating habits as part of our disorders. Not all humans are the same.",False,False
