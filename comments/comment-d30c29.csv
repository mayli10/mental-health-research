Like my parents will cut up tomatoes and mozzarella balls for dinner and put so much fucking olive oil on top.

But I was not cooking for one person, I was cooking for hella. So you gotta multiply the amount of oil you use by the amount of people you're cooking for.     Which isn't even getting into oil as ingredient vs as a textural element in the cooking process. Depending what you're making, like 20% to 99% of the oil doesn't even end up on the plate. I can cook hella omelettes after buttering the pan once, and there's approximately the same amount of butter left in the pan when I'm done -- because it's the butter that heats and cooks the food, not the pan. So then it's, ""okay so how much for one person, considering most of it stays in the pan, and also I'm cooking for hella right now.""     But either way, yeah that stress is an ED thought -- get it out, look at it, take its power away.",False,False
