Can you make your last meal of the day before bed something fattier/higher in protein, which will digest slowly and keep you feeling fuller and more satiated? Then you can acknowledge that your binge urges are emotional rather than physical hunger and work through them from that perspective, and maybe make them easier to ride out. A piece of salmon, or a nutritional/protein shake, paired with a small serving of nuts/seeds and maybe tossing a multivitamin in there might help?",False,False
