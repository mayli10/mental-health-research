Skim milk and eggs whites sounds fuckin awesome. I used to love chia seeds in oatmeal too. It doesn't have a ton of protein but I liked the texture.",False,False

ED brain is like ""you'll be a big chonker if you eat more"" but I know it'll balance out in the end. I'll work on raising my intake, at least on the days I exercise",False,True

I find it quite safe and could make it with semi skimmed milk and egg whites for protein if it would help.,False,True

Complex carbs break down slower in your body. So whole wheat bread etc is going to provide energy over a longer period of time. This article explains it a little. https://healthyeating.sfgate.com/human-body-metabolize-whole-grains-12094.html  I used to think bread was the devil. But these days I accept the calorie bomb, log it as nutrition for my body to do what I want to do, and reap the benefits.   You also need protein to rebuild your muscles and your body in a contact sport.",False,False

Calories = literal energy, and that‚Äôs what your body is going to need. And if you‚Äôre already to the point that you‚Äôre getting the spins and feeling faint; upping your electrolytes will pretty much just help with day-to-day stuff. For Big Shit you sadly do need Food.   And that‚Äôll depend on your individual body and what it needs to run. You might need 500 bonus calories, maybe less, maybe more. It really depends on how you feel and how your body adjusts.  The good news is, strenuous exercise burns hella calories. So if it‚Äôs a comfort, know whatever you‚Äôre intaking is gonna get burned and zeroed out.   As far as specific foods, uhh I dunno. Typical veggies n proteins. Lean meat if you‚Äôre not veggie/vegan. Iron-rich greens like broccoli. ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è I studied bio not nutrition I gotta pass the mic on this one",False,False
