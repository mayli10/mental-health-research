I think I'd just do what they told me. Once you know how to lose weight, it's not that hard to do it again, so you can always just revert after you've gone through it. But at least you'll know how to recover, by yourself, if you really want to later, if you go through the whole program.",False,False

Don't give up yet or assume that you're going home. Try your best today and tomorrow, and see where your team lands.   However, if you feel super alone and like the staff is threatening you, the program itself may not be a good match. Like, it's normal to chafe against recovery; if no one got challenged in those places, few people would improve. But if you're in a pretty threat-based, ""sink or swim"" style recovery program, that may not be right for you. Many people just don't respond to those tactics, and need the staff to titrate challenges in a more empathetic way. If you do get kicked out, or feel like the program isn't helping at all, I would encourage you to look for a program that's a better fit.",False,False

It really doesnt work well to just expect a person to give up all their behaviors and eat as if they're better from day one. I'm sorry this is happening to you. Try to not let it discourage you from continuing to seek recovery,False,False
