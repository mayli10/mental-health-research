I bought them because they were advertised as extra small which I am but they’re SMALLER THAN THAT. I fit into them fully, buttoned and zipped and all ONCE at my lowest weight (109lbs). Now that I’ve gained back like 10-15lbs they don’t even go past my thighs ffs but I’m keeping them as inspiration.  I’ve considered taking a before picture with them now and taking an after when they fit fully again. ",False,False

I even buy \*brand new\* clothes for when I'm thin enough. Which is so stupid, I haven't been at my lowest/goal in like two years.  The fun ( /s ) part is that I fit just fine in all my inspo clothes, but I'm not allowed to wear them until I'm thin enough. And I still complain that I have nothing to wear",False,False

And now when I buy new pants I don't always try them on, just get ones I know will be too small so if I want new clothes I have to lose weight. The result is that I've got a good 5+ pairs of pants/shorts I can't wear yet, and I'm running lower and lower on ones I can wear.",False,False
