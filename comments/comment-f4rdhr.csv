I don't believe in having a reason to bake hahah other than to feel like a domestic queen, plus it's so satisfying watching other people eat your creations. Bring them into work or give them to family, I'm sure someone would appreciate them :)",False,False

Back when I was living with my parents Iâ€™d make my little brother all sorts of nice meals and snacks and I wouldnâ€™t eat shit  I was occupying myself with the delicious, off-limits fatty foods but denying myself any of it.

Itâ€™s definitely not the same as full sugar and fat, but trying recipes with almond/coconut flour, Puyre/swerve, etc makes me feel a little better.  I can eat a bit without too much guilt and itâ€™s not sooo tasty that Iâ€™ll binge on it!",False,False

Iâ€™ve actually shown her some memes from the Ed subreddits (ones that donâ€™t mention any Ed by name) and weâ€™ve laughed over them together, and she messaged me on Facebook a while back to let me know she was at a baby shower and had one piece of chocolate and then forgot they were there instead of obsessing over them because she was having so much fun.  So anyways point of this long story no one asked for is I know one person who at least has a disordered view of food and constantly bakes for people so itâ€™s probably pretty common!",False,False

For me it was ED fueled. I still love to bake but now that I'm recovering, I feel the urge to do it much less often and I'll be okay to eat some of it too. Do yourself a favor, and focus on non food related hobbies until your relationship with food is better. Stay safe love",False,False
