I've been quite underweight so it's kinda hard to hide. I've also had to take time out from work and study so have had to be pretty open about it.,False,False

I've been to treatment, had rapid weight fluctuations, was weird about food in front of people, had to explain strong emotions from comments about my eating and/or body...I guess it just sort of became obvious after awhile.  That being said I rarely speak about it with anyone.  Occasionally my mom will express concern and say some insensitive things about my body but that's it.  To be honest I'm glad everyone just kind of leaves me alone with it.",False,False

I didn't actually get any treatment until I moved out, and even though I did see a therapist a few times while I was in school &amp; still on her health insurance, she didn't know the details.  She did confront me once to ask me whether I was purging - ironically that was the one thing I was not doing. I had been on a crazy binge while home alone and made myself a giant batch of oatmeal cookie dough, but after about half of it I was feeling sick and the urge to binge was gone. Not knowing what to do with the remaining dough, I decided to flush it down the toilet. Apparently I did not clean up well enough, and my mom was convinced it was vomit. Lol.",False,False

When I was a kid with BED, I didn't do a good job hiding the evidence, so my mom knew about the bingeing (she didn't know what BED was though; she thought it was just a gluttonous slob with no self-control, you know?) Anyway, I became depressed and finally got diagnosed with BED at 17, and my mom kind of knew, but thought it was a ""phase"" or not serious. I told a COUPLE very close friends that I had a history with BED, but I didn't admit to actively engaging in any behaviors to anyone until I started purging at 18 or so. At 20, I tell basically everyone now. 1) because my BMI isn't as high, so I feel more ""valid"" because I purge and fast or whatever. 2) It's just been so long and my ED is most of my life rn, so I don't talk to many people in general and 3) Therapy kind of helped me not care about the opinions of others.  I also told my entire public speaking class during the first speech of the semester, which were introductory speeches for ourselves (it was encouraged to speak about our fears, insecurities, etc.), and it was so freeing telling a group of 30 random strangers about the one thing in my life that is fueled by secrecy. It was like wearing my stomach on my sleeves.",False,False

I was close once with a couple of really good friends but I was cut off so I left it. Sober me greatly appreciated that!  Only other people that know are my bff (big mistake) and my gf.  My bff of 10 years I told because I felt everything was (is lmao) falling apart. She expressed anger and sorrow equally. Long story short, we're okay, we're still the bestest of friends, but I definitely notice her watching me closer at mealtimes and when I go to the restroom. It's kind of nice knowing she cares.  My gf is a wildly different story. She's gone through AN a few years ago and is mostly recovered now. She isn't affected by my eating habits (thank god) and eats when she's hungry. But it also brings up my feelings that she's indifferent to what I go through. I guess it's selfish of me to expect a ""did you eat?""  We all like validation hahaha. But yeah. Be careful who you tell. No going back. Wish I never told anyone sometimes.",False,False
