In my case, it has to do with my usual schedule rather than chronological hours. I go to bed around 2 am each day, so any meal I have before that is logged under the X day. However, if I stay up later and I eat something, I'd usually log it under X+1 day. So, logging this particular mean is up to you and your habits imo.",False,False

I figure my body operates on a rolling basis anyhow - putting calorie counts into particular time-bound bins is about my mind. I log each day as starting at midnight. (Does this mean I’ve stayed awake to eat some kcals at 12:01am in the hopes that nutrition will mitigate the insomnia? Yes. Yes it does.),False,False

I routinely eat a substantial meal at 2am and I count it for the previous day, but if I was a normal person who usually sleeps 10pm-6am, and one night I have food past midnight for whatever reason I’d probably add it to that day.",False,False
