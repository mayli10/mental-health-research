So when you wake up in the middle of the night and have the impulse to binge, rather than telling yourself ""No, stop, don't do this"", try telling yourself ""Okay, just wait for a minute. If you want to binge, you can binge, but let's just sit here for one moment first and recognize what is happening. And then if you still want to do it, you can do it.""   And then in that moment, try your best to figure out why you want to binge. Ask yourself: What would happen if I don't binge right now?  For me, the answer is usually ""I'd be alone with my thoughts"", and I can't handle that because my thoughts are of self-hatred and disappointment and regret and embarrassment and every moment I am shoveling food into my mouth is a moment I'm not thinking about those things.  This is why they say that the solution to binging is to figure out the psychological thing that is causing it.  But anyway, there are entire books written on this and this is just my own idea, so take it or leave it.",False,False

At 10:30pm I woke up and ate 3-4 servings of mixed nuts and a few spoonfuls of peanut butter along with a protein shake.

Can you set up decoy snacks like an apple or some crackers that you can plan a head on? I really don't want to encourage you to eat less because there may be some underlying reason you are having these issues. I know being underage makes it hard to get privet medical care without parents finding out. I'm sure that doesn't help your anxieties.   I don't want to try and diagnose you online as I'm not a medical professional; however, I'm also curious what type of food you eat and how soon before bed? Maybe your blood sugar is dropping while you sleep causing you to wake up craving junk food. You could try incorporating a higher protein snack before bed. Maybe even a warm glass of milk/soy milk etc (depending on your preference) before bed.",False,False

It could be that the weight you lost was largely water weight and youve just bounched back to your previous state now that you are eating regularly.    Try to be kind to yourself and remember that your body needs nutrition to heal properly.   If you find you are waking up to eat in the night; I am wondering if you are eating enough durring the day?  Binges or that out of control feeling can be a side effect of restricting.   I hope you feel better soon!,False,False

When I wake up in the middle of the night though it's like I can't stop myself and I binge on high calorie food. Any tips for that?
