It's just a matter of figuring out the ratio between the things I have to work through, and the behaviors he has to change to accommodate me.  For example, if a man eats fewer cals than me on any given day: light triggered because my TDEE is way lower than most men's, and I will start to become anxious about how much I have eaten that day. But that's my problem. I'm not going to try to get him to eat more just for the sake of my emotional well being.   If a man makes an unwanted or thoughtless comment about my body, or looks at a part of my body in a scrutinizing way: big trigger, but that's something he has to stop and never do it again. It's inappropriate regardless of how much or how little he knows about my disorder.",False,False
