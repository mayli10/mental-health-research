Some people fixate on their noses, their lips, their whole face, etc. usually BDD is not only weight related too- you could have it about multiple areas.  Updated to say sorry i at first misunderstood your post. I feel sometimes like i can see my real body but it’s fleeting. I definitely know what you mean about the thighs- i still feel massive despite developing a thigh gap and my pants no longer fitting on my thighs. I see bones and i still don’t feel thin. I see my weight on the scale and think it can’t be real. I wish i could offer some advice but i don’t have any. It’s a mental disorder, and it‘a a tricky little bitch.",False,False
