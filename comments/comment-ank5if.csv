It helps me with the habit of eating mindlessly whenever Iâ€™m bored or stressed. Unfortunately my job now involves me talking on the phone 90% of the time so I canâ€™t chew it much anymore. ,False,False

I tried to quit some time ago because they're full of artificial sweeteners and I couldn't. I literally had an easier time quitting cigarettes than gum. I don't smoke anymore but I still go through a packet of gum everyday ðŸ˜…,False,False

Usually when Iâ€™m not eating or heavily restricting I have some gum in my mouth. In the beginning I usually used gum as a way to disguise the smell of bile on my breath but now itâ€™s just a habit ,False,False

I think it's partially a comfort thing (always worried about my breath, particularly when restricting and drinking too much coffee) and the oral fixation. V much part of my rituals now.

Now my jaw pops every time I open and close my mouth. A few years ago, it used to be bad enough that my jaw would freeze in place a few times a day. I almost never touch gum anymore, and when I do, I spit it out after about 20 minutes. It got better, but it hasn't gone away and probably never will.  I have to say, of all the ED side effects I expected, that was never on the list. ",False,False
