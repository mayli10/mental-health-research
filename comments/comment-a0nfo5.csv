The number of binges I have has been greatly reduced. I'm not hungry for most of the day so i tend to do OMAD. It's been like a miracle drug for me. I'm finally losing weight.  I was on topiramate for another thing (bipolar disorder) but would not recommend it. It has the tendency to make you forget your words mid sentence, lose all short term memory, and just generally seem less intelligent. ",False,False
