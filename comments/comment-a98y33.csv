My cousin use to have an ED, and I was so jealous of the way she looked. Being 13 now, things have changed, she doesnt have an ED anymore but I do.... And now ive grown taller than her and skinnier. Its like the jealousy switched and now she hates seeing me eat less or change in front of her. But now from that ive learned from both prespectives and it sucks. Just remeber your cousin isnt doing this to hurt you, shes doing it because of a mental illness. You both just share the same one. Sorry if that was a little confusing I'm a little light headed right now ",False,False
