Its sounds bad but restricting made me feel safe because I knew I wasnt gaining and with meals plans sometimes I feel like I'm overeating or maybe I really am. And it's scary. It makes me obsessive.  I hope u figure something out tooâ™¡,False,False

At first I attempted to meticulously plan out my food and calories so I stay at my weight but it just didn't work. I still obsessed over food. And since I live with my family I don't always know what I am going to eat. Its so fucking hard not to think about the calories in your next meal.   And I agree with OP It can lead to grazing, binging etc in some ppl. And honestly it's just scary. My doctor just tells me to push through but it's so hard. I can manage 3 meals now, and i usually end up grazing throughout the day. I hate it, because it makes me feel fat and undeserving of my meals.  I wish u and everyone else luck though. I feel like there's still a chance at recovery, even though it feels like its rock bottom.",False,False

If you're underweight right now, some of the obsession over food may be your body's innate biological desire to survive. Would something like 4 bigger meals a day work for you? Is that an option?",False,False

I recently made the connection between the size of the meals I eat and the phenomenon of food comas. With the amount of food they make you eat in recovery, you're stuck in an endless food coma. Even if you didn't spend all day eating, you spend all day sleeping off the grogginess.",False,False

My life revolves around food *at least* as much in recovery, if nor more, and I can't handle it. I hope you can figure something out xx",False,False
