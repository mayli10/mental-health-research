My boyfriend is naturally super skinny and the reason is because he never eats (doesn't have an ED, just doesn't have food issues). He'll have a bag of chips with salsa during the day then come home and have some popcorn and be fine. He says he just doesn't get that hungry and/or forgets to eat. I can't even imagine.

Seriously, I get told that by a couple of ladies at work pretty regularly.   It isn't luck, it isn't genetics. I pay (way way way too much) attention to how much I eat and exercise. It's effort and conscientious work.   I get that they want their weight to be something out of their control, but damn, does it ever bother the hell out of me.",False,False

Metabolism is such a small part of weight that it’s become such an excuse for many people. Calories in versus calories out is what it’s all about.   People whom are seen as having a high metabolism (IME) are usually people that eat one large meal In the company of others, then move a lot/eat very little for the rest of the day. ",False,False
