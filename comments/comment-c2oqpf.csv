All of his opinions are based on nothing but his own creepy prejudices and fetishes and his actual understanding of *any* topic could fill a teaspoon. I'm really sorry his dumbass opinions on EDs stuck with you - I promise his views are not the views of the majority of people. He's a special brand of shit.",False,False

For what it‚Äôs worth ‚Äì my partner and I are both in recovery and were both at lower weights when we met. It‚Äôs definitely **hard** for me to accept/believe that she likes my body at a recovered weight, but she tells me she does all the time... and I do have the ‚Äòproof‚Äô of how I feel about hers. I absolutely 100% sincerely find her even more attractive at a recovered weight. Not saying that to be politically correct or anything; it‚Äôs the truth. So it truly is possible, I can tell you from both sides. Nothing about living with this shit is easy, but you‚Äôre not inherently doomed to never find someone who can love your natural body &lt;3",False,False

He's done so much for drama, mainly negative attention. He has so many issues and thinks his opinion is right because ""this is what I think and honesty is a great policy bla bla bla."" I used to watch his videos when I was a teen too due to the shock factor, but it got old pretty fast. I don't know if he's ever said/done anything fully acceptable tbh.  I feel you. Honestly, I relate-- not to that specific thing, but his harsh opinions about anything, mainly womens bodies basically made me believe that everyone is judging me as bad as he is and it made me super self conscious. Fuck him",False,False

I‚Äôm seriously dating for the first time in my life at age 24, and it‚Äôs terrifying, but it feels like there‚Äôs a light at the end of the tunnel. That maybe one day I could love someone and be loved by them and love myself. But it‚Äôs a daily struggle. I hope you can get there someday, OP. I hope we both can.",False,False
