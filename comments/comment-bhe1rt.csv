I kind of regret saying that now though, because it's been triggering for me recently to see his parents because ""I'm too fat for an ED"" even though it wasn't at the time. Although, he sometimes raises his voice about my ED when I'm on the phone with him, and the walls in his house are very thin, so they probably would have found out that way eventually anyway.  They don't really pry or anything though, and I guess that's what the difference is between my situation and yours. The fact that he mom said that about you is just.. :/ idk ..not ideal",False,False

If she was really worried she would probably sit down with me somewhere alone and talk about it.   &amp;#x200B;  As for distractions, I'm probably going to see her tomorrow when I go to hangout with my BF. He seemed worried about his sister when I texted him about it so I think he has the same mindset as me right now",False,True

If it helps, look at what else she knows about you now. She knows that you were worried about her kid, and divulged something deeply personal to try to warn her about it.  I hope his mom has enough tact and respect to not bring your part of this up again unless you do first. But still...if all you can feel is AAAAAAAAAA, I would too haha.",False,False
