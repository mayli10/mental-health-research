A fresh grilled chicken breast or, even better, a lean Filet mignon, cooked with NO butter, a side of amazing rice, and fresh steamed broccoli. If you dont like the rice get a slow baked sweet potato dry with butter on the side.  OMG the food there is so good. I believe you could have sucked it up and sat with your family, but that is just my opinion.  Ps. Their salads are even served in a chilled bowl. Ugh, just tell a manager to fix your ugly salad.",False,False

I just couldnâ€™t bare the noise or smell anymore. Iâ€™m not a veggie though, I just prefer healthy food and places like that just simply do not accommodate. My family wasnâ€™t mad with me at least and they were glad that I at least came and tried to sit in there.",False,True
