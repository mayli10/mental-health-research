Thank you so much for your reply. It is so tough. I really hope you find recovery. Our EDS will always tell us were not good enough. I actually just graduated college. I never thought I'd graduate and still have an ED. Im disappointed in myself. I'll definitely read that book. Stay strong and Im sending hugs. &lt;3,False,True

I keep feeling like I’m too fat to have an ED even though I’m like 10lbs underweight. It’s all very shitty no matter what or how you feel. I wish you the best! :) I hope that you can figure out how to quit the awful binging, I can’t force myself to binge. I used to when I was 15 and going through bulimia. Now I just restrict myself. I used to purge all the time and that is the closest thing to hell anyone could ever experience. I know how the guilt hurts you and I feel awful that people have to deal with it.  Idk what to say, just keep going and get through and graduate college, I’m going to be a senior in Highschool soon and with my grades, it would be disservice to drop out because of my Ed. You’ve made it further in life than me so keep your head up. I’ve been reading books related to Eating disorders such as the ones written by Jenni Schaefer, check them out they’re great reads.   Anyways, stay strong, I feel for you! 🙏💯☝️",False,False

I know I’m a stranger on the Internet, but for what it’s worth, I’m so so proud of you for scheduling an appointment. You deserve to recover. I’m sorry they don’t always keep your disorder in mind—if you ever need to vent, you can ALWAYS dm me! Stay strong.💕",False,False

I’m so sorry you are going through the same thing. It sucks that in order to get real help (like inpatient/outpatient) covered by your insurance, you have to be skinny enough. The whole thing is SO triggering. I decided to accept the help and scheduled my appointment with the mental health provider instead. It’s nice having support from my family, but sometimes they still talk about weight and calories (triggers) in our group chat without keeping my disorder in mind. It’s hard ):",False,True
