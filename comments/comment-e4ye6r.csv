Like what am I supposed to do with all this *time* now that I’m not b/ping. It’s like part of my soul has been ripped out. And any other activity I try to replace it with just doesn’t equate and fill the void as adequately as my ED. So I find myself inevitably going back to it. It has become a warm security blanket that gives me comfort and a *home* feeling. It’s kind of sad/scary how ingrained it is. Nothing else can replace it.,False,False
