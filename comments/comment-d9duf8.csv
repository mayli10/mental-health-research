Is she describing things in a way that seems like she’s venting or asking for help? Because that might be her way of reaching out and she may need some support!   When I first started struggling with ED I didn’t know how to ask for help. I remember eventually starting to “open up” about things that were troubling me to a close friend. I started out by just “venting” about how much “dieting” sucks because I couldn’t focus at work. She actually expressed concern by explaining to me that a diet shouldn’t be making me feel so shitty, and that helped me feel valid that my ED was a problem.   She never diagnosed me or even mentioned an eating disorder. But she did express concern for my well being and offered to listen and support me. If she had just brushed it off I may have believed my experience with “dieting” was normal and that I should continue to suck it up.  However; If your coworker isn’t really trying to **confide** in you, but you are just picking up on her behaviors from the sidelines, then I wouldn’t say anything!",False,False

If I’m right what did calling them out accomplish? Especially since I’d be exposing myself at the same time... A lot of weight loss programs/ methods/ diets (IF, CICO) involve behavior that people with EDs do (like eating one meal, skipping breakfast, calorie counting) so in the end... who knows why others are doing it?",False,False

I recognise it mentally but my brain is so disordered and unhealthy I feel like acknowledging it would make us both worse.   Plus I absolutely don’t want to talk about mine with anyone I know. It’s personal and private and part of the positive feelings it gives me is from it being secret. Which is fucked up, but again, I know I’m a disordered bitch so here we are. If I told someone I’d feel the need to get more extreme in private to get that feeling of privacy going. That’s a road back to purging and I don’t want to go there again.",False,False

I think for a lot of people (myself included) an ED is something they would rather keep private.,False,False
