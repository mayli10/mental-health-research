I don‚Äôt prepare it myself, I just eat it straight from the jar as soon as it gets winter-y outside. There are different variations with apples or cranberries. Its low in calories so it‚Äôs safe for me   My other favorite food are spiced cookies (‚ÄúSpekulatius‚Äù ) which are ridiculously high in calories though and somehow can‚Äôt be bought in small packages and always trigger a binge for me lol. But they‚Äôre so tasty. ",False,False

We have a 'traditional' (our families tradition) lunch with ham, chicken, and a variety of different salads (including pasta salad and potato salad). It's usually buffet style so I can choose my own portions, which is amazing. Then we put all the effort into dessert. A few years ago I made a jelly snow globe with a mango sugar free jelly base and filled with cherries and whipped cream with a gelatin globe on top, I did decorate it with a mini gingerbread house and men but that was for the others to eat. There was also a homemade fruitcake. Honestly I can't wait to see what is done this year. I'm going to do a maintenance day on Christmas.",False,False
