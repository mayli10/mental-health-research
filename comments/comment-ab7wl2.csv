I've had weeks where I averaged 125 grams of fiber a day and single days over 200 (keep in mind I'm an active male and need a lot of calories). At one point In was eating FiberOne Original cereal 2x a day consistently, each bowl would be 3-4 servings...you do the math, that's like 95-100 grams of fiber right there...on top of all the whole grains, salads, psyllium husk mixed with everything...etc. And hot sauce on everything. Still only pooped once every few days and rock solid.  Regaining digestive motility has been one of the slowest and most annoying parts of recovery for me. When your body wants to slow things down to try to extract more calories from your food, I think it just stops caring what's in it.",False,False
