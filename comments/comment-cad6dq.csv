If it helps: based on what I know, it's normal to have extreme hunger and binge after restricting, especially when you're in recovery for a restrictive ED, even if you're at a ""healthy"" weight. Your body is reaching out for the nutrition and energy it needs to sustain you and work on repairs. It doesn't necessarily mean that you've developed BED and it would likely help to feed the extreme hunger until it naturally tapers off.   Besides, the diet mentality involved in restricting certain foods can also make them seem more attractive, which can contribute to future binges. (At least for me.) I've read somewhere that if you truly give yourself full permission to eat anything you want, you'd gradually stop bingeing or having intense cravings for a particular kind of food.   I'd advise you to stop restricting but I know how hard that can be :( but in any case stay strong, and good luck for recovery ❤️",False,False
