I used to binge when I was trying other people's methods but I much prefer to just not eat most times so I can eat whatever I want during special occasions!,False,True

I am not quite anorexic, not quite orthorexic but some weird hybrid of very nutritionally conscious forever dieter who fasts for days and restricts pretty heavily.    I don't have body dysmorphia, I know exactly what I look like. I am not an unhappy person. I don't hate the way I look. I am not depressed or anxious in any way, I just want to be thin and eat whatever I want on vacation without hating myself.    That's another thing. I don't have unplanned binges. I PLAN my binges. On purpose. And never falter.  It is always a family event or vacation of some sort where there will be tons of expensive and fancy food that will be worth it. Then I indulge the whole time and I fucking love every minute. Then I don't feel bad afterwards. I just fast afterward to lose the weight.     So honestly I don't quite fit in here or in normal society either. These people at least get where I am coming from and don't treat me like a freak.     So welcome.",False,False

It's pretty straightforward. I know that when I don't lose its because what I ate, and when I eat I know that that is slowing weight loss... No freak outs... I don't even weigh myself that often. The number doesn't matter, only that my clothes get looser and I keep looking smaller",False,True

I was never overweight, but a good 150/160 pounds at 5'9/5'10. I had low self esteem, went to 500cals a day, lost like 35 pounds, I was fantastic. Then I met my boyfriend and gained back like 15 pounds.   When I'm with him I still eat normally. Eating with or around others to not look disordered doesn't stress me out, I don't obsess over the 23 calories in my energy drink or water weight. Obsessing over calories like that makes me shove snacks down my throat at the end of the day and gives me hunger pangs- if I count them just on the side and make sure they don't go over a certain limit, I'm okay.  I sometimes feel like I'm a 'healthy' anorexic, or like this is a diet that I'll never really forget or end, but that I can put on hold for as long as I want to. All I know though is that I do want to be skinny, so I just try.",False,False
