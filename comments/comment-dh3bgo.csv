Ya know? And my little, but she lives with me haha and I feel like she would’ve come to me herself. I don’t know. I want to KNOW WHO SAID SOMETHING but obviously I cannot haha. It also just makes me nervous that they all talk about me and people who “know” tell other girls and then they know too. Ah. Stress",False,True

Whenever another sister seems to be struggling (ED related or otherwise), people are always going to the board to express their concerns. It's sweet to know that people care about your health/wellbeing, but it's also such an uncomfy experience being called out like that.   That being said, you shouldn't feel unwelcome at sisterhoods or other sorority events at ALL. You may feel like everyone's eyes are on you, but I promise you that they are not.   First and foremost, your sisters are there to support you; they care about you and they want to spend time with you. If the support you need right now is NOT getting help with your ED (even if that's what you might ""need"" physically or in the long run), your sisters and friends can still be there for you in so many other ways. Please don't feel like you need to shut them out.",False,False

Someones health is their own private business as far as I'm concerned. I'm not sure if that's disordered AF but idk :\\,False,False
