I feel for you! Imo for therapy, this relevation is an addict's version of ""recognizing you have a problem."" Now you can really take steps to fix it.   I know I'm an internet stranger, lol.

Therapy doesn't ""work,"" ie therapy isn't doing the heavy lifting here. You are :c   For me it was really hard to accept that I was the only thing going to make me better. Like I'm the only one who controls my actions, and nobody can control the thoughts in my head or how I feel. I can manage how I feel but no one else can. Pills are a good band-aid, but do you want to reply on them forever? Therapy is a tool, but it's like a chisel while you're both the mallet and the stone.   Lo siento :c ",False,False

Tbh I don't like the word recovery. I feel like an Ed will always be a part of you (I've recovered diy style for a few years before)-- I think Ed's are just managed and it's simply possible to find ways to control your food to satisfy your needs and for it but doing so without dangerous behaviors. Most people I know who are recovered are still obsessed with food and their bodies and their intakes their behaviors are just less dangerous. Its hard, but you can do it!

And Yeah I know it's not magic, I'm starting to realize that. I am setting unrealistic expectations for myself. It's partially because of my mom. She wants this over with and acts like it can be cleaned up in no time. I have to stop listening to her. She doesn't want me to be sick, I get that but it's also not like the flu. She thought the medicine would fix everything. ",False,True

When it comes to eating disorder, addiction, obesity, etc anything that's a really bad habit that messes with the functionality and quality of life chances of recovery are like 5% with or without therapy. I think it's more how badly you want to be better. Therapy is really just a bunch of guesses and a soft science that are still in development and i think understanding of helping people with these problems while making a lot of progress is something that still has a lot to be desired. I mean think about it no even 100 years ago we were locking women in rooms for being hysterical, we've come a little bit of a ways but we're still in a big transitional period of learning what actually works.

I needed 120mg of prozac because I'm an over-metabolizer. It's a thing. I've been inpatient only for suicidal thoughts (three times hahahahaha) so I don't know if it would help bulimia but something tells me you are so deep you really need the break from real life. I would consider it, idk. As far as outpatient, definitely do it. You really seem like you are in crisis and things can normalize with help.

Recovery is sooooo slow and it so isnâ€™t perfect. 3 months is such a short time and you probably wonâ€™t see any difference which is so normal! I was still purging once a day around that time. Itâ€™s okay. You deserve time to change and heal. Iâ€™ve been in therapy for over a year now and Iâ€™ve only recently seen the changes and I know that sounds like too long but the thing is itâ€™s a lasting recovery. You will get there and you are learning so much. ,False,False
