From what I can understand it has something to do with enzymes in your stomach constantly not being able to do their job in taking in nutrients due to the act of purging. So when you do take in alcohol it’s an irritant and your body naturally goes into the state of “time to get rid of this” ,False,False

In college a few friends thought I was an alcoholic because they would always hear me throwing up/I would throw up whenever I got drunk......they meant well but they were very accusatory.  Before I go out I try to eat a ton of veggies with a bit of chicken and rice.  It feels healthy so I’m less likely to purge it but the carbs and the protein help me absorb the alcohol.,False,False
