I was really lucky to hit the jackpot on my first try  (2mg escitalopram daily. And xanax as needed for panic attacks, which are now very rare)      They definitely help me, I don't have as many intrusive awful thoughts, and if I do, they're easier to just brush off. It used to just be that I'd feel bad, or feel numb, it didn't get better than that. And while I do still have lows, they're not as bad, I don't feel like offing myself all the time. I'm less quick to get irritable, or upset, it's like I'm able to just roll with the punches. My general mood is what I'd call contentment.     I don't really have any negative side effects. I guess really vivid nightmares if I miss too many days in a row.  I've never felt like I'm addicted (I don't think that's a side effect of escitalopram, thankfully)     Lots of love to you, I hope you can find something that gets you out of the low, whatever it is. All the best&lt;3",False,False

It is possible, and you will just have to be honest with your psych to get what works for you",False,False
