My immediate reaction to ""try tomorrow with no restriction"" was ""fuck no, I promised myself I'd finish this 7-day fast"", and then I saw the rest of your comment. Now just to do some more soul-searching to see exactly WHY I need to finish the 7 days.   Thank you, I think I needed this.",False,True

It’s part of the disorder, self-doubt. You could have someone in inpatient who checks every ED box and they’d have doubts too.   I want to be able to think 800 cals is too much once again. If I hit 801, I want to be able to push myself to go walk for an hour as punishment. Instead, I round down and say fuck it or overeat anyway. There were days when I would purge a single bite of food because I wanted to be empty and pure.   I feel like a fake even though I know I’m not. There is still a sane voice in my head saying “you know damn well what things are disordered” and it’s right. I don’t have any good advice, but you’re not alone in these feelings. ",False,False

No question about that.   Your ""record"" is enough to prove it and is extremly dangerous. I am not going to say that you need to get help.   I am saying that you need to go and talk to a friend about this if you want to. Try to accept that you DO have a problem. And that you can be helped if you let others.   Tl;dr there is no question, you have an ED. Talk to a friend about it.   If not, then there is always reddit where a stranger like me will always be there to help others. ",False,False

Normal people don't starve themselves and want to keep doing it like us. I'm going to guess if someone tried to force you to stop, you'd fight against it.   Hell, try tomorrow with no restriction. Or even the next meal, and **no** compensating with exercise or fasts for that meal later on. If a defensive 'fuck no' response or a bunch of excuses came to mind, chances are you can't stop by yourself. Because you, or your disorder, doesn't want to.

I feel like the behaviors + the mindset are what makes someone disordered.

I just had a moment of ‘clarity’ yesterday where I realized that I don’t have an ED and I’m actually just a huge faker. I then proceeded to have two mugs of laxative tea and finished logging my 578 cals for the day (felt pathetic for eating eating so much at dinner). ,False,False
