I have a friend that went through the same thing. I think that visiting the place of my childhood brought back alot of those memories and feelings and that led me to spiral. But, self-awareness in that regard is a step in the direction of recovery. We’re strong enough, we’re worthy enough to be healthy.",False,False

It made me feel better. I’m sorry, it’s not easy for us, I draw a lot of my negative thoughts from childhood as well, but I was a skinny kid, everybody and their sister commented on it, I was THE skinny kid, it the only thing anybody ever commented on, whether it be positive or negative, I had other traits, but it was all my weight and that was my identity. I puffed up at puberty and suddenly I was the fat girl, the pudge, hefty, it caused an identity crisis naturally, I didn’t feel special anymore.  I hope you had a good trip otherwise. Visiting California is a dream of mine coming from a Canadian girl.  Stay strong hon, you’re not that little girl anymore, you’re a strong courageous young woman and you’ve got this.",False,True

Growing up, I was definitely an overweight kid - maybe not necessarily obese, but definitely on track to get there, especially when I moved from California to the South. Everything here is fried, and our financial struggles didn’t allow for my parents to really invest in a super healthy lifestyle.   I’ve always been self-conscious about my weight. I remember having self loathing thoughts at 4 years old. But I don’t consider my ED symptoms (like, actions, really) to have shown until around 7th/8th grade. (for reference, I’m a junior in high school.)  We visit California periodically, but we didn’t have alot of money from when I was 12-16, so we took four years between trips rather than our usual every-other-year schedule. The last time I’d been to California, I was still a chubby kid. At 16, I’ve lost alot of weight since, (per my ED, obviously) and consider myself to be in pseudo-recovery now, but I still have tough moments.   Leading up to the trip, I couldn’t get the image of my childhood self out of my head, and my body dysmorphia started acting up almost to the point that it was at the peak of my anorexia two years ago. I restricted and worked out vigorously, took ASV pills, anything I could do to lose more before our trip back. I’d known that I’d lost weight since the last time I visited, but I wanted so badly to prove myself.   Well, my restricting came to a halt pretty much when we got there. I was eating in healthy amounts of the food that our family made and that we went out to eat.   That is, until our last day.   Never in my life had I binged to that extent before. I’d thought that I was going to die at one point - maybe thats dramatic but it was scary as fuck. On a day-long road trip, we went by In N Out and Jamba Juice in the morning and afternoon, Dutch Bros on our way back, and then my cousin had her 16th birthday party. All of that combined food and bloat from throughout the day gave me so much anxiety that I began chugging water bottles - as I always do when my weight gets to my head.   Soon, my stomach was ballooned so far out that even attempting to suck in was painful. It hurt to move. It hurt to breathe. And I decided I couldn’t handle the pain anymore and went to the bathroom and hurled my guts out, multiple times.   I was still bloated as a fuck after but the pain and ballooning had gone away. Nobody knew that I’d thrown up, but after eating so much, I felt pathetic. Like all progress had been lost.   On a lighter note, I haven’t binged since (although, that was never really a problem with me to begin with - mostly it was over-restricting.) And I restricted and exercised again before Prom and, no binge after.",False,False
