If you want, you can check out my post with my projection tool/spreadsheet. That's what I've been using to help me see things more realistically and remember that one day is not going to end the world (even if that's what it feels like).",False,False

Try OMAD (one meal a day) if youâ€™re open to it. Sleep in if you can, drink water or coffee. Go to an earlier dinner if possible and eat whatever you want until youâ€™re full. Then try to make it to the end of the day without snacking or anything, and if you do keep it low cal. :) thereâ€™s a subreddit, r/OMAD if you want to check it out.   Itâ€™ll keep you disciplined, and you can enjoy your meal and time with your family with less worries!",False,False

This past weekend I ate 1500, then 1200, then 1500 again (that last 1500 was mostly consumed in proseco and low cal kettle corn at the beach ðŸ™ƒ). Guess what? Iâ€™m the same weight as three days ago. Eating at maintenance or allowing yourself a day or two of eating out DOESNâ€™T undo your progress. I still worry as well that Iâ€™m going to wake up and suddenly all of the weight Iâ€™ve lost is going to be back overnight but this is just your eating disorder talking to you. I did go to the gym, sauna, and do some hot yoga in between to work out any water weight that I may retain after eating relatively unclean, but if you gain anything.. thatâ€™s all it is and itâ€™s going to go away. You can and deserve to give in to some Mexican food to celebrate Motherâ€™s Day, and then be back on your bullshit like nothing happened. I find that with restricting between 800-900, I donâ€™t have any terrible side effects from eating. Enjoy yourself and HAPPY MOTHERS DAY!! ðŸ¥°",False,False
