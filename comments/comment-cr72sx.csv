I used to like it too because I’m like oh haha I lost my voice bc of my ED and no one knows. Hasn’t happened in a while, kind of don’t want it to again but yeah definitely a disordered thought.",False,False

However, I can tell you that chronically purging after more than a few years will make you realize that there's nothing but shame in purging. Whether that's when your teeth yellow, your mouth develops open sores, your blood sugar crashes daily, or you lose your sense of fullness/hunger... the pride goes away. I remember the thrill I felt the first year of purging; now its been 8 years and I just wish I could die most days.",False,False
