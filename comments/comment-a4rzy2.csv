You just add water (I add some stevia because it’s not so sweet to me) and bam! You got yourself 50 cal peanut butter for 2 tablespoons instead of 200 cals. ,False,False

I wouldn't even force myself to finish it if I was full. It's just the unrestricted eating of it without caring that each spoonful has 105 calories or that it's making me fat. ,False,True

It could be healthier and don’t have to make a lot, so you don’t eat it all. I’m craving so hard peanut butter too lately, but I live alone and buying a jar means I’ll try to eat it all in a sit thinking “I have to finish all food in order to stop eating like a pig”.",False,False
