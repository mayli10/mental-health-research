I was way happier at 118 lbs @ 5’7 than I am fluctuating between 96-98  The flucations &amp; food weight are so much more visible now  I wish I could go back to muscular @ 118 than be where I am now bc Now I’m only happy at 95.8. Even tho I know it’s psycho  I ate so much the last 2 days and was at 97.2 and 96.6 and was disappointed even tho normally I’m way more ,False,False

I’m already super underweight &amp; I’ll be happy at a low weight and then as soon as I hit a new low, nothing else is acceptable. Like I hit a super super low weight the other day (like lower than middle school weight &amp; im 24 years old w 2 kids) and now I’m not happy with anything but that.   A few months ago I’d be happy like 4-6 lbs heavier &amp; now that would make me miserable to be at that weight. I even know I’m being fucking psycho. I know I’m too skinny. But I see myself as a fat ass. ",False,False
