I would keep an eye out on those things and your blood pressure. Sweating though, could probably be from heat because i noticed i felt hot during binges.",False,False

I’ve been making my binges more “functional” (i.e., I can’t keep “fun” food in my dorm so I binge on Gardein veggie patties and frozen burritos), don’t know if that plays a role, but I guess I’ll see. The sweats and the heart pounding...was that something you experienced? I thought I was having a heart attack for a moment here. ",False,True

When i was like 114lbs i binged like all day and night and literally could not gain weight for the longest time. My weight actually dropped 7 lbs. Wasnt good as it sounds because the only reason i wasnt gaining real weight was because,, my body was trying to use the food to repair. I had b12 and iron deficiency, along with a weekend immune system. ",False,False

When I had my bloods done my thyroid levels are  normal but near the overactive borderline, which partly explains why during my most recent relapse I was on over 1600cal/day and still only 42kg and why it was not easy for me to restore. The other part of the explanation is simply overestimating how much you eat/need. When we condition ourselves to ED, particularly AN we get a distorted sense of what is normal amount and what seems like a massive binge to us is relatively not that much.",False,False
