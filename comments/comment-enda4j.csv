If youâ€™re hungry and craving peanut butter though, it could be a sign that your body is in desperate search for the fat and sugars that are in peanut butter. Thatâ€™s typically why itâ€™s considered such a common binge food, because it has the perfect concoction of ingredients inside it that make our brains crave it when weâ€™re hungry (I also read once that ice cream is similar in regards to that).",False,False
