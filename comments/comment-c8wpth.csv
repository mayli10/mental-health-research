It sounds like she was really hurting and her baby passing does sounds like the trigger. My heart goes out to you, because this situation shows just how terrible and difficult it can be when death causes pain that gets passed along.   I think it’s really hard for any of us to fathom the type of pain a mother feels when they lose their child- it goes against the natural order of life, you know? Like there is a word for children who’ve lost their parents (orphan) but no word really for parents who’ve lost their children.  Even though it’s such a shitty, shitty event, there is some comfort in knowing she was with someone who loved her and was there with her til the last even when she was scared because she’d made a mistake. I want you to take some deep breaths and remember that you shouldn’t blame yourself. There’s a million things that could have happened differently, but you weren’t the cause. I know it can be so disorienting and panic inducing thinking about how she used to be here, and to have that incredible shock that her story isn’t continuing.   It’s okay to be angry and to take time to grieve. I know the whole 5 stages of grief is widely known but in reality that grief will wax and wane for a while because I can tell you cared for her. The randomest things in strangers might trigger a memory of her, be gentle on yourself, the way she’d probably hope you’ll be. I found it helped me to talk to them in my mind, as if they’re still around.",False,False

She lost a baby last year, he had a horrendous disability that left him without a spinal chord so had to be... put to sleep? I can’t think of a kind term for aborted. I am 99% sure that was the trigger (if it isn’t obvious) as it was the 1st anniversary and she was found wrapped around his ashes.  She called my friend saying she’d made a mistake, so he was with he in the ambulance when she passed. He loved her more than I’ve ever seen somebody love someone, they just hadn’t gotten together yet.   Yet. Such a stupid word.  I literally want to pull my hair out, I can’t believe I’ll never see her again because she fucked up while drunk",False,True
