I like to measure every part of my body. My scale does my weight, my bone mass, my muscle mass, my body fat, my body water percentage, and calculates my BMI and sends the data to my phone. I know that having all of these numbers is bad for my ED, but I LOVE counting.",False,False

It's almost like I have a weird OCD- style comfort with numbers (good numbers = a good day, bad numbers = anxiety), with many things, not just my weight.   For me, my ED was often about control and getting what I thought were ""perfect, simple, clean, crisp"" numbers. Whether it was calories, grams of fat, or my weight, it was the numbers I counted over and over in my head, or hyper focused on. It made getting help very hard, as a few therapists couldn't comprehend that I actually loved how my body naturally looked, and that I wasn't trying to loose weight to be pretty, ""taking it too far"" or something.   For me? Numbers are just soothing.",False,False
