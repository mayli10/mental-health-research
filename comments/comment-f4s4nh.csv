Some low cal bread or some other carb would definitely be the best but better some veggies than nothing!  Please take care of yourself and don't ever feel pressured to drink, even if it's the standard procedure to get drunk on Karneval",False,False

But that way you look like your drinking &amp; it saves you from awkwardly explaining why you don’t wanna drink. But if you do decide you decide to drink definitely have something in your body. Higher fat/carb foods are definitely better at “absorbing” the alcohol but if you were to have like a plain baked potato &amp; veggies you’d be better off than having nothing. &amp; if you drink a cup of water for every alcoholic drink you have it’ll also make a world of a difference in slowing how fast you drink, diluting what is in your body, &amp; preventing a hangover!! Be safe &amp; have fun 😊",False,False
