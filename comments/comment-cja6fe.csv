I felt similar to the way you described the first few days, and thought that there was no way it had worked so fast. After the first few days it started causing me a lot of anxiety, but that has decreased over time, and now I feel like it’s working. For the first time in a long time I’m not constantly thinking about food, I’ve been restricting less, and I feel I can trust my brain to tell me to eat when I’m hungry and stop when I’m full. I read online that it can cause a decrease in appetite so I’m not sure if that’s what’s causing me to not focus on food as much as I usually do, but I guess it could be. I still have disordered thoughts, but they no longer consume me. I can laugh with my family, see beauty in the world around me, and I finally feel like myself again. Wishing you all the best &lt;3",False,False
