I also think it’s probably pretty accurate, despite what people say. They use the formula that leads to the fewest calories and it always pretty much matches what the TDEE sites say for the activity levels. Today I barely had any exercise (like 2k steps) because of a snowstorm and it told me I burned only 1521 calories and my BMR is 1322. When I walk at a high heartrate and reach 10k steps for the day it estimates about 1850. Knowing that seems to help me eat a little more on exercise days tbh.",False,False
