I just eat few calories. Carbs and sugar are my bad foods so i tend to stay away from them during the week and Saturdays i will have a little.,False,False

My fats generally hover around 40-50g as well. Fiber varies greatly from day to day. But 10g minimum, I try for 20g. I eat a lot of veggies, tofu, yogurt, oatmeal, fruit, and nuts. (moderation on the nuts, but they're good for getting in healthy fats) I try to be as healthy as I can be within my calorie limit.",False,False

I don't consider my restriction to be as extreme as some. I still consume around 800cal a day and I make sure what I eat is healthy. So I haven't had any issues.,False,False

Take beano or gasx till you acclimate.    Be warned though, getting used to high volume makes it reaaaaaallllly bad when you fall off the wagon and can consume twice as many cals in junk food as you could before.",False,False

But a few is totally fine on something that's already high vol, low cal. I only put 10g of almonds on my yogurt. That's 57 cal. They're there for some crunch and some healthy fats and a little bit of added protein. I may be disordered af, but I'm still trying to be healthy within my calorie limit. Those 57 calories didn't break me. My whole day was still under 800 :')",False,False

Oatmeal topped with fruit and nuts. Stir fry loaded with veggies + tofu. Those are all high vol, low cal. Those are a few of my go-to safe foods. I've posted in the EDfood sub with recipes for all of them. Quest bars are great as well for fiber and protein. I bake them into cookies or just heat them in the microwave for a bit.",False,False
