And now that I'm semi-recovered, I thought the friends would magically pop back into my life, but turns out if you isolate yourself for a year to starve/binge/purge, people tend to fade away.   For the people I did tell during a drunk moment, now I can't handle being around them without cringing with embarrassment. ",False,False

I’m so jealous of people who have supportive friends and can talk about it openly.   Only my exes know - the first guy just completely didn’t understand or didn’t care. The second guy was a lot better about it but he used to make jokes like “you going to throw that up later?”. Makes him sound like an asshole but he was actually very supportive about it all. ,False,False
