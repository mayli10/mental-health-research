I never thought that movies with ED plot lines were made *for* people with EDs nor have I ever expected most of them to have an educational goal.  I’ve avoided watching “To the Bone” the same way i’be avoided “Starving in suburbia” and “For the love of Nancy”.

Also, I’m someone who’s been battling AN for a long time so I’m not a good representation of how the general public sees it.

If these movies are okay, ED movies shouldn’t be off limits.    ***  You don’t “catch” anorexia as if it’s a virus; the bodies many Anorexics see as aspirational or “invalidating” 😐... often causes the general public feel either pity or disgust.

Clearly I got a little carried away with it and it turned into a vent/rant though. Though it’s a little much I’m probably gonna keep venting my opinion on this when it’s relevant and proper to o so since I feel like I’m the only one talking about this side of the argument.  ED groups are a little ridiculous sometimes imo. People are expectant of and hyper vigilant about glorification/proanas. As result it seems like people “*see*” it when it’s not even there.  It’s well known that *some* people like being obsessive gamblers, think drug abuse is fun, feel justified in being an alcoholic, are complacent with being unhealthy, and glorify overconsumption + obesity, latter actually has groups based around it (Ex.HAES).   However, it dont see a lack of a sense of humor, obsessive policing or a lot of indirect shaming (“ewww” “crinnnggeee”) in their support group spaces.   In which, the behavior treats people with EDs (*especially anorexia*) are somehow special and unique, in that we are more likely to be naíve, arrogant, and/or complacent individuals than anyone else— imo we aren’t. We’re just like everyone else who may be sick and struggling     ***  ***Only relevant to this subreddit*** :   The way I perceive it; it’s probably* very unlikely* someone is at all proud of their problem if they saw a group named “***EDAnonymous***” and went through a though process that brought them to the conclusion it would be a good place for them. So the suspicion/vigilance is less warranted than usual.   The name is witty and blunt because the second you see it you can tell it’s clearly a play on the format used by 12-step-programs. Someone will immediately know that whoever named this group feels that people with EDs mirror people who involved in alcoholicsAnonymous, overeatersAnonymous, NarcoticsAnonymous, GamblersAnonymous, NeuroticsAnonymous etc. That puts a spotlight on the pathological/harmful/ill nature of EDs and doesn’t let you forget it.",False,False

We don't expect every movie that includes drinking to espouse the DARE motto (on the contrary, movies absolutely glamorize drug and alcohol addiction), and I know that's not exactly the same, but still. I don't think an ED movie is under any obligation to be pro-recovery or not triggering or whatever simply because the subject matter is a mental illness. IMO the movie is triggering but doesn't glamorize the disease the way many movies glamorize addiction.   Maybe this is an unpopular opinion, but as someone also diagnosed with PTSD, it is the responsibility of the person who has triggers to either avoid them or learn through therapy how to confront and cope with them.

It’s not a born out of tumblr word or close. I didn’t see, “to the bone” but they didn’t invent the name so we could have a quirky thing —it’s been around (on the web) since before 2004 and off the web it was used before that it seems. Just like *every* other slang term it can fall out of relevance and sometimes make a come back. RAD!    2.Could be wrong but don’t think it was ever used as a personification. My friend non ironically &amp; non jokingly  called me an “Alchie” for awhile before I got sober. Rexie seems to be in similar vein. Trust me, she wasn’t romanticizing jack shit. She was saying I need to admit I’m a fucking Alchie because drinking alone everyday isn’t normal. BTW: Alchie is well understood where I am and it’s usually either an insult or just teasing.  3.Im not sanctimonious guys, I’ll admit I’ve liked making fun of the silliness of the personification thing in the past and probably will still poke fun at it in the future sometimes. ***However*** i don’t think it’s fair to make people out to be odd/juvenile/complacent/ “glorifying”/“romanticizing” just because someone jumped on the bandwagon of using “Ana” to personify ED on and off, or sometimes using “Rexie” to euphemize their diagnosis sometimes 🤷‍♀️.   4.TBH I kinda the appeal especially in humorous convo.  I’ve been battling EDs on and off for over a decade &amp; AN specifically on and off for &gt;5 years so why not have a sense of humor about it when among people with similar struggles?  5.Its silly for sure but i can’t think of it as unique, quirky, unusually, or stupid. Thats probably because I live since in a society where both teens &amp; adults who aren’t even dealers say things like:   “The best weekend is always one with Mary Jane”  “I love Molly makes me wanna dance”  “We’re broke to spend the evening with Jack”  “I’m probably gonna fail without Addy helping me study”  “I’m kinda too afraid to take a trip with Lucy things might go bad”  “ Dex/Drex/D just makes you act like an idiot dude, I swear”  ...to each other unironically. Even when noone could be listening in so using a code name for the sake a privacy would be completely un needed.   Online communities dedicated to Substance use  &amp; EDs have a lot in common so it makes sense they have similar Jargon.   SU &amp; ED are maladaptive coping mechanisms, affected individuals likely have friends/families who don’t understand it, affected individuals usually have ambivalent beliefs/feelings but deep down known it’s harmful or atleast very unproductive — and many people are feel mild shame. So of course tons people enjoy giving it cutsie euphemism names and/or personifying it as a way of emotionally dealing with it while confronting it.   I think we should allow people get *a little* more relaxed and colloquial with the terms/speech when we’re talking about our ED behaviors without rushing to think “*they’re promoting the social glorification of mental illness and destructive behavior”*.  The reason they’re being **so** unsophisticated with their speech  may not be because their proud and don’t understand the seriousness and function disabling nature of their ED (romanticizing). The other possibility is that it’s tempting to be laid back because: Dedicated online spaces are probably the only place in the whole world where everyone “in the room” is going to feel blasé towards someone talking about compulsively purging halo top and depression-fasting for 26 hours.   ***  **TL;DR**   *support groups* share a lot in common with Web based *subcultures*. NOT necessarily because people in support groups are trying to normalize/romanticize their problem. With subcultures it’s because like minded individuals are coming together. In support groups it’s because people with similar struggles are coming together.   I think people in ED (non pro) communities have good intent when it comes to preventing illness romanticizing, which *is* a real social problem right now. But I think we accidentally put unrealistically high expectations on each other to be #SERIOUSBUSINESS all the time meanwhile we do the ***exact*** same shit as every one else   So yeah   I’m an **Alchie** who’s sister is a lazy **stoner** and I suspect my employer is a **fake natty**  — and  I approve “**Rexie**” as an *okay* euphemism.",False,False
