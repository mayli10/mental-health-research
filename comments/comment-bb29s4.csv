Being this effortlessly thin, sporty, healthy-eating, down-to-earth ""beach baby"" kind of ideal is something that's marketed to the rest of the world as being quintessentially Aussie but isn't something you actually see as often when you're really here. There are HEAPS of fat people here (myself included), we'd probably give America a run for their money if either of us liked to run, and I don't think being underweight is any more accepted than in the states (some accept it, some are concerned, models and celebs are routinely underweight).  So in short I would not say it's really common, it's probably the same as where you are - you'll meet some very thin people IRL, and other people have varying opinions about it. Like yes you'll meet more if you hang out in circles of sporty, clean-eating young pretty people, but isn't that the same everywhere?   I can't tell if this is a good or sad thing to hear tho üòÖ",False,False

I made a comment that back then is when great-grandma (my grandma) said I was the chubby bunny of the family, and how everyone used to pick on me for being the fat kid.  I think my cousin wanted to punch me in the face. Comparatively, I was a smidge taller than her at that age, but I was about sixty pounds lighter. She gets called fat, but she's considered to be *chubby*. Her doctor said chubby. Her mom says chubby. Her dad and step-mom and grandma think it's a *problem* and want to deal with it now rather than later.  My 90s chubby is like her anorexic, if we're being blunt.  &amp;#x200B;  And just to clarify, coming from my grandma, being called a chubby bunny didn't hurt when I was four, five, six, years old. All of her pet names for me were after cute, tiny, soft, cuddly little creatures. She called me a bunny, she called me a mouse, she called me a chipmunk once or twice. Both my grandmas said this in love, and I needed it so badly.  What hurt was when people took it as fair game *well grandma said it first* to start the fat jokes and the bullying. Other stuff that happened didn't help either.",False,False
