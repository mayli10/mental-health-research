But I can't really do the whole doctor thing without exposing myself. I don't drive due to severe anxiety and my family doesn't know about my ED. I'm really not ready to let them know either.   I only get cravings when I'm on my period thankfully. And it's only for chocolate which I don't keep around regularly. I'll make a 28 cal hot cocoa if I'm desperate.,False,True

Even if you tell them you have an ED, they wonâ€™t make you go into recovery.   As for sleeping, itâ€™s very important bc itâ€™s how your body heals. Less sleep means less time to heal. It could also make cravings worse. Try a Benadryl if u really ant sleep.",False,False

(Still overweight, not dysmorphia talking there)   I probably do look like shit. Just cause I haven't been sleeping well. I eat quite healthy (when I do eat ðŸ˜¬).",False,True

I had weight loss I could not see many times. I had weight gain only I could see.   For your dom to say something, he must be really worried and that you actually have looked like youâ€™ve lost weight or maybe even you look not well (ie. tired, weak) bc EDâ€™s can be quite malnourishing.",False,False
