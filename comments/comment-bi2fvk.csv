I'm not sure what she will say since I already told the teacher I just kinda forgot but I have nothing to lose :"") and I guess ethics can be ignored for this. I will see if I can apply!",False,True

If you get a doctor's note you can give that to the prof or if your uni is more formal about it you can apply for a deferred exam. It's actually easier than you think to get one, just have the ""flu"" and you're set  Hope I don't get downvoted to shit for this ðŸ˜¬ But if you're desperate you're desperate",False,False

I really hope she's more sympathetic with me, It really was such an honest mistake.  &amp;#x200B;  Ah thank you for that, you're too kind :'') I might just be overthinking it but I am just so scared as I'm on a scholarship.  I really appreciate your words tho, I sometimes just feel like these are so important but idk, I guess it just feels like all the work has gone to nothing. Thank you, i hope the teacher does answer me back soon.",False,True

Sometimes they can be sympathetic about these things. They might at least let you do it for half credit or do some sort of makeup assignment. Then again, some profs aren't sympathetic at all but it never hurts to ask. They might even be more lenient with you since you've proven yourself all semester to be a good student.  And if not, well, I guess it's trite to say that your GPA doesn't define you, but it really doesn't. There will be plenty of classes &amp; plenty of tests in your future which you will do amazing on. I don't know a single person who made it through uni without failing at least one class, and getting a handful of C's along the way is totally normal.",False,False
