I’ve only been going for about a month and a half, but it’s good. I like my therapist and she’s a specialist that used to work inpatient so it’s nice to have someone who actually knows what they’re doing with eds. I’m still losing though, which is why she wants me to see a dietician. We’ve talked about friends and feeling isolated and the importance of being vulnerable when appropriate. She’s encouraged me to reach out to my friend if I think it’s a good idea and just admit that I’m struggling with no other expectations of the interaction. I think it could help, but I don’t know. As far as other friends, not really. I just moved and started grad school this fall and she’s one of my only friends I’ve kept in contact with on a deeper level and I don’t know that I would feel comfortable telling my other close friend from undergrad. She’s recently put on a lot of weight and has been very open about how great it’s been and how happy she is to be gaining (she used to be underweight from not eating when she was super depressed) and I don’t think she’d understand. I haven’t made any grad school friends I feel comfortable enough for it either",False,True

She’s surrounded by ED stuff all the time though and is currently doing research about eds and we talk about that a lot. It’s more about just saying I’m having a tough time than bringing her back to ed thoughts. I don’t know though, it does feel selfish ",False,True

I would let her recover and work on your own as well",False,False
