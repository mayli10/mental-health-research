Even if I dont feel the poop sittin in there, coffee will make it  one out. If you drink too much coffee on an empty stomach it might leak out in it's own tho. That happened to me but thankfully I was wearing a pad and it got caught.  Hope that helps. Laxative abuse is never good so I'm glad to hear you dont want to be taking them.",False,False

Not as harsh as laxatives! Honestly if abusing laxatives isn’t your thing and doesn’t trigger you then take one. And enema might help if you want instant relief! It’s ok to use medicine. What’s not ok is abusing it :) ,False,False

My BMs have significantly slowed down since Christmas. I feel so bloated and constipated rn, I'm on day 3 or 4. Even during the weekend, when I drank lots of alcohol every night I only had two BMs during the whole weekend?! (usually alcohol gives me the shits!)   I'm not even restricting much this week cos I literally just want to have a BM!! My diet since Christmas has mostly been veg, so I think I've been getting enough fibre?   Even this week I've been eating lots of veg and baked beans but still nothing?!? And am kinda scared of taking laxatives in case I become dependent. ",False,False

During bad restriction phases I can go more than 2. I used to abuse laxatives so my bowels are totally fucked so please don't head down that road if you haven't already.  In the hospital I was given Miralax and colace and that really helped me.

Worst I got when I was restricting heavily was one BM a week. Today I'm 7 months into recovery and I still sometimes go 3 days without a BM...which feels pretty freaking horrible when you're taking in 2800 calories a day of low density food including about 75 grams of fiber a day. My digestion right now is overall the best it's been since I started recovery but it's still pretty messed up compared to before I started dieting years ago. I find it ironic because all the people on /r/loseit rave about how much better their digestion is since they lost weight. My experience has been just the opposite.",False,False

I usually only make bowel movements every 3-5 days and don’t pass gas very often. But i believe for me it has to do with how little i eat, just not enough for it to get flowing.
