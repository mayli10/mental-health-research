I've tried saying something before but it doesn't go well because she sees it as me being competitive and she doesn't trust my judgement. Which I mean, normally would be fair. But like. I know I'm objectively right about her.",False,False

Every time I see my parents they tell me I need to gain weight. And to make matters worse my roommate weighs the same as me but she's 5'8"" and her legs are my biggest thinspo.

I've seen girls with higher bmis than me that literally look skinnier and that's one of my worst triggers   I'm 5'5 and 118 pounds but my waistline is still 27 inches, wtf? It's been like that since I was 125 pounds, i hardly look any different except that my ass and hips keep shrinking. I have always had a terrible shape but somehow I thought losing weight would change that?  On top of that my bone structure is just wide everywhere. Ugh.  I'm not exceptionally thin when it comes to the numbers but I really shouldn't look as chubby as I do. It sucks.",False,False
