Please ignore what that troll said to you, his words are as meaningless as his life. I remember I tried doing a roastme on an alt account and for the most part every other comment was a jab at my weight or my appearance (which I knew would happen). Some of them were funny but the majority were just straight cruel and not in the spirit of a good RoastMe. People are way more likely to single out women to dump all their pent up anger on because women won't fuck their incel asses. Please try to not take their words too personally, because at the end of the day you're more beautiful then any person ugly enough to tear others down.",False,False
