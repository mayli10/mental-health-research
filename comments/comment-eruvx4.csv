For example, atypical anorexia (""normal"" BMI anorexic) falls under this diagnostic unit, but only part of the health issues of anorexia are caused by low BMI, weighing more is not gonna help you avoid malnutrition, heart problems, social issues, secretive eating, possible b/p, etc. Tldr low weight is only one aspect of some EDs.",False,False
