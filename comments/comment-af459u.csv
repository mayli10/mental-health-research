Like you want validation because you look fine to everyone else but only you know you're really not. It's like your Ed takes advantage. When someone makes a comment that seems close to sussing me out my brain goes ""you need to be thinner the next time you see them."" Tbh I think whatever this is in our heads just uses food, weight, need for validation etc to express itself. It's like if there's something we kind of want, it latches on to it and uses it as a way to convince us to make ourselves worse. If that makes any sense. ",False,False

The help seems to dry up. Is there someone you can talk to, who will listen, and take you seriously? Some of my worst ED brain periods have been while I „looked well“.  Recovery isn’t about weight restoration, it’s about control over the ED. Ime weight restoration hasn’t been sustainable without working on the psychological component of ED. I hope you can find a way. Be kind to yourself.",False,False
