Can you tell her that what she’s saying is super triggering to you? This honestly feels like some weird bullying thing. While it might not be an attack and I don’t want to push that narrative, it’s clearly some weird competitive thing.   I should also say it’s not your job to try and help/fix her. If she does turn out to have some issues with food, which hey sounds like it, and she confesses that to you. It’s not your cross to bear. That sounds like a really selfish thing to say but that is a lot of emotional weight to add to yourself and you are under no obligation to take that on.",False,False
