I seriously feel sooo many people in that sub have or are developing eating disorders. If that's not the case then I feel extremely invalidated because I guess I'm just a normal healthy person.  Doesnt fasting right after a major binge and then doing that repeatedly wreak havoc on your metabolism?  What I also dont get is that if these people are seriously doing extended fasts punctuated by binges, rinse and repeat, that's literally what people with severe anorexia do and it lands them in the hospital. So what the fuck, why can these people do it?  Why is it okay for them to do it and not for me?  It honestly fucking confuses me and fucks with my head so much",False,False
