I just restrict and I‚Äôm losing weight. It‚Äôs weird because i know my obsession is not normal. I know logically i should be eating more and not feeling as guilty as i do when i eat bad foods. I almost cried last night because i turned down cake. Like couldn‚Äôt even bring myself to take the tiniest itty bitiest bite. But I‚Äôm not sick. I weigh a normal amount.,False,False

If you let yourself accept even a tiny amount of logic, the answer will always be no. Because a personal record low is all it'd be -- a low that I'd have to gain back anyway. I figured, why just make it harder for myself to let it all go?  Like they say in AA, ""rock bottom is wherever you decide to stop digging.""",False,False
