It’s totally within your rights not to want people to comment on your body, and it is very much their problem if they can’t respect an extremely basic and polite request. (Also ps I have found a trick for dealing w these types of comments is actually to NOT explain yourself at all, just firmly ask them to stop and don’t follow up w “because it makes me uncomfortable” or anything, you don’t owe an explanation for a simple request AND it doesn’t put you on the defensive.)",False,False
