If you refuse consecutively they will recommend residential and idk what happens if you deny cause most people take the advice,False,False

My experience with day programs has been that they expect you to be fairly motivated to recover. My particular program had a rule that if you didn’t complete a meal, you were sent home for the day. They didn’t really let people remain in program if they weren’t motivated to recover. People who got sent home more than once or had frequent struggles at mealtimes were referred to residential, and if they refused, they were discharged.   Also, we had strict meal plans that we had to fulfill at mealtimes. There’s no way I’d have been able to get away with eating only vegetables. We had to have protein, carbs, fats, dairy, fruit/veg at breakfast, lunch, and dinner, plus 3 snacks, which were a bit more open-ended, but still couldn’t just be fruit/veg.",False,False

In the state I live in, I am a minor. I just got out of a PRTF last week, and they threatened bringing the board of mental health into my case if I didn't comply with going to this ed program. Now that I've left the PRTF, I don't think I actually have anything to worry about. So I probably can say bye to the ed program people even though they think I need it.   Honestly, I was willing to go to the program as long as I was still underweight. But since I've binged for 5 days in a row and gained 7 pounds into the healthy weight category, I don't want to go. I feel like I'll be the biggest one there. I want to lose weight to get back to being underweight.",False,True
