Also scar creams can help, but they tend to be expensive if you are using them over a large area.  A cheap DIY way to help lessen the appearance of them is using a loofah on the area in small circular motions around the area once or twice a day in the shower (with or without soap). It won’t do a TON , but can help fade them",False,False
