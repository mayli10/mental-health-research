I've been there too and I understand what a nightmare it is. When the system arbitrarily decides who is sick enough and you don't meet that threshold or professionals don't take you seriously, it sucks. It's terrible how ED treatment people are all, ""It's so important to catch the signs of an ED before it becomes worse"" but then they don't take you seriously if you're not ""worse."" System sucks.",False,False

Despite telling him I semi seriously tried to kill myself at work, this is the outcome.  But thank you for your reassurance. I know logically I deserve help, though at this point I don't much care for it, I just want someone to notice my pain. The system is beyond flawed and only seems to help those who are either ""easy"" cases to achieve recovery, or those literally on the edge. If you're anywhere in between, well you're not bad enough for crisis care, but you're too bad for lower level care.",False,True

Almost a year ago I was going through something really similar. I was really struggling and the only local treatment center I could afford had me wait for 9ish weeks before I could be seen/assessed at all. I'm so damn sorry that this seems to happen so much. If it means anything at all, you're sick enough no matter how crappy the system is. You deserve treatment regardless of how long they're making you wait.",False,False
