I could start by reading all your posts. I could also blast your inbox on dm's. Then, judging by your writing style, I can tell you're a female in the Western world, probably early 20s. Like most people of their early 20s, &amp;the fact that you're on an Ed sub, you probably overshare on the internet a bit too much.

Several people in this thread have pointed out how irrational you're being.  I don't ""turn it off"" - nobody in this whole sub does. The thoughts are always there. Sometimes they can get less intrusive and quieter, during bouts of good mental health (which we can't control).  Other times, my anxiety and the fear of people ""finding out"" about my problems get much louder than the ED voice, and I imitate how everybody else eats as to not cause trouble.  But when I feel ""fine"" eating maintenance, it's purely physiological. I might not get dizzy and my digestive system might work better, but I'm still counting all the calories and I'm still bargaining and looking for the less caloric option and I still get angry and anxious and sad by how I am eating and longing to restrict again. Just quietly, and all while putting a show.  Your invalidation and constant pestering about this have severely triggered me, I've had several breakdowns in the last couple days from you basically agreeing with the voice in my head calling me invalid and fake, as if I'm not truly suffering if my symptoms differ from yours.
