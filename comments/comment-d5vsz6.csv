Wish you luck too, hope you both are followed by adequate therapists. Btw my boyfriend says the same thing about my bulimia, that no matter the relapses, as long as he sees me trying to do better it's ok.",False,True

He's been getting deeper into depression in the last few years but he's starting new ADHD medication in a couple months and I hope it helps him feel okay again. And even if it doesn't, as long as he's looking for solutions I'm gonna stick by his side. I can't blame him for my personal predisposition to eating disorders.  I'm wishing you two luck as well ðŸ’›",False,False

Usually I rely on men's desire as an antidote for my dysmorphia so that's a bit of a trigger but it's actually normal in couples to have ups and downs.",False,True

But it's shitty to say that his depression affects me so I'd rather not bring it up.  Hope you're okay, ðŸ’›",False,False
