It helps just to know someone read it and cares to some extent. I’m trying to get away from my dad’s wife — it’s just difficult. I feel trapped in this situation. I’m trying to save up as much money as I can, but it’ll be a long time before I can actually support myself financially. But, in the meanwhile, I think I’m going to take up the offer to live with my boyfriend and his parents temporarily while I get everything sorted out. I can’t keep living like this.  I’ve recently started seeing a psychologist at my college, but it’ll be short-lived if I don’t make it into grad school since I graduate this July. I’m feeling a bit more hopeful than I was last night. I’m trying so hard to keep afloat and try recovering. I’ll see if there are any women’s groups and support networks. I’ll try not to lose hope! Thank you!",False,True

One thing though, you need to get away from your dads wife - she sounds like a very abusive and unstable person and will be poison for your recovery and well being.   You need to identify the rocks in your life, the solid ones, and not be ashamed for clinging on to them in the storm. The true rocks will be happy to have you there and not take advantage of your vulnerability.   Are you in therapy? Can you reach out there about advice? Are there women’s groups or support networks in your area? Don’t lose hope, there are many who will help!",False,False
