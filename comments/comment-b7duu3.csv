That happens to people all the time. And that’s why you want to use a different kind of pasta.,False,False

Usually, I just use beans (maybe rice if I'm feeling *risky)* and lettuce + peppers, veggies, spices, etc.  On the upside, beans are a great source of vegan protein and, if you're restricting most of the time, protein is pretty important to losing fat and replacing it w/ muscle. The veggies make it look bulkier and, usually for me, the meal comes out to be 300 calories or so. If that's all you eat all day, you could splurge w/ rice or even two bowls.  Good luck!",False,False

But I remembered this one pasta recipe (from the YouTube channel Oat Fiber) that's made with oat fiber which is super low cal. You could make it ahead of time and tell your friend that you made homemade pasta special for your vegan Mac.     http://realfakefoods.blogspot.com/2018/10/149-calorie-mac-and-cheese.html?m=1,False,False
