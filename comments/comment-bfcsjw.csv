My last attempt at a relationship was 8 years ago. Those particular individuals constantly said things to me that started with ""you'd be perfect if it wasn't for (stupid arbitrary thing)"". That's not the best thing to say to someone who struggles with toxic perfectionism... ðŸ™ƒ  I don't attempt dating anymore because I'm not perfect, and what I think my perfect self would be honestly doesn't exist. It sure doesn't exist after almost 33 years of living, so.... ðŸ¤· When I try to explain it to people I get looked at like I'm crazy (which is probably true, not going to lie lol...).",False,False

There's tons of women that I find extremely attractive but I wouldn't dare say anything, it's just too stressful.  I doubt that men aren't approaching you because your unattractive, it's just stressful for guys too. It's easier to isolate then to take a chance unfortunately.",False,False
