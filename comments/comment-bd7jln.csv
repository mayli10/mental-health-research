If your HR spikes when you go from lying -&gt; standing or start moving around, the low RHR is being exacerbated by your ED.  The warning signs you want to look out for are those of [postural hypotension](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/orthostatic-hypotension/symptoms-causes/syc-20352548), along with chest pain, shortness of breath, and syncope. If you've experienced any of those recently, go to your doctor and don't lie about your behaviour. Having a stroke in your twenties is *not* a good way to go.",False,False

My resting HR is often in the lower 50s (spikes up to 65+ during my period who knows why).  It’s often a little higher in the doctors office (white coat syndrome) so I’m not actually sure if it’s concerning.  A low resting HR can cause some of the symptoms the symptoms associated with restricting though.,False,False
