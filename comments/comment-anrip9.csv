Then running around the mountains for 6 days. Lets say he ran 15 miles a day. I have no idea how much he actually ran but apparently he had foot injuries so it has to be a lot.   15 miles is probably 120 calories a mile for him, so another 1800 a day. This brings his total calorie deficit to 22,800.  He would have excreted a couple of litres 9f water on the first day, and at least a litre of water per day after that. With a lack of access to fresh water, he would have lost 6 7kg of water weight. He would have been severely dehydrated, who knows, maybe he found a fresh water source.  22800 calories is about 6.3lbs of fat, and 7kg is equivalent to 15.4lbs. Thats nearly 22 pounds all together.  If he ran 25 miles a day, he would have burned 30,000 calories, and lost nearly 24lbs altogether.   Its possible, but it also seems nearly impossible that he didnt die.",False,False
