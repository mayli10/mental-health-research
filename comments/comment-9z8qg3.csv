Depending on the laxative you took it's possible your body is drawing water into your gut to make you go. Or the contractions of the laxative are causing some sort of inflammatory type reaction that is also causing you to retain fluid.   Laxatives are literally the WORST THING EVER if you actually want to maintain a so called flat stomach.   So if you can wean yourself of using them I would.   Try reading up on laxative damage. Having that knowledge is one of the things that keeps me from LAX abuse because it'll keep me away from my goal. ,False,False
