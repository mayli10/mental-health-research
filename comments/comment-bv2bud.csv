I got back down to 1 pound away from my LW and 11 pounds from my UGW and I binged on Sunday. Currently in the middle of what was a 48 hour fast turned 72 hours.   Try not to stress yourself out more. Lots of water and clean foods. Workout if only to increase your endorphins and feeling of productivity. I always feel like I’m actually “doing something” when I’ve worked out.,False,False
