It wasn't worth it because of the amount of time I'd sit down to recover after working out, also twice the time spent showering, washing twice the amount of work out clothes. It all added up quickly.  I ended up just staying at the gym for a really long time instead of two average amounts, taking a break in between and switching to a different work out. ",False,False
