I‚Äôm a spoiled pos and totally undisciplined. Someone suggested finishing a meal very slowly, so I might stretch a meal in progress to hours and see how I do. Sorry, I really am that pathetic and weak.",False,True

I would just always want to eat whatever I was craving RIGHT NOW, but by just saying ‚Äúit will still be there tomorrow‚Äù it kinda just helped me think about if I was actually hungry and willing to eat a different small snack, or if I was just craving that specific food/flavor. Or, if I really felt like that wouldn‚Äôt work that day/I was craving it really bad, I would set a specific time (8 AM, 12 PM, 6 PM, breakfast/lunch/dinner) that I could have that for a meal, and I would just wait a few hours or however long it would be, and even just slowing down that little bit would help me feel a little more controlled and I usually ended up eating less/not bingeing on everything rather than if I just gave in immediately.",False,False

A better way to start controlling your appetite would probably make a meal plan you'lll stick to but if it's too hard then just try to eat slower. Like, a lot slower. Then you won't have as much time to eat huge amounts. Keeping yourself busy with other stuff besides eating and chilling alone helps as well. You can overcome this! üíïüí™üèª",False,False
