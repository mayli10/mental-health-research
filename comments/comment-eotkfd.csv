My ex used yo fucking jiggle the skin on my arms or my legs. I’d get upset and ask him to please not do that and he’d make a huge to-do about how it’s normal to have skin or whatever. And then I’d be like *yes I know but also there are these things called feelings and they are not always rational* and he’d roll his eyes or diminish the issue in some other way.  When I briefly dated a different person this summer who would actually respect my boundaries and ask how I was feeling it was so so weird.,False,False
