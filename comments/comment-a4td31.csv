I know it doesn’t make sense to just compare weight but I def do. I have an older sister that’s 5’1” and I’m always jealous about how little she weighs, but I literally have half a foot on her. I feel like my height also feeds into my insecurity. I’ve never been short and cute or dainty and I hate it. I literally have one friend that’s taller than me and everyone else is shorter and I’m jealous by how petite and comfortable they seem while I’m all awkward. ",False,False

But I WILL reach 100lbs only 23 more to go. Might even try for 99 just to snap a pic of it before I die. That's a 13.56 Standard BMI or 13.04 with the new calculation. A 21yr old 6ft male at 100lbs has a BMR of around 1450ish cals a day so I have been sticking to that and have been steadily loosing. I also have a extremely physically demanding job so it's been pretty tough to stick to 1450cals but my ED brain wont let me go above that. Atleast its better than when I used to do just a single can of progresso soup at 140cals a day.,False,False

But it's more that everyone is taller than me so they all look better than I do at the same height and even though there's a clear reason for it, it makes me hate myself. ",False,False

But like you it’d be impossible with my height. So I looked for another ‘perfect’ number, and for me 53 really struck me. I’m trying to get back to it!",False,False
