By repeatedly slowly doing it, and nothing bad happens then you are showing your brain that “we don’t have to be scared of this”  Just keep trying your best and as i said if you just cant one day that’s alright try again tomorrow, but the more consistent you are the better and faster it will help you   I wish you all the best!",False,False
