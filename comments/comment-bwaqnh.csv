It reminds me of something I've seen online about having depression: ""there are good days and bad days.""  For me I don't think I'll be like I was before with food either. I think I still have an eating disorder, but for me it's more like a disability rather than something that's very actively ruining my life, if that makes sense. For example I'm underweight, and I don't think I would be comfortable maintaining a weight in the healthy range or even the mildly underweight (like &gt;!BMI 17-18!&lt; range) which would probably be healthier for me. I also have those dark thought patterns sometimes, such as feeling very anxious about my body or about eating, although the frequency is reduced from how it was at my worst. :/ It does sound sort of sad that I'll likely never be completely free of those thought patterns, so I think I sort of understand how you feel (although everyone's mental health and thought patterns are different, so I hesitate to say I completely understand).  What you said about managing adversity is interesting. I guess that's sort of true for me. It kind of gives me more of a perspective on the kind of things I want for other more long-term aspects of my life, in that I really only started thinking about my career after I was sort of ""climbing out"" of a low point in my ED.",False,False

The majority of people I've talked with still have some kind of trait or certain ""pattern"" with foods that still lingers long after completing ED recovery. Most are fine with it, as am I, but I still can't help to feel somewhat sad about knowing that I'll never be as I was before my anorexia.",False,True

I don't think I can stop counting calories even if i wanted, but then again.. isn't that what ""smokers"" say about quit smoking?   I think you're right about not ever being 100% recovered. There will most likely be some kind of trait still lingering around, even years later. What I find annoying though, is when others don't understand why one can be doing something in particular (like counting calories or having a rough idea of stuff all the time) which can be a result of a past eating disorder. Instead they'll just think we're weird.",False,True

Everyone has their own goal for recovery. I think it makes sense for people to consider themselves 100% recovered if the intensity and frequency of their dark thoughts don't trigger a full-on relapse.  Mental illnesses are on a spectrum. If 100% recovered means you never have dark thoughts, then I don't think even ""normal people"" are 100% free from mental illness. It's sort of like depression; I think sadness is a very normal emotion that everyone feels. So no one can really be 100% free of all sadness whatsoever. However if your sadness/depression is intense enough to impair your life then I would say you are depressed.  However I don't want to say that this woman *is* completely recovered because I don't know the intensity of her dark thoughts. I think she's right—just speaking for herself—that *she herself* might not be completely recovered. But I think it's possible for *others* to be completely recovered still with some dark thoughts.",False,False

I don't know how to unlearn calorie counts or workouts or all the nutrition I've researched. not to mention society loves thin women anyways so you always hear weightloss talk no matter where you go. I think if you get in and out of your Ed quick enough you might be safe but after all these years you'd have to lobotomize me to make me normal again,False,False
