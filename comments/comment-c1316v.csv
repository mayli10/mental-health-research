Like going on a walk or doing shopping. I've also found that eating food that satisfies you help A TON. I tend to eat a lot more when it's something that doesn't satisfy me. The more you frustrate yourself, the more pressure you put on yourself, and the more likely you are to devour everything Wish you the best of luck :)",False,False

I was out of work for a month and gained fucking fifteen lbs. Now that I’m working again I lost ten lbs in a week! I don’t have time to mindlessly eat because I’m on the phone almost all day, and when lunch comes I don’t want anyone in my office seeing how I eat so I take very little. By the time I get home I’m so tired I usually have dinner but don’t snack after and don’t wake up to eat either anymore.   I also put post-it notes on my food at home with my current weight and my goal weight... and on my bathroom mirror... and on my scale... and on the wall next to my bed so it’s the first thing I see in the morning...",False,False
