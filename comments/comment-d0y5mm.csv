Go for feeling moderately full multiple times a day instead of completely full all at once then waiting til the next time you're hungry. Going all out too fast may end up just being more triggering.,False,False

I had 2 eggos for breakfast and ate a sandwich for lunch. At first I was really proud of myself but then I remembered how much I hate being full all day long. I am thinking about sleeping for dinner,False,False

It just feels so WRONG like... I don’t even know. It’s so awful. It’s so so so awful. I got completely full one time- stuffed! As a recovery challenge (‘Normal’ portions for ‘normal’ people but you know) and it caused me to slip into this relapse. So. Yeah. I feel you.,False,False
