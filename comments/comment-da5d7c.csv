I'm not trying to be condescending lmao I just wanna share with u how u should prepare them so u can enjoy them for the rest of your life. So you have to rinse them VERY well. After u did that you have to put them on a hot pan until they become crispy, or dehydrated. Mix them with ur best sauce and taa-daa, best noodles. That way they will not have that weird texture. Tbh now I prefer shirataki noodles to normal noodles lmao.",False,False

I think the main issue with a lot of ‚Äúfood alternatives‚Äù is the way they‚Äôre marketed and people‚Äôs unrealistic expectations. Like I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs anything wrong with cashew-based cheeses or creams, but of course you‚Äôre gonna be disappointed if you expect them to taste like dairy.

I think the key is not trying to use them as a replacement for pasta. Trying to put them instead of pasta into literally anything that should be pasta is not tasty.  However they go amazingly in things like stir fry and noodle salads, hot pot etc. Basically anything broadly Chinese or Vietnamese that has strong flavours will do them justice. If you take them out of that gross water they come in and fry them (no oil or anything) in a very hot dry pan before adding them to your dish it's a game changer. They absorb the flavours of things you put them in and end up being more of a texture than anything. Cooked right, I definitely don't dislike eating them.
