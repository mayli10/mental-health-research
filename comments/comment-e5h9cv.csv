My best friend has a BMI of slightly under 16 and she eats normally, exercises normally, no disordered thinking around food (I watched her closely when we first became friends thinking there’s no way she doesn’t have an ED, but I was wrong, thankfully).

But I’m thinking that in a way, I am much healthier than them for eating my veggies and no sugar etc so I’ll look better later in life. Sooner or later it’s going to show up on them.

Or maybe she worked it into her restrictive daily limit. Or maybe she’s gonna work out like crazy after. Or maybe she is just blessed to be able to eat without worry and keep a decent figure.
