So i can watch them eat it intensely and lay in bed and night and replay it in my head pretending i ate it. I cook a lot for friends and bake a lot of bread and cakes and dont touch anything.,False,False

I’m not saying it’s bad to give other people your food. I do that all the time. What the post and several comments are saying is that they TRICK people into eating more. Adding unnecessary oils for example. Because they want people around them to gain weight. That is what my comment was about, not turning down or offering others your food. There is nothing wrong with that. However, constantly trying to convince others to eat more, tricking them into consuming more calories than they think with the intention of making them fat, that is not okay no matter how bad your disorder is.",False,False

Imagine how you would feel if someone did that to you.  I have a friend who is constantly trying to lure in calories for others and encourage them to eat more so that she feels less insecure about her own decisions. She tired to lure me to drink regular sprite once and I felt so betrayed.

I don’t do it to make her gain weight.   It’s just that when she’s full, she’ll eat less at meals and think nothing of it when I eat small portions too.   But when she’s hungry, she’ll eat larger portions and serve me the same, knowing that if I don’t take the same portion that I’m restricting.   And if it’s a light, low calorie meal, she’ll be hungry sooner, make something for her and me to eat again, and ask me, “aren’t you hungry?” when she sees me eating less. She’ll know something is up.   And most of the time when I don’t eat, then she subconsciously won’t eat either, which leads to more suspicion about me when she realises she’s hungry.   I inevitably spend a lot of time with her at this time in my life. So basically I keep and eye on what she’s eating and make sure her calorie levels are met. I know if she’s had a deficit for a few days and that she’s not snacking, she’ll make a heavier meal and serve us both larger portions because she’s an intuitive eater.  So in her coffee and cereal I make sure I add a good amount of milk if I make it, while I have black tea and water with oatmeal. Meals are something I can’t weasel around. I try to feed her snacks (healthy ones and sometimes yummy-not so healthy ones) so she’s not completely hungry by the time she eats a meal, while I don’t snack at all.",False,False
