I'm going to try and recover again, so I wish us luck. I'm actually trying this time, too. I've realized how much this disorder has affected my life and other people's lives in my life, and I'm ready to change. I won't lie, it doesn't seem like you're ready to change yet. Maybe I'm wrong, but I hope I'm not for your sake.",False,False

I'm still trying hard though. I hope you and and everyone else here is able to recover. I'm working on it a best I can.,False,True

Food brings people together and represents different cultures and their backgrounds, there's more to it than how me and you see it. There's still lots of hope for you, so much potential to recover. If any of us could go back in time to when the disordered thoughts started, and change them, we would 100% of the time. You are in a space that a lot of us wish we were, please take this opportunity to rewire your brain. You can change, it might be hard, but you can do it and have it be permanent. Please, please recover.",False,False

That is at least my truth and I can’t say it enough. If you can start recovery as soon as possible you will benefit from it. It doesn’t happen all at once, there are so many setback and each one makes me want to throw in the towel but in the long run it has been worth it. It just would’ve been a lot easier for me had I tried to recover sooner. Take care",False,False

It brings back painful memories for me from a long time ago. I believe I started out like you but I had so much shame and obsessiveness over food and thinness that I didn’t get help till decades later. Please try and get some serious help. I am turning 49 next month and I’m only just starting to realize how much time was lost to this disorder. Please take care and you are worth it.,False,False
