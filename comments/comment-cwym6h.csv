I would suggest that you figure out what’s causing you to go on these binges, and get that sorted out. It sounds hard, but it’s easier than being bulimic",False,True

All I will say is this: you do not want to start purging. That and that this sub is a public support sub not some tumblr/toxic-pro-Ana blog, we’re not going to give out tips on how to get sicker, we’re here to try to recover, whatever that looks like individually.",False,False

The idea of it just sitting in there makes me feel disgusted.  I know I shouldn’t have posted what I did so I edited it and got rid of it. It was a moment of impulse and desperation. I’m just in a bad place. I’m sorry if I triggered anyone.,False,False

I can’t physically purge. I’ve tried with my fingers and a toothbrush and it never works. It has to be because I am doing it wrong. I don’t know when to do it or how and of course the internet doesn’t provide that on a google search.  I know this is really disgusting to ask but how do you do it? I know I would feel so much better. I only want to purge very rarely but I think it would help me feel better.  I know your reply will probably be telling me that I shouldn’t do it but not being able to do it is killing me. So please.,False,False
