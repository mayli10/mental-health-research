I did IF for a little bit and it was very helpful. I can do it on weekends more easily because I have ways to soothe myself besides food, and I'm not stressed by work. I can distract myself. But in the mornings when I'm miserable at work I find it really hard. I should try again though. ",False,False

I'm so incredibly hungry in the mornings and so binge-y in the evenings. So being strict with myself and planning my meals the day before has completely trumped it. I know you can do it. ðŸ’›ðŸ’›,False,True

I've been in a bingeing/overeating phase for over two months now. I am gross. But it probably won't happen for me considering I've never totally lot interest in food. ,False,False
