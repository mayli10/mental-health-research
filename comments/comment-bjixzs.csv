I wanted to get to a weight that would put me at 19.2 - thought I'd be happy and stop there. Now I weigh a full ten kilos below that and finding it so hard to manage. The weight loss fuels me and at this point I can scarcely afford such a mindset but fuck it sucks when you think you have it under control and you just keep spiralling.  Just a vent - I know that feeling of hesitation and deferred satisfaction so well, especially coming down from a high BMI. Shit's kind of mind-bending. I hope your obvs strong insight can continue to help you keep things in perspective on this weird road we travel down.",False,False
