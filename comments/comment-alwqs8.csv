If you’re purging, try to reduce how often you’re purging.  I’m not in my worst condition, but my arrhythmia was always exacerbated by purging because of the way it fucks with electrolytes.   Also, decreasing your caffeine consumption helps too. I kept getting the same unsettling palpitations you describe, so the docs recommended this for me. I dropped drinking a lot of coffee! But monsters are another story. Whoops. ",False,False

It can be totally normal, particularly if you're physically fit.  I would say it's most likely not a sign of something more sinister. But if you experience other symptoms like shortness of breath, palpitations, chest pain, etc. it's probably worth getting it checked out.",False,False

I also started around the same age, I still wish that I had asked for the help then. I’m almost 23 now. My family said they noticed my eating problems when I was younger, but thought it was a phase I would grow out of.  You have such a full life ahead of you. France sounds wonderful. Even if your mom doesn’t understand it sounds like you have good adult influences such as your aunt and your grandmother. Reach out to them if you can. Also it’s so interesting how intuitive people with EDs can be to others behavior. It’s like once you are aware of certain behaviors you see it easier. ",False,False

Btw im 13, and have been struggling for 2-3 yrs now. I've attempted recovery in the past, but I always ended up getting worse. I have thought about trying again. I want to get better for my step brothers and baby brother to be alive for them. I'm also going to France in April because my aunt is taking me (she struggled with an ED too). Maybe my trip to France will help me take my mind off things and learn to live. I might consider talking to her without it. She took me to Disney once and caught on my habits despite weight or anything. ",False,True

I don’t know how old you are, but I’m guessing you are young. This is the time to try to get help. Find adults that can help you before you do more damage to your body than you already may have. Your grandmother may be a great resource for advocating for your health and wellness it is a large part of being an RN. Please try to reach out as soon as you can. The heart is not an organ to play around with. ",False,False

At least see if she will make you a regular primary care visit. They can listen to your heart and make sure you are okay. Your school nurse should be able to do this as well.,False,False

Im just ranting, there really is nothing I can do right now. My mom is hard-headed and think this is a choice with no problems. That I'm over-exaggerating etc etc. She did promise I would get an assesment for my ed but she hasnt called anyone. So im probably going to my dads over summer if I don't get help by then.",False,True

Even if it’s you think it’s nothing you never know. Even if you are just dehydrated they can give you fluids which sometimes makes all the difference. They can do EKGs and check your electrolytes. If you’re in the US and do not have insurance ask for the financial help packet. Usually you just have to fill out a bunch of information about your financial status. ,False,False
