Because of my disordered eating I either binge for months or restrict. It takes a few months for tracking to normalize my intake and then I can kinda let myself eat intuitively.,False,False

I have a hard time finding recovery/body positive posts that don’t use the word fat or demonize calories.   I know I’m maybe an outlier but tracking keeps me on track and in a mentally healthy place. If I don’t my disordered eating habits comeback/get worse. It’s the only way to shut up the voice in my head.,False,False
