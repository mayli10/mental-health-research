Granted, his TDEE is like double mine, but the fact that I want him to be very well-fed completely goes against what I want for myself.  It'll be like 4:00 pm, and if my boyfriend says, ""I haven't even since breakfast"" I do my concerned freakout while knowing fully will I hadn't eaten since the day before or possibly longer. It's a mess.",False,False
