You are under round-the-clock care and supervision in a medical facility. It is generally shorter in duration and focuses on preventing immediate and acute risk to your life.   Residential is similar, except you're not necessarily at a hospital. You may have the ability to come and go depending on program rules. You're still under 24/7 care, but in a less clinical environment and over a longer term. This is designed to stabilize you physically and mentally.  Intensive outpatient means you are partaking in activities during the day, but you aren't living in a facility or hospital. You go home at night, you might still have a job... You're transitioning into independent living with less supervision.  Outpatient is a step down, and consists of therapy, maybe group work, classes, or weekly meetings... Basically the least amount of supervision.",False,False
