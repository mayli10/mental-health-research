At least with the nicer yogurt the calories are worth it haha",False,False

I'll choose a higher calorie food (up to 50 cal difference) if it seems like it'll be more nutritious or filling. With snacks I always choose the lowest calories though.,False,False

I‚Äôll generally be happy to ‚Äúspend‚Äù an extra 25-50 cals on the nicer looking choice.   It‚Äôs actually funny to think that I even bother to consider that level of difference considering how often I end up bingeing and downing 5000+ cals in one sitting lol ,False,False

I tend to restrict more beforehand if I'm going to have a day I don't look at calories as much. It actually makes choosing kind of easier to go by calories if there are many options I like and I also feel less guilty if I at least try to be ""healthy"" üòÖ",False,False
