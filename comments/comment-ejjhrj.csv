Moreover, recent research has been pointing at there being a large genetic component to EDs (which likely interacts with the environmental risk factor components in different ratios and ways for different people).   &gt; Replicated heritability estimates for AN range between 0.48 and 0.74; for BN, between 0.55 and 0.62, and for BED, between 0.39 and 0.45.   (from [this paper](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5356465/) on the genetic epidemiology of EDs)  And even if it *was* a choice (which it isn't), one might stop and wonder why one's beloved partner is choosing to do something that is clearly self-destructive and causing them pain. And one might think empathetically about how hard of a time one's partner must be having to choose to rely on such a painful and dangerous coping mechanism instead of just writing it off as them being self-centered.",False,False

To really get better and stop the eating disorder we have to deal with the issues that started it, some of which we might not even be aware of.  I told my boyfriend that I binged today (over my tdee) and his response was ""just stop eating"". Reasonable, but it doesn't really help.  You aren't self centered, you are dealing with complex issues. Try to be kind to yourself while you figure it out.",False,False

And it’s not as easy as “just eat” or “just stop thinking about it” it’s an actual problem that can’t be stopped by just wishing it away (trust me I tried). It takes time and hard work to stop the ed thoughts so don’t feel like you are just weak or too self centered. If you want to talk to someone you can message me.",False,False
