I’m pretty sure he just feels helpless and like there’s no other way to get me to stop. But I have brought up better solutions like maybe cooking healthy meals together or meal prepping and he seems interested so thank you :)",False,True

He’s most likely oblivious to how dangerous and unhealthy his idea really is. I’d have a chat with him about how he can support you. It doesn’t mean you have to force yourself into recovery. Maybe the best thing for you right now is to have someone to talk to openly, someone to vent to, or maybe someone to do healthy eating activities like lunches with, or maybe you need someone to cook for you or find recipes with you, or maybe you need someone to accompany you to doctors or therapy appointments. Just let him know how he can support you and remind him that this isn’t about HIM and what HE thinks is best.",False,False

It will make it harder for you to stop, legitimately. It's like that whole, ""dont think of a white elephant,"" that's all you can think of. If you tell yourself you cannot b/p it will make it hard to resist because it's a taboo thing your brain will crave more. This is difficult for him too, but you absolutely need to tell him that this will do the opposite of help.",False,False

I think he just feels so helpless and I never realized how big of a toll it took on him but it really hurts him to see that. It breaks my heart to know I cause him so much worry. Idk I guess I’ve imagined it like what if I dated someone who regularly shot up with heroin and I couldn’t do a damn thing about it. He loves me a lot but doesn’t know what to do and sincerely thinks it would help me because he knows I love him too.,False,True
