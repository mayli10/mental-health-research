If they had seen the OVERWHELMING support of people to one another.  Having a bad day? Its okay darling we are here for you.   Feeling like recovery?  hey good for you honey! You go! you get well! hell yeah! It was never about being better than one another, who was sicker, or thinner. We just helped. it even stated that the sub was for people who weren't quite ready for recovery.  but there were subs for people in recovery.   Im so salty.",False,True

Every new years eve is a fight of ""im gonna gorge myself"" to ""NEVER EAT AGAIN"" in both extremes.   I was gone for maybe...6 months? My boyfriend found my reddit account and discovered how much I was posting on ProED, and other things, I was mortified. So I deleted everything.     I was 'normal'. I was eating more, I gained some ( I HATE SAYING THAT ) and my body grew used to eating regular meals through out the day.  I made a new reddit looking for support.  I found my safe place gone and I wept.",False,True

We were about to go private, but they (the mods) said it didn't matter. They can see private subs, direct messages, everything. So there's not much point in going private just to hide from mods.

The funny thing is I posted on loseit before I was even underweight and had dozens of people demanding the mods remove my post because I “seem anorexic.”  It’s like Reddit is totally ok with eating disorders until someone actually gets thin, then they’re like “ok wow gross you can stop now!!!” ",False,False

There was one or two posts which gave tips or tricks. However considering it was a total safe space to vent and such, I don’t think that was the worst thing. It allowed people to freely talk without fear.  It feels like this new community is on its best behavior, I try harder not to post anything that could lead to someone not taking care of themselves and I think most other people are too. I’ve seen a lot less recommendations for low cal foods for example. I also don’t see “on a 72 hour fast, send me strength!”   It’s for the best.
