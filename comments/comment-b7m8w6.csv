I just throw mine in bed with me and wake up with them warmed to my body heat but that's just cuz I don't wanna leave the bed without warm clothes on. I gotta get up at 5 am for work and live in Minnesota lol. Winter is loads of fun.",False,False

My alarm goes off at 5:40 and I feel like my body temperature drops like 10 degrees when I wake up. During the summer it's so much easier to get up.   If you have control over this, get a programmable thermostat. I set mine to turn up in the morning so I can get up. That, and/or a space heater. Get up and turn it on and go back to bed until it's warm again ðŸ˜‚",False,False

Although waking up still sucks, it helps when I set my alarm ~1 hour early and turn my space heater on full blast so by the time i actually have to leave bed, its reasonably warm in my room.",False,False

Rise early in the morning, and crash in the afternoon. I'd get up at 4:55 almost every day.  Now, while restricting, it's so hard to get out of bed in the morning, and it seems like I get more energy as the day goes on. I have my alarm set at 5:35 am on days I have to be at school by 7 (same time as when I'd wake up at 4:55), and I just sleep in every other day. I'm so lucky I only have 2 days/week where I have to wake up early anymore. I have no idea how I'm going to do it 4 days/week again next semester.",False,False

Pretty fucking miserable and just like you I just did *not* want to get out of bed to be cold and miserable all day.  The only thing that helped me get out of the warmth of my bed was leaving my clothes on a hot radiator overnight, so I could wake up and slip straight into warm clothes. Alternatively you can put them in the drier for a few minutes.   Beyond that nothing really kept the cold away. I basically hung around every source of heat like a moth to a flame.",False,False
