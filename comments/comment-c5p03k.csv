If you look at MFP, when I weighed myself I would have days of 6000-8000 calories, followed by fasting for a day or two because I was afraid of what the scale would say.   My wife told me to put away the scale. I did and kept tracking my calories. I never really went above 4000, but I also never fasted because there was no scale or number to be afraid of.   My therapist said weighing myself once a week would be okay, especially for practical reasons to at least know my weight. I‚Äôm not saying I recommend this for everyone, but I did and was surprised to see my weight hadn‚Äôt changed.",False,False

If you are the type to recite what you ate today in your head, write it down instead and avoid checking it. I've been guesstimating for 6 years now, it works ok, I still get weird when there's food not made by me, and i've measured how much fits in my hands in such way or how much is each bowl and cup and mug i use... but it's less obsessive. (i still double check with my fancy schmancy measuring cups and spoons I got every now and then, lol).  i fantasized about a food scale for a while but have my head on straight enough to.. not do that.   but yeah i also imagine i'm eating... muuuuch more than i'm telling myself. minus my prepped meals, which i measure out lmao",False,False

I'll binge on crap - starts with planning a low restriction day but then going over calories and then the whole fuck it mentality.  So then I fast for a bit but when I feel the bingey feelings hit I try to reason with myself. Like, OKAY, we can have a high calorie day, you can eat however much of whatever you want as long as it's keto. But then I still feel guilty and either binge again or just slip back into fasting.
