I never go out with friends for a normal meal, that terrifies me to the bone! So many calories, but not like in a binge where I‘ll have 10000 calories? That’s just too...moderate.

Like it was disturbing me for years that i could not eat for a few days and then eat a few days’ worth of food in a single sitting, and now behavior i was deeply ashamed of has become aspirational for people in the fitness community?  Who are the gatekeepers for what is and isnt ED behavior? DSMv aside, it seems if you smile while doing it on instagram, it’s fine and cool all of a sudden...",False,False

If I'm going to be hungry, I might as well try my hardest to restrict and maximize the weight loss. If I'm not losing weight and 'perfetion' is unobtainable I may as well enjoy as much food as I can.   For whatever reason I can't convince myself to eat normal foods in normal amounts because somehow they're not worth it at those levels (if that makes any sense). Like eating a cup or two of popcorn? No way. I'm either eating a bowl that's way too big or absolutely none. ",False,False
