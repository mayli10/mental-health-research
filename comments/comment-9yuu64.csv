When I first heard about metabolic damage, I was so thrown off and terrified. Like damn, even if I get to a healthy weight I could still be fighting the effects of this thing. Stuff like this makes me feel like having an ED is just having weird disasters occurring around you in multiple places at the same time. And on top of that, you have to prepare/think about/worry over future disasters. And then clean up after the last thousand disasters. It’s just a rainstorm of disasters. I don’t know what I’m saying.   But I do hear you on the good habits &amp; muscle gains. I’m hoping and praying that if I can fight my way through this, I can make it to that point &amp; somehow my body won’t be a /total/ train wreck like it is now.   I agree with the sitting in the corner. I’ll be in mine as well trying to figure out how to juggle trying to eventually “look good” but also not destroy my body completely lmao  but I’m sending you all the good energy that I can &amp; I’m wishing for you to find positivity &amp; comfort in your journey 💖 thank you for replying, helping me out, and making me feel less alone in this!!!",False,True

That’s what really bothered me the most. The fact that they’re saying that my body could essentially be playing “make-up” for the rest of my life. Based on what you’re saying, I feel like if I lost weight and just ate “non-ED” foods (meaning actual meals with actual nutrition and not lettuce and sadness) at actual “normal” calorie levels, then it would be more sustainable and comfortable for me. I honestly feel like when I read this article, my ED brain went haywire and was just like “science means nothing and my body is doomed to hell” lmaooo but you guys have brought me back to reality 😂  And I totally hear you.

It's that they weren't designed to live in an abundance of extra food.

Many people don't sustain lifestyle changes and just revert back to their old eating habits before they started losing weight, thus they gain the weight back, because it's those eating habits which caused them to gain weight in the first place.   Your BMR is also reduced when you lose weight too, which isn't your metabolism 'slowing down', it's just lower weights require less energy to maintain than higher ones. It's like you'd definitely burn more energy / have a higher TDEE if you were dragging an extra 30-pound weight around with you every day, right? This combined with the last bit I was talking about could lead to pretty quick weight gain.   Old behaviours habits die hard, and problems such as overeating (just by nature) or binging (disordered habits) are some of the hardest things to beat. Losing weight doesn't deal with that issue, and it's really easy just to slip back into those behaviours.   If I ate how I used to eat (I used to have BED, but my ED has since morphed into Bulimia), and didn't fast or purge, I'd put the weight back on really quickly. Which terrifies me, and is making it really hard to stop fasting and purging for me, because I know if I don't compensate I'm just gonna gain it all back :/ (which isn't the main reason I b/p, but it is an unwelcome incentive).

I know my lifestyle still isn't terribly healthy based on the obsessive nature, the extremism, and the anxiety involved.

But everything I've read says that continued good habits and muscle gains in addition to weightloss help improve your metabolism and can mitigate the affects of dramatic weightloss. But they have to be sustained efforts in order to work. Reducing bodymass reduces BMR. Increasing muscle increases BMR. Increasing BMR and increasing activity increase TDEE. The math works.

I can debunk this and y'know what? I will.  The reason these women gained their weight back was they crash dieted and then went back to their old eating habits. So of course they didn't keep the weight off! They went back to what caused the weight gain in the first place. They didn't change their lifestyle, which is what you really need for sustained weightloss. You need to eat healthily and not be sedentary and you'll be fine.   Other things that help is building muscle. You won't become bulky, but muscle requires more calories so your BMR increases. The women in the study didn't do that, they lost fat and became what's known as 'skinny fat', you need to build some muscle and become lean and not only do you look good at a higher weight, you feel better and your metabolism is faster.

We talked about it over on r/fatlogic   The reason diets fail is because people dont keep up the healthy habits once they've lost weight or they don't adjust their deficit for their new weight. If you're trying to lose at a healthy rate by doing 500cal deficit and you start with a TDEE of 2800 for example, you can't expect to eat 2300 calories forever without exercise and continue to lose weight, your lighter body won't need all of that. You'll have to adjust to a lower number that is still a 500cal deficit of your new, lower TDEE. Then when you're where you want to be weight-wise, you stop eating at a deficit and maintain.

These needs are controlled by the unconscious part of our brain, which can't really be forced to accept things that it doesn't want to happen. The basic principles of restriction apply for all basic bodily needs that need refilling:  Hold your breath or try to breathe less for a while and you'll end up taking many big gasps of air to make up for it when you start breathing freely again.  Pull an all-nighter or sleep 3 hours a night for a while and you'll end up sleeping a lot to make up for it when you start sleeping freely again.  Fast or intensively restrict calories for a while and you'll end up eating a lot to make up for it when you start eating freely again.  There are two solutions to these problems, either ignoring your body's natural needs, or making adjustments that automatically cause your brain to want less of something.  Better quality of sleep can reduce the amount of sleep you need from 8 to 6 hours, where as forcing yourself to wake up after 6 hours without improving the quality of your sleep creates sleep debt that you'll have to repay in the future by sleeping a lot to be less tired all the time.  Better quality of food and healthy exercise can reduce the amount of calories your appetite naturally wants from 2000 to 1500, where as forcing yourself to stop eating after 1000 calories without improving the quality of food or adding healthy exercise creates hunger debt that you'll have to repay in the future by eating a lot to get rid of food thoughts and constant hunger.  I know I'm a huge hypocrite for believing in that as as an underweight anorexic who used to be obese, but it's simply the theory that makes the most sense to me. I'm personally choosing the route of ignoring my body's natural cues (which seems to fail +90% of people), so far it hasn't been too difficult and I don't see myself giving in anytime soon. If I do give in and start listening to my body, the weight will come back and I'll be overweight again. There is no magic future in which I'll be a BMI below 20 and eat when hungry/stop when full.
