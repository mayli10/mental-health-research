Then they can tell you if there’s something wrong (whether ed related or not).   I know that I would be super freaked out if someone came up to me asking if I had an ED (bc even though I do, it’s super personal to me and I’m a very private person), so I would personally just bring up that I’m concerned about something being wrong, and not necessarily bring up any specific issues that might be causing their weight loss.  Good luck with talking to your friend!!",False,False
