Which seems obvious now that you pointed it out but I was feeling really spun out when I wrote my original post.  I do have an anxiety disorder that for the most part I manage okay but yeah I guess I forget sometimes that I have a habit of channeling all my anxiety into food and weight as a way to manage my feelings.

You worry that other people don't feel the same way that you do. The truth is that if this behaviour makes you feel so bad than you would stop it if you could. You can't though. You're struggling just like the rest of us.,False,False
