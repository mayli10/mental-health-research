I said ""thank you for saying that but that doesn't fix anything."" It has to come from inside because no amount of compliments will change my disordered thoughts and I'm not telling you this looking for compliments.

I know that my boyfriend, when he eats too much and/or drinks too much, will wake up the next day saying that he feels ""fat"" or feels ""bloated"", and often expresses, objectively or subtly, that he is feeling anxious, regret, and anger at himself for eating the way that he did. It usually follows by a few hours or a day of fasting until ""that feeling is gone"", then he's back to normal.   I also know people who just have a crappy relationship with food, and treat ""bloated"" the same way.   TLDR; it's not the word... but instead the meaning that we choose to give it. :/",False,False
