I think I’m gonna start saying “stuck in underland” as code for referring to my relapses since I’m often under 100lbs for them. “One way ticket to onderland” is gonna be a euphemism for recovery/treatment and “onederland” is gonna be an endearing term for my healthy-weight range since my minimum healthy weight is in the low 100s.,False,False

Severely obese people who have a lot of weight to lose (to be in healthy range) are usually in the two hundreds and three hundreds. If u gain to be greater than 199 or lose to be below 100 then that means you’re no longer in **one**derland/**one**hundreds.  That’s the reason the “w” in “wonderland” Is dropped and an additional “e” is added in.  Getting to Onederland/Onehundreds is kind of symbolic of their perseverance to get to normalcy. For many people getting to the onehundreds takes over a year of commitment meanwhile the majority of adults in the world are already Onehundred-something pounds— even many overweight ones. So it’s like entering a better ‘world‘ that always existed, that so many people live in, but they previously couldn’t access it because they were too large — kinda like Alice shrinking down to get to wonderland. It’s such a perfect cute name for it, and I really wonder who came up with it lol.  It also seems to be an achievement because the large majority of adults have a final goal weight/ideal body weight that’s in the one hundreds so getting their is like finishing the second-to-last lap, so to speak.",False,False

Don’t worry it doesn’t make me uncomfortable ! Sometimes it’s like I’ve had an ed so long I don’t even think the same way as normal people. Like 100lb is the big 1 for me even though last time I got under I ended up in IP,False,True

I’m not trying to combative or anything, I’m just genuinely curious but if explaining makes u uncomfortable then just ignore this last part of my comment",False,False

It's called onederland because it's in the 100s. ""One""derland ""one"" hundred. Under 100 wouldn't be onederland anymore. I don't even know what I'd call that. If there's even a name for that. Besides ""unhealthy"" unless you're a child or incredibly short.",False,False
