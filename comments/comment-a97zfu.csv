Now I've calmed down, I've realised whatever food I eat tomorrow, however many calories I consume - it's NOT permanent. If we lose control tomorrow, it's okay, we'll be okay, we can't gain pounds overnight. You'd have to eat 3000+cals *over* you're tdee to gain a pound of fat.   Ik Christmas seems to just revolve around food and alcohol, but try and focus on other things if you can? Maybe go for a walk, or watch a movie or play a boardgame with family? Something that will distract your mind and keep your hands busy. ",False,False

Maybe you can try having something to hold on to when feeling anxious around food? I always have a drink in hand (water or something low cal) when I feel that way around a lot of food and it helps because it keeps my mind busy. Just take small sips and breathe!!! Hang tight, the sooner it comes the sooner it goes away &lt;3",False,False

The mental obsession and concomitant anxiety, well, they flat-out suck. But there can still be good moments. And it doesn‚Äôt have to be like this forever. Change may be measured in years, but it‚Äôs real and possible.  While the whole ‚Äúpositive self talk‚Äù thing has always kinda struck me as BS, I do try to assess my thought patterns and look out for cognitive distortions. My instinct is to assume the worst and to beat myself up, but I simultaneously recognize this isn‚Äôt *effective*. All it does is make my life harder.  So maybe, see if you could say a couple compassionate things to yourself today. Because you definitely deserve compassion - both from others and from yourself.",False,False

Losing control and having too many calories is NOT inevitable. It is your choice. What can you do if you feel like you are losing control? Have a plan. I am also a little worried about this; my plan will be to come on here I think. ,False,False
