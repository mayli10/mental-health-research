I definitely feel confident I can maintain a healthy amount of body fat. Technically up to like 20% body fat (for males) is perfectly healthy. I also wouldn't look like what I look like right now at the upper end of that range and I would probably feel pretty disgusting.,False,True

I'm seeing a therapist and she's like we've got to work on helping you stop calorie counting again and all I can think is oh no she's going to make me get fat I already gave up my scale what more do you need for me to feel better?????? Logically I know I can maintain a normal BMI without Calorie counting but what's the point in a normal BMI is just too much the range is to large! On top of that America is filled when obese people and I'm hell bent on never becoming one so why shouldn't I use my magical powers of self control and fucking manipulate my body to my will? ,False,False
