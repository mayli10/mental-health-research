Found out last night he's moved on already, which was already a gut punch as we'd planned out a life together, I'd met his family, he said he loved me constantly, and the breakup was tearful and awful on my end. Should add I was definitely relapsing on my ED the last 6 months of the relationship (I had gained a lot of weight throughout the year and had other mental health stuff going on as well that didn't help), though he was kind about it and that was not the reason we broke up. As I thought more about it, he was a really shitty boyfriend in other ways and just was overall controlling, possessive, disrespectful, and narcissistic.  At first I was upset he moved on so quickly when I'm still trying to get my mental health in order again. It took him less than a month to move on from a girl he told was his future and his universe? That's not insulting at all. I quickly turned kind of numb though, because I had managed to fast all day and didn't eat my one daily meal yet.  Whatever. He never loved me. Oh well.

I dont binge every time I cant accommodate my hunger: my body and mind are slowly realizing that not eating for a few hours doesn't mean I'm on my way to starving to death again.   (Why does it matter so much to me that I used to have heart problems? That I was so close to dying? Like I need that experience to validate and feel comfortable with my weight gain now. It's just something I'm noticing when I talk about my experiences this past year and a half.)   But that doesn't mean everything is going smoothly.  In other news, I almost started publicly crying because the man working at a fast food chain put cream instead of skim milk in my coffee and I took a few sips before I realized. I'll drink 400 calories of meal replacement shakes without hesitation but no fucking way am I drinking 4 shots of creamer in my coffee that I didn't ask for.    Also, I have a baby bit of OCD coming in, but it might just be related to stress over my upcoming exam.    Thanks for reading (I love this subreddit for giving me a space to talk about this stuff. I dont want to talk about this with my therapist or friends because I'm getting over it and it's... not something people will easily understand...)",False,False

I know I will have to challenge this in recovery, but wtf? It seems like I either use small utensils (restricting or eating normally) or eat with my hands (binging.)",False,False
