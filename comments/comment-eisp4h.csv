I'd go, ""well, hah, I'm underweight, look what you did to me, you assholes"".   It was really unhealthy and shitty, and I'm glad I was able to stop. On the odd occasion where I'm hate browsing subs and take a peak in one of those, my reaction is now ""well, hah, I'm ripped, look what you *couldn't* do to me.""   The main thing that replaced it was overweight people irl confiding in me about their struggles, because it is clear that I've struggled, too, having been both underweight and overweight in my adult life. Giving (solicited) advice and pep talks creates a way more positive cycle in terms of dealing with my own insecurities.",False,False
