I mean, I *have* lost a noticeable amount of weight, and my eating at times *is* noticeably disordered, and trying to obfuscate around that is often more energy than just the truth combined with boundary setting. I’m an adult and I’m my own guardian soooo, yeah. A casual, “Oh yeah, I’ve lost some weight.” Follow up with, “I’ve really been enjoying running!” Or alternately “I’d prefer not to discuss it though. Thanks for understanding.” (Or variations thereupon)   As far as eating vegan, people really can get weirdly vocal about diets differing from their own so I do tend to prevaricate a little here. “I just don’t like X so much. I’m all about Y though! These Ys look amazing! (Aaaand subject change)”",False,False

I lie about how much I weigh. ""I ran out of foundation, I know, I look like I'm DYING without it. Love aging, right?"" I roll my eyes and say ""That's just because I'm wearing two pairs of control-tops! It's so cold I needed layers!"" I save my calories up so that I can eat meals with my parents. If I'm not eating, I rattle off foods I've been craving as the ""huge lunch we had catered at work."" I'm already shopping for my thanksgiving outfit, because my plan is to buy a pair of slacks a size or two up and then wear another pair of pants underneath so I look bigger.     Yeah, I feel like a piece of shit, but a *skinny* piece of shit.",False,False
