I have low calorie recipes all saved even though I know I'll probably never make any of them, I'll plan orders in advance even if I know I won't be going to a restaurant anytime soon and daydream about a bunch of different food combos I can do within my limit and stuff I want to try. Hanging around on this sub I've seen a lot of people fixated on food and in love with it so I know I'm not alone  If calories didn't exist I would be alright.
