I remember I used to eat apples bc they were so filling for me at times.   Eventually this could change. Maybe go for smaller ones or try breaking them up so you eat one throughout the day.,False,False

Itâ€™s just too much simple sugar. I donâ€™t stay full for long so itâ€™s not a good value for the calories either. I honestly prefer a potato or a bit of brown rice+veggies, at least I keep full for a long time on that",False,False

You could try mini apples though? I donâ€™t know where you can buy them, maybe a farmers market or an organic store? I just have a tree on my walk home from Uni I always grab an apple from and they are super tiny (prob. 50 calories each) and the best apples ever.",False,False
