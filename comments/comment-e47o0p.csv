I remember being so mad when my family would say it was just a phase and I'd grow out of it, because I never did and it's over a decade later. I was also told I'd never find anyone to love me if I couldn't share a meal on a date, because that's fucking helpful, thanks Mom.  I feel like it contributes a lot to my eating issues, I had misophonia before ED and after a few years of crying when I heard people eat and being unable to eat mandatory family dinner without severe anxiety, I think anyone would have some food issues, even if they didn't end up being anorexic. I literally would rather starve than have to sit and listen to people chew, and that's eventually what I started doing :/  The worst is people acting like I'm the one being immature, when literally every single person I've ever confided in about it will do really exaggerated chomping to trigger me like it's funny immediately afterwards. As if that's not fucking immature. If I told a person a certain noise triggered memories of my rape, they would never do that, and honestly the two elicit extremely similar anxiety and panic responses. They're very comparable in terms of the distress they cause me, but misophonia is totally misunderstood. Not only do people not try to be considerate about my misophonia triggers, they actively try to make it worse for me and then laugh about it.",False,False
