I had pretty much straight relapsed right when I was discharged but it really kicked off again when I got back to school since I go out of state. I skipped the phone appointment I was supposed to have with my therapist and when my dietician texted me saying she had to reschedule my apps with her I just never did. That left me with just my psych who when I did actually go see at my scheduled app told me if I hadn't come she would have called 911 on my which pissed me off hella. I've been switching through a lot of antidepressants because the first 4 I've tried don't seem to make any difference in my mental state. After a couple more apps with my psych and her begging me to see at least a dietician again, I was still noncompliant. I had my last app with her the Monday before thanksgiving and at that point I wasn't even taking the meds anymore because it literally made no difference, and finally she was fed up with me not doing what she said and gave in and I did not schedule another app with her, so now I'm rogue, but like you I just feel the need to figure out recovery on my own. I don't hate my psych, but treatment didn't help, and the meds weren't helping either, and I just wasn't willing to do therapy anymore, so seeing her felt pretty pointless. I don't recommend this at all if you really want recovery though because I don't actually know if I can do this on my own, but right I really don't want recovery at all so having a team would be a waste because I'm just not willing to put any effort into it. If you want to vent someone about this lmk because I relate hella.",False,False
