The idea of ""growing pains"" makes a lot of sense and it's actually really comforting to think of it that way. Growing pains go away eventually. Thanks.",False,True

I can tell you though, it does get easier to live in your body. I still feel like shit a lot of the time, I’m still uncomfortable and I still feel like a failure, but it is SO MUCH better than when I first started. It will take a bit of time but you’re young, and I really hope you stick around for that time. ",False,False

Having an eating disorder is the epitome of ""damned if you do, damned if you don't."" Being sick sucks, but being healthier sucks equally or often more.   It's paradoxical. It's easier to live when you're close to dying.   I think the term ""growing pains"" applies, both literally and figuratively. It's a difficult transition, made more difficult by the fact that you didn't choose to put yourself on that path.   Just hold on. You're a total badass to have stuck it out for any period of time.
