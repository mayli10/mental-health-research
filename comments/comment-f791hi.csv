I was recovered for a couple years but with the weight gain and this itâ€™s all very triggering :( thank you for the kind words. Hopefully Iâ€™ll be in recovery again soon",False,True

ED logic is not real logic. I feel like ED brain finds any reason to flare up.   Also, anyone seeing pictures of their ex with a new SO is bound to pull on the heartstrings. So no, you're NOT crazy for that. Take care of yourself ðŸ’—",False,False
