I learned in my first round of treatment that a lot of emotions have another emotion driving them that you can pinpoint. Anger usually has fear or sadness driving it,False,False

It’s been SUCH an important realization that people’s reactions and statements are often more about their own struggles than they are about the content of what they’re saying. This is particularly true when people are lashing out at others, I think",False,False

It can be because we feel we aren't sick enough to get help, because we want others to notice and care, or because we don't feel like we deserve recovery to name a few.  I don't think that alone makes you wannarexic. I'd say a ""wannarexic"" is someone who romanticizes eating disorders and people with EDs and ""wants"" to develop an ED because they think it's cool.",False,False

Ironically a lot of the people who say things like that are suffering themselves or want to feel superior to others. Feelings of wanting someone to notice suffering are very common disordered thoughts,False,False

Regardless of perceived or actual validity, if you have or believe you have issues with food, or weight, or cognitions regarding those, it's worth looking into and taking care of.",False,False

Sadly, at 18 we usually gain weight and that's the worse time for girls with ED. Please, talk to your parents (believe me, they can help you SO MUCH, even if you think they don't understand anything) and try to recover while you're still a kid!!!!!!",False,False
