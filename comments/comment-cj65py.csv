But when I told the doctor about it she said that that only happens when you’re actually purging. I’m never seeing that doctor again.   Thank you for commenting!,False,True

When you chew your food, your digestive system starts preparing itself to digest it, and produces more digestive enzymes and stomach acids. This is fine if you swallow your food, but without it, the excess enzymes and acids will start eating away at your digestive tract. This can cause stomach ulcers, tooth decay, throat irritation, etc.   If you are having stomachaches, you should go see a doctor if you can because it could be the beginnings of an ulcer, which could get really bad if you don't have it checked out.   Please stay safe! 😔🙏",False,False
