Men suffer in silence so as not to be labeled ""weak"" aka ""feminine""  But let's just keep talking shit about men. And then downvote them for their opinion on the topic because they are somehow invading a female space.   That will help the situation.",False,False

Also sexism can apply to all genders, so saying it does't make sense against men, now that's sexist.  I'm not here to debate, but please get your facts straight.",False,False

My ex once told me that I was the only girl he had ever dated who didn't have a thigh gap and it was ""weird"". Then was butt hurt when I got upset like that wasn't an insulting comment.

If you’re not ready for recovery, are you at least seeing a therapist? That way you could talk about those kinds of comments and maybe it’ll be helpful to work through them.   When I started recovery, I was dating a boy who had a fat fetish. Even though I was dying from my eating disorder, I was convinced he liked me because I was fat. Of course I couldn’t accept that I was nowhere near it. When he found out how terrible it made me feel that I found out about his preference, he did everything he could to support me through my recovery.   I had another ex who knew about my ED, and would still tell me I had thick thighs because he was too oblivious to realize that not every woman sees that as a compliment. I’m an asshole so I would make him feel bad about it, “oh thanks that’s a great thing to say to someone recovering from an eating disorder.”  But no matter what it was still shitty. I feel like in general people who’ve never suffered from an ED don’t think about how their comments will come off. It’s hard to accept that and not take it personally, but again that might be where therapy would help.   TLDR: boys are assholes screw em",False,False
