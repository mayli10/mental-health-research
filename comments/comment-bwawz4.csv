Michelob Ultra is only 90 calories, and it has the other benefit of tasting like piss so you don't want more than one.  I like wine a lot better, and thankfully its nutritional value can be approximated a lot more easily. I put these entries into my custom foods in LoseIt and it's a lot less embarrassing to ask someone what kind of wine you're drinking than about the calorie info. Hope it helps! And if you don't like wine, hope it can help someone else. It's not exact but it's better than nothing.  wine | serving | calories | carbs | sugar :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :--  sweet white, 6-9% ABV (Riesling, Moscato) | 6 oz. | 130 | 32 | 10g sweet white, 9-12% ABV (Riesling, Moscato) | 6 oz. | 195 | 48 | 18g dry white, 9-12% ABV (Pinot Grigio, AlbariÃ±o) | 6 oz. | 125 | 31 | 5g dry white, 12-14% ABV (Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc) | 6 oz. | 200 | 52 | 4g dry red, 11-13% ABV (Pinot Noir, Cabernet) | 6 oz. | 180 | 45 | 1g dry red, 14-16% ABV (Pinot Noir, Cabernet) | 6 oz. | 150 | 37 | 1g sparkling, 12.5% ABV (Champagne) | 4 oz. | 110 | 27 | 1.5g dessert, 14-21% ABV (Port, Sherry) | 4 oz. | 230 | 57 | 32g",False,False

No nutrition facts on them. I rarely drink at home, but when I do, it's usually Redd's or Angry Orchard, which DO list calories (if anyone has any recs that are &lt;150 hmu lmao).  Basically, assuming you're American, alcohol isn't regulated by the FDA, but by the TTB (Alcohol  and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau). FDA requires nutrition labels, TTB makes them optional.

And of course, the alcohol industry lobbies to keep nutrition labels optional on alcohol because they have a vested interest in people not realizing just how many kcals are in that shot of Baileys.
