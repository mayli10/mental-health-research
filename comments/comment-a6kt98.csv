I have 2 1/2 years of sobriety and although I didn’t follow the 12 step path (I never worked the program) I believe (and I’m sure you know this to be true) that it is MUCH worse when you’re holding it all in and keeping it to yourself. To quote an okey but a goodie: you’re only as sick as your secrets.   You have a choice right now to drive a stake in the ground and reclaim your self. Take it! You can continue to move forward from where you are right now. ,False,False

I just hate myself for relapsing, but as long as I can pull my head in by Monday I should hopefully be okay.   I just need to try not to binge again today but I've already had like 400 - 500 calories, ugh.",False,True

Doesn’t mean you’re not moving forward.  I don’t see any reason why you’d get fired for kissing a coworker, but it always helps me to know that neurotic people are more likely to suffer from hangxiety (hangover anxiety) so things always feel a lot worse when you’re recovering from a night of drinking. I’m not saying that you’re overreacting, just that things might feel slightly easier to deal with after a couple days of rest and self care.  Sorry things are tough right now :( try and stay safe please",False,False
