You would put in a bowl and eat with a spoon if you had the whole thing at once. It's a peanut butter cup smoothie, so people would assume it's pretty calories dense. In reality it's not and it's actually very healthy.",False,False

The nutrition on the website is not accurate (I put everything into MFP) but they recommend it makes 6 servings and I cannot eat 1/6 of the recipe in one meal. It is really legitimately filling. It also has a good protein content and is even better with the quinoa.   According to mfp 1/6 of the recipe(I was able to weigh the total after it was cooked and for me 1/6 was 383g) is 260 calories with 11.8g protein, 1.9g fat and 49.9g carbs (15g fiber) It is even more nutritious with the quinoa.",False,False
