Iâ€™ve also been on a medication for a year that makes me want to eat everything in sight and like any craving I have Iâ€™m going to fucking get it. No self control. No discipline.   Luckily Iâ€™m coming down and off the medicine and for the first time in forever I have a bit more self control but shit. I donâ€™t know how people do it.,False,False

I thought I was getting a lot better but if there's a bowl of food in front of me, and especially if it's a social situation like dinner or a party, it's like I forget that I'm trying to restrict and keep eating. And eating. And every bite it's like, ""it's ok, because this is my last bite :)"" and then I realise I'm already lifting another one to my mouth. Then trying to approximate the damage afterwards and I always over-estimate bc I get anxious if I don't but then I get anxious looking at my calorie count lmao can't win",False,False
