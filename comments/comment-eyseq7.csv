I've had the same where I thought I was gonna throw up and I have emetophobia I hold it in even when I'm sick but at that particular time I felt so nauseous and actually tried but only dry heaved which makes sense because my tummy was empty and then I just passed out.. after that incident whenever I feel like this I just lie down to redirect blood to my brain or eat a candy or something to regulate blood sugar and avoid passing out at all coz that shit is scary.,False,False

I hate to say it though, I’m so used to it that it doesn’t frighten me quite as much. I just think, “Well, better get some sugar in me real quick. Candy or soda?”  This time super sucked tho because usually I don’t have to run so far for a restroom, nor is the nausea so intense.",False,True
