I tend to have a snack at each place but the final actual meal for me always is hard. Last year I actually told my boyfriend, “I’m going to go puke” after dinner. He brought it up a couple days later (we had only been together a couple months) and I explained it was a problem I was dealing with. He’s been understanding since. But I am terrified, but trying to go in postitivley. It’s just one day and all that jazz. If anything, Ella (my grandpa’s dog) will have a nice meal! ",False,False
