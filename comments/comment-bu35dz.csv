I have a minor heart condition which causes mine to drop here and there. I crave salt soooo bad since developing it, it raises blood pressure and keeps me feeling less faint/dizzy. My mother and sister are also this way with salt, we all just naturally crave tons and eat it straight, and all have screwy blood pressure. You may be naturally trying to compensate. It’s nothing that’s an emergency or anything, but if you regularly feel salt craves + other symptoms (or increase in the symptoms you get from restricting) like dizziness, fatigue, racing heart, and fainting, get it checked out to cover bases.",False,False
