The best thing to do, with *any* mental health situation, is listen. Empathize and show her you understand and don’t judge her at all. Give her that time and be that comfort for her. Support her and her health. Just don’t push, you know?",False,False

At the same time I don't know what the right thing to is when she tells me about her Dr appointments and how difficult it is for her.,False,True

Honestly, the best thing to do is wait. Let her come to you in her own time. She seems like she already trusts you- but that does not mean the door is open for you to pry.   And coming from experience; I had a girlfriend who was very open about her ED and I was open about mine. She’d try to push me into recovery and I’d push her. And it got us *absolutely nowhere*. Neither of us wanted to recover and honestly, it hurt and felt like all she wanted to do was sabotage me. Which is, I know, silly since I was doing the same thing and my intentions were for her health, and I’m sure that’s how she meant it as well. But ED brain does not let that be true. ED brain says anyone who gets in the way of the ED is toxic, terrible, and has ulterior motives.   You can do small pushes towards health; but these are extremely hard waters to navigate. Unless she is to the point where a straight-up intervention is necessary- your best bet is to wait and let her come to you and be ready to recover on her own.",False,False
