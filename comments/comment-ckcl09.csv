""Oh yeah, that shiba dude throws up all the time. We're pretty sure they're just tuning into radio waves from nearby power lines. They definitely don't C-section their food babies. What a relief. Bulimia is scary. I'm glad I don't know any bulimics. I'd have to figure out what to say to them about it.""
