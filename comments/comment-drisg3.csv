I’ve got a lymph node biopsy coming up so I do have some issues, but those aren’t why I’ve been losing. I’ve been telling people that my appetite is gone and I’ve developed gastroparesis (which is true but it’s from the ED) and that’s why I’ve lost. I’ve also said that anxiety over the biopsy makes me too anxious to eat, when really I’m too anxious to eat because the ED makes me purge it if I go over my limit .  I’m a liar basically",False,False

Yeah, it is absolutely very exhausting to deal with emotionally fragile/volatile people. It can be an incredible burden to help someone carry. And it's definitely not a productive use of my annoyance to wish I was one of these people in question, and on some level I am thankful (much as I hate to admit it) that my body fights so hard to keep me from becoming physically or emotionally fragile. It's just hard to beat that pathological craving for validation and admiration. Thank you for your words :)",False,True

I feel like maybe they don't understand what an eating disorder is, and that they have one. I'm honestly glad you're not the type of person who does this, or talks to people like that. Right now I have to deal with an emotionally fragile person in real life, who doesn't recognize they're emotionally fragile and is making it everyone else's problem. I don't care that they're emotionally fragile, so am I, but throwing your issues onto someone else so you don't have to deal with it is exhausting for everyone else. It's a good thing you don't do this, even if it takes away from your social power.",False,False

But yeah, it's sad that I'm fixated on that, sure.  But this is like equal parts annoyance that there are people on instagram who do this, and envy that I *could* be one of them.
