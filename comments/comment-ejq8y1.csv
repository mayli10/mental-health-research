Honest facts here: on my honeymoon this summer I was straight up buying 1-3 ice creams a day, usually having 2 very large meals, and 1-2 pastries. Some days I wasn‚Äôt having as much of the sweets but it then was balanced by beer pints.  I was able to weigh myself after it all and I was still the same! Truly it was the walking. I know that sounds crazy.",False,False

I did end up gaining weight because I went to an area that had food that I didn‚Äôt want to miss but I lost it so fast after I got back. I barely gained any either. My advice is to let loose if you can because it‚Äôs a one of a kind experience, I don‚Äôt regret enjoying myself over that month at all and I really don‚Äôt feel like it slowed me down dramatically either.   Otherwise, I was out and about a lot so I had a lot of control over what I ate so honestly it wouldn‚Äôt have been hard for me to restrict if I‚Äôd wanted to.   I really hope you can have fun and don‚Äôt forget to take lots of pictures, it‚Äôs really a once in a lifetime thing ‚ù§Ô∏è",False,False

I was out and about a lot and actually had a lot of control over my food while out, but I chose to let off a bit and I basically ate whatever I wanted (though I was pretty anxious about that). When I was home with them I tried to manage my portions. They ate really hearty food but honestly with walking so much I ended up hitting my low weight there (lost 5 pounds of fat) without tracking or trying much.   I feel like I‚Äôm super active when overseas. You just explore so much and walk a bunch. Every time I‚Äôve been overseas I have either maintained or lost. This summer I went to Europe for my honeymoon and I ate exorbitant amounts and I maintained. I think if you‚Äôre walking around you probably won‚Äôt gain a thing.  I hope you can enjoy the great food but if it‚Äôs hard that‚Äôs okay üíï hope this post is coherent. I‚Äôm on the bus and it‚Äôs pretty loud so it was hard to make it all sound right haha.",False,False
