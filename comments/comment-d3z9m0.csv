Think about 1000 calories in pure liquid oil form. That’s roughly 126ml of oil. So a bit over half of a cup.   Based on your description “same or smaller than a mini cupcake”, it’s unlike bigger than 126 square centimetres.  Also a moon cake is not purely made of oil. It contains nuts/pineapple/egg yolks/sugar/water/meat/raisins etc. depending on the type. The point is, the overran caloric density is lower than that of oil.  In fact from my experience it’s usually 350kcal - 450kcal/100grams. Could be as low as 250 for the fruit kind, or as high as 500 for more dense ones, but the majority falls between that range.",False,False
