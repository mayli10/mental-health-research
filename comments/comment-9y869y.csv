I hated it so much. But that's the exact way I would think. ""I've already blown it for the day, so I'll just have a massive binge and then purge.""  It started out infrequently but it quickly grew to a problem that was spiraling out of control. My glands were swollen, my head hurt all the time, and I just felt like rubbish. I wanted to stop but couldn't.   I kept making these grand promises to myself that ""today will be the last time"" etc. But it never was because I'd justify it with that logic. ""I've already screwed up. Might as well keep going."" Almost like punishment.  I've been binge (and subsequently purge) free the entire month of November so far. I know that's not a huge accomplishment, but it is for me. It took changing my thinking just slightly to conquer it.  Now, I tell myself purging isn't an option RIGHT before I start eating. And I tell myself AS I'm eating. And the most important thing I tell myself is: I have permission to eat and I have permission to make mistakes.  I have to repeat it to myself a lot, but it's worth it.",False,False

In other words, 1900 still isnâ€™t bad. Yeah, itâ€™s more than usual, but itâ€™s not terrible. And dealing with a 700 calorie surplus is way more manageable than dealing with a 3000+ calorie surplus! Just like dealing with 1 flat tire is much easier to manage than 4 flats!",False,False
