Emotional/mental hunger is a real reaction to near starvation too, when you've been restricting for a long time your brain changes too. It only takes a few months for this to start to happen, so it will probably take a few months to go away too. Are you seeing a psych or dietitian who could help you come up with a meal plan/at least some loose guidelines?  I think the most important thing is your mental health. Avoid anything that feels triggering or that makes you scared of losing control and restricting again. I think you might have to find a balance of giving into the urge sometimes and trying to negotiate normal, healthy portions other times. I'd say trust your gut, trust your doctor, and don't worry about weight changes in the short term. Once you have a firm foothold in recovery (i.e. not in danger of sliding back to restriction or picking up new habits like b/p), you can reevaluate from there.  Just one layperson's opinion! I can't stress enough that I am not qualified to give advice.",False,False

I’ve read about extreme hunger but just don’t know how to tell if and when it really is just emotional eating or actually extreme hunger. My weight loss was rather significant when restricting but I didn’t restrict for as long as many people so not sure if my extreme hunger phase is done and I just got in a habit... How can I tell when/if it’s over? Should I listen to the urge or try to stick to normal portions? Sorry for the questions, just a bit worried.",False,True

It's ok. It's not you, it's your body trying to recover physically. In scientific studies I think most people gain rapidly at the beginning, then settle back down to a healthy weight as the crazy urge to overeat dissapates.",False,False
