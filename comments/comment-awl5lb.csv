The novels I could write about this psychologically abusive, narcissistic woman and her selective memory...  She also emphasized appearance, and treated her daughters like property, my body, clothes and belongings should all be available for her to use and talk about however she wanted. She was very controlling when I was younger and I barely talk to her. She'd also leave me and my sisters in the house for days, and weeks with barely any food which led to me reactively eating for a few days when food was available again. The lack of food wasn't on purpose, but she sure as he'll didn't seem to mind abandoning us to go hungry.   She's very upset with me for having illnesses, partly because she knows my isolated upbringing and her neglect contributed to them developing/getting worse. She calls me crazy, stupid and abnormal for having OCD. She called me standofish and lazy when I was a child and first showing symptoms of Depression. When my ED got worse, she'd purposely sabotage my safe food and bother me about losing weight despite me eating so much. The only time she showed concern and really payed attention to me having mental health issues was when I was losing too much weight and it made her uncomfortable. But during that time I was actually improving so much mentally (enough to get my terrified ass into college) and she still gave me shit for it because I was too skinny. When I could barely get out of bed due to depression and just binged the day away she didn't care. When I tried to talk to her about binging she was disgusted by the thought that I might purge, but since I didn't she just said ""eat something healthy and stop."" She only acknowledge the binging to blame me for food going missing even if I didn't eat it. She'd say well ""you're the one who binge eats so it must have been you."" She would ignore every sign of emotional progress and make me feel like by pointing out the things I was still struggling with.   I realized she didn't have my best interest in mind when I binged in front of her for the first time. No one else had ever seen me binge before.

It also became competitive. Like that was the one thing I had that she couldn't take away from me and couldn't have herself.   I had a very isolated upbringing (my parents wanted to protect me from the influence of the devil so I was homeschooled and forbid to hang with other kids) and my ED filled that need for company.
