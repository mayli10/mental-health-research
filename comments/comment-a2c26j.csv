Like because the person I'm looking at is me, they're fat. But anyone else I'm like ""Yas queen"" I think I'll have to weigh myself and put the measurements into that website again so I can see objectively what I look like. ",False,True

Mirrors can legit make a person look heavier or lighter.  Now I don't even know how I look.  A few days ago I felt okay in public about my legs because the window I passed by was a ""thin reflection"".  Today a window I walked past made me look bigger.  Therefore I've suddenly gained lots of weight on my legs (in three days) even though I weigh the same.  This is where the constant body checking comes in.  I touch a part of my leg where I know I can feel the length of the bone.  Even though I feel and look fat (in that window), I can't really look fat if I can feel that bone, right?  &amp;#x200B;  God.  It suuuuuuuuuucks.  &amp;#x200B;  PS It's winter here and I'm glad to be hiding under jumpers because I feel massive.  I hope I pass a thin window soon.",False,False
