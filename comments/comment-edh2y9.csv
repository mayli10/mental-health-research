Everybody saying goals and asking how we got here, why don't YOU do the sick fucking work and get there yourself and then see how you actually feel about being ""goals""? I'm miserable and killing myself and i still feel fat as fuck. OP i feel you :( sorry u going thru it, we could exchange clown hats for novelty I guess lmao",False,False

How can you call someone else's suffering ""goals""? Sure, a BMI of 15 might be your goal but there is a time and place to say everything and this is not the correct time and place. Why don't you have some ""insight and concern for each other""?",False,False

I truly hope you'll endure and overcome it.   Ours is an extensive and diverse world, where no one size fits all. EDs vary, some being polar opposites of others — yet all are potentially deadly and merit our sympathy. Mine does not cancel out yours, nor vice-versa. To a restrictive ED sufferer, it would be heavenly to eat normal portions and not stress over doing so. To an overeater (which I myself tend towards), *goals* would be going days on end with limited meals or even unbroken fasting, and winning the resulting weight-loss which would be a nightmare punishment for an anorexic.   Can we all have insight and concern for each other, not feel attacked because someone else's heaven is our hell? *Can we at least try?*",False,False
