I had a friend in HS that we suffered through our EDs together. She got down to near hospitalization weight and everyone around us kept saying “I’m so worried about her” and all I kept thinking is that she looked amazing and how I wished everyone was worried about how skinny I was. I never once thought she looked bad, I was insanely jealous and saved photos of her on my phone like a creep.",False,False

I have this gross and toxic need to be the worst. Like i want to be dying. I want people to be worried about me. I want to be the person who could die any day from starvation.  And that jealousy, for me at least, is the only thing to have to hold on to to remind me that I AM ACTUALLY SICK.  I'm not underweight. I'm not sick enough.  But i WANT to be. Maybe physically I'm not there, but it's only a matter of time, because I cannot control the jealousy bubbling up inside me telling me that im fine as long as people are sicker.  It's not exactly a positive thought, but it's something I, personally, can cling to. I can remind myself ""okay you're already a nut job, you don't have to force yourself to be more of a nut job.""",False,False
