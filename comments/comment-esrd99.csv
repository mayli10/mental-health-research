Everyone just wants to help you.   You could try to speak to your mom and just explain what's happening: ""I wanted to let you know that school are going to call you tomorrow because today X happened, and recently Y has been happening. I feel scared/anxious/worried/sad about it and right now would like to...""  I don't know your mom, but I know that mine would want all of the information immediately and I wouldn't be able to deal with it. How do you think your's would react?   Or, could you speak to school again in the morning and ask if they could have a meeting with you and your mom instead? That way it seems more like they're supporting you to tell her, and you're involved in the whole process. It might help you to have a voice in what happens next.",False,False
