Humans certainly have the capability to fast, but not for super long term. 400 or less a day is not sustainable. After a while(this while would depend on your current body mass and genetics) you would become malnourished to the extent that your body would start shutting down normal functions; you would lose hair, your skin would tear easily, your teeth would be more susceptible to falling out, and eventually, you would likely die from complications due to organ failure.",False,False

Sorry should have been more clear. I‚Äôm aware anything below 1.5k is considered restricting (at least with sedentary women). I don‚Äôt need this lecture because I‚Äôve heard it a million times. I‚Äôm aware what‚Äôs unhealthy and what‚Äôs not. I never said it ‚Äúwould not count‚Äù you‚Äôre jumping to a conclusion on a vague comment and need to find someone else to bother, love. Someone who is actually confirming they think this way. Restricting/malnutrition is still starvation obviously, but my intentions were to state it as more fasting, which i honestly failed to clarify which i apologize to OP and anyone else for that.

I was starving when I used to eat 1100 calories a day. my hair fell out and I couldn't think straight and I was slowly entering malnutrition. which is why it's kind of insulting when people say that 1000+ calories is automatically binging. because 1000+ was still slowly killing me. I was at a bmi of 16.5 and dropping.,False,False

Once you go below a certain calorie threshold you stop feeling hungry and you almost go into a state where you feel like 80% normal but something is a little off. And logically you know what you are doing and know what you need to do to heal yourself and get better but you wake up every day and continue to follow the same destructive behaviors.  &amp;#x200B;  Take care of yourself. Search for a reason to snap out of it, and when you find it, hold on to it for dear life and don't let go.
