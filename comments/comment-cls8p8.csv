Telling someone you don't see as often as friends or family first can be really useful as it's like a practice run.  Number one thing to remember though is that if you ask for help or support in a genuine way then then people will want to help you. You're not going to be a burden on anyone.",False,False

Maybe the best way to tell someone is if you say something like ""I think I have an eating disorder but I want help. I have found some resources for help online but I don't want to do it alone, could uouy support me"".   That's not an easy step but telling someone is absolutely worth it. When I told someone it made me realise how much my friends valued me.   I hope this helps:  ""So my therapist isn't accepting that I have an ED and is working with me on my PTSD and OCD instead but they have given me a really useful resource.   https://www.cci.health.wa.gov.au/Resources/For-Clinicians/Eating-Disorders  I'm almost done with the ""Workbook: overcoming disordered eating: Part 1"" and even though it's like reading a school textbook it is actually helpful. My aim is to complete it, along with the suggested food diary and charts then take it to a therapist that specialises in ED's. I'll have actual evidence in diary form that way and my own thoughts on each aspect of my ED.   Take a look. I answer the questions in a notebook instead of on the sheets because then I can read them on my phone or computer and answer on paper. I have them all printed out too but I find the sheets too big and awkward to write on and not enough space.   I hope this helps at least one of you.""",False,False
