My partners family warn me now before they take out the camera and ask if I would like to be in the photo, but they don't fuss if I say no. When I met them for the first time, his dad took out his phone for a pic on a hike and when bf started to say 'wait, stop!! She doesn't do pictures!!!!', I'd already hit the deck and started running in the opposite direction. Pic turned out with me as a blur, ROFL.    For some reason once I hit my 20s, i just couldn't do cameras anymore. Or mirrors. I'll memorize where mirrors are so I can turn my head when I walk past them. Went to a store where every pillar was covered in mirrors and I just ended up staring at the floor the whole time, scared because I had nowhere else to look without seeing myself. It's ok. Dysmorphia is hard.",False,False

I often have to troubleshoot technology and experiment with cameras for my work.   I used to have to be the on screen talent for tutorials too, it was awful. Now at a different workplace, same deal, I end up in front of the camera.  Better STILL, the (pretty and super slim and triggering) guy I like is behind the lens.  But?

I'm told all the time that I will regret not taking any photos of my self in the future. Especially by my mom, but she doesn't have an ED and can't understand why I am so abnormally camera shy. I thought that since you are a part of this community you probably have some form of an ED and could maybe offer some perspective on this topic.",False,True
