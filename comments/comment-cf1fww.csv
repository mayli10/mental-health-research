Like I said the things I lost in the fire. I reflect on the past live in the present and try to avoid looking to the future.  Over the weekend I met an old friend for a drink. When I arrived to my surprise sitting at the bar with him was his sister. Who I hadn’t seen for years. After a few whiskeys she broached the obvious question about my weight loss. I looked her straight in the eye and said “I have and still suffer with anorexia and have suffered with bulimia.” She laughed. I explained it further. She just said “wow.”   We finished the night departed, hugs and farewells. I walked home counting my little victory.",False,False

Living with an ed is different for everyone but difficult for all nonetheless.  I’m sorry that you’ve gone through these hardships I definitely understand and feel for you. If only there was a way to change the way we perceived things, especially during childhood. I hope one day we find our place and some balance to our lives because, for me, there is no in between. But it seems to be the only thing that drives me and fuels me. Like I’m actually being good at something. I send you big hugs all the way to where you live.",False,True

It is my first priority I just wish so bad that I would care more about school or work. Everything else makes me feel dumb but I’m better at starving than anyone else I know.,False,True

This might be a bit wordy and come from a different direction. But I will share my experience “im only good at this”   I wasn’t particularly great at sport or school. I always liked to swim, run and in my late twenty’s lift weights. My brother and sister though all went on to win awards and be successful in education, sport and life. More luck to them. It wasn’t something that motivated me.  I had always lived my life how I wanted to live it. I didn’t need validation. When I was in my teens I was 20 stone. My dad took me a side to have a chat with me about my weight. We spoke about discipline and self-control. He told me in history what maintained the Irish was our ability to resist British Colonialism. The ability to not conform and give in. To hold our identity and traditions and resist. (In Ireland not giving in or showing mental or physical weakness is demanded for both men and women, young and old. Work through the pain. Never complain. Especially my social class. We didn’t have a lot except pride. That went for women and men.)  After that conversation I had felt like I had let my friends and family down (in Ireland your family and community is everything.) As a result I would run for two hours three times a week and swim twice a week for an hour. I created a calorie deficit &amp; started to eat healthy. The feeling of controlling my weight empowered me and at 18 years of age I felt like I had found my talent. This was the start of my Journey.   At eighteen I enrolled in college. I had no real interest but attended because in Ireland you go to college or you emigrate. I enjoyed college &amp; there I met people who shared the values I identified with. Controlling calories, exercising and a lot of binge drinking. I felt excepted. I had gotten good at dieting, fasting and long periods of training. It was my thing &amp; I defined myself through it. People rap themselves up in distractions and celebrities they will never meet but what I was doing was real &amp; I could see the results.  I was happily living my life and in my early twenties. When I started my first serious relationship. The strain of my weight loss, calorie counting and exercising brought this to an end though. At 23, 24 or 25 (I can’t remember exactly) I was working a good Job and everything seemed to be in place in my life. The problem though was I weighted 8 stone 10 pounds (I am 6ft 1.). Though I was very thin no one ever really commented. The thinking being in Irish society if you acknowledge sickness or illness both mental and physical. It’s believed you could catch it. Don’t ask don’t tell. Finally when my weight became an issue. I was forced undergo treatment.  No more dieting, calorie counting or exercising for two years. It nearly killed me. I felt I lost everything. I still say to people about that time in my life “Things I Lost in the Fire.” Referring to my ability to exercise and diet being taken away.       I never took any pride in my degree or social achievements. As kids we use to laugh at the people with the big house and expensive cars. We would say can’t buy class, respect or principles. I am who I am.       All I ever wanted was to be able to put in my hours training. Be disciplined when it came to eating. Feel in control of my life. The material goods and status symbols of life didn’t motivate or sustain me.  Now I just think the one thing I was good at. The one thing I loved “I lost it in the fire.” Even though I exercise and calorie count it’s not the same. If my weight loss becomes too noticeable my parents and friends will intervene and I will lose control of my life again. Even though they live there life’s through impulse buying, binge drinking and substances abuse.  Sorry it was so long. Hope it helps.",False,False
