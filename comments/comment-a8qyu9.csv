Turned out to be anxiety both times.  That being said, EDs can and will fuck you up as Iâ€™m sure you know, so try to get it checked out as soon as you can just in case.",False,False

If you don't have access to medical help right now, try to do some self-care exercises to make sure you're in as good of a head space as possible. Get plenty of fluids and electrolytes. Try your best to get adequate sleep.  If the palpitations continue (even intermittently), you should probably get checked out by a doctor. Palpitations can be a sign of heart trouble and you don't want to mess around with heart stuff.",False,False
