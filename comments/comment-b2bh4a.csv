I have the same fantasies (and even weirder, more bafflingly irrational ones tbh). I've talked about my disordered thoughts and habits on my finsta and one of my friends who's had serious issues with eating has commented with support and talked about her experiences. It does help a lot.  But I also understand the desire for people with whom to mutually encourage ED habits. Even when you participate in online forums, living a disordered lifestyle can feel so lonely and isolating. I can talk to my friends about almost anything, but I can't get validation for my fucked up thoughts around eating and my body. My personal unhealthy desire is this: I want to be skinny and sick enough for the friend I mentioned to see me as an ED ""peer"" (she's incredibly thin, I don't even come close) so we can talk about this shit honestly rather than having her counsel me bc I'm lesser than her. I don't want her to say, ""aww, I've been through that too, it'll pass!"" I want her to say, ""yeah, I do and think the same things as you, look how fucked up we both are."" And worse, even though she's one of my best friends, I want her to see me as competition. Her body already triggers me and I want to get to a place where mine triggers her too. I know that's waaaayyyyy messed up though.",False,False

In fantasy, it’s stuff like staying sick/getting sicker with each other. Rationally, that’s probably not a very good thing and I should want a recovery buddy?  A support group might be helpful, but I don’t think I am mentally ready for that. It seems way too intimidating for me. ",False,True

I think it's also unclear to me (and maybe to you) what exactly you want - just validation? A buddy that helps you stay sick / get sicker? A buddy that helps you recover? What role would you play for that other person? What are your ethical boundaries (could you be okay with saying stuff that would make someone sicker)?  just some thoughts The validation is huge... I have never had anyone in my real life to talk to about this so the sort of validation on here is enough for me. I wonder if you could find a support group in real life? ",False,False
