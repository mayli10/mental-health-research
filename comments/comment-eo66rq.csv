At least you tried and it's a crappy reality to face that not all treatment centers/programs are efficient or helpful. That's amazing that you're firm in your convictions about what you want out of treatment. I hope this doesn't stop you for good. Best of luck :),False,False

Most of us don't want/need to hear that at the beginning of recovery. They could have just said, ""weight gain is not part of your specific treatment plan, we will focus on xyz."" I'm sorry you're feeling down, but you don't need to restrict. It's awesome that you're seeking treatment. Keep up the good work and if you can, try to forget this. Maybe you can even confront them about your feelings and how these statements are proving to be counter-productive.",False,False
