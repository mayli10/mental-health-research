She can stop getting junk food so you'll still come over.   1100 cals a day is not direcly a dangerzone amount but i should not go lower than that. (The average human consumes and burns about 2300 to 2500 a day)   It is however very wise if you take something daily which contains something with either a lot of fat or fibers. This is so your digestings system won't clog and fill you with literaly shit. ,False,False

I'm sticking to around 1100 calories a day and my fridge is full with fruit and vegetables and one block of tofu, nothing else.  I did this before to lose 20 kg, but the key for me is to not get tempted to eat not whole food stuff. I just need to forget what chips and candy taste like so I won't be tempted. Problem is, I often go to my moms place on the weekends and she buys me a ton of vegan junk food, and I hate wasting food so I always feel obligated to eat it which triggers a binge. I might not go over this week just until I have full control again.    ",False,True

If it is to little you will most likely binge at the end of the week, but if it is on the bigger side you might get stressed out too much.   Maybe ask a family member or friend for help.   But in any case, sticking to a plan is a step in the right direction. Good job. ",False,False
