I was pretty over weight and lost it pretty quickly.  Even though I see the numbers go down I still feel huge.  Like the biggest person in the room.  Like even logically I know I'm not,  I still can't stop feeling that way.  Like no matter how small I get I will never feel skinny. Probably won't feel skinny until I'm under weight.  ",False,False

She also tried to explain to us what stretch marks and loose skin were by saying 'They look strange don't they? It's what happens when people get really fat really fast then lose weight'.
