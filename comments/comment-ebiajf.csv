I know we feel like we donâ€™t need to, but itâ€™s always nice to have the reality check - I have been getting this from some friends, and Iâ€™m going to pass it on to you :P itâ€™s a good thing that you ate something.  As to salt vs other electrolytes, I always just go with salt. I know people fasting like to use that, potassium, and magnesium, but Iâ€™ve never actually looked into that. I literally just pour some salt on my palm and lick it when Iâ€™m feeling crappy :P def avoid potassium if itâ€™s a health issue :)",False,False

I have to be careful cause I canâ€™t drink those electrolyte drinks anymore since they all contain a ton of potassium, and I can really hurt myself if I go over in potassium. I stay hydrated all day with like 33oz of water almost every 2 hours. ðŸ˜¬ cause that damn uncrustable didnâ€™t help. I feel myself still feeling just as terrible. So I subjected myself to ridiculous carbs and calories for nothing ðŸ˜­ Iâ€™m sorry you have to deal with all those :( thank you so much for your comment.",False,True

I have POTS and Ehlers Danlos so itâ€™s not a fun combo with restricting.   Salt is great, hydration is great, and COMPRESSION SOCKS have been amazing as well. :)",False,False
