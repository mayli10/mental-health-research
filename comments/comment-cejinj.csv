I love weight lifting and don't really drink (every good drink has sooo mamy calories ðŸ˜°) so it's good to know I'm on the right track!,False,False

I'm 11 years older than you are, same height. BEWARE...when you hit 30, weight gain happens even faster. If you don't already, start strength training NOW. Then you can eat more due to a faster metabolism in your 30's!!! And beware alcohol calories. I wish I could go back and warn myself at your age and make some changes so that I wasn't still dealing with this in my 30's. Hormones are a real bitch!",False,True

I have never felt it. People say it is because my eating is disordered but I can legit eat til I physically have to vomit and still not feel anything other than physical discomfort. Developed a real phobia for puking from that.,False,False

It's a rare genetic disorder, and it's not your fault at all. Perhaps look into it to see if that fits your description?",False,False

I can eat 1000s of calories in a single sitting and this is pre-Ed. The other day I had a whole bowl of stir fry noodles, a burrito, a bag of pop corn, halo top, and then apples with almond butter. I felt sick after but after every meal I just kept thinking about what I wanted to eat next?? Iâ€™m like a bottomless pit?",False,False

I've tried every trick,  chugging water, eating slowly, eating undistracted, nope. After every time I eat I immediately start thinking about what I'm eating next. Even before my disordered eating began I was always preoccupied with food, so hungry. I've just learned to live with it I guess. And being cognizant of it helps, they say ""trust your hunger signals"" but when I'm starving after a huge iHop breakfast I can't really trust the signals, I just have to push thru.",False,False
