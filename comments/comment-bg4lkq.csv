Also couple's therapy could be a good idea, if not just to gain tools on how to approach your partner's issues and for both of you to work on communicating with each other.",False,False

It sounds like you two need to set some boundaries about how you can best support each other - they might not want/be comfortable with you nagging them to get help, just as you might not want/be comfortable hearing all the details while you are preoccupied with something (like vacation). Set some rules about how and when you'll talk about ED-related things.  I lived with a couple two years ago who had a very similar dynamic, where the mentally healthy one felt burdened and resentful while the mentally ill one felt smothered and the constant pressure to ""just get better already"" actually made them get worse. They lacked communication and personal space.  You can't make the choice to recover for them. It sounds like they've made that choice for themselves finally which is great. But especially now that they have a medical professional working on it, it's not your job to fix them. You can only love them while they fix themselves. I hope you two can see eye-to-eye and find a way to work it out.",False,False

It’s a tough spot to be in but at the end of the day you can’t jeopardize your sanity. Be honest and set some boundaries.   I was in a similar situation except my partner struggled with depression. I never did anything about it and then it got to a point where external parties had to pull me out of an incredibly toxic situation.   Set things straight now so they don’t get worse later down the road.,False,False

It seems like a really shitty thing to say but your mental health is important too.,False,False
