Unfortunately, there already has been many times where I've chosen my eating patterns over my passions. Earlier this year I quit gymnastics, which I had been doing for 10 years, partially because it is scary to do gymnastics when you feel like you are going to pass out. I know I should get help but I'm terrified, and the funny thing is that my mother is a psychologist. I have hidden everything from her (which hasn't been too hard honestly, I'm on a binge and restrict cycle which makes means that my weight loss is never drastic) because I'm scared that she will think it is her fault or that she is a bad parent or psychologist for not knowing sooner. I'm worried that if I get help, she will find out, and she has had her own mental health issues that I don't want to get worse.  Thank you for your kind words, hopefully I will be able to get therapy when I need to.",False,False

Your experience sounds so much like mine. Even if you haven't decided you have a problem, I would highly recommend a therapist even if you keep your ED a secret. I saw a few before I found a good fit. She was a recent grad from college doing a psychologists ""practicum"" when I was 17. I never told her about my eating behaviors, but she gave me so many tools to keep myself sane enough to keep trying.  Also, if you have any passions, do you best not to let your ED destroy them. The minute you protect your ED over something that brings you joy, you've got to evaluate.  Choir was mine. My best friend. Being able to keep my job and be independent.  Basically, keep a life for youself the best you can.  I'm sorry I know you didn't ask for my lecture, but I drank too much and I hope you can be happy, sweet stranger!",False,False
