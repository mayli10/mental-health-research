It was the biggest ive ever been and the quickest ive ever gained weight. And when i stopped the weight didnt fall off the same way. It took hard work. Im just using condoms and risking it.,False,False

They may be able to give you advice based on how long you've had your current (implant?) but it's still worth discussing. You don't need to put up with crappy side effects.,False,False

I hated the cramps, bloating, and cravings that I had on my period, but I feel like I literally can not lose weight. I wonder if there’s any birth control that doesn’t have this side effect, or if it’s different for every person? I asked my gyno ab it and she said that it shouldn’t really have an effect on my weight but it does. On google it says it might cause you to keep an extra 5 lbs but that it’s “not a big deal”. ?!?!?!? Yes it is",False,False

I have a constant daily struggle to get off birth control for this reason. Not only does it just make me feel a flat affect/weird mood, you literally CANNOT lose weight on any birth control! T (My last sentence is based on experience and not applicable to everyone) but it makes me wanna go get my BC taken out and just wing it. Like ughhhhh does anyone else have this issue? I wanna call my gyno bc of this and the mood problems. I hate it. I love not having a period but this does not outweigh the side effects and I wish it did",False,False
