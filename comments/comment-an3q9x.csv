I find it takes at least 5-7 days for things to normalize. That's just my experience.  I want to point out, though, that if I'm eating a ton of salt, it's usually accompanied by massive amounts of carbs (popcorn, rice cakes, roasted chickpeas, baked sweet potato fries, etc.) which is definitely the bigger factor for food/water retention. When I'm actually restricting my overall food intake, I don't feel like my salt intake makes a huge difference and I definitely do use a quite a bit.",False,False

I honestly have no clue to this answer, but I ended up buying a scale that measures body fat percentage because I would be losing consistently and if I ate fast food or had a very salty day of food, it would mess up my scale readings for like a week and then I’d drop a couple pounds over night. It stressed me out too much so I try not to rely on weight on the scale. I measure body fat, take progress pics, or take actual tape measurements which seem to be better indicators of my progress.
