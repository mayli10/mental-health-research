It’s sickening that it’s this hard to find humane, dignified healthcare. We deserve better. At least we have this board as a safe space.",False,False

They told me they would get me a questionnaire to fill out but brought me a sheet on substance use instead. They saw that I am hep c positive....I got it from a bad needle but that was 12 years ago and I've been ""clean"" ever since. No one asked me about that part. They did drug test me without my knowledge though.   I told them about depression and they asked me if I had ever neglected my family because of my addiction. Asked if I had ever broken the law because of my addiction....things that have nothing to do with my health. Things that directly contribute to my depression. (And no...I never neglected my fam or broke the law...)  Today I also found out that I'm not eligible for treatment for my hep because I'm not sick enough. Oh the irony.  So much for my ED....seems the least important thing on the list.   #deathbycapitalism  Thanks for the kind words. I know I'm not alone on these types of struggles. It's just so unfortunate that we have turned health and human caring into commodities. I get so frustrated.",False,True

You did the right thing by not putting your mental health in the hands of the wrong people. It may have been your only to get help with your primary doc, but this isn't a dead end for you by any means.  A while back, I tried talking to my family doctor about my depression. He straight up laughed at me, said that my whole family ""just had it"" (HIPAA violation lol), said that I was overdramatic and invented my own problems for attention, and ""prescribed"" St. John's Wort without actually checking my current medications to see that it had terrible interactions with them. So. Fuck all that, and fuck doctors who don't offer real support and care.  I searched through my health insurance's directory for a while and sent as many emails as I could until I found my current therapist. I've been seeing her for two months now. This is the first time I've been able to grab the bull by the horns and really try to take care of myself. You can do it, too. Struggling with finding the right care is SO REAL and it doesn't mean you are not trying to get All Better!!   I just wanted to let you know that you're not alone in this. Sending hugs if you want them.",False,False
