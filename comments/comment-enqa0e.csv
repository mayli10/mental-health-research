Iâ€™ll try to keep any indulgences I do to a minimum and also I canâ€™t get drunk cuz Iâ€™m doing dry January which unfortunately is making me lose weight at 2x the speed even tho I want a margarita SO BAD ðŸ˜‚,False,True

Maybe Oreos, fuck I love Oreos ....",False,True

Sometimes I have a mini pack of something I don't usually eat or I buy low cal stuff that's too expensive to eat regularly. Idk if any of that would work for you but just some suggestions!,False,False

Ugh I wish I didnâ€™t want to at all lmao that would make this way easier,False,True

Going with what I feel like rather than pre-planning days in advance always makes me feel better personally",False,False
