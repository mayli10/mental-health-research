I've been struggling with disordered eating for a little over than a year. I am 18, I always had normal period since it first came, pretty regular, it would be late a couple of times but other than that my cycle was on point, it would come every month the same day. This year I started restricting my calories more, about 1000-1200 cals a day, so I was losing weight but pretty slowly and for me that was okay. I never actually realised how much eating could impact my period, but at the beginning of the year I missed one month. Then another one. Then it came, and another one the next month but it was just spotting :never had such a weird period. Since then I haven't had one, and it's already 4 months. My mom brought me to a gyn and I had exams and stuff, and because I'm young, they assumed it was normal that my period was acting up: they prescribed me the pill and now everything should be ""fine"". Of course no one knows about my ED, I am far from being underweight.  I hope I helped you, English is not my first language so I hope you understood everything!  Sending hugs x",False,False
