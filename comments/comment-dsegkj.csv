Trust me, I’ve been there and the pain is so, so not worth it hun, but then again I know how hard of a mental hurdle it can be to jump  Wish you all the very best",False,False

But as the person above me said, once you eat something solid after a bit you will either shit yourself or be really painfully constipated. So be warned!",False,False

From a harm minimisation point of view I’d really love it if you would consider something like sugar free pudding or jelly or mashed banana that has an *almost liquid* consistency but is a teeny bit more solid.   Big hugs to you!",False,False
