There's still hope for the future. I know I would have a really hard time jumping into anything so soon after a relationship that long too. It sounds like he's understandably confused and hurting.   There's nothing wrong with YOU. There's nothing wrong with him. It's just not a good time. And the beautiful thing about time is that it goes on. ♥️,False,False

Anxiety up? Feel like puking? Appetite goes way down. Wine is the only way I’ve been able to eat, but at this point I’m ready to just roll with it.
