I used to work in medical records and most of the doctors have the default phrase ""Well developed, well nourished, and appropriate for age (for kids) [or] appropriately oriented (for adults). I can't tell you how many times I've seen doctors forget to adjust the defaults.",False,False

I've noticed minor errors showing up in my own chart before (I have a ton of random medications, supplements, and allergies to review with the medical assistant and I think sometimes they are rushing to just enter the first thing that pops up even if it's not quite correct). I appreciate the level of detail that goes into all of my doctors' clinical notes and I know WDWN isn't a bad thing...it's just a funny/unfortunate choice of words to come across when you're recovering from a restrictive ED!",False,True

I work with electronic health records, and every doc that doesn’t have templates, I go hang out with them, and set them up. Normal stuff is pre-filled, and it’s only changed if they remember to note something different.",False,False

We need to push HARD to get our issues recognized as unhealthy and to seek treatment. Recognizing we are at a point where we need help (regardless of physical stats) is unfortunately against the nature of this disease.       Keep looking for a new PCP if you feel up to it. There are some who will notice and understand.",False,False

Most are lazy/rushed (imagine having 20 minutes per patient and having to fill out a slew of documentation) and don't really go back and put in more accurate assessments. So many times I've found notes describing normal heart sounds in patients with clearly audible heart murmurs, normal skin assessments in patients being seen for gaping wounds, etc.",False,False
