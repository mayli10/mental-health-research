It’s such a toxic brand in so many ways from their “one size fits all” clothing and lack of diversity, but it makes me feel like I’m part of this “exclusive club” that’s thin enough to wear their clothes. Their marketing is based around this exclusivity that’s so damaging to young girls who are insecure about their bodies, and it’s so sad how they’re able to get away with this because their clothes are “trendy” and a lot of people want to wear them. Don’t beat yourself up over it, it’s not your fault, it’s the influence of their marketing and your ED talking, a lot of people are in the same boat as you.",False,False

Privileged and validated. It felt great. But that feeling wore off quickly though...,False,True

Maybe buy secondhand brandy clothes at a thrift or on a resale site in the future so you dont support their brand directly? :)",False,False

I'm at the point where I can't buy any bottoms from Brandy Melville because they're all too big on me. But guess what? I still hate my body and want to be thinner.

It just the feeling of fitting in - both physically in the clothes and metaphorically into this society that is just so toxic and i despise it but the feeling of 'exclusive' is just so overwhelming sometimes. ""Could i fit into brandy melville?"" and the thought of it makes me feel good about myself, in a way privileged and validated.",False,False
