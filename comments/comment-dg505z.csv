Like it's recommended you get 5 servings of vegetables a day. So I'd do like 2 for dinner, 2 for lunch, 1 as a snack. And then I combine that with other recommendations for servings per day.",False,False

I don’t have a lot of time to cook so I could definitely pick some easy meals that I enjoy and stick to those!    I worry about my fam noticing the marked out info but I don’t think they look anyway.   Thanks for sharing your ideas :),False,True

The meals that taste yummy, that give you energy, the meals that make you accidentally drool on your hand as you're trying to take a bite (yes, I am speaking from experience here!). Write down the ingredients you need for those meals and then take that list to the grocery store. You're not allowed to drop items off the list! Go through the store, pretend you're a Busy Businessperson that doesn't have time for second-guessing or comparisons, and get your groceries. Then when you get home, take a black permanent marker and quickly scribble out all of the nutritional info on the labels. Even if you can still faintly see the numbers, it's to remind you that you're NOT supposed to be looking or caring. Then prepare and eat the meals you wanted to make!",False,False

I have a very physical job so having energy is very important to me. At the store I’ll literally look at something and think “how will I feel at work if I eat this?”,False,False
