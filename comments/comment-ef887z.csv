They are experiencing reactive hunger from being in a deficit the rest of the week/month.  The whole concept of having a day to eat “guilt free” is disordered. Every day should be a day where you indulge in a craving. I don’t like watching them bc I’m disturbed by the desperate hunger in their eyes lmao,False,False
