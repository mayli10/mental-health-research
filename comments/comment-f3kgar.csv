Speaking from experience, your body is more likely to use this fuel to fix broken things like cuts or bruises, or use it to maintain some energy. Itâ€™s really not gonna be enough to add any pounds.  That said!! If you check the scale and itâ€™s higher DO NOT freak out! Things like cake and sugar tend to hang on to water in our bodies, so your weight might reflect that. And donâ€™t forget weight fluctuates between 2-3lbs every day.   Be strong and celebrate the fact that you fed yourself today! And fear foods too! Great job!!! Be well ðŸ’œâœ¨",False,False
