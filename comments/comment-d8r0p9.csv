I think his comments about it’s okay to eat and it’s okay to eat healthy is his way of saying that there’s a balance and you shouldn’t worry so much. Sounds to me like he realizes somethings up.  Like the other commenter said, I think your ED brain latched onto the wrong parts of his comments and spun them another way. That’s what our dumb ED brains to do us!! they want to control us",False,False
