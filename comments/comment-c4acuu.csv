Makes a good sub for scrambled eggs. If you can handle the taste of plain tofu (personally, I love it) just cut it into cubes and bake at 400 degrees on a baking sheet with parchment paper. Flip the cubes over a couple times and they get a bit crispy and really good then you can dip them in whatever condiments you like.",False,False

I have a big fear of drinks with calories but in my mind that's a big amount of protein for what it is so it's worth it.  i see a lot of people recommend quest bars as one of the best tasting brands but in my experience they're okay at best but i havent tried many flavors. theyre 180 to 200 calories usually. ive heard one bars taste better, but ive never tried one and they're usually a little bit higher in calories. i ordered a big box of protein bars off amazon a bit ago and honestly, i was expecting them to be not great but they seriously taste just like candy bars. they're made by pure protein and theres a few different flavors. the one i like most is the chocolate deluxe and it has 180 calories for 21g of protein, the other ones are 200 for 20g. they were also really not expensive especially considering the cost of brands like quest and one.   eggs or even just egg whites are good if you can tolerate those. i hate eggs but i can handle just the whites if they have some seasoning. i think an egg white is 20 calories for 3 or 4g protein but that might be off.  good luck, i hope you can find food that gives you the protein you need 💕",False,False
