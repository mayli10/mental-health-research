Why does she have to be sad all the time and make us all sad? Why is she so negative?” and I should’ve left by then. Thanks for the support.",False,True

There’s those that have experienced it and are fully empathetic. There’s those that haven’t dealt with it yet can still understand and be empathetic. There’s those that really don’t understand but still try their best to be supportive. Then there’s people who are willfully ignorant and believe that their logic and ideas are the written rules and everything else that does not follow is wrong. I’m sorry you have to deal with such a friend. People like this piss me off more than anything and I would say just distance yourself from this person because even though they aren’t being directly toxic, it’s still a toxic mindset ",False,False

Like people who haven’t lived it *just don’t get it*. They make these judgements about people’s choices based on their own experiences and refuse to acknowledge that others may experience different realities. And then they assume that people of certain weights or with certain habits are lazy or whatever. Which they say until we believe them. It sucks. ,False,False
