Luckily, i don't usually have to put on a gown, but for some reason they wanted me to this time and it was only after I got weighed that they told me to put it on. ",False,True

I always have to put a gown on to get weighed and the ones they give me are fucked up and the things that tie it are tied in knots and don't even go the full way around so i have to go walking around with the back half of my body exposed and that isn't fun when the only thing you're wearing is a bra and underwear.",False,False

My issue is mainly that i just become way more aware of my body, though. I'm pretty much past the point of being afraid of judgement from other people when it comes to my body   I'm my biggest enemy, not to sound cheesy lol",False,True

I have done a lot of physical exams on patients myself and when you’re doing the exam, you become very un-judgmental of others after you’ve seen many patients. I feel this way to others yet when I’m the patient, I get nervous too. I even started apologizing to my dermatologist because he was inspecting my feet and I said “I’m sorry they’re so gross” and he reminded me of the fact that nothing is gross in comparison to when you have elderly patients who don’t take care of themselves.   I still feel awkward myself but honestly the medical profession is generally a very compassionate group of people and most of the time what’s on their mind is getting the job right for the physical exam so you get the care you pay for.",False,False
