It's the cheapest and easiest to find, but it has some of the most laxative effects of all kinds of magnesium and doesn't absorb well at all. Look up ""types of magnesium"" and read about the differences between them before you buy one, as they can have varying benefits! I personally use magnesium malate (also good for energy) and magnesium bisglycinate (also good for anxiety), as they are more bioavailable and don't have laxative effects.   I would also take B12.",False,False

I initially started taking it to help with my stims tolerance. But I’ve been seeing it everywhere with regards to heart health, digestive health, etc.   I’ve been taking 400mg for over a year now, and idk the last time I’ve had a headache. I shit everyday like it’s clockwork. Plus I somehow have a “healthy heart” despite all the shit it’s been through. Good luck.",False,False
