I try to not even touch anything unhealthy or stuff that are high cal cause they'll make me binge. And when i ate a plate of low cal stuff my family is satisfied cause they dont know shit about calories and think i've eaten normal. Then i try to remind myself as often as possible that i dont want to fuck up the day in the the last few hours. Works mostly of the time. (And drink a lot of stuff like tea after eating. It'll kill your apatite to eat more of the food on the table).  Good luck, hope you'll make it. And dont forget that a nornal meal isn't a binge yet. Maybe you can try to look what and how much others eat and eat exactly that too?",False,False
