And I know rationally he didnâ€™t really mean I looked fat. Everything else he said was counter to that. My mind is just really good at twisting shit like this.,False,True

I used to work in a hospital and you can get it into a big mess. ALSO people are so incredibly unbelievably freaking bad at knowing what weight looks like on a person. People have casually estimated that I have been *100lbs* heavier than I am, and they weren't trying to be mean, just clueless. Guys tend to be worse because they estimate by their own weight which is naturally heavier due to muscle mass, larger frame and height. Maybe he doesn't get too many ED patients or people who are lower weight. But it is protocol to clarify the unit of measurement when a patient mentions just a number. Especially because so many people are clueless and delusional about their weight or straight up lying. He was probably just having an absent minded day",False,False
