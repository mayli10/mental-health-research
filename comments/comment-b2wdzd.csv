Literally the other day he sent me an article about how eating little or no carbs have such bad effects on your body and makes you extremely unhealthy.  The funny thing is that the whole low carb thing doesn't even apply to me because (by normal people standards) i eat a pretty average amount per day and are by no means eating low carb.,False,True

There are a ton of writers, journalists, fitness professionals, and random bloggers who actually aren't equipped to critically interpret the research. You might skim an abstract, fast-forward to the ""results"" or ""conclusions"" section, and extract a broad takeaway from that â€”Â without understanding the study's methodology and and limitations, without seeing it in the context of many other studies, without having a clue as to the reputation of the researchers or  journal...  That's how we get famous doctors hawking their own theories, some more compelling than others. Like Stephen Gundry, who honest-to-God wrote a book (and has a whole business around) the concept of lectins in plants being toxic. Seriously.  If educated, scientifically-literate doctors can spin the research to support their own agenda, I don't have much hope for the general public. It's possible to find published studies on any food that suggest it has a positive or negative effect on human health. (I know because I've been down this rabbit hole trying to treat a chronic inflammatory disease. Did you know literally everything is potentially bad for IBD? Yeah. This is how you develop orthorexia...)  The people with the most balanced attitude to food I've ever encountered are registered dietitians. Shocking, I know.",False,False

Plus red meat is chock full of protein and a number of nutrients, itâ€™s actually got a pretty good nutrient:calorie value.   Itâ€™s one of those things thatâ€™s gotten a bad rap in the endless quest of finding a new food to demonize/raise up, and in general itâ€™s good to have in a diet. That said, I donâ€™t think eating too little red meat is a concern for the average person, and blanket statements like the friend said are missing a hell of a lot of context and making too many assumptions, so I completely get OPâ€™s frustration.
