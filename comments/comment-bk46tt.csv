I'm guessing the problem is finding out how the cells respond to the glucose vs TGAs once they're absorbed. The UCP thermogenesis thing probably plays a role in carbs not causing as much adipose tissue formation (I think I remember my biochem professor saying they were currently researching how to upregulate UCP as a ""diet aid""? Lmao) but we don't really know because there's not enough research about it",False,False

And it IS weird and itâ€™s based on some studies done in the 1890s, I think, so itâ€™s ridiculous that weâ€™re basing our entire caloric expenditure knowledge based on them. I think it involved college kids being locked in a room, who literally had their shits collected. Look up William Atwater if youâ€™re interested (or bored, or a dork like me ðŸ¤—).",False,False

And I canâ€™t really imagine a way where we can measure it, or at least model it as if, in vivo. Weâ€™d have to build like an artificial digestive system or something? I dunno.",False,False

But tbf, we don't really have a better way to measure it afaik? Like we can measure adipose tissue formation but not the calories derived from the consumption of a specific item",False,False
emdrgdi,t3_bk46tt,t3_bk46tt,roastedpepper,2,2019-05-02 23:14:30,/r/EDAnonymous/comments/bk46tt/calories/emdrgdi/,"So the way they measure calories is using something called a bomb calorimeter. Basically itâ€™s a massive high pressure oven that is able to measure how much heat is released when they burn something. The amount of heat (=energy/entropy) released is then converted into calories (calories are just a measurement of heat=energy). So basically they burn the shit out of food and then measure how much energy/heat is released to get the calories. So itâ€™s a very basic way which doesnâ€™t take into account how our bodies actually use the energy, which varies depending on the source. For example, some say that our bodies do not completely convert the energy from alcohol cause itâ€™s toxic so some of it is expelled prior to being used etc.  Edit: written whilst pretty drunk so please excuse any wrong info and correct me if Iâ€™m wrong.",False,False
