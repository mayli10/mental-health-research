She believed me about my daily intake (highly restrictive) even tho I’m OW and she’s helped me with food insecurity and with planning meals and she’s just super great about my b/p cycles. I even had a whole egg (fear food) and a whole half a plate of protein because of my work with her. ,False,False

She's super understand and works with me. Honestly I've stopped seeing my therapist but I'm still sticking with my dietitian. We got at my pace and she never is judgemental. She actually also understands what I'm going through! It's amazing to be able to talk to someone in real life who doesn't look at me like I'm some freak",False,False

The dietitian isn't going to make you do anything or try to scare you into doing what you 'should'.  They're a resource for you who are educated enough about food and nutrition to be able to help you look critically at some of your erroneous beliefs about those topics.,False,False

And if it *is*, does your therapist know that there are no qualifications required to start calling yourself a nutritionist?  Any whacko with a food agenda can call themselves a nutritionist.  A dietitian has a four-year degree at minimum.",False,False

Seeing them was tough - they held me accountable for my behavior. Ultimately that accountability is what helped me not just actually get better - but get into a better dietary system than I'd ever been in before in my life. Overall my current diet supports my daily life a lot better than my old systems did, even pre-ED.",False,False

It was mainly to confirm that I was actually consuming far too less calories than was healthy instead of just taking my word for it, which is fair. The nutritionist and I went through what a typical week looks like for me in terms of food intake and exercise. I don't remember her being judgemental at all if that's what you're worried about! She worked with me to come up with food plans that fit with what I was comfortable eating. ",False,False

It's such a relief to talk to someone who knows about EDs and proper nutrition, who understands the struggle, but still knows how to keep you healthy. I worried all the time about what I should be eating, and my intuitive eating skills has been absolutely demolished. With my dietician, I grew to eating like a healthy individual again, all while maintaining a healthy weight I actually look good at! I get my vitamins so my hair and skin look nice. At first, she just encouraged me to follow the meal plan for one meal every day, and I gradually worked my way up to following it completely. It's such a relief to not have to plan everything out to a T anymore (although it did require an adjustment period).   I'm so happy you get to see a nutritionist about this, good luck ❤️",False,False
