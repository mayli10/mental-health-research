I've only ever lost weight through counting and obsessing so I'm not very confident in my abilities to lose the weight I desperately need to (I'm objectively fat).   Following my dietitians plan I get obsessive again, but in a different way. Everything has to be perfect and each meal is carefully counted out portions of protein, carbs, and fat. But part of me is like this is what healthy eating is like for everyone. Its work. And maybe I'm just too lazy to do the work.",False,True

No scales, no tape measures, no logging, no obsessing. My biggest downfall back into my eating disorder was stepping on a fucking scale. I was feeling good about myself and eating well, and then my dumb ass decided to see what the numbers looked like, knowing that I base my worth on a number. Then I downloaded MFP again, another thing that I know better than to do. And my healthy 1200 a day plus light exercise with a weekly weigh in quickly turned into 800 calories, a new gym membership, excessive walking, a scale for MY HOME, a tape measure, and a folder full of triggers on my phone. If you have ED tendencies, DON’T allow yourself to be triggered. Don’t do the things that you know will send you into a spiral. Not “just this one time” or “this time will be different” mentalities about it. Make healthy, balanced food choices, exercise a comfortable amount, and above all else, prioritize your well-being.",False,False
