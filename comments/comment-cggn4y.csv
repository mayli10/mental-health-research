Someone else being ""happy with your body"" is so completely irrelevant to eating disorders because other people do not live inside your body and don't know what it's like to want to crawl out of your skin or just disappear.  An eating disorder does not care if someone else thinks your body is fine or beautiful or perfect.  An eating disorder doesn't care if someone else thinks your body is disgusting.  It only cares about its own rules and whether you are following them or breaking them.  Have you asked your partner what *she* would find helpful from you?  It may be (probably is) very different from what *you* think is helpful.",False,False

Being in a relationship isn't a cure for an eating disorder. It wouldn't matter if someone else loved my body more than I did, because I'm the one who has to live in it.",False,False

She needs to actually want recovery and to see a professional.",False,False
