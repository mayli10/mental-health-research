Maybe I‚Äôve just gotten good at finding low calorie alternatives but it‚Äôs so wild to me when I see a tiny piece of salmon and one stalk of broccoli and the person is like ‚Äúsoooo filling and only 800 calories!!!‚Äù",False,False

It's an intuition thing like guessing someone's weight. It's obviously never going to be 100% accurate, so I just aim to estimate the calories to the nearest 100.  My ED has never been about control, so it's completely fine if I'm actually eating 200 calories more or less than what I think. I don't even log my food down anywhere, I just keep a running count of how many calories I have left for the day in my head. Things balance out over time and small errors in counting aren't significant enough to cause visible changes.",False,False
