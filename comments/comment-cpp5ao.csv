I remember throwing away an empty jar in the washroom upstairs after spooning it out of the tub in bed. Now if I have a binge episode it's usually on low calorie sweet stuff. Omg marshmallow fluff would be so good don't give me those ideas üòÇ,False,False

I am still embarrassed. That's definitely a weird binge ""food"" for me so I try not to buy it unless I'm feeling super in control. I just got another bottle a few days ago, and while I still had what the average person would consider an excessive amount, it was less than half the bottle.   STAY STRONG!
