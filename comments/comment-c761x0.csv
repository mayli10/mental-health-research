I was trying to say that the “tips” rule definitely seems to come from a place of not wanting to harbor pro-Ana communities. It doesn’t apply to all tips, like recovery tips!   Good for you, I’ve been in a similar place before! I wish I had recovery advice for you :/",False,False

I'm not looking for any ""pro ana"" tips (sorry if it came across that way). I have previously struggled with anorexia nervosa and have relapsed pretty hard recently. I'm desperately trying to recover but my situation is making it hard to get professional help. i hate my ed and just want to be healthy again. Its ruining my life. Not looking for anything pro ana, but i could really use advice on how to start recovery again. i want my life to go back to normal and i'm also terrified that my little sister will copy my ed behavior. Im looking for anyone who has advice on how i can ask my family/friends for help. :)",False,True
