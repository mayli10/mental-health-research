I know consuming more protein helps dimish muscle wasting but I'm trying to stay around 500 calories, and I sadly don't have access to my protein powder rn. Thanks for the advice though!",False,True

I’m not sure what a “severe deficit” means for you, but at least for me my ability to do a good workout correlates with intake. (Super low intake, super low chance of sustainably having good workouts.) I know EDs rarely listen to reason but a moderate deficit probably has a better chance of achieving your stated objective. Also, bear in mind that some % of body fat is essential and trying to drop below will be both difficult and risky.",False,False
