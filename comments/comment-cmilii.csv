I just finished the last big exam and busy week of my college education and it cost me 5lbs... All thanks to binge behavior. Googling ways to lose weight fast doesn't help but I'm still sitting on my couch with a waist band on and doing leg lifts,False,False

Trying to restrict to lose those last few pounds while also being so occupied by the thought of food and having the urge to eat is frustrating. I've had some bad crying sessions these past few days but let me tell you it gets better. As long as you are losing healthily and allowing yourself to nourish your body as well it will be possible. Remember that what you see in the mirror and all those terrible thoughts about yourself are not true. You truly do deserve to get rid of those damaging thoughts and to heal.,False,False
