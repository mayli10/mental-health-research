If I've been restricting well for a while and then indulge a little - it's like 'breaking the seal' and it makes me want to go crazy with cravings. Just know that it will get better and you will normalize back again, it just takes time. Good for you for allowing yourself to have a nice vacation with your boyfriend!",False,False

Sometimes it’s not that I fear eating over my limits (which I do very much fear) its that I fear the potential lack of control and increased hunger after indulging/eating regularly.  Part of my anxiety with my eating habits is how much I fear the increase in hunger when I’m finally at my GW and can eat a little under maintenance.    Yesterday I ate pizza and had a cocktail for dinner and I woke up SO hungry.,False,False
