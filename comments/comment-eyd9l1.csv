I almost went to treatment a few years ago but I didn't follow through. I've never felt sick enough to deserve it... I'll be sick enough when I'm dead, I know that's the bottom line of this disorder and yet... I honestly just wish I was a minor so that someone would be forced to take care of me because I'm clearly incapable.. This place, this sub and people like you, really helps me to feel grounded and less in my head with all of this though, and I am grateful for you.",False,True

Especially that idea of ‚Äúive been ill the whole time and I have no idea where to start‚Äù. I think that‚Äôs why some people go to formalized treatment - to surrender to those who can see our sickness in ways we can‚Äôt currently. Have you ever been to php or res care?  You deserve love and care and nourishment. You deserve honesty and authenticity. I remember when you found this community back in the fall and since then you have been so consistently sweet and supportive it makes me wish I could reach across the screen and give you a hug.  Wishing you all the best üíñ,False,False

Maybe that was just a rant instead. Idfk. Thanks for the validation though. For seeing me.,False,True
