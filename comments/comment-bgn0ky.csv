Your friend might literally be incapable of recognising that they aren't and that it's SUPER shitty of them to tell you to your face that your problems aren't as bad as theirs and that you don't understand, because they genuinely believe it. It's part coping mechanism and part just being sheltered I think (less life experience = less awareness of scale, how bad things can be, etc.).  that doesn't mean it's OKAY, your friend was still way out of line. But I'm sure they have good qualities too and this is just their insecurity leaping out, and they're trying to validate themselves in the only way they feel confident to do so (validating their own suffering/shortcomings). Next time they seem rational it might be worth it to say hey, if you know I have a history with EDs, then it's shitty of you to tell me that I don't understand what body dysmorphia is like, and it brought up some really bad memories for me. Don't accept any excuses or whatever, just let them sit with it. It's something they need to hear.",False,False

It's too bad because it sounds like they really are struggling. But instead of finding camaraderie and lending support through your mutual struggles, they're tearing you down. I'm sorry. That must be so frustrating.",False,False

I just...could not be comfortable around them after that. Maybe we're different people, and I respect if you want to give them one more chance not be wildly invasive/derogatory, *which they were regardless of their motivations/rationalizations/explanations/excuses*, but holy fucking shit.  This person has zero concept of boundaries and you're not obligated to spoon-feed them how to treat you with basic politeness and boundary-respect.",False,False
