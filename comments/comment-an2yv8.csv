I have a very very active little dog who doesnâ€™t stop to think to eat on his own. It seems so ironic I spend so much of my time trying to keep him fattened up while doing the opposite for myself ðŸ™„,False,False

Im terrified of my dog being underweight and being able to feel her bones. Which is kind of funny because thatâ€™s exactly what I want for myself. I also obsess over her food and the quality of the ingredients in it. ",False,False

My poor pup has lost 1kg in the last month (which is a lot considering she's just 15kg)... I was horrified when we weighed her. I was so scared of making her fat that I went the other way. I feel so very guilty.    I've been increasing her meal portions and being more generous with treats the past few days so hopefully she will gain it back soon. I've also asked my boyfriend to take more charge with her meals as I clearly am too messed up in terms of food, human or otherwise, to be in charge of anothers diet.    I see this as a huge indicator that I never should have kids.  ",False,False
