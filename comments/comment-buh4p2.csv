I’ve hovered a few pounds underweight at 5’7 for a long time, restricting but not wildly - and was convinced this wasn’t bad enough to feel so dizzy and strange - and yet I managed to rack up some electrolyte imbalances, liver problems, heart irregularities, nerve issues, and the kind of blood sugar foolishness that makes me feel like I’d had ten bags of candy if I eat a few peas. The worst is that it all happened the most when I tried to “recover.” :)  It sounds like something’s swinging around! Definitely keep safe and get some checks done to investigate (EKG, bloodwork - electrolytes and blood glucose etc etc). No one talks enough about how about how this stuff throws *everything* off course. I don’t know what your day to day routine looks like but it could be an easy fix (I felt exactly like you’re describing because of dehydration!)",False,False

I’d get checked out at the doctor. I’m primarily worried by how low your heart rate is and how your lips/hands turn blue. The turning blue thing implies your heart is pumping too weakly or slowly to get enough oxygen throughout your body.   Go to the doctor and mention your cardiac symptoms. They’ll run a bunch of cardiac tests (probably an EKG, an echo, stress echo, and whatnot).",False,False
