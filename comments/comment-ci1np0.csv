I had promised myself that I did not want to see 35.  But here I am.  I got some help, which while not perfect thanks to an understaffed and underpaid NHS (I'm in the UK) I managed to pass that milestone.  My biggest failing so far, has been to push everyone away.  My support network crumbled.  One of the things that helped me, was to reconnect with the friends that I felt comfortable with and just trying to talk to them, not necessarily about ED / mental health, but just as friends. The social circle around us makes a big difference, and even this subreddit has made a big difference.   Please don't be alone x  &amp;#x200B;  By the way - have you had a look at some of the charitable foundations that may be able to offer help ?

I think if you call the national help line they can give you some ideas about affordable or free services.,False,False
