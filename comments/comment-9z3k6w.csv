Getting treated differently bc of an illness fucking sucks... like people are defining you by your illness before they think about you as a person.  Imo it's selfish and harmful of the other party but you can't tell them that bc it's under the guise of misplaced and well meaning concern.  In my experience my loved ones reacted this way because of their lack of knowledge of EDs.  EDs are still one of those taboo illnesses that even shock progressive 'I understand anxiety/depression!' types to their core.  I realized they were treating me this way (monitoring what I ate, my bathroom time, etc) because they thought my ED was deadly like.. immediately deadly, probably because of media lol.  How many shows have the girl with ana die in a month? Likewise, how many shows have the girl recovering after one tiny intervention, never to relapse again?   I ended up going to one therapy session as kind of a show to them that 'I'm trying!' and gave them the quick 'Now I'm cured!' they were looking for.  I'm not actually, of course, but now that I they think I am I can live my life and determine for myself when I'm ready. :-/",False,False

I’ve been drowning in anxiety lately. I recently hit my new LW (still feel huge tho) and my parents are becoming suspicious....I’m so worried they’re going to start making me eat. It’s literally keeping me up at night ,False,False
