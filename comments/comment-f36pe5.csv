Or do I just have to speak about it with my regular doctor? He is a friend of our family so I don't want to risk it that he could tell my mom... I know that he is not allowed to but I have so much trouble to even tell my boyfriend about it... so how could I speak about something like this to a less known person? Anyway thanks for your advice:),False,True
