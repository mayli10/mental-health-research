However they are a fast road to it when it overpasses the control you have over yourself. Stay careful with it.   I've always had disordered eating and I see myself allowing less and less food intakes now. I have this one goal I want to reach, but I catch myself thinking about doing a bit more. Pushing your body to the limits.   I've been trapped in various self-destructive behaviours since I'm 10, and an ED could very well fit into this. You have to understand yourself, to prevent the loss of control over your own self. Sadly. ",False,False

Sort of by definition choosing to engage in harmful behaviors (your words) is disordered. Whether engaging in that behavior reflects a diagnosable mental illness is admittedly a trickier question.  Wanting to continue in the behavior has no correlation with whether the behavior is disordered.,False,False
