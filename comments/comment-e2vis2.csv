Books, sudoku puzzles, riddle books, crocheting, colorful pens. Also paper and envelopes or cards and envelopes AND stamps to send love letters to your partner while you’re away. Pictures of loved ones and pictures of pets. Journals and pens if you like to get your feelings out on paper. Something to listen to music on that’s ok by the treatment center rules (old school MP3 players that pick up the radio are a godsend) and maybe speakers to go with it if you want to share.   Good luck!! And congratulations on making the choice to invest in yourself and your long term wellbeing. It’s a hard choice to make and I’m rooting for you!",False,False
