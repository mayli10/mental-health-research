Every time I've lived alone I've had a period of adjustment where I b/p non-stop for a little while... Then I slooooowly get it together again. I've been recovering for like 8 or 9 years and recently I've been doing pretty well--until this week when my fiancé went on a backpacking trip i'd only purged once since june. This week feels like being back at square one. B/p every day except yesterday. Ruined my record the minute he left :(   I hope you get to a better place soon! Living alone is a whole set of skills that have to be developed. Don't be too hard on yourself...,False,False
