It was professionally inappropriate to phrase his opinion like that (let alone that his opinion about it being ""the fattiest thing out there"" just being a fairly incorrect phrase). It sounds socially-awkward and fully like he is projecting in regards to his own opinions and anxieties. He was totally in the wrong to give you that kind of ""advice"". ",False,False

Yeah they are higher calorie than they appear but would he say that if it was a couple slices of toast? What an asshole. Not like you’ll be able to eat for a few days anyway. Ugh. ,False,False
