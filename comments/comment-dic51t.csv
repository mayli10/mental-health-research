I’ve talked about this at length with my therapist and my partner and ultimately believe that it can sometimes be the lesser of two evils and that awareness around it is the key. EDs are so isolative and harmful and sometimes having someone see you and see what makes you feel safe is incredibly helpful. AND- you can’t stay there forever. You can’t eat one piece of bread with butter spray as a sandwich forever. But in this moment, her partner saw her, saw her pain and struggle, and did what helped her. And I’ve been in that position and I believe it is the right thing to do in that moment.   As a sub, I don’t know. It is enabling behavior.   As a human, I’m glad someone helped her.",False,False

I never said you shouldn't speak your truths. Talking about your struggles, talking about the day-to-day hell that is ED. I get that, and that is needed!   However, enabling others to harm themselves isn't speaking truths.    When someone is having a crisis because they haven't eaten or drank for 50 hours, and the top comment is how they can push through... that is not speaking truths. That is pushing someone to continue a very disordered behavior.   If someone is saying they have lost the will to live, that is a cry for help, not speaking truths.   People talking about how to lose X weight in X days, and people giving them pointers, that is destructive, and against the rules of this website (enabling others to harm themselves).   I am not limiting anyone's autonomy here.
