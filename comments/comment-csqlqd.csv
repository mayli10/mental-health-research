If I eat close to 500 then I'm going to gain or I'm being too greedy because if I've managed to eat this low this long, then why can't I keep at it? Really unhealthy. I'm trying to change though.",False,False

Won't feel so full. Honestly at 500 I can guarantee you will start passing out in about a month. 800-900 is better but really you shouldn't be eating less than 1200 as a minimum. Which is terrifying I know but you could work towards it.,False,False
