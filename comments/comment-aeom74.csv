So, I know what my scale at home says. Theoretically if I know what the doctor’s office scale says on the same day, then I know the approximate discrepancy. And I can track how my home weight changes and know what the doctor’s scale will say at the next visit. (Approximately, cuz some clothes...and water since not weighing at the doctor first thing in the morning)   But in reality I just track my home weight and ask the doctor not to tell me what their scale says. It’s too distressing.",False,False
