I'm sorry.  I recommend buying new clothes instead of trying to make do with stuff that isn't fitting. I know the prospect of buying clothes for a new high weight is AWFUL but you'll feel so much better wearing something comfortable. I did it myself and I don't regret it. If you have a hard time justifying it, think about it this way: if or when you lose weight again, it'll be a nice physical reminder to see how far you've come.  I also recommend thrifting. You can try on a bunch of already worn-in jeans and stuff and pick whatever fits best without worrying about the size (since it'll all be pretty random brands and sizes) and it'll be inexpensive too!",False,False

I bought a bunch of new jeans when I hit my lowest weight and now every time I open my pants drawer I have to see them and be reminded that I can't wear them because I've gained weight in recovery.,False,False
