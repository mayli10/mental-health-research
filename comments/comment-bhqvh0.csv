Like, maybe I'm just odd but I love green tea and I find sweeteners (calorie free or not) just totally ruins it. When I drink green tea I want 1) that rad metabolism boost and 2) to enjoy that nice, smooth roasted, nutty, and pleasantly grassy flavour that comes with good green teas. Not cloyingly sweet nonsense that overpowers every other flavour. If I wanted sweetness and nothing else I'd drown myself in a vat of corn syrup, not drink green tea lmfao  But if you want bottled or canned green tea that's unsweetened with no surprise calories, I recommend Oi Ocha! I love it and always drink it if I'm out and forgot to bring my iced tea bottle from home. You can find it at pretty much any asian grocery store, or at least that's veen my experience! (Which I'm so glad for because I tried it for the first time in Japan and fell in love, so I'm delighted that there are shops in Toronto that sell it lmao)",False,False
