It is among one of the most awful foods I have ever tasted, and I’m truly not a picky eater. I v much regret the money I spent trying to find a brand I liked.  But it’s super good for you and most people seem to like it. From a nutrition standpoint, I really wish I could eat it. But just in case you try it and are like “WTF THIS SUCKS,” I wanted to let you know you’re not alone haha",False,False

Typically I just use it on popcorn but my mom is a pro at cooking with it/using it for sauces. I don’t even question the nutritional content. It’s just one of my safe and “free” foods.,False,False

I’m just saying it won’t help you with fullness, so you know, since it’s not cheap. I see it more as a spice!",False,False

It doesn’t have much water or fibre, which are the main fullness factors.   Eat beans or lentils if you want lots of fullness and protein is my suggestion.",False,False
