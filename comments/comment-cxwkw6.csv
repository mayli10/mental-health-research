Like, ""yes I do have problems with restriction but I also have problems with binging. Sometimes I eat uncontrollably to the point where I involuntarily become sick. When you guys encourage me to eat extra on top of what i have already eaten, it can quickly trigger a binge, which is just as harmful for my recovery as restriction is. I'm still trying to figure all this out, so if you guys could not encourage me to eat extra if I have already eaten, that would be very helpful, and I'll let you know if there's anything else you can do""  It might be scary to do something like that because for a lot of us binging feels more shameful than restricting. But it seems like you may already be open with your friends since they know about the AN. If you dont think it would help to say something like that to them that's okay. I hope you figure something out, you deserve to have as few stressors in your recovery as possible",False,False
