Just add like 0.5-1 oz of lemon juice to  3-4 tablespoons of hummus and mix it up. Then take 2 cups of coleslaw and 1 cup of broccoli slaw. Mix it all up with the hummus. Makes a huge bowl of delicious, delicious slaw for under 150 cals.   And if ur feeling wild, roll it up in a low cal wrap and you have the best tasting thing in the world.",False,False

If it was packaged junk I could easily avoid it, but the thing is whenever someone brought in something homemade they would be really pushy with it and I would take it like a bitch and eat it. Granted most of the time it wasnt bad, and I could get away with eating a few modest bites and tossing the rest but every now and then someone would make something that was God-awful and I would get so upset internally as I was chewing it.   I have food issues for sure but it doesnt mean I hate how food tastes. It's quite the opposite actually and theres nothing i hate more than eating crappy or mediocre food. Yuck.",False,False
