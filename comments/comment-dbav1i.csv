Hey. HEY. I know it feels like the weight of the world is on your shoulders, but I want you to know that statistically, you are not an outlier. It's very, very common for first gen college students to struggle in college, and to leave without a degree, for *myriad* reasons. I know why you feel guilty or like you've let down your family, but you were responding to your cumulative life circumstances and health problems. You're not a failure, and you won't be even if you never make it back to school.   Provided finances allow, btw...returning to school is not something you should write off. (But yeah, I know that community college fees are outrageously high in some states, or their transfer rates suck, and I'm really sorry if you're in this situation. That's definitely a toughie.) The point is, we're sold this fantasy of college being for 18-24 year olds, who all live this awesome cool undergrad life, but it's super common to get a B.A. later on. Age should never be the reason you don't go back to school.   Speaking of colleges: it's often possible to seek counseling from trainees in Psychology/Counseling/Psychiatry programs for a very reduced fee. That would be my first stop when looking for sliding-scale help. Even if the university itself can't help you, they may be able to refer you somewhere.    I'm sorry you're going through this. You've been failed on a societal scale, and I'm not saying it will be easy to fight back, but I am saying that where there's life, there's hope.",False,False
