A low calorie limit like that is neither sustainable not healthy. If you don't want an ED, I recommend increasing that to your TDEE-250 for slow weight loss and eating a balanced diet. You can work that out with your doctor and nutritionist. Also, first rule of this sub: &gt;No asking for / giving tips Including those for weight loss, physical harm, medical advice, how to ""trick"" health care professionals, ""pro-ana buddies"", asking for BMI guesses or judging body pictures. Harm reduction tips (eg. binge eating prevention, exercise-related) may be approved at mod's discretion. Recovery tips are always allowed.&lt; I'm not trying to be snarky or rude. An eating disorder will make your anxiety and depression worse long term. Turn back while you can. Get help.",False,False
