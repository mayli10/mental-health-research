Now - this chart isn’t based on any solid science and the man who came up with these arbitrary figures is an anti vaxxer. It’s not correct in the slightest and it’s very harmful.   I doubt you have any of those conditions though and it’s your ed twisting already baseless and incorrect chart into something that’s more triggering. Your ideal weight IS NOT a bmi of 16. This is extremely low and at this bmi, mortality (chance of death) increases significantly.    I know it’s hard but please don’t let this get to you.",False,False

(And then shout “f*** that!” to crowdsourcing what an ideal life should look like.)",False,False

Yeah that sounds really extreme though and not healthy information to be putting out there by a doctor of all things",False,False

It is connected to a relatively well known vegan doctor though, so if you find one by someone like that then it’s probably the one I’m talking about.  Sorry, I know that’s no fun but I’d feel really uncomfortable linking it directly because it felt like a slap in the face and I don’t want anyone to be harmed by it bc I know sooo many people here will click the link to trigger themselves intentionally. :(",False,True
