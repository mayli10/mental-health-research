I donâ€™t remember feeling vastly different either, I tried so many different ones though I remember half the time I just felt so blank and bland.  I hope that you have a good experience this time if you do try again!",False,False

I guess my fears are more along the lines of messing my body/mind up worse than it already is since bodies are so complex and medications don't seem to be super well understood and still relatively new. But plenty of people take them and are fine, so I need to keep reminding myself of that and try to let go of the anxiety",False,True

So I guess getting back on them can't do too much more damage in THAT department..   Aside from the side effects, they are supposed to make things better overall, so maybe you just need to experiment with a few different ones?   When I try and look back at the time I was on them and compare it to now, I can't remember feeling any different. But everyone in my life remembers me being markedly motivated and high spirited then (and they don't know about my mental health/medications) so I guess it really does make a difference? It's weird",False,True

I don't think it affected me in any way besides making my vision blurry and causing intense nausea when I abruptly stopped it ðŸ˜³  As for being dependent on them, I'd like to first find one that helps. But I view it like people who need glasses. They aren't shamed for needing glasses/contacts to correct their vision, and if someone was struggling with poor sight, you'd encourage them to get their eyes tested. How many times have you heard someone say ""they're too dependent on corrective lenses, they should just try looking harder, then things wouldn't be blurry"". Hopefully the answer is never.   My point is, you shouldn't feel ashamed because you struggle to produce enough happy hormones, store bought is fine, provided it helps not hinders. If you need an aid so that you can function, like a walking stick, glasses or medication from antidepressants to antihistamines, then that's okay. You can't live the life you want if you can't function. Bodies are complex machines, some of us just need additional software to help us run smoothly.",False,False
