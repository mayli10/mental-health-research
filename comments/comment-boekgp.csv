I feel like I’ve failed because I was underweight all of last year until November 18’. Then I binged constantly and now I’m a fat slob who wants to disappear.,False,False

I seem to dabble between bulimia/BED.   Except eating disorders can affect anyone of any size. And just because you are a certain weight, doesn’t make your ED any less valid.

I don't want my thighs to touch, but they do and they always will, since I am already slightly underweight and I was even skinnier but my thighs always touched.   I'll never have the body I want and work for and knowing that makes me lose every motivation I had. So I am eating and eating and then I feel horrible, I want to restrict but then I feel dizzy and I can't study anymore.     FML",False,False

It's taken me 12 years of bulimia to realise that though I love the idea of being all jutting bones, what I really, deep down want is a slim, *healthy* body. This might sound silly, but my body idol isn't a supermodel or anything, it's actually Lara Croft. She's drawn slim, but she can climb mountains, her body functions really well. That's what I want. A healthy, happy body. That's more important to me now as I work my way towards 40.  I need to get the idea out of my head that I want to be so slim I could just disappear. I want a body that will let me live and enjoy my life. Not struggle up a flight of stairs without feeling faint.  Most of all, I don't want people I love to be afraid that I'll die. That's not the sort of attention I want.",False,False

My ED journey started because I consciously decided I wanted to be anorexic, but I could never sustain it, a months restriction would lead to a massive binge, and the binges would always make me gain more weight then I had lost in the restricting phase, one step forward two steps back. Eventually I discovered purging and spent about 8 years binging, excessively exercise, vomiting, and using laxatives to basically maintain a ""Normal"" body weight, and even now 12 years deep I still battle periods of excessive restriction, binging and purging, occasional laxative abuse and excessive exercise. It was terrible, it's taken over my life, ruined relationships and will probably stick with me in some way for the rest of my life.    Like nothing else in the world, I wish I could travel back in time and speak to that younger me, and tell me what I am going to tell you right now,    ""You might not like your body now, but it could be the best version it that it will ever be, it might be the worst.  No body cares what you look like as much as you do, if you keep waiting for the ""perfect body"" to make yourself seen by this would then the world will never see you. As hard as it is accept your body as it now and love it for it is you. If you don't love yourself now you wont love yourself at your lowest weight either. If you choose to pursue weight loss, pursue it from love and self care, nourish your body and have patience, focus on establishing a healthy routine with eating and a healthy relationship with food. The world will view you through the same eyes you view yourself. The thing that will draw people to you in this life is your kindness and your energy and any ED will steal this from you. No body cares what you look like as much as you do, if you keep waiting for the 'perfect body' to make yourself seen by this would then the world will never see you. """,False,False
