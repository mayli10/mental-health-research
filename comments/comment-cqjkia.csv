Down to veg with non veg husband.   Im definitely going to try this tip. What's helped me with staying my husband's food is asking if it would be weird for me to finish it. He's a germaphobe so he'll often be like ""Kinda?"" Which is just enough shame to keep me from eating his food.",False,False

It was to the point that I would even pick at HIS leftovers if it was vegetarian (FRENCH FRIES), because like how could he leave them??? Lol.",False,False

I think it's just that deep, animal part of my brain that's like ""you never know when food will come again EAT IT NOW""  And of course, I unintentionally reinforce that thought process by restricting ðŸ˜‚",False,True

I could NOT stop picking at my plate even after I had decided I was done.   You didnâ€™t ask for tips but just in case you want one, the thing that worked best for me was announcing to my SO (or whoever else was at the table) that I was finished eating. There was something about forcefully putting it out there that I was done that made the decision feel more solid and easy to stick to, and also (but this was honestly secondary) obviously if youâ€™ve told people youâ€™re done, thereâ€™s a little embarrassment involved in having them see you continue eating.   This totally broke the habit for me. Now Iâ€™m basically the opposite; Iâ€™ve literally not finished a single cheat meal since I started doing this. (I still finish my weighed, measured, and meal prepped meals just so I can log them accurately.)",False,False

Personally I've always assumed it came from growing up in poverty, but it's something I've carried with me even though I'm financially secure now.",False,False
