I’d honestly be worried about you if you weren’t.   Please take care of yourself so you can be there to support him the best you can, and don’t be scared to reach out for support for yourself. ❤️",False,False

As someone who has made several serious attempts, there is often nothing loved ones can do to stop the person. I was surrounded by loving and supportive people who were actively trying to keep me safe - but my depression was so severe I still managed to attempt. In some ways I think my attempts were even more traumatic for my SO than for me, so I really hope you’ll be gentle with yourself and reach out for support. It’s like the oxygen mask announcement on airplanes - take care of yourself first before trying to help others.",False,False
