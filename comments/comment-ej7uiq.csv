Because then it was, oh I just want to be safely in this weight range! Then it was I want to have lost half my weight... It kept going and at no point on this journey was I healthy.  I am currently 'recovered' but I struggle every day with portions and guilt and wanting to lose weight because I don't want to be viewed as the fat girl who couldn't stay skinny. It's such a dangerous mindset to develop. You are a worthwhile person regardless of any number (except maybe if it's like number of people murdered :p). It's so easy to justify restricting when overweight because society encourages weightloss no matter what. It's never too late to develop a healthy relationship with food. Xx",False,False

If I remember correctly, your body can only metabolize a limited amount of fat each day and going too far under can force it to burn muscle instead, which can eventually lead to the same heart issues that are common in anorexics. I mean I’m absolutely not following my own advice half the time, but still.",False,False

Excess weight could be something you're worried about but its effects are far more long-term if they end up happening for u; restriction could catch up to you really quickly (i have a friend with atypical ana and she has been in and out of inpatient, lots of heart problems, always cold, etc, despite being in a larger body). you deserve to recover no matter your weight because being stuck in the eating disorder mindset SUCKSSSSS.",False,False

Even though your circumstances may be different from other people’s, there’s nothing that separates your worth from others. You deserve to care for yourself because you exist.
