He really does try and my words last night were too aggressive (was drunk). He had just mentioned something about me staring into an empty bowl for a long time and I felt embarrassed, so I made a post where I thought some people would relate, but I just feel like a total bitch now lol",False,True

I know heâ€™s just trying to help, but the other day he tried to tell me that butter and cheese is good for you lol (I had just had a huge bowl of mashed cauliflower with sooo much butter and goat cheese)",False,True

Iâ€™ve been struggling for over half my life and sure donâ€™t understand it myself either. I am currently seeing a therapist and a dietician and my therapist is always asking if I want him to come in just to learn some language around the ED that may help him help me. Like I said in the comment above, I was drunk last night when I posted and my words were way too harsh ðŸ˜ž",False,True

The thing is, when I met him he was struggling with an ED as well. I for sure donâ€™t expect him to understand my exact situation, and I totally relate to you in that he says things that are meant to help that just end up hurting. Thanks for reaching out :)",False,True

Wtf ""normal"" people don't starve themselves all fucking week and then pound back 2500+ cals of chocolate in 20min. I don't know if I'd prefer he got mad or upset with me, but him insisting this is normal behaviour is not even close to helping.",False,False

I donâ€™t even understand it myself and Iâ€™ve been living it for 25 years! If theyâ€™re compassionate and supportive, you may consider yourself very lucky. We have to remind ourselves that EDs can be very difficult on our partners and families, and give them their dues for being able to cope with it. Perhaps you are projecting your anger towards your ED on to your partner. If you love them and they love you, couples counseling may help if one or both of you are struggling with communication. Best of luck.",False,False

He doesn't understand but he is worried, and sometimes says things that hurt me but I know that's just his waying of trying to help me. Maybe your partner also just doesn't know how to deal with your ED but he is worried about you and wants to help you?  If you wanna talk about it you can message me.",False,False
