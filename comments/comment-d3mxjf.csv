Your situation sounds super stressfull, take care &lt;3. I feel like this is the realistic outcome, but a part of me really really wants to believe that full recovery is possible... I've met people who claim that and really seem like it but ofc you can never know. It would just feel sad to have to settle for this quasi-recovered yet functional state, it's fine but full recovery would be so much better.",False,False

I used to throw up. Then i moved to restricting. I have been on and off having an ED and eating ‚Äúnormally‚Äù but I‚Äôve always had issues with my weight. In my 20s, again on and off, heavily restricting, using drugs to lose weight, etc. i have been ‚Äúok‚Äù for about 6-7 years although there have definitely been episodes of binging. I‚Äôve never restricted like this since my early 20s and I‚Äôm mid 30s now. I had a death in the family recently, I‚Äôm going back to school, and my dad made a fat joke about me.. someone at work asked if i was pregnant. I‚Äôve been majorly triggered. It doesn‚Äôt go away. :(",False,False

I feel sad for never being truly, truly free of disordered thoughts, even if I don't act them out. Even if I don't feel that they are true. They still wait in the back of my head and come up if I feel anxious or sad.  Maybe there will be a time when they're not there anymore, but for me it feels unlikely.",False,False

I consider myself mostly recovered, but I still go through binge/purge and restriction phases.

My first episode was age 15 (with a prodrome looming since 13-14) I have had periods of physical wellness between relapses, some of them lasted years, but in retrospect it was only surface level. My body was healed but my soul wasn‚Äôt. I believe that it‚Äôs possible to recover properly, if the root of the problem is addressed and the soul is healed as the priority, instead of simply weight restoring and trying to fix behaviors. I‚Äôm at a place now where I actually believe it‚Äôs not physically possible any more to restore my weight and fix my body until I fix my soul first. Working on it!",False,False
