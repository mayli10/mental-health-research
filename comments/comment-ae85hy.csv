Its life changing, and maybe not stressful per say, but it means your life is different now and can cause a relapse into old habits. The first thing you should do is tell your husband how you've been feeling and give him background if he doesnt know what you've told us. And if you can afford it, find a therapist   I hope you can get through this, we're all here for you!",False,False

It's just so annoying because he's the only guy I've been with that I actually enjoyed being with. Every time we start to get intimate or I feel like things could be going that way my brain shuts down and I'm suddenly super anxious and fearful of being seen. You hit it with the worthy thing. I see myself as so undesirable I can't imagine why someone else would see me as anything else. ",False,True

Unless I'm obliterated to the point where I don't care. But I want to feel good sober. And I want to make him feel good when I'm sober. Thank you for the reply though. I will try to talk to him about it. ,False,True

I don't have personal experience with this exact issue, but I do have an interest in people having the type of sex lives they want and I also have had very confusing periods of my life where my sex drive disappeared. When I've lost my libido I've never been quite sure what was causing it: medication, depression, not feeling attractive, actions of my partner etc.   &amp;#x200B;  Your feelings of guilt/failure might be making it worst because you feel so much pressure to be a willing spontaneous partner. I totally get why you feel guilt but you might need to try to let that go... you aren't a failure as a partner if you don't want to have sex....but it is certainly a feature of many healthy relationships and it is hard on other partners who want to be having sex and are refused/turned down (I have experience with this and it actually caused me to question my worth and I find it very triggering when someone I am in a relationship with doesn't want to have sex with me... I try to be mindful of this because I know there are so many reasons to turn down sex, and that everyone is allowed to refuse sex and I believe it can be manipulative to be too pouty about it)  &amp;#x200B;  Have you explained to your partner that you think you don't want to be having sex because you don't like how you look? It's hard to give suggestions without knowing what type of things you enjoyed previously and how you like to to express yourself/experience your sexuality if you know what I mean  &amp;#x200B;  I think if you did work on just feeling worthy in general it might help...  &amp;#x200B;  I'm sure you know that it's totally possible that you were feel just the same way even if you lose weight, but I get your instinct. For me I do feel like staying at a low weight DOES help me feel more attractive, but I'm also annoyed to feel that way.  &amp;#x200B;   You could try introducing more/different types of physical activity/exercise into your life- that could help you feel better mentally.   &amp;#x200B;  \---As usual this is kind of my own thought process about nothing masquerading as an answer to your question sorry hahah its what i do. ---  &amp;#x200B;",False,False

I want so badly to enjoy it and be intimate but I just cant get past them touching me(my fat). At my worst, I would end up in tears after every act of intimacy and be so frustrated and ashamed in myself. I think drinking and ant anxiety meds help but then they also kill your sex drive so I would not advise. You are not a failure because of your issues. You can have an honest conversation with your husband and work through it.  YOU DESERVE TO BE HAPPY. ",False,False
