I’m “recovered” too but have no idea what would happen if I got pregnant. Were you recovered-ish when you had your kids?   My fiancé says stuff like, well if you have a kid now your body will recover faster, etc. I know he says that for my sake because I worry, but it’s probably a little selfish on his end too... it does make me feel better knowing that he’s had a baby with his ex who was older (~34?) and it didn’t impact his attraction to her.",False,False

I got ow/obese during pregnancy with both kids and uw within the first year after giving birth both times. The first one was more gradual, and I managed to eat enough to maintain milk supply while losing, but with the second it was out of control and I had to switch her to formula to keep her fed. So much guilt. Especially since I'm at high-end-of-normal bmi now... I ruined breastfeeding my baby for nothing.  I want another one eventually. But not while I'm like this. I guess I'm 'recovered' for now but it's shaky; everything has to be more stable, from finances to mental health.",False,False

Follow the wardrums, swell with a bebe, then stop eating and breastfeed postpartum until you're a s k e l e t o n of a mom and everyone's like ""wow good for you so many women let themselves go after having kids""  Jk don't actually do that you'll lose your supply and have to bottlefeed and your skin will be loose and gross and covered in stretchmarks no matter how skinny you get and you'll get the positive comments but you'll know what you did to earn them and hate yourself for not doing what was best for your baby and hate everyone who compliments you for perpetuating insane standards on new moms and ....
