Giving in and binging or going to extremes due to a plateau kept me bouncing at the same weight for literally 2 years. If you can just hold... You're gonna see it and it's going to actually be real!!  What's the point of the scale going down if people look at you and see the same thing right? Focusing on actually getting smaller, real weight loss and not water loss instead of the number is how I broke out of those hellish 2 years!    Also don't abuse laxatives... There like bad for you m'kay? ðŸ˜œ",False,False
