A thin person who had been maintaining their weight for a consistent period will look more balanced, whereas someone who is still/was recently losing weight will have lost weight from specific areas that the “naturally” slim person has an even distribution over.   Those places vary from person to person, but they can include the face/jawline, extremities, and for some, breast/butt. Many will lose the weight around their middle slower as the organs are more vital than the extremities. So between two people who are similar weights, the person who is restricting/losing weight might look more “gaunt” or “bony” because their weight is not distributed evenly across their face or arms, since their body has only recently been converting it into energy. And so you can notice a pattern between people who have lost weight recently/are currently restricting vs maintaining.   I think this is why people often get told they’ve lost “too much” weight when they’re still at a healthy (or even overweight) BMI; their uneven weight distribution makes their face look gaunt and their limbs bony, making them look more emaciated than they really are. So I get why some people in normal weight loss subs get frustrated when they hear it, but OTOH, their loved ones don’t know any better - they just see someone with much more prominent bones than before, which is generally a red flag, even if it turns out to be a false one.   Sorry for the wall of text you just got me thinking lol",False,False
