For me, I drink green tea rather than drinking normal tea (because in the UK it’s normal to have a “cuppa” with the family). Normal tea (with milk) is terrible, I hate milk because it’s so bad for you.  However you should drink green tea AFTER eating something. Sometimes I forget to eat in the morning and drink green tea. Not a good idea. Did it once and puked up on the way to a eyebrow appointment. It can also make you constipated which isn’t great",False,True
