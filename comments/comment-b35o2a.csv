I legitimately don't understand how I didn't know I was obese instead of ""a little overweight"". I looked horrible, why am I just seeing this _now_? And it's making me so anxious because at a BMI of 19.8 I think I look skinny but I could very well just look super normal and not thin at all. I mean, obviously I don't look stick thin, I'm a healthy weight, but still. ",False,False

When I look in the mirror I usually see a skinny person, like edging on too-thin skinny (which is odd, i'm only just barely UW. Probably still 18.something) but when I look at other people with similar stats they look fairly normal, and every time I go outside everyone looks thinner than I do. So I'm just in a constant state of ??¿?  It's very bizarre and I have no clue what my wack ass brain is even trying to do anymore. Lowkey kinda miss being a more typical dysmorphic mess who always looked fat at any weight lol",False,False

I’m sucking in and everything and fuck I look huge. All I can see how gross and flabby I was, even though I remember being pleased at how small my waist was getting. It’s wild.",False,False

At my lowest weight from before, I’m actually lower now but I remember back then thinking how small I was but now I look back at pics and I’m like ‘eh not really fatty patty’ lol  I’m technically underweight but I feel so jiggly and I feel fat and I definitely don’t think I’m perceived as being underweight, idk if people would even describe me as skinny bc I have a small frame so I feel like it just looks normal on me?   I’m scared that even though I’m underweight I’m not underweight enough? Like I’m “skinny” but I’m not skinny enough and not nearly as skinny as my weight on the scale would imply   It makes me so sad ",False,False
