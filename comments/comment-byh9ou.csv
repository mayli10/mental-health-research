If youâ€™re restricting I recommend finding snacks that are decent in nutritional value and/or filling - granola bars, cheese and crackers or cheese and mixed nuts, and oatmeal are all my go-tos. Lately Iâ€™ve also been eating Skinny Pop rice cakes, theyâ€™re usually on sale at Publix and theyâ€™re pretty good (and vegan)!  Roam the grocery story aisles if you can handle it (I go at night when itâ€™s quiet) and just see what pops out to you!",False,False
