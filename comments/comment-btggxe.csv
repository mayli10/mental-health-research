Or maybe even 2x (with 1x being extra small)   It's a robe, going sizes up is normal to ensure cozy wiggle room like you were enjoying. It might even just be more of an issue of height over width. Please don't fret too much love &lt;3 I'm sure the sizing isn't the same as when we typically think of regular clothes",False,False

Was it pretty busy? They might've just run out of robes in your size earlier when they were serving you, then got more in between when you were done with your treatment and the next girl came in. I doubt anyone thinks someone with a BMI of 19 needs a 5x. Also the possibility that she grabbed the wrong size if she's in a rush.",False,False
