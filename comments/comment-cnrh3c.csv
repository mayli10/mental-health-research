I hope you start to feel better about it all soon.",False,False

I'll definitely give some thoughts to the second advice. Thanks for answering ! It means a lot.",False,True

I would schedule days in advance where I would overeat massively, but because those were planned I never had to reckon with the sense of loss of control, and the guilt and shame were much less than with a regular binge.   For a couple of months this summer I found myself really struggling with “legitimate” binging. Every time I would try to rally and tell myself that was the last time, and every time I would fail.   There were a few different things I did to get back on track but these are the two that helped me the most.   First, I realised, and was able to keep reminding myself, that the *one special food* I was obsessing about wasn’t going to be the end, it was going to be the beginning. I found I’d been telling myself that if I couldn’t stop thinking about that one protein bar then I should just eat it, get it over with, and the obsessive thoughts would stop and I’d be able to get on with my day. That obviously wasn’t the case; the thoughts would just switch over to something else ad infinitum. Being able to nip a binge in the bud by reminding myself that eating the thing wasn’t actually going to help, was really useful to me.   The other thing was bigger and more substantial. I had to reflect on what was causing this destructive emotional reaction. What had changed in my life when the binging started that made me feel so out of control that binging was the only thing that was going to make me feel better? This was tough work, mentally and emotionally, but I managed to identify those triggers and work to change my material circumstances such that I was able to handle my emotions more healthily.   Hope this helps.",False,False

If you go from binge to normal energy intake you’ll be less likely to get sugar fluctuations and things that cause more binges. Drink a lot of water to stay hydrated after the binge and gets sodium build up out. It feels natural for us (ED people) to just want to go 0-100 after binging but for your body it’s less stressful to just - try and get at least 1000 cals in the following day and utilize self care- comfy clothes, bath, music, take a walk to get digestion going.",False,False
