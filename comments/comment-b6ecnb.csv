It’s strange and kind of disheartening to know this resonates with anyone. I’m bummed that other people are stuck feeling the same way, and at the same time really grateful I found this community because where else can we be even remotely so candid? Life is hard enough for all of us without having to feel even more isolated by the people that are supposed to care. Finding all of the wonderful, beautifully broken, trying their goddamndest folks here has been so healing and so immeasurably helpful for me. I just hope I can pay a fraction of it forward by making someone else feel the tiniest bit less alone!",False,False

Like, I appreciate that they think they’re concerned for me. I do.   But part of me can’t help but think that the way people go about “helping” people suffering from eating disorders has more to do with gratifying their need to feel like a Good Person than it does with actually helping. It takes all of two seconds online to figure out that our issues aren’t really about the food. If you really truly want to help someone, don’t you put in some marginal amount of effort understanding their problem? You don’t even have to read a book. Just browse a few articles. Google how to help someone with their specific problem and then follow the advice.   We aren’t dumb. We know that our caloric intake isn’t sustainable. That’s the fucking point. Because our problem isn’t what we want to or don’t want to eat. Our problem is a deep emotional trauma (or traumas) that we struggle to process so we cover it up by focusing on something we can manage/control (or at least feel like we can), our diet. There’s a wound we can’t make feel better, so we trained ourselves to feel better about something else.   It would be so much more helpful to have someone remind me that I have value. That I matter for things other than my appearance. That I’m actually pretty capable. That what happened to me as a kid wasn’t right and wasn’t my fault. That I’m loved, regardless of whether or not I’m “perfect”.    Instead I get told to eat more. Not to lose more weight. But all that does is reinforce for me that my “problems” are bad and make other people uncomfortable and they really wish I’d just keep that stuff locked up where they don’t have to see it. That kind of “help” just makes my illness worse. So forgive me if I’m less than grateful for the “concern” being displayed.   It sucks because I’m left with the painful understanding that I was actually right. That I’m not worth it to them to spend 5 minutes trying to educate themselves so they can avoid making my illness worse. That my imperfection is detestable and unwelcome. And that I’m on my own.   How is that help? How is that not some superficial pat-on-the-head that they get to walk away from feeling like they’ve done the Right Thing without actually doing anything except make themselves feel better at our expense?
