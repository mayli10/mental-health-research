Odds are your friend enjoyed the movie and wanted to share that with you. I’d hope that was the reason anyhow. But you could always ask them why they suggested it.   (I fit the ‘egomaniac with an inferiority complex’ joke so I often jump to “what are you trying to SAY?! Huhhh?!” And the answer is frequently “That wasn’t about you at all.” Which invariably genuinely surprises me.),False,False
