It’s seen 100% as a choice, like we could ‘just eat’, I think to normies it really is that simple.   My conspiracy is that those who have felt sad or nervous can *somewhat* empathise with depression and anxiety (not really but stay with me) whereas being scared of food, not eating out of spite or sadness, etc. those without Ed’s just do not experience.  But idk ",False,False

Everyone has sad or down days, so they can imagine what it’s like to be like that allll the time.   Everyone (normal, healthy relationship with food) is so god damn obsessed with food they can’t imagine the revulsion some of us feel. They just can’t get in the headspace and lack empathy.   That, and it’s considered an illness for 12 year old girls and anything young women are into is completely trashed by society - boy bands, fashion, etc. Young women are consistently laughed at and completely disrespected for their issues and interests.

I had to describe its voice, what it looked like, write fucking letters to it.  It's weird how I struggle with that but I still think of depression as a black dog.  &amp;#x200B;  The main thing that gets me is when people who don't understand EDs come out with the line about how we wouldn't be starving ourselves if we were in Africa or something like that, how it's like a choice and there we are shunning all this food to get skinny when people are going hungry.  &amp;#x200B;  Ignorance.",False,False

Movies and books and stuff always either joke about it or pretty it up with the person being this beautiful girl who seems to never have the actual bad parts of an ED other than weight loss and passing out.,False,False
