If you’ve been classified as a danger to yourself, the standard procedure on medical-surgical units seems to be to assign a 1:1 (a watcher). There might be some wiggle room in the policy though (if that policy even applies in your area). Good luck. I hope you can find a way forward and be safe &lt;3",False,False
