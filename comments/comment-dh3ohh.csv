I've had body dysmorphia as long as I can remember. Messed up eating habits, too. And a couple weeks ago she said she didnt think she had anything to do with my eating disorder and asked me if that was true. She's been a good mom overall and definitely not purposefully making me feel bad. I didnt have the heart to admit the ways she messed me up.",False,False
