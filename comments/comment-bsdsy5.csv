At first It was really hard fighting the urge to go back into my addiction of over exercising  but what helped my mentality was that putting those calories to good use and being active sure beats sitting around all day feeling bloated. I try to do this at least two-three times a week (i cant do it everyday as im scared that i might relapse)",False,True
