People who don't get hungry often don't find the need to eat and therefore they maintain their skinny figures because they're probably undereating by default but for people who have big appetites (like I do) it's hard because you constantly have to watch what you eat as to not gain any significant amount of weight over time.

She humble brags about being too skinny and she says she wants to gain weight but I don‚Äôt see her making any effort to. She has a terrible diet (basically only fast food and junk food), but only eats like once or twice a day. Crazy thing is, I looked up her TDEE and it‚Äôs like 1200. At least I can technically lose weight on that. I feel bad comparing myself to her as she‚Äôs not a bad person for being skinny without trying but she pisses me off sometimes.",False,False
