I didn't even want to loose more! I was ok with even gaining 1-2kg back. Anyway, shit happens, gained 16kg in total, reached a new HW and now i'm back to my ~usual weight~ and wasn't able to get this low ever again.",False,False

Now I’m restricting again but not as heavily because I _never_ want to go through that again. I know it will happen if I let myself get too hungry and if I lose too rapidly,False,False

I never reached it but I got 3 lbs under my original ugw. Then I decided to try the whole recovery thing so I threw out my scale and now I dont know my weight. It is terrifying. I know it's going to be worth it tho when I get to the point where I have a somewhat  healthy relationship with food and my body,False,False

Even maintenance is a thing I need to watch daily.   When I get to a point I am satasfied/kinda with my body weight I just turn to something else.  Nose? Hair? Teeth? Eyes? Clothing? Job? I'm not happy with anything in my life and would like to change all of it.   Weight is the only thing that takes up so much of my time I rarelg turn to my other insecurities. Sadly, it's always something and my disordered brain will never stop.",False,False
