I fell off the bandwagon and slowly gained 20 lbs while doing my phd candidacy exams by BED over the span of the next year.  Guy ends up saying ""hey I'm less attracted to you now"" and its perfectly legit but it still hurt you know? We discussed it at length and stuck together because  yeah he hurt me but he's perfect in every other way.   Now in the present, Im slowly stopping the BED and am 10 lbs down thus far. I've had to stop habits like watching TV while eating with my SO. He complains I cant eat while watching tv but whatever. He doesn't gain weight no matter how hard he tries and can eat like shit with no consequences. He listens when I explain how I feel but idk if he will ever reaaally understand.

And for 2.5 months it's worked great! I was losing weight at a healthy pace and was definitely in control. But then I accidentally triggered myself on YouTube and Reddit of all places and then spent hours last night falling further down this rabbit hole.

Learn from setbacks see what was the trigger physical, emotional and mental. Take it day by day. Never rate your victories or your loses, take it as it happens. What I am typing is mainly from experience. I went from anorexia to Binge Purge 5-7 days a week to once a week.   Live your recovery now,  for you no one else with no judgement, no opinion &amp; no comment. Best of Luck hope my sharing helped.",False,False
