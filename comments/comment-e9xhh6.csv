Lots of good recipe posts in the safe food subreddit. I find I can take many of my favorites and just have them in smaller portions. If you want to keep around that calorie amount, using the scale and calorie tracker to preplan meals can be helpful. That way you can have something you like but not feel too full. Lean cuisine has lots of frozen meals too for around that calorie count that are pretty light and not too filling. My favorite thing to have is salad, I feel light after eating it but also very nutritious.",False,False

I like roasted radish with Mrs. Dash for a seasoning (get them wet and put the seasoning on them before you roast them so the seasoning sticks).  And sauerkraut and mustard.  Right now thats basically how I'm eating ""dinner"" every night this week so far.   The radish gives me a full feeling for about five minutes after dinner.  The Sauerkraut is super good for gut health.  And no salt in Mrs. Dash to make you all bloaty.",False,False
