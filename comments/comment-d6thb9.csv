At times I'd like to be taller since everything evens out, but I loooove being short too because when I (if I T\_T) get to my ugw, I'd be sooooo cute and smol and AGH. If I get smol and standing next to my 6' bf, we'd be soooo cute aghhhhhhh.   BUT, just think. If you're super tall, it's not always possible to be a double digit weight and not be severely underweight, so gotta thank our height for that at least. I guess. : (",False,False

I hate being short and having such a low tdee, I hate that so many short people have naturally tiny frames and little bird bones whereas of course that is not the case for me, no siree.

Even standing next to taller friends is a struggle because I’m 5’0 and they’re 5’4+ but I look huuuuge width wise.
