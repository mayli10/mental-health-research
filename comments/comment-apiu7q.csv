I'm Chinese so I'm used to hearing shit like that from relatives, but my best friend's dad is known for being brutally blunt no matter what and he has always commented on me being chubby as fuck. After losing a bunch of weight last year, he saw me for the first time in a while and said ""Haven't you lost weight? You're getting skinny, good job!"" while giving me thumbs ups. I was *thrilled*. Can't remember the last time I've ever been that happy",False,False

He stopped getting me pop tarts when I was like 7, at 8, he told me to stop drinking apple juice because eating the fruit was better.  The other week my mom got me a free pink lemonade from Starbucks, and when I didn't finish it all, my dad got mad.  Like, hmm, I wonder why I'm so afraid of sugary drinks and liquid calories, huh?",False,False
