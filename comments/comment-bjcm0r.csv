I hope your love can get you guys through this together. ðŸ’• I'm scared to tell my boyfriend, I feel like I'll be burdening him even more than I already do :((( He always insists I'm not but I feel like I just put negativity in his life",False,False

He accepts you as a whole person. And like any person you have your struggles. He understands this is a point of great difficulty for you. He wants to help you, not hurt you!",False,False

Yesterday my boyfriend called me out about my ED. We've been together for 3 years and I just recently told him.  I regret telling him about my ED so much.  As you said, he didn't sign up for this.  I feel like he'll get tired of me, my depression, my ED.  He told me I need to recover, because this situation is taking a toll on our relationship. He is scared and worried for me and ""our future"". I honestly don't give a shit about ""our future"" because it's really not about him, it's my problem.  And moreover, I don't feel ready to recover right now. I just don't.  He never wants me to talk about my ED and my binges, and when I do, he gets upset and by consequence I binge even more.  e.g. yesterday, binged all night long and this morning my belly is feeling like shit.  He is the most important person of my life.  Losing him would be so fucking sad, I can't even imagine it.   Sending love. Hope you'll get better.",False,False
