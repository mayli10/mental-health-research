It started at that 1200 shit. U prolly not going to listen just like I didn't but I have to say it anyways. This is not worth it. Weight loss is a marathon not a sprint. You will be so much happier loosing at a steady rate and eating 1200 than you will be going below it and loosing an unstable amount rapidly. EDs take every thing from you I'm so serious. Litterally TODAY I walked a bridge for 2 hours on oxy working my way up to jumping. Want to know why? Cause I binged last night and couldn't stop thinking about how much of a failure I am. When I pussied out I counted the steps I got in from my walk to the bridge. The other day I ran until I felt like vomiting cause I ate 250 calories I didnt plan. I often leave social situations because my stomach is going to growl and i cant have my friends hear. A lot of the time I can't concentrate on my school work cause my brain is running on fumes. My girlfriend has almost left me beacause of this twice. I thought it would be me shrinking my portion sizes for a easy lil hack. Just a little under 1200 maybe a bit under 1000 ... 800... ect ect. It never stops it never ends it will never be good enough. I'm sorry that your even considering going under 1200 for a prolonged amount of time. That in itself is a red flag for unhealthy behavior. Please be safe and kind to yourself. You deserve a life outside of arbitrary numbers.,False,False

Push your daily intake back up to 1200! breaking down and binging is a sign your body absolutely cannot function at your current restriction level.,False,False
