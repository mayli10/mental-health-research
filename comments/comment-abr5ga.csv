I gained more weight over the summer when I was stuck in a binge cycle so I've been wearing nothing but the same few jeans, leggings, and loose shirts since.

Sad thing is, the overwhelming majority of them are clothes I used to wear all the time. ;( I have a whole large uhaul box filled with them.    But, I have given myself until June to fit into them. If they don't in June, I will get rid of them. I won't stop trying to lose weight, but basically my punishment for not doing it in time will be losing all those clothes and buying new ones.
