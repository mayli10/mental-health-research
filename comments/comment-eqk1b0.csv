The psychology and suffering that people go thru at a wide variety of sizes makes many purple not feel worthy or sick enough to get help. Obsessions, low self esteem and anxiety and harmful behaviors are manifestations of much deeper issues. Often some that one may not be consciously aware of. I wish you all the best.",False,False

I‚Äôve been researching all I can and finding some helpful things. I now have an app that helps track my mood and log what I‚Äôm eating.  I‚Äôm only on day one of this but I feel like it‚Äôs helping.  I‚Äôm worried about overshoot because I‚Äòve never been terribly sick looking or underweight during even the most vicious points in my ED. I‚Äôm worried putting on weight to ‚Äúheal‚Äù is just some vague arbitrary term that feels a lot more like a punishment from healthcare professionals.

Most therapists will try to work on sliding payment scale with you. A nutritionist is really a good idea to have since you've struggled with different types of food/control options. Ocd support groups also would be good to look into. Even the apps available for phones that help track moods and emotions might help. The internet/technology makes many things more readily available.  Cbt and dbt are your best friends right now. Throw yourself into learning the therapy and skills and implementing them. Also if you haven't seen a psychiatrist by this point it's really worth it especially seeing you have multiple diagnosis and years of food manipulation can change the way your neurological even responding to stimuli.,False,False
