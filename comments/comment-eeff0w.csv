But then OTOH I realise it's because I'm drinking instead of eating LOL  Like I will still sometimes drink a bubble tea or a hot chocolate or something. But that bubble tea was my lunch, that sugar free almond milk hot chocolate was my dessert/half my dinner, etc. Yet I used to drink those things like... just on the side, all the time. Bubble tea in particular blows my mind now... I used to get it upsized full sugar with tapioca pearls to go WITH food!!! That's over 500cals in the drink on its own, easy!! Now I'll get it without sugar and it will BE the food.  Things were so different before lmao... Sometimes I look back at all the calories I used to drink in addition to the food I was eating and go Yikes  It's weird bc I'm thinking about it now and there's definitely a taste/mouthfeel component to this tho. Like I would happily drink anything milky but I would not spend the same amount of calories on full sugar juice or soda, for example... Same as you I would much rather save those cals for some good solid meals ü§°",False,False
