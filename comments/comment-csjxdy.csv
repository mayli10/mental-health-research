I miss the days where I didn't care about calories and food in general and I was able to enjoy it without feeling like people are judging me ( cuz I am judging myself so of course others are too) .,False,True

You are sick and you deserve to recover. Please, never ever think that you do not deserve to recover. Healthy people do not freak out like this over eating some chicken and chips. Healthy people eat meals like that and then carry on their day like normal. Hell, have you seen some calorie counts in restaurants? They’re in the thousands. That isn’t even that many calories for a meal. A low calorie meal is general considered to be around 500kcal. That means that your meal is probably an average amount of calories for a normal person to have for lunch. It just seems like a huge amount because you’re sick. And yes, you are sick. Just because you had one average sized meal does not mean you are not sick. Like I said, if you weren’t sick then you’d just carry on with your day like normal after what you’d perceive to be a normal meal rather than freaking out about it. You are valid. And you do deserve recovery. We all have times like this when we feel like we lose control, that’s not because we’re “pigs”, it’s our bodies fighting back because they need nutrients. I’m so sorry you’re feeling like this, I really hope you feel better soon *hugs* if you need to chat feel free to PM me 💖",False,False
