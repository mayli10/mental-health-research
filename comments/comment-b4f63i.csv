Like Iâ€™ve always had fat cheeks but this lil double chin that wants to live here has got to go.    So I bought a jade face roller/massager and use it everyday on my face and chin and neck.

Probably it's the only part of my body that actually changes appearance noticeably. I have to tell myself to not care. I have to remind myself that having fat on my face, having that bit hanging down under the chin is freaking normal, and that everything in my body stops working properly when I get down to low enough body fat to where my face looks thin (to me), and that it's physically unhealthy to have that little body fat. I have to remind myself of how great I feel 24/7 when I carry a little more body fat. Better sleep, better skin, better hair, much less hunger, better workouts and strength. Less food focus. Less dreams about binging. Last night I had an absolutely horrible nightmare about binging on carbs that wrecked me, mentally. Lately I've been doing a ketogenic diet and unfortunately although I went into it for the right reasons, the initial weight loss triggered me and then I lost more weight, but am trying to ""recover"" right now (and still really freaking hungry 24/7 hence the dreams). It's horrible though. I feel like I can feel every millimeter of fat I add to my body and the scale has so much power over me at times it's insane. Even when the scale doesn't go up I am imagining and fearing gaining fat... which biologically, I understand is an absolute necessity for right now to be healthy and normal. I feel like I switch back and forth between thinking about this rationally and irrationally every single hour of every single day. But I would say, try to change your mindset on body fat. Be honest with yourself. Want to recover. Want to gain fat. Want to be sane. Want to not suffer every single hour of every single day with hunger. I've done it once before. It was glorious for a time. Ultimately I didn't really deal with my inner demons, I just forced myself to recover.  &amp;#x200B;  I'm not going to stop trying. I have to divert my focus away from my appearance, away from my weight, and remind myself that it doesn't matter what I look like, and that worrying about my looks constantly is only going to make me want to compare myself to others more and gradually drive me insane. There is so much more to life than food or body fat. Those things don't define who we truly are nor limit who we can become. Failing to recover, however, is objectively of my greatest limitations, and one I impose on myself every day.",False,False
