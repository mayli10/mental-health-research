Restriction is not the only way to harm yourself with food.,False,False

I mean is it even a misconception anymore if so much of us do it? Yeah it sucks to deal with, but I just explain it's a mental illness, I can't control it, it's my own personal problem and I certainly support people loving themselves and having confidence at whatever weight they may be.",False,False

So I just ignore it as best I can. It's their own insecurity, and really has nothing to do with me.",False,False

Someone who used to be a good friend told me -- well, she didn't even have the guts to do that, and instead posted on an online forum we both belong to -- that my eating disorder and how I felt about \*me\* was making her feel bad, because she was larger.

I'm not hurting anyone else, so I honestly don't care if someone gets their feelings hurt because I'm trying to look a certain way.    I think the vanity aspect is a separate issue. Being labelled as fatphobic is more social justice-y (i.e. ""your body issues make other people feel bad about themselves, so what you're doing is morally wrong""), whereas being labelled as vain is more of a character defect (i.e. ""you're too preoccupied with your looks, so it makes you look shallow""). Obviously there's more to it than vanity; I personally don't think being super underweight looks good. I really don't like the look of ultra-slim thighs. I'm not attracted to super-thin women. Do I still want to be that super-thin woman? Sure do.   I know that people think I'm probably being vain but I don't care. People are misinformed about EDs in general, and besides, I can't control what others think of me. Even if I am vain, at least it's directed internally and not externally. Needless to say I don't lose any sleep over it.",False,False

I can't stand people that do that.

They see someone who they perceive as skinny talk about themselves as fat. That makes them think, well if he/she thinks they’re fat, then they must think I’m monster fat!
