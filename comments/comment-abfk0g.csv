I couldn’t be around my friends when they were getting bad because they had no idea about my experiences with it and I kept comparing myself to them. I ended up having to separate myself from one of my friends because of this, I hope you can figure out a way to help but if you can’t please put your mental health and stability first ❤️",False,False

I’m not really sure what works because I’ve found that nothing has really helped me, but just gently letting them know you’re there for them is a nice gesture ",False,False
