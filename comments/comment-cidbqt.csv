Most men realize that women in photos are not realistic. I'm a woman and sometimes I like looking at photos of hot women and I don't even consider myself bisexual or gay in the slightest.   I also love looking at pics of men that are all chiseled. Never in my life have I dated someone like that and I probably never will and I am perfectly ok with that. I love the body and mind of every man I've been in a relationship with. But I can also think Chris Hemsworth is a smoking pile of sexy.   How does your bf make you FEEL when you are with him? That's way more important.,False,False

Men are men. Doesn’t mean it’s bad. It’s literally like watching a movie for entertainment.",False,False

Porn is horribly toxic. Research has revealed very little, if any, positives from it. If OP can get over it, good on her, but I’d be *out* of there asap.",False,False

But I don't, so I'll add my own two-sided perspective. Maybe tw for lots of porn/body talk  First, Attraction in relationships is way more than porn types. So both me and my hubs are bi, and neither of us fit our porn types. I like watching bondage/rough porn so for that type the partner could a literal mr. potatohead animation or not present cause it's all about the fantasy of the action. I also like girl/girl stuff because I like looking at girls and it's easier to find stuff focused on what works for girls. If Mr. Octopus looked at my type he'd feel super insecure, but I've literally never been more attracted to anyone but him.   For him I know he like androgynous types of both physical sexes. Boyish girls and waify guys, ""traps"" (as in cross dressing in a cute fashion not transitioning, sorry if this is the wrong term but it's what he uses). I definitely have curves that can't be denied or hidden even at near underweight BMIs. It definitely took me a while to get over the fact that while he enjoys that fantasy (and many others) he's just as excited about my enormous T&amp;A and expresses plenty of genuine appreciation for them.  Similarly we both suffer from disordered eating. He's been badly underweight most of our relationship is only recently solidly in the healthy range. While this makes him insecure I'm just as excited to see him naked as I was 30lbs ago. And while I still equally like his physical appearance it's also more than that. His smell still intoxicates me, I still love the feel of his skin and the way his hair falls over his shoulder and the way he smiles when he kisses me. The way he looks at me still makes me blush. Oxytocin is a *hell* of a drug and it can make anyone else pale in comparison. I don't love him because he's hot, he's hot because I love him. It's not even like oh I like his personality so I'm okay with his looks,  it's that when you care about someone the combo of personality and looks makes them an automatic 20/10.   And he's the same way despite my regular weight swings, and I'm pretty sure most people are the same way. If you are with someone and especially if it's serious it's because you want them, lock stock and barrel and that makes them way better than any thing online.",False,False

I find a well-sculpted male body to be very beautiful, as a woman and as an artist.  My boyfriend does not have a perfect body, he has a nice one with some features that are better than others.  I find him highly attractive, more than I would if I just saw him on the street, because I know him.  I love who he is.  I love how he smells, I love how he thinks, he’s kind and sweet and kind of a pain in the ass sometimes but he’s a great dude.  I’ve seen much better bodies than his, but it’s about more than just that.  My boobs are not great, they’re on the small side and not my favorite feature at all, I’ve always been crazy self conscious of them.  I know he likes big, pretty boobs and I can’t blame him, I like boobs too.  But the one time when I was half asleep, something slipped out that indicated how I felt insecure about them?  He *burst* out with “Do you think I don’t like your titties??  Omg I LOVE your titties, don’t think that!!”  Eloquent.  But it clearly came from the heart.  Men look at porn because they’re visual and they like jerking off.  Women with that body type are overwhelmingly the stars.  It does not mean he doesn’t think your body is great.",False,False
