Directly 8 years indirectly 21 years. I don't think anyone says it to be nasty. They just find it hard to perceive how people with EDs see the world.   A good friend once asked me “how can you live your life so rigid, like its empty.” I replied “Lin when you started smoking did you enjoy it. Do you enjoy smoking. If you had to choose between food and smoking which one would it be.”  Everyone’s got there thing. They function around it. Live happy normal lives. Hiding bottles around the house, cigarettes in cupboards, gamble on their phones at work and family events &amp; put themselves in danger to feel like their alive.  I remember one day. I made a cup of tea for me and a colleague. We are kind of close, worked together for ten years. After I handed her the cup of tea. She gave me a chocolate bar. I just played with it, running it through my fingers. Then discreetly pushing into my pocket. I regifted it later that day. I am more aware of it now but I still have to work with it.   If I can give you any advice keep talking and keep writing and never be afraid to share.",False,False

I was mostly good, of course clothes shopping is a bit stressful because dysmorphia. The clothes look too small for me but then they fit perfect so... it’s hard to get my head around. She didn’t say it in a nasty way.   Kcal counting is normal for me unfortunately, it can get very tedious at times. Hope things start to go a bit better for you soon. I understand what you mean about strangers though for sure.",False,True

Had there been any triggers or anything else on your mind.      I had my niece’s birthday the Sunday just past, yesterday. All week my mind wasn’t my own. The usually thoughts racing, anxiety, distracted &amp; distant. Unfortunately to cope I started to KCAL count and began fasting again.      Being around people who know my history with ED’s is stressful for me. It seems to bring it all back up. It’s easier to be around strangers.  Strangers comments don’t really have the same resonance for me as family, friends &amp; neighbors.",False,False
