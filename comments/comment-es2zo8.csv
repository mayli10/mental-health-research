I think it is easier to be lazy and not give a diagnosis and then have to think about evidence based care for that diagnosis.   I also wondered if many people would say something like what you said: that the diagnosis can be self-reinforcing. I think it's obviously very important, if a diagnosis is given, to stress that this is a current diagnosis and that it will hoped change and that it should be a wake up call, not a life sentence. And I think referrals to a nutritionist and therapist are important.   Thanks for answering. Hopefully, I'll hear from a couple more people, too. It's helpful feedback.",False,True

On the flip side, there was also part of teenage-me that took my AN dx and wrapped it up with my identity and felt that now I was obligated to stay sick or else I’d be a liar.   Actually, the first thing that came to my mind was that my mental health diagnoses have influenced what insurance was willing to cover, my eligibility for protection under ADA, using FMLA, etc. So, there’s that legal/financial side of things too. I don’t know if that could have part of her decision...like, considerations of how things get logged and coded and any implications of that. (Avoiding more paperwork and implementing the standard of care for an ED patient? Maybe that’s too cynical of me.) I’m not in that world, just have dealt with lots of bills/paperwork as a patient.",False,False

I think people would rather be validated in their suffering; to know what they are dealing with. Thanks for your response.",False,True

I feel like my parents don’t really believe i have a disorder because the doctor never said i was anorexic. Kind of makes me feel like a fraud because i don’t have a word to name my condition.,False,False
