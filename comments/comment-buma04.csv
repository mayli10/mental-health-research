I definitely have fear foods I don't buy anymore (literally just nuts, full-fat ice cream, and cereal) because I'll just DESTROY THEM, but I don't really have any ""safe"" foods. Fruits/veg? Love them, but if I get full off them (literally probably about ~300 cal of grapes, blueberries, strawberries, salad, and/or apples), it'll trigger a binge.  I hate feeling full but I'm never really full anymore? Ugh it's a straight up awful binge cycle that has me up 13lbs from my LW. Still down 7lbs from my SW but that's a whole 20lbs loss I just threw away. It's depressing but it's so hard to stop.",False,False
