I have sorted feelings about this... that's quite disappointing. ,False,False

I wouldn’t either. Unfortunately though some people do buy into it, without having eating disorders. Sometimes it can lead to disordered eating and more sinister things. I don’t think they meant their podcast to offend, more to point out the offensive behind these thoughts. They could have handled it better, it sounds like they took it to an extreme. ",False,False

I’m not choosing to be a part of that cult... it’s the way my brain functions. People don’t generally “buy into” eating disorders or the thoughts that go along with them.,False,True

The things they expressed disturbed you because they SHOULD disturb you. They’re not saying these thoughts and beliefs are okay, they’re actually saying the opposite and trying to point out how harmful buying into this thought process can be.   It’s a rather extreme form of humor and I can see why people find it distasteful and offensive, but I think that’s also the point they were trying to make. Btw I don’t watch this and haven’t seen it, but it sounds like things I’ve seen before so I’m judging off of that. ",False,False

ONRAC makes food/body-oblivious comments pretty regularly, though.  It seems like the kind of April Fool's series that would not strike them as at all offensive.",False,False
