Supplements are your BFF and really focus on protein. Your hair is also like 3 or so months behind how you are fueling your body so give it time to adjust if you start trying anything to help,False,False

When y'all had hair loss, how much was it? Was it clumps? Hand fulls? Mine is just like 2-3x more than a couple weeks ago, but not clumps.    My personal life is a hot mess rn and my ED is reflecting it.   Lately I've been binge eating (not purging)/low restricting and still losing about 0.5-1.5 lbs a week, so my weekly average is still gotta be pretty high but low enough to lose. Could one still experience hair loss if they're oscillating high/low calories like that? It doesn't seem like it should be that way but I'm also binge eating absolute garbage food with no nutritional value.    I'm gonna try to eat more but I gotta get a handle on the binges. Shit is so rough rn though. If anyone has harm reduction advice please let me know. Outside of eating more and not binge eating... I already know that. I think I can get a handle on the binges if I stop being so self-absorbed/self-loathing and try being more social. That doesn't happen overnight but I'm working on it.",False,False
