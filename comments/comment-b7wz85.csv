I feel terrible wasting food but some foods I cannot tolerate without sauce, like McDonalds nuggets without sauce are literally not tasty enough to bring myself to eat and I always have to give them away or toss it. So disappointing and I've definitely cried a few times from the expectation of delicious food ruined and my hopes crushed lol.   If possible I won't leave a fastfood drive thru or takeout place without checking the bag there. My orders are just too consistently messed up. I won't even get McDonalds from ubereats anymore because they ALWAYS forget the sauce I ask for (whether it's the McDonalds or driver, who knows) and I've tried even begging in the special instructions to check the bag and they just won't take 5 seconds to do it and 4 times in a row I've gotten nuggets with no sauce I had to throw after a long wait and ask for a refund for. Hate getting my hopes up for food then being let down, it's a special kind of disappointment for people with EDs and normal people can't understand why it's so goddamn upsetting. Along the same lines if someone else is picking up for me and I'm not there to physically check the bag or watch them check it I won't order a sauce-dependent item. Though my luck sucks and my order ends up fucked up anyway like 80% of the time no matter how simple, non-modified and devoid of addons it may be. ",False,False
