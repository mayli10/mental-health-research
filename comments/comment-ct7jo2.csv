I’m so active on this sub because I literally have no one else to talk to about the fucked up shit going on in my head - my SO and mum both know about my ED but if they knew just how bad it is they’d freak out. So subs like these are my safe place, I don’t feel as alone, I feel like less of a fuck up waste of space because so many others are feeling the exact same way as me and I don’t judge them the way I judge myself. I would have an ED regardless of whether or not online discussions existed, stuff like this just keeps me from completely spiraling into self loathing.",False,False
