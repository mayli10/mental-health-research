Like, same thing with me, I had 1 coffee, 1 monster, and 3.5 liters of water. Still weighed the same at the end of the night as in the morning even after eating all day.",False,False

I just didn’t drink anymore before I went to bed a few minutes after that weigh in. Would that still cause me to retain? I finished drinking my fluids maybe two hours before that weigh in which is also why I thought I would show up heavier but didn’t",False,True

Usually I just go with the heaviest weight as my current weight to be safe but I really want yesterday’s weight to be real! I’m also trying to drop weight for a specific event too which makes it more stressful!  I have a wedding coming up that I’m attending and trying to lose weight for. One of the guests that will be at the wedding referred to me as “the fat chick” amongst my group of friends when he thought I couldn’t hear him last November and I haven’t seen him since then. I’ve lost 33 lbs and was hoping to lose another ten before the wedding in four weeks so I won’t be the “fat one” anymore. Maybe my body realizes how important this is to me and that’s why it’s doing this, since you know my body is The Enemy^TM afterall",False,True

Like at a certain point if you keep not drinking it goes away, but if you are drinking just a little each day or not at all just one day, you retain more water before losing any water weight",False,False

Weighed in 5 pounds lighter than 4 days earlier (although in the morning) and then b/p while still in a calorie deficit, had another calorie deficit (and have had for like 2 weeks, longest time I've gone without going over on cals) and still weighing in at the same, 6 pounds heavier than 3 days ago. fruIt's frustrating. I know its water weight and food weight. And I know I've lost since 3 days ago. But the scale wont show it and I'm trying to lose as much a a possible before my next therapy appointment!",False,False
