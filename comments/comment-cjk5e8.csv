Thank you so much for your thoughts. The speeding up thing was *both* poor planning and impatience, so that's not great. We were also hurrying down one night and I tripped and actually tore a ligament in my knee and he said, ""Are you okay?"" and I said ""Yes"" but apparently said it too ""snappy."" I don't know. It's hard when we're at such different skill levels.",False,True

It's good that you're being thoughtful about this. It makes a huge difference that your bf is experienced. I was just getting antsy imagining a guy with Bear Grylls delusions of ""I car camped once, I can totally do it bro"" (they exist, oh God do they exist). I will say that him telling you to speed up is somewhat concerning. People usually CAN'T speed up, and I'm sure he knows that. Were you trying to beat weather/nightfall, or was he just being impatient? I have to say neither is great. The former speaks to poor planning, and the latter to not being sensitive to your physical limitations. However, if you feel really comfortable with him and trust him, then for sure go ahead.   Like, the great thing about backpacking is that it will whip you into shape fast. I mean obviously if you feel like you're physically falling apart right now, I would not recommend you go. But if you feel reasonably capable, I bet you'll do fine. Just keep in mind that while the first day or two always sucks, there's ""this sucks!"" and then there's ""ohhh shit this...does not feel right....""  You need to be honest with yourself about what your body is telling you, and set aside any anxieties about ""oh no I'm ruining his trip"" and so on. (Like, this is where ""speed it up"" attitudes concern me...how assertive are you? Would you be comfortable telling him you guys NEED to turn around and cut the trip short?)   Also: if you go, stay hydrated!!",False,False

My only real mountaineering experience was hiking Mt. Washington in NH in winter a few times—strangely enough, the walking itself was difficult for me (my boyfriend kept asking me to speed up) but the scrambling/ice picking was much easier. I think I got a weird burst of adrenaline for that. And then I spent a few days being sore :)  As for backpacking, I did it much more when I was a teenager and, as I guess might be normal, was miserable at times during it but was overall happy with the experience at the end. Both trips had something hindering me—being sick in a foreign country in the first, very high altitude in the second.  My boyfriend says this route will be easy (no scrambling, etc.), but I worry. I am far from as physically fit as I was when I went to Mt. Washington, and even then I was too slow. I take short hikes sometimes. I have proper gear.  He's a very experienced backpacker and I want to impress him and do things with him that he loves. I worry that I will be tired/unhappy/disappointed in myself the whole time and that would cause rifts between us.  I'm sorry for the novel!",False,True

Glad to hear your dad has plenty of help. Definitely all the more reason to prioritize focusing on your own health issues for a bit. You can be supportive of others, but ideally it doesn’t come at the cost of sacrificing your own well-being.",False,False

However, I am an anorexic who is very aware of how that can affect safety in the wilderness. And it's unclear from your post whether you have mountaineering experience. So I'm gonna get practical, because medical distress in the backcountry can get dangerous (and expensive) very fast. I'm not throwing these questions at you like an interrogation, btw. These are just some things to consider before you agree to go, assuming you are new to this type of activity.  When you say physically weak, what does that mean? Are you at risk for cardiac problems or osteoporosis? Are you able to complete hikes? How much weight have you tried carrying before, and did you try going both up and downhill? (Downhill is way more dangerous, if you're weak and carrying weight.) Do you have boots that fit well and support your ankles? Does your pack fit, resting snugly on your hips?  Also, what is the route/country like - gentle entry, or steep inclines right away? What's the daily mileage? Is this on trails or will there be routefinding? Are you sensitive to altitude, and will you spend a night acclimating?  Most important of all, if you're not an experienced backpacker, how experienced is your boyfriend? Does he have reliable equipment? Basic first aid skills, and an ability to recognize more subtle medical problems (e.g., dehydration)? A handle on weather patterns in the area?   I really hope this doesn't sound discouraging! Going into the wilderness always sounds harder than it actually is, but people with eating disorders do need to take extra care. Like, the time to ponder these questions is now, not when you're out in the high country desperately trying to escape unexpected weather on a bad leg. You know?",False,False

Luckily my dad has lots of help (perhaps too much—he's a doctor himself and is getting every second opinion imaginable) but there's still the feeling that a *real* daughter would be more supportive. (And would = should, of course). I would love to be able to reach out to you again.",False,True

I really hope you find some comfort and stress relief.  I may not be the best equipped to help (being mired in mental health issues and frequently struggling with similar issues) but I hope I can help some.  My therapist says that ‘should’ statements are a cognitive distortion. Life is usually too complicated for the simplicity of ‘should’ statements to be valid. We often have to choose between multiple options that each have pros and cons. And we can make better decisions when we face reality as it is, not as we think it ‘should’ be.  Based on what you shared, it seems you’re weighing a lot of different choices to make in coming months. And you seem to always lean towards trying to make others happy (taking care of your dad, spending time/traveling with your boyfriend) because you think you ‘should’ because a good person would. I don’t think that’s necessarily true.  Taking care of yourself, prioritizing yourself is a good thing. Something that you seem to be neglecting. Your needs are important. Your mental health is important. Backpacking through Wyoming will always be an option later, but not if you push yourself when you don’t feel physically or mentally strong enough for the trip and end up hurting yourself trying to please others.  I also really hope you consider looking into other options to get your dad assistance if he still needs it. It is nice to be able to help family, but not if the stress is to the point you can barely handle it. Maybe some other family members can step up? Or maybe there are insurance covered options for some home nurse visits? My mother has serious health issues and I struggled for too long trying to be a ‘good daughter’ take care of her alone. So I understand the pressure but, seriously, getting outside help made a huge difference in my quality of life and I don’t regret it, even if some people might judge me for it.  It really sounds like getting into CBT should be a high priority. I really hope you find some relief.  I’d definitely be happy to talk more if it would help, wishing you the best!",False,False
