My family buys Cool Brew (it's in grocery stores in New Orleans, not sure about elsewhere but it's def on Amazon) and my dad and I don't add water to it. I'll mix several shots of the concentrate with whatever milk (usually skim or almond but I'll do 2% if it's my whole breakfast) and lots of ice. It is so, so good, a whole other world compared to normal iced coffee IMO. Even with a low-cal creamer it tastes kind of rich because of how strong it is. I didn't even know you were supposed to water cold brew concentrate until I went to college and my friend saw me mixing my iced coffee.  My dunkin order is a large iced coffee with skim milk, 140 calories. It's huge and even with skim milk it's kinda creamy, lots of caffeine. A favorite :')",False,False
