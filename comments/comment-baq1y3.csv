If you've been working out with anatomical adaptation specs (3 sets of 8-12 reps per exercise, at \~60% of your 1 rep max) for some months and have seen results, probably not.   If you haven't seen results, you're likely not training right and/or restricting too hard. But the good news is, this means you can fix your workout program and then recomp. To build a good workout, I'd recommend you consult with a personal trainer. Many will just do one-offs to get you started, and you don't have to purchase a whole bunch of sessions with them. Personally, I like to consult with one once every few months. Mainly for reassurance that I'm not gonna throw my back out.",False,False
