I tried it out before going to the doc last time so I would know how much I'd weigh there with my clothes/shoes on and it was like 2.5 lbs,False,False

I just explained to my host family that I’m a “fitness nut” and that I’d like a scale to track gains for lifting (they know that I exercise a lot).,False,False

Weigh in the morning before pee, after pee, weigh after any food, after bm, weigh before bed. Sometimes I get out of bed in the middle of the night to weigh again. It's an obsession and it's controlling my life and if you can help it, don't buy one. It's just all downhill from there. Also, if you do buy one, I feel you on that. I straight up wanted this.",False,False

If I can play devil's advocate for a min, I'll just mention the mentally draining aspect of owning a scale. The whole weighing yourself every day / multiple times per day thing. The number on the scale has the power to control your mood and alter the entire trajectory of your day. So while it does calm the anxiety of the unknown number, it causes so much additional anxiety that I'm not even sure is worth it.  I've purchased and thrown out so many scales over the years, I think this is the healthiest conclusion I've come to about them.",False,False
