We had to do this in middle school P.E., and it was so traumatic. I was freaking out the whole week and had a panic attack on the day of. To make it even worse, the teacher had a student taking the measurements, and she was yelling people's weights really loudly.  And THEN, the district also sent a postcard to my house with something like YOUR CHILD'S BMI IS UNDERWEIGHT. SEE DOCTOR FOR ADVICE stamped across it. Which made me freak out. (But my parents ignored it, just like everything else about my ED. ""Hooray"".)  Still, bad as that was, I can't even imagine the humiliation of being overweight for this process. Your parents getting a postcard that says YOUR CHILD IS OBESE? God, who comes up with this shit?!?",False,False

I remember every second of it, cause it was the first time anyone ever told me my weight. I remember the teacher saying she didn't expect the number to be so high, i remember that I didn't expect it to be so high either, I remember feeling too heavy. That number is engraved on my mind forever. It was 9th grade and now at 27 my brain is still obsessed with staying as far below that number as possible.
