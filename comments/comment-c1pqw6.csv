Tums especially makes me feel like I'm ""padding"" my stomach for the coffee.   Ditto on the cold brew and adding almond milk tips, and I'd add if you can swap out energy drinks or caffeinated iced teas for coffee sometimes, I find them much less hard on my stomach.",False,False

But if you drink more than 4 cups , you really do want to eat something small. I've almost blacked out a few times when I live on only coffee.  Stay safe!",False,False
