Which is kind of an official sounding way of putting it but it works and it's not legal for interviewers to pry anyway. Not really the same situation as youre in but I think most people get the hit that it might be something touchy you'd rather not dwell on it or talk about if you just say something along the lines of 'medical issues, I'll be gone a while but hopefully I'll be fixed right up and back good as new :)' you feel?",False,False

It's not a contest over there to see who's the worst one off out of the rest, you're going there to heal right? And secondly for the coworker? It depends if you're super close and trust them then disclosing the truth is an option, if not so much then a simple and vague lie like family troubles or something would work, believable yet don't go too much into detail or it'll spiral out lol",False,False
