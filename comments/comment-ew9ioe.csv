Asking what the “prettiest” BMI might make someone of higher BMI uncomfortable or cause “oh someone thinks xyz BMI is prettiest? But I’m not xyz BMI so I’m not pretty.” I’m interested in knowing what people think too but please take in consideration that some people might be uncomfortable with it.",False,False

When im lifting heavy eating right in a good pace mentally my bmi could be ""high"" but my bf% is crazy low. But I have such a nice butt and my legs are so shapely (finally) I look healthy strong sexy. I feel good, accomplished like I can conquer the world.  When my ed was overcompensating for my mental health issues I was obsessive about celebrity bmi. And wanted to be in underweight category. I don't weigh myself anymore just for this reason. I've had a really rough patch lately and can tell physically/mentally I'm struggling just by my clothing and my drs comments. I noticed myself recently wondering about my weight/bmi. I know so much better than that logically just from my career and education so I must be getting really obsessive again if the thoughts are coming back. I'm glad you posted this really made me reflect on how my mind has been playing tricks on me lately. Thanks",False,False
