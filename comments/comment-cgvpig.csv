I went through this same thing not eating pizza my favorite food ever for months and months and it scared the shit out of me. I was finally forced into going out to eat at a local pizza restaurant that my family went to my whole childhood and it was so scary. Taking the first bite nothing but the thoughts of calories, how i‚Äôm just gonna drink water to make myself full between bites etc filled my head. But I  enjoyed the pizza and thought to myself while eating it this is really good. And then i went home with my family, feeling more alive than i ever had during restriction and woke up the next day being fine. I love you since you love pasta you should be able to eat it stay safe god bless you!",False,False

I‚Äôve got a lot of fave fear foods. Maybe try prepackaged portions like the kids chef boyardee (under 200 cals) or frozen tv pasta dinners (smart ones angel hair linguini is 200 cals and tj mac is super low cal). With fresh pasta you can put .5-1 serving and the rest veggies and be about 300 for a huge serving. Or as a cheat meal. Eat 50 cals less per day and put that towards a huge bowl of pasta at the end of the week.,False,False
