Clinicians should measure weight and height as well as ask about them because the patient’s self-report is often unreliable. Body mass index ([calculator 1](https://www.uptodate.com/contents/calculator-body-mass-index-bmi-quetelets-index-in-adults?search=anorexia+nervosa&amp;topicRef=14704&amp;source=see_link)) should then be determined for comparison to population norms.  •Recent weight changes, lifetime highest and lowest weights at adult height, stability of weight over time, and history of efforts to control weight and shape. A chronology should be established to determine whether current symptoms are acute or chronic.  ●Frequency of self-weighing.  ●Meal pattern.  •Estimate typical daily caloric and nutrient (carbohydrates, fat, and protein) intake from both foods and beverage, and assess pattern of consumption, including times, amounts, and context.  ●Present and past eating disorder symptoms.  •Dietary restriction  •Attitudes about food, eating, body weight, and shape (including fear of becoming fat and resistance to gaining weight)  •Binge eating  •Compensatory behaviors such as purging (self-induced vomiting or misuse of laxatives, diuretics, or enemas), fasting, and exercise  •Ritualistic eating behaviors (eg, cutting food into extremely small pieces or refusing to mix different types or colors of food on the plate)  ●Fear of gaining weight or becoming fat.   ●Self-evaluation, self-esteem, and perception of body weight and shape.  ●Menstrual status.  •Last menstrual period   •Regularity and extent of menses  •Weight at which spontaneous menses occur  ●Prescription medications.  •Oral contraceptives can produce withdrawal bleeding that simulates menstrual periods  •Emetics may be used to stimulate purging  ●Suicidality – Anorexia nervosa may be accompanied by suicidality, including suicidal ideation, action to prepare for an attempt, and nonfatal attempt or self-harm. Patients with suicidality should be seen more frequently and perhaps hospitalized, depending upon the estimated level of risk ([table 4](https://www.uptodate.com/contents/image?imageKey=PC%2F73092&amp;topicKey=PSYCH%2F14704&amp;search=anorexia+nervosa&amp;source=see_link)) \[[9,53,60](https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anorexia-nervosa-in-adults-clinical-features-course-of-illness-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/9,53,60)\]. A specific suicide plan of high lethality or intent indicates the need for hospitalization. Risk factors, evaluation, and management of suicidality are discussed separately. (See [""Suicidal ideation and behavior in adults""](https://www.uptodate.com/contents/suicidal-ideation-and-behavior-in-adults?search=anorexia+nervosa&amp;topicRef=14704&amp;source=see_link).)  ●Comorbid disorders, such as anxiety, mood, impulse control, substance use (nicotine, caffeine, cocaine, and stimulants may be used to curb appetite), and personality disorders.  ●Psychosocial functioning.  ●Prior treatment.  •Psychotherapy  •Pharmacotherapy  •Self-help groups    ●Family history of eating disorders and other psychopathology.   In discussing onset of anorexia nervosa, the clinician should ask about interpersonal problems at that time \[[9](https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anorexia-nervosa-in-adults-clinical-features-course-of-illness-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/9)\]. It is worth noting that family members should not be blamed for causing the illness because there is no evidence that families cause eating disorders; however, there are families who are not supportive and who may contribute to problems with self-esteem and body image.  As part of the mental status examination, the clinician should note behavioral restlessness or fidgeting. Impaired attention, concentration, and thought process can indicate cognitive impairment, including delirium related to medical complications of low weight and/or purging. Anxious or depressed affect should be assessed. Insight and judgment can be evaluated by asking about the patient’s target weight and treatment-seeking behaviors.   Medical complications of anorexia nervosa that can be found on history and physical examination are discussed separately. (See [""Anorexia nervosa in adults: Evaluation for medical complications and criteria for hospitalization to manage these complications"", section on 'Medical evaluation'](https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anorexia-nervosa-in-adults-evaluation-for-medical-complications-and-criteria-for-hospitalization-to-manage-these-complications?sectionName=MEDICAL+EVALUATION&amp;search=anorexia+nervosa&amp;topicRef=14704&amp;anchor=H86793536&amp;source=see_link#H86793536).)  **Structured instruments** — Structured, interviewer-administered instruments are available for diagnosing anorexia nervosa and other eating disorders, but are seldom used in routine clinical practice. These structured instruments are discussed separately. (See [""Bulimia nervosa in adults: Clinical features, course of illness, assessment, and diagnosis"", section on 'Structured instruments'](https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bulimia-nervosa-in-adults-clinical-features-course-of-illness-assessment-and-diagnosis?sectionName=Structured+instruments&amp;search=anorexia+nervosa&amp;topicRef=14704&amp;anchor=H191479834&amp;source=see_link#H191479834).)  **Measurement-based care** — We suggest that at each visit, clinicians weigh the patient wearing as little clothing as appropriate (eg, hospital gown) and after voiding. Clinicians should also ask about daily caloric intake, the number of hours spent exercising and walking each day, and the number of binge-eating and purging episodes that occurred each week since the last visit. Measurement-based care can help identify nonresponders and detect residual symptoms. Symptomatic change over time can also be assessed with self-report measures \[[61](https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anorexia-nervosa-in-adults-clinical-features-course-of-illness-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/61)\], such as the 36-item Eating Disorder Examination Questionnaire (EDE-Q) \[[62,63](https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anorexia-nervosa-in-adults-clinical-features-course-of-illness-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/62,63)\].",False,False

A low body weight is defined as a body mass index (ratio of weight in kg divided by height in m2) &lt;18.5 ([calculator 1](https://www.uptodate.com/contents/calculator-body-mass-index-bmi-quetelets-index-in-adults?search=anorexia+nervosa&amp;topicRef=14705&amp;source=see_link)).   ●Intense fear of gaining weight or becoming fat, or persistent behavior that prevents weight gain, despite being underweight.  ●Distorted perception of body weight and shape, undue influence of weight and shape on self-worth, or denial of the medical seriousness of one’s low body weight.  There are two subtypes of anorexia nervosa, based upon symptoms during the past three months \[[5](https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anorexia-nervosa-in-adults-and-adolescents-medical-complications-and-their-management/abstract/5)\]:   ●Restricting – Marked by weight loss through dieting, fasting, and excessive exercise. In addition, the patient has not engaged in recurrent episodes of binge eating (eating an amount of food that is definitely larger than most people would eat under similar circumstances) or purging (self-induced vomiting and misuse of laxatives, diuretics, or enemas).  ●Binge eating and purging – Marked by episodes of binge eating and purging.  This topic reviews the medical complications of the restricting type of anorexia nervosa. Complications due to bingeing and purging are discussed separately within the context of the medical complications that occur in patients with bulimia nervosa and binge eating disorder. (See [""Bulimia nervosa and binge eating disorder in adults: Medical complications and their management""](https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bulimia-nervosa-and-binge-eating-disorder-in-adults-medical-complications-and-their-management?search=anorexia+nervosa&amp;topicRef=14705&amp;source=see_link).)  The clinical features and diagnosis of anorexia nervosa are discussed separately. (See [""Anorexia nervosa in adults: Clinical features, course of illness, assessment, and diagnosis""](https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anorexia-nervosa-in-adults-clinical-features-course-of-illness-assessment-and-diagnosis?search=anorexia+nervosa&amp;topicRef=14705&amp;source=see_link).)  &amp;#x200B;  **Anorexia nervosa in adults: Clinical features, course of illness, assessment, and diagnosis**  **CLINICAL FEATURES**  **Core features** — The essential clinical features of anorexia nervosa are \[[1,3](https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anorexia-nervosa-in-adults-clinical-features-course-of-illness-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/1,3)\]:  ●Persistent restriction of energy intake that leads to an abnormally low body weight  ●Intense fear of gaining weight or becoming fat, or persistent behavior that prevents weight gain  ●Distorted perception and/or importance of body weight and shape  **Associated features** — Anorexia nervosa is associated with other psychological and behavioral signs and symptoms, including \[[1-4](https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anorexia-nervosa-in-adults-clinical-features-course-of-illness-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/1-4)\]:  ●Relentless pursuit of thinness  ●Obsessional preoccupation with food (eg, collecting recipes or hoarding food)  ●Fear of certain foods   ●Restricted repertoire of foods  ●Preference for low calorie foods (low energy density)  ●Overestimating number of calories consumed  ●Overusing condiments and/or artificially sweetened products  ●Food-related rituals (eg, cutting food into small pieces or refusing to mix different types or colors of food on the plate)  ●Concerns about eating in public  ●Social withdrawal  ●Exercise-related rituals (eg, walking or running a set distance each day; swimming a specified number of laps in a pool)  ●Restlessness or hyperactivity  ●Limited insight into or denial of core clinical features  ●Resistance to treatment and weight gain  ●Inhibited expression and dysregulation of emotions  ●Feelings of ineffectiveness  ●Poor sleep  ●Low libido  ●Dysphoria (eg, depressed or anxious mood)  ●Inflexible thinking  ●Perfectionism  ●Need to control one’s environment  ●Behavioral rigidity (eg, purchasing food only in certain stores or from certain salespeople, inability to accommodate to changes in schedule or environment)  Some of these features can persist in weight-restored patients with anorexia nervosa, reflecting either problems that predated onset of the eating disorder or long-term “scars” caused by starvation.  In addition, neuropsychological function appears to be impaired in anorexia nervosa. A study compared patients with anorexia nervosa (n = 40) with healthy controls (n = 40) who were matched for sex and were comparable in age and education; patients were nutritionally and medically stable, but many had comorbid illnesses (eg, depression) \[[5](https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anorexia-nervosa-in-adults-clinical-features-course-of-illness-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/5)\]. Cognitive functioning was worse in patients than controls in multiple domains (eg, executive functioning \[planning, decision making, and response inhibition\], visuospatial ability, and motor function).  One aspect of neurocognitive functioning is decision making, which is also impaired in patients who are actively ill with anorexia nervosa. A meta-analysis of 16 studies assessed decision making in symptomatic patients (n = 507) and healthy controls (n = 633), using the Iowa Gambling Test (which measures the ability to make advantageous and disadvantageous choices) \[[6](https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anorexia-nervosa-in-adults-clinical-features-course-of-illness-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/6)\]. Decision making was moderately to substantially worse in symptomatic patients, and the effect was independent of the lower body mass index and increased depressive symptoms observed in patients. By contrast, decision making in patients who had recovered from anorexia nervosa and in healthy controls was comparable.      Anorexia nervosa is often accompanied by comorbid psychopathology and general medical disorders, as well as suicidality.

Significantly low weight is defined as a weight that is less than minimally normal or, for children and adolescents, less than that minimally expected.  Significantly low body weight is ill-defined, and you’ll see various figures used depending on age of patient, gender, history, etc. 85% of IBW is common for adults, but it can also be &lt;5th percentile for children, &lt;18.5BMI, &lt;17.5BMI, or a host of other things. Studies are inconsistent and diagnosis tends to be a “I know it when I see it”; someone who has all the cognitive distortions and anxieties and is on a trajectory to reach a low weight is suffering the same illness as someone who has been in it for longer and is already there.

Before 2013 an anorexia diagnosis also required loss of period too even though some people who menstruate never experience amenorrhea no matter their weight. It wasn’t until somewhat recently we started seeing more people report the same symptoms of AN at higher body weights, which is now known as atypical anorexia. The DSM isn’t revised that often and is always behind what’s currently happening in the field because of it. The best explanation I have for the weight criteria and the weight classifications for severity in AN is that the BMI severity is medically important for doctors being able to gauge more of the physical risks of being underweight. Unfortunately, these are also the criteria we have to use in the field of psychology and weight definitely does not determine the severity of the mental illness (not to mention health risks of AN exist at higher BMIs as well). Current research is showing that atypical anorexia is about 10x as common as AN so hopefully the next DSM will remove the weight requirement. There’s no telling when it will come out though, it was 20 years after DSM IV until V came out in 2013.   EDs are complicated because they are both mental and physical illnesses",False,False
