At that 2015 appointment, my doctor told me I had the “symptoms of AN” and sent me to get outpatient treatment with a dietician, mental therapist, and medical doctor at an ED center in my city for a few years.   I felt like a fraud because I didn’t think I had anything diagnosed. I still had the symptoms of course, I guess I didn’t give a shit and didn’t bother to read my papers.  I think if I had gone to treatment knowing that I had an clinical disorder to treat, I would have approached it more proactively rather than feeling like a fraud and half-assing it.   Diagnoses aren’t always essential, but I think it helps with finding the right resources and the psychological drive to help combat the issue.",False,False

I knew I had an eating disorder. I wasn't surprised at all. It was very clear in my mind- if you starve yourself everyday in between binging and purging you have an eating disorder. I was proud though anyhow. Stupid, I know, but hey, I was 14 and deeply engulfed in pro-ana culture. ",False,False

To be fair, I was still a healthy weight at the time and had previously been legitimately overweight my whole life. Turns out she was right. I should have taken it more seriously. ",False,False
