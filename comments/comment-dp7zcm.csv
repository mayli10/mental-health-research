Like logically I know they're still skinny. They don't look fat either, just... normal.   I'm not looking forward to gaining  because I know every ounce basically is fat and I'm going to just see a whale when I used to kind of like my body at a certain size.   Ofc if it helps my brain function better then it's worth it",False,True

Like I think I'm about my sisters size, but my mom broke down when she saw how much weight I've lost. My treatment team keeps pushing a higher level if care and I'm just like, uh, it doesn't look that bad.",False,True

People constantly tell me how thin I am (ugh no not yet) and I have skinny ass limbs, am freezing cold all the time but when I look in the mirror it still looks to me like I'm smuggling a watermelon under my belly skin. Maybe I just got so used to being massive after all those years that my brain doesn't let me see anything else even tho I'm close to UW :')",False,False
