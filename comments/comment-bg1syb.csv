No matter what the comment is, I think it’s super inappropriate to comment on someone’s body. Even the nicest comment is so awkward — like, you either have to return the compliment or dismiss it in some way. How about we all agree to keep our comments to ourselves? Deal? DEAL. (And sorry that comment dug a canyon in your mind. If it helps, you’re perfect as you are, you know.)",False,False

She has no accent. She's very observant, though, and always notices when I change my appearance. I wore circle lenses once and she noticed right away when it took everybody else forever.",False,True

She didn't say it as an insult, either. More like a statement. ""You got thick."" It was like a slap in the face. I wish I could take it as a compliment, too, but how can I when being thick is so absolutely not how I want to be?  I am probably being overly sensitive. I'm *definitely* being overly sensitive but fuck if it isn't enough to ruin the entire day.    On the plus side- it's completely killed any desire I have to eat today.",False,True

As out of place as it may have been, I'm willing to bet it was intended as a compliment. Either way, fuck that shit. Hope you're feeling better.",False,False
