It sucks so much that when we just want to be ‘normal’ for a day our bodies punish us, like what the hell im trying to actually take care of you for once?!? Two years ago I spent Halloween the exact same way.    I hope you were able to go out and have fun on another night to celebrate ❤️",False,True

I love how much this community looks out for each other 😭❤️     I looked it up, and I’m 99% certain it’s due to the iron supplements I’ve been taking. Looking back (and again, TMI!!) black poop has always sort of started whenever I get back on iron pills, so I feel confident that they’re the cause.",False,True

When I’m fasting I always keep bars on me as an easy “just in case” if I’m feeling like I’ll pass out, or don’t feel like I’m clear-headed enough to drive.    This is bad, but I’m not sure I’ve ever actually intentionally ended a fast, it’s always been “just go until you feel like you may actually die”. If I’m at home when I hit that point I go for something safe, if it happens while I’m out and about it’s almost always some kind of bar :(.",False,True

I don’t want to worry you for no reason because it’s most likely nothing but just in case!! I hope you’re feeling better ,False,False

The fasting sub has some good info on how to end longer fasts (or just like... google) and I'd recommend it so you don't injure yourself or get stuck in a situation like this in the future. I know it's suuuper unpleasant. Please try to be safe and take care of yourself as best you can.",False,False

EDs are so dainty and glamorous! ",False,False
