Dude's a head taller than me, and I wouldn't be surprised if I outweigh him. How he was standing, I'm unsure. He hugged me, and I was afraid I'd break him.   I thought, shit, I absolutely can't end up like that.   But then, I've also seen people who were as strict as I am, and burned out, and got moderately overweight. They're clearly depressed about it and obviously not in a good relationship with food.   I don't want to end up like that, either. :p ",False,False
