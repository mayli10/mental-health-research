I'm assuming you've maintained, so set a Calorie goal based on that average. That way you have a more sustainable diet as opposed to something unsustainably restrictive that ultimately breaks you down and makes you binge. Also, it being the holidays might be holding you back - I know it hold's me back - so you might be better off waiting it out, but please don't let yourself lose control. I know you want a crash diet and quick results. But steady sustainable weight loss is more likely to stay off. And if a crash diet just makes you bounce back anyway, what's the point?  Sorry if this violates rule 1, but I truthfully believe this is just generic, non-fad-diet, healthy, weight loss advice.",False,False

I spent the past 3 months gaining and losing the same 5 lbs. I had to finally tell myself that if I'm going to stick to losing the weight I just have to deal with it. I'm completely scared of gaining all the weight back. My body is a pice of crap that seems to store everything I eat into fat. I'm literally 10lbs away from going from obese to overweight if I could just fucking stick to eating less! ðŸ˜«,False,False
