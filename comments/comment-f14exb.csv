No one wants to feel awkward, so I'm sure they act like it's no big deal. They may apologize once, but more likely they'll never mention it again and after you see each other a few times, the awkwardness will be gone. Just act casual!!!",False,False

I still replay in my mind embarrassing things that happened to me 10 years ago! But try to remember that most other people don't do this.

After all, they should have knocked and waited before walking in. That person is probably feeling badly for making you uncomfortable, and the instant embarrassment on their part probably means they didn't even notice what you looked like naked. Seriously, I once walked in on my friends dad on the toilet, and I couldn't tell you what he looked like, only that I felt so stupid! Try not to obsess about this past today. Just laugh it off if they apologize again and try to move on.",False,False
