My sister told me that she’s going to try and lose weight by counting calories and I’m really afraid that I’m going to relapse into ed habits after being pretty good about not engaging in them. It’s so dumb and yet my brain acts as if someone else losing weight is an attack on me personally lol,False,False

Before I unfriended her, she had lost 150 lbs. I unfriended her because I could not deal with someone who lost that much weight.  I want to lose that much weight (of course I would die if I did that, but ah)!",False,False

Last December I introduced calorie counting and CICO to my older sister and I fucking regret that. She’s now losing weight and looking much better and yet here I am feeling enormously fat. After work she heads to the gym and my head is like “why aren’t you exercising?” “You’re going to be the fat one”. It feels like such an unhealthy competition. And fuck, my mum most likely has an ED, she has stopped eating dinners because she wants to lose weight. And asks me up front about diet pills and I’m all I don’t know. Fuck I’m rambling now. All I can say is that I want everyone to stop talking to me about losing weight too. Even accidentally I get triggered and I know I need to learn to live in a world and be comfortable with it. But right now? No. It’s spring and I’m not ready ",False,False
