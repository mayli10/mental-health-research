Stop belittling your feelings. Imagine how fragile males’ egos are, and if you said “look how tall that guy is, or how big his package is, etc”",False,False

I prefaced it with ""This is gonna sound dumb but..."" he was very understanding about the whole thing though he did find it silly. I don't blame him. For someone in a regular mental state it seems like a weird thing to be upset by. Nevertheless, I feel better.",False,True
