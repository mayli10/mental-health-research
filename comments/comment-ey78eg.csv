When I had a BMI in the 15’s, I thought I looked so awful. I’ve since been trying to recover and I now have a BMI in the low 18’s and I literally can’t tell the difference between photos of me at my lowest weight and recent pictures. I look the same. All that effort for nothing, amiright",False,False

Loving yourself unconditionally is fucking hard. I kinda chuckle inwardly when beautiful people talk about everyone having SOMETHING they don’t like about themselves and how you just need to love yourself anyway cause it’s like, of course you can love yourself mirrors are probably friends to you??  EDs just take away your ability to see beauty in your appearance. It’s not that you’re *not* beautiful, it’s that no matter what you can’t seem to see it. I’m really sorry you’re going through this. Hopefully in time you’ll grow more accustomed to how you look and it will feel normal?   Personally I like to tell myself I’m beautiful even if I don’t believe it (like, at all). Sometimes it’s nice to be nice to yourself.",False,False
