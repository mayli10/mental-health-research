What you have to do is remind yourself internally that you have just as much right as anyone else to eat and enjoy your food. If they're allowed to eat without judgment, then so are you. Try not to lower your eyes and shrink into yourself and pretend to be invisible for the duration of the meal. Sit up straight and make eye contact and take a big, unapologetic bite out of whatever it is you're eating. If it helps (assuming it's applicable), remind yourself that you're thinner than whoever is judging you, therefore it doesn't matter if they're picking away at a salad and trying to look dainty... you can afford to eat whatever you want.
