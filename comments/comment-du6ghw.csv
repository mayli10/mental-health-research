Now I’m just obsessively fixated on learning French which is great but I know once I go back to my normal life it’ll all go back to how it was before. Just the way my brain works I guess :/. It’s also crazy how insidious this illness is because I superficially have relaxed a lot of my rigidity but in reality I’m not gaining any weight and know I’m still almost mechanically cutting corners and doing sneaky things here and there. Crazy.,False,False

Also i would play with beatles, play chase with flies, planting seeds, watering trees or making water spots for birds to drink from.   The outdoors is bomb-ass idea, hell yeah get into that park with a flaming passion of exploration, like the soul of Roald Amundsen reaching the south pole. You go gon’ get it, bucko!",False,False
