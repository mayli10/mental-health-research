Also, if you engage in eating disorder behaviors, like binging, purging (which can be vomiting, restriction after an ""off limits"" food, exercise, laxative use, diuretic use...), or extreme restriction, even if your mind isn't occupied with food/exercise/body image, you are likely to have an eating disorder.  There's really two types of anorexia, ""typical"" and ""atypical."" It's kind of arbitrary, but anorexia nervosa has, as a diagnostic criteria, that the person be under a certain percentage from their ideal body weight, but also might be diagnosed when someone has lost a significant amount of weight in a short period of time due to extreme restriction. Atypical anorexia is a subcategory of unspecified eating disorders which has the restriction and the ""anorexia mindset"" without as significant weight loss or a significantly low body weight. That being said, you can experience serious medical side effects from eating disorder behaviors regardless of what your weight is, so whether you meet the diagnostic criteria of anorexia nervosa or of a different eating disorder, you are still at risk of medical consequences, and it doesn't mean that the eating disorder is any more or less severe.",False,False
