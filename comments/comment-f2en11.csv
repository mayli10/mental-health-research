As soon as it was under control my urges to restrict were so minimal that it was extremely easy to overcome them. Vyvanse can be a lifesaver but it's not for people with serious restriction problems at all. It's for people with BED. Some people binge as a reaction to restricting all the time because their bodies are starving and need food so bad and that's not BED. Some people restrict as a way to offset their binges because the binging is so out of control.   Any doctor prescribing a drug for binging should really do a lot of digging into their patients behaviors before prescribing a drug like this for the exact reason you mentioned. I was actually surprised how much I *didn't* have a restrictive ED when I started vyvanse because once I was free of the compulsion to binge all the time, I found myself wanting to feed my body in the right way and not wanting to restrict at all even though sometimes its difficult to eat. I never used to eat breakfast. Now I physically can't eat in the mornings when it hits so I make a smoothie every morning instead of skipping breakfast which would be so easy. It cured like all of my disordered behavior.  Sorry if this is coming off some type of way toward you specifically, I just have strong feelings about this lol. I only had one doc who would prescribe it to me for BED. I ended up finding out I had ADHD that way because it helped me in a lot of other ways too so I thought I should be tested for that, and now I'm only able to keep getting it because I have ADHD. It can be really dangerous for people without BED who just binge *sometimes* but also have strong restrictive tendencies but if you primarily have BED, like I can't even say how much it helped me.",False,False

You can't ignore science though, our bodies need nutrition and have hunger regulating chemicals. I think recovery is possible and if you believe in yourself enough it's achievable, but the way you go about it is different for each individual.

In the past half year ive committed to recovery in which i allow myself to eat what i want while still focusing on trying to eat healthily, and the most major thing is ive also stopped counting calories. In the first few months i definitely did struggle with binge eating episodes quite a lott and quickly gained at extra 20lbs more then i am comfortable with, but i still kept at it and just everyday after the binge episodes i focused on trying to go back to eating the foods that make my body feel healthy and good.  Sowly the weight gain stalled, and in the past two months i havnt gained any weight and even seem to have gone back down a few lbs, and the binge eating episodes happen less and less, i havnt had a binge in weeks now.
