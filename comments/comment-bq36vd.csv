Like we have evolved to eat but sometimes our higher minds crave the control of a super restricted diet over our instincts and impulses.,False,False

Since they can control how their body looks like? Body dysmorphia could make you do weird things. Maybe some people were shamed about their body even if they were thin, to begin with. But just goes to show that we humans often go against our survival instinct. And in the end EDs are mental disorders, sometimes there is not easy to explain.",False,False

We no longer have to walk hours a day to hunt animals. Instead, most of us here can easiky access high fat high sugar foods which we've all evolved to seek out and find addictive.   ED symptoms like binging as a response to restriction is exactly​ what we have evolved to do in order to survive cycles of feast and famine.  There is also a theory that anorexia comes from a migration response in that if you need to eat and digest food, its hard to migrate or escape from predators so you become too afraid to eat.",False,False

This applies to all kinds of illnesses, from depression to Parkinson's. While EDs can strike very young and be fatal, enough people live long enough to pass on the genes that they're still around.",False,False

Our mind wants one thing and we have to mentally fight with the body nature has designed over however thousands of years.,False,False

It is the same as our survival instinct - we have to try and fight to not die, but here we are some people who want to die. We try to not get ourselves, but here we are hurting ourselves because we are upset.",False,False

Correlation does not equal causation though.",False,False
