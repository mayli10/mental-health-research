Hooray for artificial sweeteners. They‚Äôre really similar beverages, though they do use slightly different ingredients. Diet coke uses only aspartame to sweeten it. Whereas Coke Zero Sugar (rebranded from Coke Zero) uses both aspartame and acesulfame potassium as sweeteners. So the flavor profiles might be a wee bit different, but both are zero calorie sweeteners.  As a zero calorie beverage, any weight effect would have to be indirect. (Eg. some people say diet sodas lead them to feel more hungry) You can also go down a google rabbit hole about the effect of artificial sweeteners on insulin response, etc. but doing that has only served to increase my bamboozlement. And honestly I was never going to stop drinking my Coke Zero anyhow so not sure why I bothered.  Tl;dr - enjoy the (diet) Coke (zero)",False,False

So one day, just for shits and giggles, I decided to track my blood sugar levels (with a home testing kit) over the course of 6 hours, with 2 hourly results recorded before I drank any diet coke, 2 hourly results while I drank it (cause I'm slow af at finishing drinks lol), and 2 final glucose results after I finished the soda in the previous 2 hour increment. At the end I noticed that my blood sugar stayed in the same normal range (with identical numbers weirdly enough) the entire time, so that most likely means that nothing in the coke artificial sweeteners caused my blood sugar to spike (which would stimulate insulin production, which causes weight gain).  But of course that was just me goofing around around with a home glucose test kit lol",False,False
