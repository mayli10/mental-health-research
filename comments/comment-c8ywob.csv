My plans for tomorrow are realistically probably sleep through the day, since I don't think I'll be getting any tonight. I'm excited to be visiting home soon though, where there are 3 cats who I love. I've been considering trying to find somewhere where I can visit cats waiting to be adopted and just pet them. Hugging cats is like having stress dissipate into thin air lol.  I'm sorry you're going through this :( take care of yourself &lt;3",False,False

One little dog called Tessa and one little cat called Bella. Tessa is a Jack Russell (think loud and scrappy) mixed with a Lancashire Heeler (think calm and organised) so her priorities are always a little all over the place. She's forever caught between trying to chase people or round them up like they're sheep.   She's also pretty shy around other dogs so, if a big dog comes, you know what I have to do? Pick her up and hold her against my shoulder. Sounds okay, right? Until I'm wearing my favourite hoody and she gets big splodges of mud all over me üò≠ I still love her though!   Bella has been hailed (by many trusted friends and family) as the world's most friendly cat. She's a soft black and white ex-rescue who just loves to sit on someone's knee. She's so gentle that I can pick her up and hold her like a baby and she doesn't mind.  Though recently Bella had to have surgery (which luckily went very well!) and had to stay overnight at the animal hospital. When we came to pick her up...she wouldn't come near us for twenty minutes! She was furious that we had left her for a night. You should have seen her: stalking around the reception area, tail swishing, appealing to the hospital staff for cuddles rather than us. A couple of hours and a lot of TLC later and she was back to normal, but it certainly surprised us!  Hey there, I hope these silly little stories might have taken your mind off things a little. Please take good care of yourself!! ‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§",False,False

A little sad, but I work with troubled youth so it‚Äôs honestly heartwarming and wholesome at a lot of moments.   Tomorrow my boyfriend and I are just cleaning his house and then going to see Spider-Man. I have no interest in it, but I like being the cool flexible girlfriend so I‚Äôm hoping I‚Äôll just be pleasantly surprised and not super bored.   I hope you have 4th of July plans that are relatively more exciting than mine if you reside in the US. :]",False,False
