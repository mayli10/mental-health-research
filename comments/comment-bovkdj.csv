The teacher weighed us then told our weight to her teaching assistant so the assistant could write it down. She said almost everyone's weight loud and clear, but with mine, she whispered it so none of the other kids could hear. I know she was trying to protect me from embarrassment but it actually gave me a huge complex and helped to set off something that 20 years later I still can't fully control (yes I'm that old lol).   The really fucked up thing is I was not even overweight. I was 5'4 and 140 lb which was high normal but not overweight. Kids were smaller then than they are now with rising obesity rates, but I still was fine weightwise. She made me feel like I should be ashamed over nothing. Thanks a lot Mrs. E you huge bitch.",False,False
