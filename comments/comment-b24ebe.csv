Sure, he's a friend and a nice guy, but he isn't the most important thing in the universe. You are.  You are a modern woman with the world at your feet. You can go anywhere, do anything, and be anyone. Go live your life and if he can catch up with you, great. If not, you'll find someone who deserves and wants you not in spite of who you are but because your are exactly who you are.   It sucks that he's not around as much to support you, especially since  you went through the work of opening up to him. But it's important to remember that he can't give you anything. Accept that he is happy where he is and then go make your own happiness. ðŸ–¤",False,False
