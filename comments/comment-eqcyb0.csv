Fuck my life, for real.  Everything is a hassle and fiasco.   Life feels like a constant struggle.  If it werent for the kids i didn't plan on having but got blessed with anyways, i would have been dead 12 or 13 years ago.  Theyre literally the only reason I still exist and even then, i obsessively think how much better their life would be with a different mother.       There are rituals for everything and i feel like my lifetime ocd (diagnosed at 5, 32 now) and my ed (onset 12 years ago) have coalesced into one angry monster that is eating my soul while blinding me with the illusion of control.",False,False

Like hours out of my day moving my scale around, stepping on, crying, repeat... let's not even get into the compulsion to binge/purge and the constant obsessive thoughts related to my gross body. OCD also effects my alcoholism ... it honestly sucks :(",False,False
