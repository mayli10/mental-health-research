She could also be drinking a lot of water for this same reason. You said she is also going to the bathroom after, which would suggest that maybe she is still purging. It is very easy to mask the sound of purging or to purge really quietly. Exercise can definitely be used to burn calories. It would be more concerning if she is burning more calories than she is in-taking or leaving herself with limited reserve due to burning so many calories. it is impossible to know without more knowledge about how many calories she eats. i would say if you are trying to find out if she is still struggling, you could ask her occasionally just to check in or you could notice if she has fear foods. is she only eating certain foods and avoiding more fatty foods- this would be a sign she is still struggling. but to be honest, people with bulimia who have gone to lengths of sticking their finger down their throat to burn calories will likely always struggle to some extent even if they don't tell you. it is not something that just goes away. its not like a switch and sometimes people do make slips.",False,False

Also, the book ""brain over binge"" has been really helpful to me; sort of a different treatment paradigm that might click with her. The exercise could be a way of purging. It doesn't sound like too much, but it's not really the amount, it's the motivation behind it. Exercise is good in general I think for people who are medically stable - helps with anxiety.",False,False

Not enough information here to say whether she's exercise purging, but it doesn't really sound like a ton of exercise to me.  Also, just because she hasn't gained weight doesn't necessarily mean she isn't making progress.  Eating disorders are a *mental* illness, and take place in the brain.  The physical part is secondary.  How does she feel about eating and not purging?  Is it better, worse, or the same as 5 months ago?",False,False
