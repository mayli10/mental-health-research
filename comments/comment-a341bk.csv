Before my EDs, I used to have a lot of self-control, a very good diet, and did gym several times a week. **I was actually very proud of my physique and I cared about my health**. It's been over a year since I last went to the gym, I've been binging on candy and junk food for months now, and I honestly feel like not only did I undo all my progress, I've actually done some really bad stuff to my body to the extent that I've done permanent damage or at least that I'll never be able to get to the state of physical health that I used to be at in my ""prime."" It's such an endless feedback loop where I realize my struggle to recovery is hopeless because I will never again return to that level of leanness, size, vascularity, etc. again. Not just that, but it's taken a toll on my mind, too. And I know that's true because it's ended up fucking with my self-motivation and mental health so badly that I have lost all work-ethic where I once used to be super driven and my grades have consequently suffered horribly. I used to be averaging like mid-80's to low-90's and now I would say I'm around the 50's to low-70's. My post-secondary options are only becoming more and more limited. Also, I feel like self-confidence has just plummeted, screwing over the tiny social life I used to have. Pair that with a number of other factors in my life which have so far only worsened as a result of my EDs and I feel like I'm just completely un-fixable.  I don't even wish I could undo it all. Rather, I would want to redo it all with the knowledge and fear of *all of this* happening to me if I don't fucking smarten up. Damn I shoulda just made this a post instead of commenting you a novel. Sorry about that. Rant over.",False,False

Addressing my need for control and perfectionism is what really opened my eyes to the fact that I maybe possibly okay yeah probably have an ED. Restricting when my pants felt too tight just felt like second nature. I bloat pretty much every time I eat - hey, here‚Äôs an idea, let‚Äôs not eat. No food = no bloat. It‚Äôs amazing how fast I can get back to ‚Äúnormal‚Äù feeling after getting restricting into gear. Why must something that feels so right at the same time be so wrong?",False,False

I have a set weight that I mentally CANNOT accept weighing above. And seeing myself above it was just the end of the world for my little brain. I don't want to be underweight and my tolerable weight isn't close to underweight thankfully but I can't accept being above my weight ceiling it's an INSTANT trigger. üôÉ That coupled with high stress is no bueno. ,False,False

Not gonna lie, I've had a few relapses that weren't triggered by anything other than the fact that I was well on my way to recovery.
