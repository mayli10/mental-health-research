We can trigger ourselves just fine, ammirite???? ü§™",False,False

It's impossible for us to know which of the two it is, but you should definitely bring it up to him.  If he offers a sincere apology then give him the chance to do better, but if he scoffs and acts like he didn't do anything wrong, throw the whole man away.  Dick is everywhere, and you shouldn't have to let a man sabotage your mental health while doing him the favor of letting him fuck you.   ‚ù§Ô∏è",False,False

It‚Äôs extremely difficult for me to talk about especially since I feel like I just met the guy, but yeah I told him. Hopefully it helps",False,True

A lot of people are totally clueless about how the ED brain works and how it twists things and telling them that you struggle with one and are insecure about your body often isn't enough. It sounds like he's trying really hard to make you feel better about yourself and tell you that he finds you attractive and just honestly doesn't realize that his words are having the opposite effect.,False,False
