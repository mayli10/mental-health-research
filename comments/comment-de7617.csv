I took a seasonal position dealing with just a customer service position that also included somewhat caring for a flock of birds. I fell in love with the birds and pushed my boss to teach me more things and she saw a lot of potential in me and is an amazing person and took me under her wing.   I also have the equivalent of half a biology/psychology degree (never finished uni), so that helped.   Most get into the field with at least an AA in biology, though a bachelors is preferred. (zoology is Too species-specific and you’d want to vary the species you can work with- biology deals more with biomes, so you’re a lot more flexible with what types of animals you study) (psychology is a decent minor if you want to get into the animal training side of it, as well) and years upon years of volunteering at zoos, shelters, rehab centers, or veterinary clinics. Generally 1 year of full-time volunteering can be approximate to 1 year of schooling, depending on the facility.   At my facility I work very closely and personally with all our animals: bobcat, foxes, and eagle included. All of our animals are free-contact (we can handle them without any barriers, i.e., facilities with lions do not just go into the exhibit and pet the lions or hand feed them) and are past rehab animals and non-releasable and are considered “ambassador animals”- meaning, they’re for educating the public about their species. I’m also considered an animal trainer, so i spend a lot of time working with them in both training and presentations/shows. We’re also a very small facility- larger ones, like the San Diego zoo or Columbus zoo, will actually have different departments and specializations for both species and general job duties (like animal dietitians, animal enrichment teams, husbandry department, etc.). But at mine, we do everything.   I both do and don’t recommend. It is a *lot* of work. I am always exhausted after work and taking sick days or vacation days is a fuckin joke. It’s also *freakishly* competitive- the pay is *shit*- like 0.50 over minimum wage *maybe*- but full-time and even part-time positions are rare as hell. Especially in big-name zoos. But it is the most amazing, rewarding work I’ve ever experienced and if you’re passionate about it- the bad days will never sway you from what you do. *but* the bad days are **bad**. The worse-case scenarios of anything in the job is death. Killing our animals, whether on accident or due to the natural scheme of things, is a constant and very real risk. Mistakes, even small ones, can end in injury or death. And that can really get to a person. Also, management in the field is pretty commonly *shit*. I lucked out and have an amazing boss- but many zoos are run by more business-minded people rather than animal-minded people.   So basically: if you can deal with being shat on on a consistent basis, both physically and mentally, then it’s the best goddamn thing ever.",False,False
