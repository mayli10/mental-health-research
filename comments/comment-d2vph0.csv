A lot of the time they're getting off on the fantasy, and everyone kinda plays along (and gets excited by the idea that it *could* be real). This is for sure one of the reasons that potentially dangerous fetishes can be so, well...dangerous. It's sometimes hard to tell when people are endangering themselves or potentially abusing their SOs. Plus, I'd say feederism is an especial gray area bc obesity is not an immediate/irreversible health threat. Its effects build over time, and are partly reversible with weight loss. It's not like pumping or something, where people are actively endangering themselves by shooting silicone into their genitals.  But, I definitely get why these subs would come across as disturbing! And I'm sure there are some mentally...not okay...people there. I just don't think it would be fair to shut down the subs just bc not everyone there is capable of separating real life from bedroom fictions.",False,False

In that case, I wouldn't take the content *super* seriously. I'm not familiar with that world, but in general, there are lots of made up posts on fetish subs, written by people who just like imagining they're doing [sketchy thing]. Even image posts are deceptive. Like, it's possible some posters are gaining weight accidentally, but enjoy the ego boost from fetish subs. Other photos may be ordinary selfies taken by fat people that have been appropriated by creeps.   idk, to me, there's just an inherent difference between a fetish sub and a sub (which I'm subscribed to, btw...I'm not a thinspo hater) that's a resource for self-triggering ED symptoms.",False,False

Anything in extreme (eating or not eating) is not good, and we shouldn't be going ""If they can do it, we should do it."" but rather, ""this is also unhealthy, get this out.""     2 - Reddit is a big place and small communities escape notice for a long time. If they get popular, or a large subs starts highlighting them, then that is when the Admins (generally) get involved.   3 - There is body positivity (fat positivity)  subs out there, so there would be people who would get defensive on that.   4 - Don't pay them no never mind. by obsessing about them takes away from working on you and your challenges. their existence doesn't impact you. and while yes, it may be infuriating, don't let it consume you.   &amp;#x200B;  hugs.",False,False
