What you ate likely had fiber and that slows digestion. You want to make sure you have a quick digesting carb source right before a workout - bananas are recommended which would be ~110cal. That way your body can access the carbs during your workout. 30min should be fine.  If you arent used to exercise, even walking could be making you sore. Make sure you listen to your body and dont overdo it. You may go up a few lb while your body adjusts to being more mobile but it will go away.",False,False

I buy tablets that you dissolve in drinks (they're called ORS sport hydration tablets if you're also in the UK) and they're only 7 cals each! I also take a multivitiman and iron tablet to help with the weakness. Idk if any of it helps but I don't feel as awful and it's good to have peace of mind. But if you're restricting you're still gonna feel a bit weak regardless of taking these extra things.",False,False
