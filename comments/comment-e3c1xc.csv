I saw her today for the first time in 3 months and she kept asking me if i cooked and how I ate and kept saying I need to eat. My mom has been pressuring me to lose weight since middle school (when tbh it was right for her to be concerned, I was obese medically), but sheâ€™s been watching me lose weight since then. At 20, I am always fluctuating between a very low normal BMI to a very high underweight BMI. It is very annoying bc she also does not mention these things In private",False,False
