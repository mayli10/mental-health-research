The flakiness comes from laminated dough. They make it by rolling the dough out flat, putting a big wide flat tab of butter on it, and folding it over and rolling it out flat again. Then they put another tab of butter and repeat. That's what creates the ""flakes""- there was butter between each layer.  It's a delicious, delicious crime against nature.",False,False

Hate to break it to you, but those croissants are more than 150 calories each. They may be light, but they're nothing but carbs and fat. I'd be surprised if they were less than 300 calories each, unless they were legit only 2 or 3 inches long.",False,False

Usually for homemade croissants the calories can range from 200-300 per croissant. Restaurant/bakery foods typically tend to have more calories than homemade ones, so those calorie ranges may go up to the 300-400 range. Another comment I saw said something around 500 calories per croissant, which may be specific to that restaurant, because I know Costco croissants have like 340cal each, and Starbucks croissants are around 240cal each. But the only way I think you‚Äôd be able to fully tell is to find out how much each croissant weighs, that‚Äôll give you a more accurate count.   I completely agree though, I want every single thing I buy to have a nutrition label, I hate having to guess at amounts.",False,False

Let me go and reconsider my life choices now  These were mostly air though with no filling or cheese or anything. Please tell me that I didn't have 2000cal in a day.  100 g have 400 cal almost.
