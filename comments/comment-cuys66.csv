The company has definitely been under fire about idols' health and I'm betting TWICE crossed some lines since they were so open about it (unless all 9 girls stopped mentioning diets at the same time by coincidence lol).

I‚Äôm a sucker for any facts about what people eat, like last meals on death row, celebrity eating habits, or stuff like ‚ÄúThe Supersizers Go‚Äù (which I feel is oddly named, but I speak American English, so maybe it‚Äôs just a turn of phrase over there that I‚Äôm missing).",False,False

Audrey Hepburn typically restricted her food because she grew up during war famine and only had potatoes and other root items to eat; the only indulgence she allowed herself was chocolate when she became rich and famous.  She mentioned that at one point in her career she went on vacation and allowed herself to eat as much chocolate as she wanted and she gained 15 pounds.  Her agent or the studio told her she needed to lose the weight and cut the chocolate or she wouldn‚Äôt have a place in film anymore.  From that point on she always kept 1 bar of chocolate in her kitchen drawer and would only allow herself 1 or 2 mini blocks per day broken off from the bar.   She also walked for hours every evening for ‚Äúher health‚Äù despite being underweight.  Katharine Hepburn was no nonsense in judging people for their laziness and weight.  She was [a waif](https://badpacino.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/annex-hepburn-katharine-philadelphia-story-the_06.jpg) who believed that no one should ever sit down.  When she was younger and filmed sitting it was because she was scripted to do so, and when left to her own direction she would always stand, wander around while talking, and lean on chairs rather than use them.  In between takes she would go outside with other actors or crew members and throw a ball around, literally run around, or try to find a simple sport to do.  She spent every moment of her active years trying to burn as many calories as possible.  I‚Äôm not as familiar with Judy Garland, but I know she was abused by the director of The Wizard of Oz (who slapped her across the face for not remembering some lines) and she was required to only eat soup and smoke cigarettes *as a child* to keep her weight down.  I would say Hollywood was crazy back in the day, but seeing how most A listers are still very underweight, I expect that studio execs are just as cruel and demanding about weight as they were in the past.",False,False
