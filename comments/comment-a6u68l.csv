Iâ€™m also tired of fighting with food...my family really doesnâ€™t care about getting ice cream in the morning after having a freaking potluck the night before. Fasting is so hard right now. My stomach hurts like hell too. Maybe thatâ€™ll help with restricting when I get home.,False,True

Iâ€™m trying to stay positive though because my cousin is young and sheâ€™s really excited to share her birthday with me. I also havenâ€™t celebrated my birthday in quite a few years  I agree with your last point too. I spend most of the other 11 months isolating myself so this month is kind of a breath of fresh air.,False,True

Like, the laws of physics don't change because of the holidays. If you take in more energy than you expend, your body stores fat. I know when I overeat that I'm storing fat and it's horrible understanding that.",False,False

I went to a party and had a whole bunch of beer and food. Probably packed in a solid 2500 calories or so over the course of 5-6 hours. Went to bed, woke up 4-5 hours later in a hypermetabolic state, drenched in sweat, hot as hell, heart racing. Not only is it a horrible feeling, it's a confirmation/reminder that I ate an excessive amount of food. Hasn't happened to me in months and I'm pissed. I've been recovering since August. How the hell could this still be happening after so long and after I've regained so much weight and gotten to an objectively much healthier place? When I was obese, I would easily eat 5-6000 calories in one sitting and my body would process it just fine and I'd wake up the next day and it would be like any other day.  &amp;#x200B;  I'm so tired of the whole fight with food. Everyone else at the party is gorging themselves and getting fat and not caring at all. They'll probably wake up the next morning and go to IHOP for a stack of pancakes while I'm fasting and having nightmares about the oil the freaking roasted vegetables are cooked in. I feel like there's only two options at holiday parties and in this modern world in general where we have access to fattening amazing-tasting high calorie foods 24/7/365: One is to torture your body and get fat by eating too much, the other option is to torture your mind holding back the beast that wants to eat an entire plate of delicious desserts.",False,False

Mine and my husband's birthdays, our anniversary, thanksgiving, Christmas, and New year's, and it's obviously not a holiday but finals is in the middle of all that. Our families live close together so we have multiples for most parties.   I love my husband and my family so much but the sheer amount of food that happens makes it so hard to control myself. I binge like a motherfucker and feel so awful.  I guess it's nice though because then there's NOTHING the rest of the year and I can diet in peace lol. ",False,False
