You deserve health, happiness, and self-love, and even though that sounds really difficult you’ll get there.",False,False

I did have a lot of sodium yesterday and honestly im having stomach issues too. im hoping its just that but like my fucking disorder was like (grabs u by the throat) ""you gained weight kill yourself""",False,True

That’s how I bloat. If there’s a salt shaker in the room, I start to blow up. I’ve gone to bed and woken up like 5 lbs heavier/lighter and it makes weighing myself that much more of a mindfuck. What I’m trying to say is that I read somewhere that fluctuation within ~3 lbs shouldn’t be worried about bc you can’t gain/lose that overnight so it’s pretty much guaranteed to be the food/water actually in your body + whatever bloating adds!",False,False

I just keep looking at myself in the mirror and feeling fucking awful and disgusting and bloated.

And even if it was real weight (it’s not) - weight itself isn’t a permanent fixture.   You are okay. You are a wonderful human and gaining a bit of water weight hasn’t changed that fact.",False,False

It’s definitely water retention &amp; food weight.   4 days ago i was 138.2 lbs after drinking a lot and eating sodium-rich foods. Woke up today to 132.0. I bet the exact same think will happen to you.   You definitely didn’t gain that much fat, it’s just water and waste weight. You’ll be back to normal in a few days, maybe a week or so.",False,False
