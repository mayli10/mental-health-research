The eyes. I felt so watched and exposed and it was awful. Now no one in my present life knows and it's awesome and horrific. Like I'm totally free to just kill myself now. I did tell my last ex (?) that I had damaged my heart from using ipecac as a teen, and that was not helpful at all. I said ""So now you know how gross and stupid I am"", and he just laughed.",False,False

But overall no one cared or didn’t understand what it was.,False,False
