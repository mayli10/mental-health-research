It can be such a hard feeling to deal with. I think it’s sometimes also easier to think of it how we would consider anyone who isn’t us - it can be easier to be compassionate to others, and then to try to reflect that compassion back onto ourselves 💕",False,False

Reading your response physically helped me calm down and someone saying that about other people is a little boost of encouragement I will definitely keep in mind. ❤️,False,True

(In reality I’m not SUPPOSED to move things because I can dislocate my joints, so I know it’s all in my head but the thoughts still happen).   Just try to remind yourself that other people really can have different needs and urges and moods and that it really doesn’t say anything about you. (Easier said than done, I know) 💕",False,False
