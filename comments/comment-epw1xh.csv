So this is this boy that is kinda making out with me some times and honestly he is just SO skinny (maybe bc he's a skater and skates all day every day since he was 9yo and is currently like 23yo) I find myself in a constant competition with him, when I know I will be seen him I mad restrict bc there's the possibility that he is gonna hug me or touch me and I don't want to look bigger than him. I told him I'm anorexic the first time we kissed and he said ""I love the way your stomach looks"" and I had been fasting for 52 fucking hours, now I even vomit when I'm going to meet him, empty stomach but still feel not enough and drink water just to vomit the air I have inside. So this it is, eating disorders are bitches",False,False

I'm already in competition with all my friends and sisters to be thinner than them. I can't imagine being in a relationship with someone and then using their body as another marker.... You have my condolences I'd never thought of that before.,False,False

I want to be cute and small and to be princess carried by a girl but also I'm 5'9"" and fuckin huge and like way bigger than most women so that's ridiculous.
