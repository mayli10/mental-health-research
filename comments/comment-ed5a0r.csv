She says she likes me at my higher weight but literally everything she does reflects against that. Can’t blame her though I agree,False,False

When I started hanging out with the guy I’m sleeping with I was on the lower end of healthy and now I’m underweight and asked him what he preferred in all honesty (he knows about my ed and is a good friend) and he said I’m still attractive either way. Like you can see my ribs dude...but yeah guys try to say the right thing and they probably don’t care and are accepting of all body types but if they had to choose my guess is that they want a stick thin Kendall Jenner body type.,False,False
