I love healthy food, so I eat it and I feel good. Focus on that good feeling. Over eat it? Eat other food I also love but is less healthy? I focus on how my stomach feels. This encourages me to eat lots of healthy food bc good feeling = positive reinforcement. And eat unhealthier food less often or less at a time to still get the flavor but doesnt have that positive reinforcement so I dont want as much.",False,False

Usually completely bullshitting. Generally, the opposite is true. People with EDs tend to love food, eating, and cooking. They just don't like that emotional, mental, and physical turmoil that come with.",False,False

Ever since my grandmother died I‚Äôve been mostly kept at home and any time someone wants to go out to eat chances are it‚Äôs at a place without calorie counts (NOPE NO THANK YOU IF ITS MEDIOCRE ITS NOT WORTH THE GUESSING GAME)  I dunno if I could be classed as EDNOS or ED-lite but some TMI is it‚Äôs been almost 140 days since my cycle has stopped but I still want to lose more lbs because it‚Äôs still ‚Äúhealthy‚Äù and the holidays and State Fair are coming up. and see if maybe this stomach pudge will leave a bit,False,False

I restrict most of the time and I've even gotten into intermittent fasting and....don't be fooled by my anorexic symptoms (I say this because I'm not diagnosed, so it could just as easily be EDNOS or something else).   Don't be fooled by my small portions, my working out, my hard-boiled eggs and hip bones. I'm so hungry, and I love food so much. I want to eat bagels slathered in peanut butter, piles of PB&amp;Js, quesadillas, handfuls of trail mix. I want to eat salads with croutons and pasta and tofu stir-fry and big veggie burgers. My brain is constantly drooling over everything I have at home and everything I could be eating...and I'm terrified to let myself eat most of it.  I'm afraid because my ED has gotten to the point where I just SO deeply associate food with weight gain, and I'm scared of gaining weight so I restrict as much as I can. Sometimes I break though or I can't restrict because there are people watching me, expecting me to eat, and the guilt and shame just pushes me further into restricting and over-exercising and fasting.",False,False
