I guess at it’s core it is fine, like I get annoyed when people say shit like oh starvation mode oh counting calories won’t make you lose weight or whatever but I see posts on there where people are just like “please don’t make fat people feel like shit about themselves” and people are in the comments being basically like maybe they should lose weight if they don’t like it and it’s just like ugh like what’s the point here? And the post today about the ED made me mad too. Someone did the calculation and was like oh if she started at X weight and ate 500 cals a day she would be at this weight and I’m like dude if you think people with EDs always eat 500 cals every day and NEVER eat more or less like idk what to tell you lol I get she said 500 cals daily but that was probably her target but obviously weight loss when you have an ED is not always gonna be linear   And yeah technically she can’t be diagnosed with anorexia unless she’s underweight but the people in the comments basically being like there’s no way an obese or overweight person could ever have an eating disorder made me Want to scream.
