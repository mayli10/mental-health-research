I go to a private rich kid university and it absolutely destroys me. Most of the girls only wear designer clothes, come every day with their hair ironed and full face of makeup (even if classes start at 6 am), are super skinny, and some don't even have backpacks and instead they use expensive purses. And they are all SO SKINNY!! The prissy, competitive enviornment of my university gives me such insane social anxiety. I get panic attacks on campus a few rimes a week.",False,False

One thing that kinda helps is to also remember that you are only comparing someone's best feauture to your worst. I also try to train my thought is to remind myself that I don't know somebodies story and etc. Wishing u the best and we'll push thru this semester ;__;,False,False
