I had tried taking tums and I ended up getting very sick, though it was only one time. When the pain happens I end up taking advil, which helps, but if it is acid seeping up, I can only imagine what it is actually doing to my insides. It kind of worries me but eh. ",False,True

I don’t want to recommend TUMS because if you do have gas, it can make it worse &amp; more painful (speaking from experience)  Ginger helps with heartburn if you have it on hand. Fermented foods like kimchi are also shown to provide relief from reflux.",False,False

Now If I eat anything solid after 7pm I am woken in the middle of the night with this burning pain, it is driving me crazy. ",False,True

It’s common in ED recovery.  Try drinking ginger tea to speed up digestion and break up gas in your gut.   You can also look up “wind releasing pose”. It’s a very simple yoga posture to help with trapped gas.  Laxatives like magnesium citrate can also help, but I don’t want to recommend that if you have a history of lax abuse.",False,False
