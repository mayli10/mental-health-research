I spend a lot of time outside (live in the southern US where it's often 90F+ and humid as hell) and sweating so maybe it's the thought of being full and hot and sticky and gross but I'm unfortunately always secretly happy when I realize how easy it is to skip meals in this weather.,False,False

I think for me it’s cos I feel fatter when it’s hot (feel like everything just swells up and I especially feel gross if I sweat) and also summer clothes are less flattering generally,False,False
