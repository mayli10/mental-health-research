I've been losing weight again and I'm already down to just 7 lbs above my lowest weight and I'm so conflicted. I want to be healthy, but being at a higher weight wasn't enough and also I want to be an even lower weight than I was before, but most importantly I don't want to ruin my life. It's really hard to deal with an ED :(   The part about the lack of hunger is a pretty huge part of it. It's at least of big part of what makes recovery so difficult. I guess your stomach just shrinks so much that it becomes difficult to eat. I was thinking that maybe I could try to be healthy while eating foods I actually like and eating an amount that wouldn't be pushing it too much for me and when I did that the meal plan ended up being about 100 calories below my TDEE at a BMI of 16 after I had added ice cream to it. That's so unsustainable, but it's also the best I would be able to do. That would be me eating three meals a day with a snack. I'm not even sure I could keep up with that.",False,False

If this is how I die I'm going to be so pissed off. I'm trying hard not to give in to my ED thoughts, but the world is making it hard not to. All the compliments about how skinny I am and the equal amount of worry for how skinny I've gotten make me want to be skinnier. Haha, I posted a bit ago about how ""it's not even about skinny for me anymore"" but guess what   L I E S",False,False
