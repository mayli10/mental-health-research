Whether it's abuse or immaturity for his age, it's a pink flag nonetheless.  Talk to him, OP. Just be aware. Could be nothing. I don't like telling people to leave their partners based off one snippet on Reddit, as it's easy for us here to be misinformed, so just be willing to examine this.",False,False

You should both maybe talk about him shutting you down though?

I am no longer with my ex who used to many tiny remarks and suggestions about my weight and fitness even though I explicitly told him to stop and I told him the full extent of the horrors of restriction. It’s been the BIGGEST weight off my shoulders and my self esteem is so much better in just 3 months. Sure I’m still struggling but i don’t feel self conscious and unworthy of some abusive dick wads love because I gained a few pounds after attempting recovery. It’s so freeing, I thought I was gonna marry this guy and I was so in love but I’m so glad I don’t have that negativity in my life anymore.   I questioned if his remarks were “really that bad” all the time but looking back, he shouldn’t have been saying ANYTHING knowing my situation. Selfish piece of shit....

My only thought is that communication has been so important for me and my SO (who does not have mental health issues himself). It’s often hard/scary for me to explain how an off-hand comment of his sent me into a spiral, but it really has helped. We also talk some about how I’d prefer to be supported. And there were some topics he wanted off the table because they were upsetting/frustrating for him and we agreed it’s healthier for both of us if I use other sources of support for those things.  From what you write it’s tough to parse whether he’s clueless about life with an ED or if it was something more intentionally selfish/hurtful. I hope you’ll keep evaluating whether it’s a positive relationship for you, because you absolutely are worthy of support and respect.",False,False
