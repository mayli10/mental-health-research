I started losing weight last march/april, and healthily, without binging or counting calories, and it was probably close to 2000-2600 a day. During the first few months, I lost 30 lbs. (I know a lot of you wont believe me and just think I have fAt lOgIc but it's true, 1200 was NOT plenty. 2000-2500 was low enough to lose, high enough that I had perfect health, and no urges to binge or ""cheat"". I think most normal, healthy people's TDEE is way higher than most calorie formulas claim.)  &amp;#x200B;  Around July, I started getting involved with the 1200 calorie a day communities, and my ED spiralled so fast, that by the end of august, I was eating  as low as 200 calories a day, lost 35 lbs within 3 months. In November, I decided to recover, and right now I am 5 lbs heavier than when I started eating 1200 back in July. While my weight loss would have been slower, it wouldn't have been that much slower. As much as I try to focus on recovery, I can't help but be mad at myself, by now I would have been AT LEAST 30 lbs lighter with a full head of hair instead of the disgusting bald spot I have now.  Now that my extreme hunger is over, there is a possibility that I might be returning where I left off in late june/early july with healthy weight loss now that I have finally returned to the 2000's after 4 months of eating 200, then another 4 of 3000-10000, but we'll see.

One of the fuels for my ED 10 years ago was the impatience I had to lose any weight naturally. I had been researching about people with heavy restriction diets who were losing 10lbs a week (starting at a higher weight) from eating 500 calories a day, so I refused to eat the 1200 recommended and tried to get down to 500. Jokes on me because restricting that low just triggered constant binges and I never lost any weight quicker than I would've done just eating healthily. I also developed an actual ED in the process so yeah, I relate to this.",False,False
