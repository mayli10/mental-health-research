I'd probably like it better if it weren't for the fact that it gives me munchies every single time. And almost always leads to a big sometime later during the night.,False,False

It's like, I'm half dissociated all the time anyway, and I hate feeling that way, so why would I want something that exacerbates that?    Also, when I was using it, I binged all the time on it. I haven't done it in years, but it takes so much self-control for me not to binge when I'm sober, that I wouldn't want to risk it inebriated even now.  That being said, I have a Vyvanse prescription, and while I've never gotten high off of it, I cannot say for certain that I wouldn't theoretically enjoy that kind of high. A lot of it though is just because I'm more or less free from binge urges, but I think I do prefer stimulants to downers.  If I didn't have an ED, I'm not sure if that would be different, however.",False,False

When I smoke weed at the end of the day is when I suddenly realize, like, “holy shit, I could eat right now, it would actually be enjoyable, and that’s great because I don’t wanna hurt myself anymore”. Smoking weed is the only thing that keeps me eating at maintenance instead of restricting",False,False

Idk if there's a correlation there but my reasons/motivations for smoking have definitely changed over the years. Initially I was just smoking because I had an older bf who would provide for me and my friends. We broke up and I kept smoking all throughout high school, just dating guy after guy who would give me weed for free. When I got to uni, I fell in with a crowd that were originally stoners but started doing heavier shit (me included). Long story short, I was so fucked up and emaciated that I had to drop out temporarily (don't know how I made it home alive tbh) and now I only smoke weed. My drinking (oddly enough because calories \*yikes\*) has begun to spiral but weed kinda helps me keep in check. At this point, I see that weed's done different things for me over the years and at this point I personally think it's helpful, but I do see what my therapist means when she says that it's part of my ED now.   I know everyone's talking about munchies but tbh I learned to curve them at an early age and have never, ever binged in my life. But I think weed can be both healing but it can also hinder recovery (if you're looking to recover like I am). I definitely used to be one of those people who claimed ""weed isn't a drug"" but now I see that it isn't the best habit when you're trying to piece your life back together. I don't intend on stopping anytime soon though, I may have to go IP which may change that but we'll see.",False,False

I find it like this for me too. I was worried I would get ravenous munchies but tbh I felt fine and I didn't even want to graze or munch or anything.",False,True

Did I feel bad? Not until the next day. Honestly smoking weed (for me atleast) is liberating and makes me feel like I'm still a decent human being after I eat rather than human garbage. It's a different experience for many people though.,False,False

Having a Ed, asd, and a constant sensory overload + forgetting to eat is my day to day.
