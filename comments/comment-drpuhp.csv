I gotta admit it‚Äôs actually a decent dish, it‚Äôs not just a can of beans dumped into spaghetti! It‚Äôs a whole recipe that not everyone can make.

At first I was skeptical and weirded out as well, but when I tried it it was not as bad as I thought, even if it's a weird combination. It takes quite a bit of time to prepare it and at the end it becomes a sort of dense soup.   The ingredients are: white beans, cherry tomatoes, black pepper with short pasta (not long like spaghetti).    There is also a typical dish based on rice and chickpeas (:  [A picture for reference](https://www.tavolartegusto.it/wp/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Pasta-e-Fagioli-la-ricetta-originale-napoletana-cremosa-Ricetta-Pasta-e-Fagioli-.jpg)",False,False
