I only like mustard on certain foods and even then I usually prefer a honey mustard or dijon, not the cheap stuff McDonald's uses. Vegetables can be good though. They're plenty sweet most of the time. I really like spinach, bell peppers, cucumber, and tomatoes, but in the case of tomatoes only when they're very freshly ripened and I wouldn't eat them on their own. Texture can be an issue if veggies aren't prepared properly or if they're getting old, but they're usually pretty good.",False,False

I love them with all my heart, I can't have a meal without them. They're great if you know how to cook them. I never thought about their texture, now that you highlighted it I guess it makes sense but I still adore them lol",False,False
