I dod sort of the same thing. Ate something salty last night, drank water, peed out what seemed a LOT more water than I drank, and weighed two pounds less. I dont think it's being dehydrated, I think it is your body letting go of some minor bloat, in your case from the retention purging causes",False,False

I would not drink an excessive amount of water to “make up” for purging. You can actually “dehydrate” yourself more with too much water, if it doesn’t have electrolytes in it. Water will dilute the potassium and salt and such in your body by essentially flushing it out. So drink if you’re thirsty but don’t just chug water on principle.",False,False
