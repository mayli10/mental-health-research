I’ve stopped OMAD because that fuels binges in me, have gone mostly vegan to keep the high calorie high fat food away if I do binge, and I can’t low restrict anymore and still function so theoretically, the Cookie Monster-type urges shouldn’t be happening. I’m sorry to hear you’re also stuck in a cycle. Hopefully it lifts for you soon!",False,True

It could be extreme hunger, which is often, but not always, experienced by mostly recovering anorexics. Not actively recovering myself rn, but I binged and restricted and now I’m trapped in a seemingly endless cycle. Same for you?",False,False
