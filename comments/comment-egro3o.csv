Somehow reached a LW today despite binging over maintenance last night. Wondering how much I couldâ€™ve lost if not for the binging episode. Worst thing ever is that Iâ€™m gonna eat more soon. Fuck my life. Man I wouldâ€™ve been so damn close to my GW if not for these binging episodes. I wouldâ€™ve actually reached my GW at the end of the year. FML. Nothing matters anymore right.",False,False
