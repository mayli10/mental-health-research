I’ve been getting really good reviews about thrift shops which is making me want to try it even more.  I’ll check in yelp for the best thrift shops in my area and go before I start my new job.   Honestly I love ~fashion~ and want to floss on everyone at work BUT i’m also poor and fat so that’s not possible right now.  Once i have more money i’ll be able to buy better clothes but if i like thrift shops then thrift shops it’ll be!  thanks!,False,True

They'd be out of business in a hot second if people were saying on their Yelp pages that they found pests or body fluids or whatever on their clothes.   As to whether the stock is quality, that's a more difficult question. The truth is that most clothes you buy *new* in 2019 aren't of good quality. Fast fashion has become a real disaster over the past ten, fifteen years. Flimsy fast fashion has also become the primary stock for thrift stores, as older and better clothes go to vintage stores.   So yeah, clothes are just fucky in general right now. But thrifting is still a better bargain than buying new. If your local thrift stores are decent, you should find plenty of lightly worn (or even never worn) items from the past couple years. The clothes are not likely to last all that long, but neither are clothes bought new, so you have little to lose by paying low prices at the thrift store, you know? This is especially true if you have (or are willing to learn) some basic repair skills...reattaching buttons, closing small rips, etc., bc you can get amazing bargains on damaged clothing.  That said, this is all somewhat location dependent. In my area, thrift stores mostly suck, bc vintage stores snap up anything well made; flea markets grab anything flimsy but attractive; and the thrift stores themselves often charge prices that rival off-the-rack values, despite ever-lessening product quality, bc thrifting is ""cool"" now, and there are 100% suckers who will pay $18 for a torn H&amp;M t-shirt. I bet your area is in a better situation. (But if you live in S.F., SoCal, or NYC in particular...buckle up, probably.)  Keep in mind that thrifting even decent shops is time intensive. If you walk into a store and it seems like a sea of crap, be patient. It just takes a lot of flipping through hangers. It's not until you've gone through a whole store and found nothing that you should wonder if your local thrift market is as bad as mine :/  Also, about vintage stores: due to my local situation, I only shop vintage, but in my area that is more expensive than either thrifting or buying new. This may not be true in other areas, so maybe check out vintage stores, too. They are usually more ""curated"" than thrift shops, so you waste less time. However, there are good vintage stores, and shitty vintage stores. The shitty ones are selling Hot Topic from 2007 as vintage, and charging bullshit prices for it (so, they're basically no different from bad thrift stores...they just have better branding).   Sorry for the essay, I just like clothes and almost never buy them new, so I think too much about this...hope I'm not making it sound overcomplicated. Chances are, thrifting is a great option for you!",False,False

Because yes, obviously so much more affordable, but also........ part of the reason I love thrifting / vintage stores so much is because I tend to focus a lot less on sizing. Especially because clothes in thrift stores (at least in my experience) are a lot broader with their sizing categories / it is very vague!!!",False,False

Think of a very limited set of staples you need (eg dark trousers, work jacket smart shoes) and just buy that short list.
