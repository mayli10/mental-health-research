I want to lose 5kg and even if I lose 0.5kg per week that means 10 WEEKS until I hit my GW. That's assuming I'm able to restrict everyday (which I won't be able to). For some reason I didn't think it would take that long but here we are.,False,False

Ya know those weight loss programs that always advertise like ‘lose 1lb every week!!!’ How are people ok with that?? That’s literally nothing, like I can’t imagine how long it would take to actually see a difference with that slow a loss   Yall don’t get me wrong I’d kill to be happy with that and be able to keep my intake normal and lose at a healthy pace.
