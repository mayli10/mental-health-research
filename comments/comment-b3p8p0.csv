Im just so confused about the whole thing. I totes get the precaution thing that is true. They even make me pee and undress before weighing me now.. Thats new, but i understand the precaution and reasons behind it",False,True

Youre right i do feel tricked like theyre trying to scare me. And thats true it is secretive so I guess they want to check me out to make sure I am ok, in case i was lying about how much I'm restricting to or b/p. I'm in the very early stages of treatment so everything seems like a blur and very confusing. On top of that, my family has always looked the other way about it, so it feels weird asking adults for help and actually being taken seriously. Maybe thats part of the reason i felt like they were all overreacting; because i never got a reaction before.",False,True

Most ED work ups involve a full physical, blood work, and EKG. It's important for them to know where you're at physically. Most people with EDs aren't that forthcoming about the frequency/severity of their symptoms, so every precaution needs to be taken.",False,False
