Donâ€™t stress abt what you will look like at a certain weight, because thatâ€™s not what will make u look awful. Youâ€™ll look awful if ur eating like shit and ur skin becomes spotty or dry and loses its colour/glow. And ur hair falls out. And ur lips are cracked a dry and ur eyes are red. And you have no energy due to malnutrition and anemia and become incredibly boring to be around.   So like, worry abt how bad thatâ€™s gonna make u look more than the weight bc I promise u itâ€™s what really does the damage.",False,False
