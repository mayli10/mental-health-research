I need my feet to touch the sea floor but because there are probably (in my paranoid mind) creatures under the sand, I don't touch the sea floor often.    Once I got pulled out and started sinking. I couldn't touch the floor and I was super scared. I was yelled at to swim and at some point in my mind: ""Swimming looks stupid""  And then I started drowning, but it was peaceful honestly. I got pulled out and was resuscitated.   So there is the story where I almost died because I decided it was best to drown than look like an idiot swimming.",False,True
