XD Was I ever so naive... XD  For real, though, people who are really into endurance will often weigh themselves immediately before and after working out, to monitor hydration. All they are typically concerned with is the difference before and after. I know this because it is something that I really should be doing, but I can't stand to weigh myself at any time other than first thing in the morning.",False,False

Lol I don't own a scale so whenever i encounter one i get on, depending how many people are around me I'll take off my shoes, but i always subtract lbs depending on what I'm wearing and what time it is",False,False

It’s partially for convenience (why make you strip) and partially because they don’t care about your actual weight, they just want to see 1) a pattern (have you gained a lot? Lost a lot?) and 2) that you’re not obese",False,False

I’m super proud of my number and can even stand to gain a couple pounds and I want the WORLD to know.   I’ll leave my number on the scale so the next person can see. Kind of like when a kid shits on the potty and shows their unimpressed mom.,False,False

I went to the doctor this afternoon and they made me get on the scale with all my clothes and shoes on, right after lunch, and I had to go to the bathroom. I weighed in at a full *5 pounds* heavier than my naked/empty stomach weight from this morning.",False,False

Wearing gym clothes is worse because they add weight to the number, which I don’t want to see or anyone around me to see and think I weigh that much. AND THEN at night you’ve usually eaten something so that weights gonan show up too. This lady just straight up being able to do this shamelessly is just a little crazy to me and makes me feel stupid lol",False,False
