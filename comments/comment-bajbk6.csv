I went on birth control and gained weight and I was like ""whatever I'll never be thin anyway!"" And just let it snowball.",False,False

I fixate on my thighs because that’s where my fat is distributed.  So as I’m watching my thighs get smaller I’m not focused on any other part of my body.  Then sometimes in a photo or a glimpse in a window reflection will shock me.,False,False

Like, the only reason I'm back up here now is because I started binging, and I started binging because I felt like absolute shit and thought I was fat and that I'd never be skinny.............why must things be this way",False,False

Honestly I still think they were big at that weight, I've just come to accept that my thighs are disproportionately big for my body and if I lost enough weight to be happy with them I'd be like on the cusp of death.",False,False

But I did look thin and kinda fit. That's never what I saw, though. All I ever saw was a ton of fat and bulges. This was two years ago. I'm now 25 lbs heavier, and I recently found a few pictures of me when I was underweight and my jaw dropped because I looked exactly like how my body goals have always been.   I reached my own ideal goal and I still couldn't see it when I looked in the mirror. EDs are wild. ",False,False

I always focus on my stomach... it’s only ever *completely* flat when I’m heavily restricting. When I step back and look at my whole body though, it’s kind of wild. My thighs don’t touch even when I try to get them to anymore, which would have thrilled me a couple months ago, but my damned stomach... I don’t know how to get rid of the fucking bump",False,False
