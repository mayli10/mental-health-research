This used to happen to me all the time! I also used to drink a lot of green tea and it made me pretty sick too. When I low restrict it makes me very nauseous, I presume it's to do with blood sugar... I started drinking coke zero and eating some chocolate rice cakes, that helps. Also if you binge then hard cut to low restrict it'll fuck you up.   Or maybe I was just hungry. ",False,False

Drinking half a gallon of water + sweating from exercise = you’re pushing out all your electrolytes.  * Nausea means you should up your magnesium.  * Black outs, shakiness, dizziness means you should up your sodium.  * If you have muscle cramps too that means you need more potassium.  Try having a bit of salt or nosalt sprinkled under the tongue (sublingual works faster imo). Do you have any Magnesium pills? You might also have low blood sugar so a small glucose tablet or barley sugar candy can help.  This should tide you over until you see a GP!",False,False

Or force yourself to eat small bites of food. Drink electrolytes. Maybe drink a regular sprite. Take care of yourself!! Hope you feel better. ,False,False

I normally just have a few saltine crackers, wait a little, have a few more, and eventually after that I start to feel better. If you dont think you can do this then, electrolytes!",False,False

I’ve been to far, far extremes with my eating disorder and have never experienced what you’re describing... I think if it continues or happens again you should consider seeing your doctor, it may not even be related to your ED and you don’t want to risk your health or your life because your ED is masking a larger problem.

If you're scared to give up your ED just say ""I've been super nauseous lately and can barely eat because of it,"" and then explain the rest, like what you ate yesterday ""I basically forced myself to eat cause I thought having no food may be making it worse, but I actually feel worse today,"" and then all the symptoms",False,False
