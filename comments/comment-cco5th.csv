I once needed my belt for a date and was sitting on the floor using a nail. The nail was pouting up against the ground with the belt on top and I just pushed until there was a small indent and then used the belt to push more then repeated until there was a hole. Went to put the belt on and realized I didnâ€™t make it small enough -_-,False,False

It just goes straight through and actually makes a perfect round hole instead of one that looks way smaller than all the rest.",False,False

Push it around in a circle where I want it, from both sides. Then itâ€™ll open up and I can scratch a hole through. It makes it kinda look like a real belt hole",False,False

But I have got a leather belt. Makes very precise holes that stretch just enough to look real.
