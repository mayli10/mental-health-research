I had strep throat, and I was dying because cough drops are 15 Calories each. I went to the store I bought sugar-free ones, which were 6 or 8 Calories each..and that helped..but I still feel like a failure for finishing two bags worth, or 300 Cals of basically candy over the course of several days. But on the other hand, they helped me so so much with the pain.  Also, my mom buys coated ibuprofen. They taste sweet because they have sugar in the coating. Needless to say, I buy my own, uncoated ibuprofen lol.",False,False

What it (and other natural laxes) does is absorb water (which is why it makes whatever you mix it with very goopy and thick ‚Äì flax and chia have the same effect, but those have calories).   For me, if I take it in the morning it makes me super bloated and gassy by the afternoon, but I still can't poop unless I drink like a couple litres of water.",False,False
