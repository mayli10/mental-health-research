Have you ever communicated your needs and wants to him? To someone without an eating disorder, the idea of needing permission to eat is inconceivable. It’s like asking permission to live, you know? How could he know you need his permission to feed yourself? Try telling him about this. Are you seeing a therapist? It’s nice to have someone to help you take care of yourself but in the end you’re the only one responsible for your health and well-being. Relying on his permission to eat could very easily turn into a co-dependent situation where he is actually enabling you by taking accountability and responsibility that should belong to you. There’s no shame in asking for help and support but you also need to take steps to hold yourself up.   You have permission to eat. You have permission to nourish your body and take up space in this world. I hope you take this permission and feed yourself, even if it’s just one meal!! Stay strong and take care of yourself.",False,False

I just want him to tell me I can eat. I just want him to tell me I deserve food. That I need it and that he wants me to eat it. That’s all I want. I can’t until then.,False,True
