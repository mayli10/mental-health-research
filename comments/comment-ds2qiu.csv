This is no place for your trolling. HIGHLY inappropriate response.  This is not a sub where you can pass out your unsolicited opinions of women's bodies.

Don't give me advice on something that I've lived and researched for years. A mental disorder is not something I can shut off.

I saw your pictures and I think you look good.  One thing I would recommend is to start to lift weights.  Muscle burns more calories.  I see it all the time, people get so focused on cardio and then get frustrated when they don't see results.  The best way to lose weight is to eat healthy.  Definitely don't starve yourself.",False,False
