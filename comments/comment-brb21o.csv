I bake probably 4 times a week most of the time. I package up most of it to give to people (everyone seems to appreciate it), but I'll admit that sometimes I binge eat it or simply overeat it.   I accepted back in January that I have a real love of baking and promised that I wouldn't stop doing it even if my ED told me to. I'm still figuring out how to moderate my consumption, but some of the binge eating baked goods eased up when I realized they'd be around more often. Someday I'll find a balance with how much of it I should actually eat, but I cannot go without that joy.",False,False

Iâ€™m actually pretty good at it too, and Iâ€™m thinking about setting up a booth at the farmers market over the summer just for an excuse to make loads of cookies and bread and shit.   My favorite thing to make is pies but unfortunately I only feel safe making them like once a year for thanksgiving, so my crusts are not that great yet lol.",False,False

I love baking so much but I never bake cakes because I know I'll trigger a binge and I'll eat it all. It's a fucking shame because I really like it,  I wanted to bake some chocolate cupcakes for my boyfriend's birthday but I don't even have the energy and I know he's going to ask me to eat them with him. :/",False,False

I honestly feel like baking bread or sugar cookies every week to stay in practice so when the holidays roll around I donâ€™t forget how to do it, but I hate having 3 dozen cookies or fresh bread hanging around, and I donâ€™t have anyone else to give it to usually. I hate that I have no self control.",False,False

I make the most beautiful pastries and baked desserts. I love to share them with friends and family. But I stopped baking because I donâ€™t have the energy. Also, I worry about pushing sugary stuff on people who might feel anxiety about it. :/",False,False
