It's been a bad year in terms of mental health and my disordered eating's been bad as of late so I shouldn't be surprised by this. But I am and I have health anxiety. God. -\_-,False,False

I actually posted a while back and asked the ladies on here with amenorrhea how their period behaved before they lost it. Most said it acted normally and just stopped showing up.     I used to have REALLY heavy periods with unbearable pain. Now I get only painless spotting whenever I eat a healthy amount. Sometimes it skips a month, sometimes it doubles. It is completely dependent on my caloric intake.",False,False

TMI but I thought my period was seriously coming back so I used a tampon, only to have it stuck inside of me because I wasn't bleeding enough for it to slide out. A horrible way to reintroduce periods into my life. Let me know if u figure out what's going on with our bodies",False,False
