My house was real minimalistic before my SO moved in, no nicknacks/plants etc, then he moves in and there's just... Stuff everywhere. Figurines, magazines, video games. And he just??

I wanted as few possessions as possible, gave away so many things that I loved, had to routinely ""purge"" all my notebooks and sketch books. I still get immense satisfaction from minimalism but, like with how I don't let myself get too scupulous with cleaning because I used to be so compulsive with cleanliness, I don't let it get too extreme or it could get really rigid again. I wish I'd kept the notebooks. And I see why AN and OCD are so often comorbid.",False,False
