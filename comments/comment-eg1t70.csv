But it depends on what you were eating before the fast. If it was a lot of heavy restricting and low calorie days, I’d say not safe. Probably more likely to pass out which is not ideal in water. If it was binging/maintenance days, might be okay.   Just listen to your body. If you start feeling like shit, don’t exercise. Electrolytes don’t always take care of you. Your body is a needy bitch so sometimes you gotta cater to it.",False,False

You might want to eat something small before to just help with energy and fatigue.,False,False
