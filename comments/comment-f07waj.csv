I just ate 7 biscuits, and then got some cheese out of the fridge, put the cheese back and went for a run! It was good.

You *didn't* fail. Not even remotely fucking close. The whole mission, the whole point is to try, and try again. No matter how many times the trying doesn't end in whatever preconceived notion you have of 'success' , you've already completed the mission . You did it. You tried. And you'll try again, be it now, or tomorrow, or next week, because you want this. I can see that you do. And people with EDs are nothing if not tenacious, resilient  and goal driven. You can't recover from one try, or even a 100 tries, or sometimes thousands. It's like learning to do high standing jumps. The training to get there is basically just trying to jump onto a too high box and not making it, banging your knees, you get closer and closer but yout knees still hit the side. until one day you just ... do it.  And then you make it more and more often. And then you are able to do it every time and you can barely remember what it was like to not be able to do it. You move onto new challenges.       Whatever you binged on is so, so irrelevant; the binge means *nothing*. It is the trying that is the part where your strength will grow with each repeat. And it WILL get easier, slowly, slowly. The progress is often, almost constantly, invisible to us because we're black and white thinkers - it's all or nothing. It's hard to see all the tiny shifts. Like a frog doesn't realise the water is hot if the change is slow enough. The only thing you need to think about is trying again. The icecream doesn't mean shit. You made progress today. A tiny shift happened. And YOU did it. That's literally all there is to it. You succeeded.",False,False
