I don't hate her or anything, but the comments and reaction and comedy channels for her can definitely be good. There are moments were I truly do feel bad for her. I even reached out to her on instagram like a month ago to let her know she has my support after she posted a breakdown video. I never got a reply. I don't feel the same way at all anymore because shes doing the same old shit of eating fast food everyday and changing her ""diet plan"" to however it will convenience her the most at the moment. Like she said she was going to only eat out for Becky's birthday and then proceeds to post 5 fast food mukbangs.... -\_- Now she quit vlogmas for whatever reason. She's just so inconsistent and cant commit to anything. I can't stop watching the car crash though...",False,False

Directly on her channel and also Michael BePettys reaction videos. But yeah I don’t hate her or anything. She clearly has really deep seeded issues with food. I guess I watch her like how you can’t look away from a carwreck? Which is still shitty of me but I am just absolutely SHOCKED at her size and how she continues to grow. It’s like watching somebody slowly kill themselves. I also find it really interesting hearing the misinformation she has about food and watching how being so obese affects her life.,False,False

I can’t speak about being in the foster care system but I can speak about falling through the cracks of the mental health system and that shit is scaring. It feels like no one can ever help you, and that even if you tried to reach out no one will help you. If it’s even a touch similar than I can understand her not knowing how or wanting to get help when everything already feels helpless.   When everyone spews hate and says it’s easy and then she tries and fails it’s no wonder she doesn’t wanna listen to people. Because I’m sure for her it’s not easy to just eat less and exercise. Like for some of us it’s not easy to just eat a burger. Or with people with BED to just stop eating. ",False,False

I think she’s ignorant. I don’t think she knows how to get the help she needs or even know what that help is. Maybe I don’t understand correctly because from what I’ve seen based on her shopping, Walmart, and eating out habits would no where near cover uninsured therapy prices where I live. Even when she says how much her stuff costs from Walmart, my Walmart is way more expensive and cutting back wouldn’t cost what therapy costs here.   But I don’t think her problems are as easy to solve as, spend less money, eat less, choose therapy. We all know recovery is more complicated than that. Lying is a coping mechanism. I think she lies because I think eating for her is a compulsion she doesn’t understand because she’s never gotten help.    I’m not saying I’m not a bad person and don’t watch her to get trigger too, I just think she really doesn’t know better and doesn’t have the support to tell her she’s not okay. If a bunch of strangers told me I’m not okay, I would tell them to fuck off too. They don’t know me. ",False,False

She can afford going out to eat every day, if not multiple times per day. She goes to Walmart for a week's worth of groceries (for most people) every other day. Clearly she has enough money to fund her lifestyle and if she \*wanted\* therapy, she could afford it by cutting back on food expenses.  She had a shitty childhood and no one can take that away from her but she's an adult now.

She’s a girl who was in the foster care system, probably doesn’t have the knowledge to find true help or the support system around her to keep trying and fighting for help.
