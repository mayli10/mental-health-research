For me I'm either low restricting or I'm just eating everything. Anything in the middle seems harder as it's a constant fight to not over eat. With intuitive eating it should be possible to just eat but you need to be ok with the starting binging and weight gain. Thereticaly once thats done you could just eat till your satisfied and maintain your weight that way but I'm too much of a bitch to try.,False,False

You burn slightly more/less kcal at different points, water weight comes and goes, etc.",False,False

I've heard the best way to do it is to slowly go back to maintenance. Like add 100 calories per week to return to maintenance.",False,False
