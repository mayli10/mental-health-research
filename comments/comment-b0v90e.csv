Maybe he's correlating what he *feels* about people with eating disorders with another population he feels similarly about it.  That doesn't make them remotely the same- it's more a reflection of himself and how he throws around judgement about populations he's misinformed about based on surface level observation.  Dude lacks empathy and critical thinking.  To your last point- he even said it himself I can't believe it. ""either you're a loser virgin for life, or you play into the rigged system and have sex with women."" and ""we either torture our bodies until we die, or we get fat"" He thinks being a virgin is comparable to killing yourself. FUCK him.",False,False

Incels just bring each other down.    And none of us want to kill or murder or assault people with smaller bodies or with bigger bodies, whereas incels have literally lobbied for women to be raped and killed. None of us want pain, for ourselves but most of all for anyone else, because we know the true cost of it.  The other day I was in therapy (with a woman who specializes in treating patients w EDs and works at one of the top inpatient facilities in the nation, and has been for yearssss) and I was talking about how I feel like I don’t want to be in recovery yet because I need to lose weight but how I’m scared because I also realize that my gw just keeps dropping. I’ve reached my original gw several times over now but it’s not enough. And she told me, “It will never be enough. I have sat across so many people who have told me the same thing and no matter what, it was never enough for them, the numbers always dropped, they never stopped dropping. It will never be enough because *it is not about weight, or being thin, or being beautiful, it is about something else*, a wound that is festering and has yet to be healed. In order to recover, we have to figure out what that is and work on it”.   And I cried, because she was right. We all have this giant void inside of us. And some of us fill it with food and others try the opposite approach, and hope that ignoring it will make it go away. Because in a world where we lack so much and have so little, food may be the one last thing we truly have control of.   Tell that to your bf and then tell him to suck it",False,False

It becomes an addiction and consumes us ",False,False

The incel community is extremely toxic, some eating disorder communities are too, but I find nothing but support here. I’m sorry that he doesn’t understand and would say something so ignorant. Maybe he would get a better understanding if he read some of our posts. ",False,False

I’m not mad at anyone about my disorder. I don’t blame anyone for my disorder. I suffer from extreme anxiety and have an addictive personality. I showed signs of this since I was a child. I cannot think of a situation in my head without seeing it in third person, I am very critical of myself.     Incels blame everyone else and are mad about it. Does not correlate, not comparable. It’s just honestly insulting af. Don’t compare me(or anyone else with an ED) to a bitter dude who wants to get his dick wet, but can’t. This maybe “my fault” but I’m not ready to be placed on medication to help me with my anxiety. I have days I’m crippled and can’t leave the house. My ultimate fear is death. An incels ultimate fear is never getting laid. ",False,False
