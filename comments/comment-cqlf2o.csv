I'm still struggling a lot and when I have to eat I cry too. But it's better to just cry and eat the food. It took me an hour and a half to eat a peanut butter sandwich and I cried the whole time but I did it and later, although I felt guilty, I did feel that my body was thanking me because my mood got a bit better and I felt slightly more alive. The feeling SUCKS but its the sucky part that you have to get through in order to reach the good stuff in life. You can do it.",False,False
