A lot of them were just memes lmao but I deleted a lot of pictures of me when I was 50lb heavier. There are a lot more I would LOVE to delete but they’re pictures with friends and I don’t want to delete those memories. I just hate looking at myself in them and I hope no one else ever sees them! ,False,False

I just look like an amorphous blob creature in old photos and I legit start to panic whenever I find one like somehow it'll physically hurt me.  Hovering on underweight now and the fear of becoming that again keeps me there. ",False,False

Like I look at photos when I was at my highest weight (and that wasn't even a high weight) and all I can think is ""holy fuck I was big."" Then when I look at the few photos I have of myself at my lowest weight I can rationally see that I looked awfully skinny. It's such a mindfuck. ",False,False
