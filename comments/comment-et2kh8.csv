However, I feel as though someone who is mentally healthy and has a normal relationship with food might not feel as violated by it? Like most people are very aware that brownies are a treat food and will assume they are high in calorie (maybe not 1000 but you know), and if all that extra oil and butter somehow makes it taste good, they probably wouldn't mind.   In a situation where both individuals have a healthy relationship with food, baking someone an intentionally high calorie (=tastes good) dessert is usually seen as normal. However it sounds like a worst nightmare for someone with an ED to hear about, so your reaction is totally justified, and I think that the intent is wrong in this situation.

Most people who have normal relationships with food have the ability to make wise decisions about what they consume - if they’re offered a tray of cookies, for example, they can eat just one or decline altogether, or ask for nutritional information and decide based on that (or the lack thereof) if they want to eat the food. Making food for others, even if you want them to eat it so that they’ll gain weight, is not in any way stripping them of their autonomy, unless of course you’re physically forcing the stuff down their throats.

I relate to cooking/baking for others and not eating much myself, or to urging others to eat enough even as I ignore my own advice. In some ways, what you describe is that same emotion x1000.
