Instead of caring about how this is affecting you, the only thing he says is how ‚Äúother people‚Äù might feel?  Sorry, my bet is he just doesn‚Äôt feel comfortable talking about it with you because he‚Äôs not mature enough to know how to discuss it. And he thinks that would be wimpy to admit so he came up with this excuse.   I don‚Äôt have any advice for you other than to tell you you‚Äôre not a bad person here. I hope you can find someone else to reach out to for support because your SO seems useless in this area.",False,False

I‚Äôve experienced this also and it really, truly adds fuel to the fire that is our already poor perceptions of ourselves.  You‚Äôre not at all a bad person, and you deserve to vent out those toxic thoughts without any judgment.  Someone mentioned this in another comment, but perhaps have a look at a qualified website that explains ED thoughts/feelings symptoms and send it to him? Maybe this will help him understand that this is a real illness and does not make you a bad person.   It‚Äôs so hard to be vulnerable and open up, to then be shutdown. It sucks even more when you have to go out of your way to educate someone so you can hopefully be understood.  I hear you!üíú",False,False

In fact, it sounds like you are very empathetic and caring.  Your SO doesn't get it, but I think it's important that he does (or tries to). See if he would be willing to do research and learn more. Up to you and what you're comfortable with, but that's what I would want, personally.",False,False
