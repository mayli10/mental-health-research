Eg I can see my stomach hanging out a little bit while maintaining a difficult pose so I feel like I'm confronting my body hatred because it doesn't stop me from doing those things. I want to defy social standards that try to make women (and everybody really) uniform and feel controlled by something shallow by appreciating the things my body can do and not how it looks. Ofc this is way easier said than done.....  Also sometimes I just wear undies because in seated poses my skin sticks to the mat a bit lol.",False,False
