Even though she constantly fed me sweets when I was a kid/pre teen. Even though I was quite fit. She'd stand there, watching me exercise, and express her great surprise at my fitness level. Surprised her every time, for some reason XP  When I was underweight, she'd give me shit. Push food on me all over again. Junk food, at that.  Now, I'm ripped. Guess what she gives me? Shit. Says I'm ugly, still pushes junk food, expresses horror at my ""eating like a man"" e.g. lots of meat, shakes with eggs in them, etc  You can't make some people happy. You can only make yourself happy.",False,False
