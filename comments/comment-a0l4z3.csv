It has pretty much all of the info you need. Definitely follow the sanitation and aftercare steps he describes, and don't use needles longer than 1.5mm.   At those lengths it will hurt more than the shorter needles typically used for the face, and you'll only need to do it once a month or so. PLEASE don't overdo it hoping to get rid of the stretch marks faster, your skin needs time to heal in between sessions.",False,False
