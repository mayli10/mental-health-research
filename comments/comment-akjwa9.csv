It's been super helpful to make and eat one when I feel a binge coming on, and it usually makes the cravings go away.   Spinach, frozen banana, Greek yogurt, vanilla extract and green tea powder (and sometimes chia seeds or plant protein powder) and it's almost like ice cream. ",False,False

But Iâ€™ve heard that you shouldnâ€™t eat too much of it because the huge amount of iodine in it can really mess up your thyroid? Iâ€™m not sure how true it is but I need my metabolism to stay as high as possible so I never eat more than 1 of those little snack packages,False,False

Definitely fills me up.  Mini cucumbers are another good one. They usually come in a pack of like five, and each one's around 10 calories give or take. I only eat two at a time, but even if you wanted to eat the entire pack, it's only 50 calories.  Clementines - 2 are usually around 70 calories, which is a typical serving size. I usually take a long time to eat these because I have to get rid of the stringy pith before I can eat them. Good for practicing mindfulness while eating.  Thai Kitchen rice noodle packets are something I've mentioned before. A 45g packet is 170 calories, and the noodles are very filling. Plus the soup after keeps me warm for at least the next half hour. I like the garlic and vegetable flavor the best.  Fiber 1 bars are good in a pinch, when you're craving something sweet. I usually only have one or two, and for 90 calories, they're really good. If you're worried about binging these, they come individually wrapped in a box. Plus, the havoc it would wreck on my digestive system to eat 5 fiber bars in quick succession puts me off from binging them haha  Lite versions of Laughing Cow cheese wedges are &lt;25 calories per wedge. This is awesome for when I'm craving something savory. I usually have this with a mini bagel. My local grocer has mini bagels that are 100 calories per 38g. I've also eaten them on rice crackers and on bread. The entire container of cheese wedges is under 200 calories, so they're not super harmful if you binge on them.  Hope this helps :) ",False,False

They come in different flavors and are 25 calories a serving. Theyâ€™re admittedly not the most filling but theyâ€™re flavorful and help with a salty/savory craving. There are also seaweed chips which are a little higher cal (40 per serving) but are super tasty and more filling than the sheets. Lol I love the taste of seaweed, tho.

You can get them in tiny packs (single serving) or get the ones that you have to make yourself (have to mix it up then put in the fridge and wait for it to set so it takes time).  &amp;#x200B;  Sunflower seeds can be an option too?
