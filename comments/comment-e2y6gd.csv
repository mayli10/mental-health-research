You should be more careful to avoid fainting in the future. If you ever feel unsteady take a seat or stay home for the day. Perhaps limit your restriction as well when you can. Also, make sure you get all of your vitamins and other nutrients. That will help avoid fainting and heart problems in the future.",False,False

What is it that you're really scared of? You don't have to tell them about your ED. You should, but I understand why you don't want to. It is evidently getting to a point where you need help though. You don't want to keep passing out and hurting yourself, right? If you can't get better on your own than it's time to say something to someone. I know what it's like to be a kid struggling with mental illness, but it's not something you have to hide from everyone. You would be better off for it if you stopped hiding. Even if you aren't ready to get better you will at least no longer have the stress of keeping such a big secret from everyone.",False,False

I don't see how you can avoid your parents finding out anyway since you broke a tooth. You'll need to go to the dentist to get it capped. That's not something you can do on your own. You may as well just go to the hospital.,False,False
