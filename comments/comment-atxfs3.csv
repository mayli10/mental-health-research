My hunger/fullness cues are still shot just because of the ED anyway but.   I’m on 450mg and my labs have always been fine and I don’t purge so my psych didn’t think I would be high risk for seizures,False,False

It lowers the seizure threshold; many other non psychotropic medications do the same, and absent other risk factors it’s not a strong contraindication - it’s like going from a .001 chance to a .01: far larger, still super unlikely. If you’re taking it because other anti-depressant agents have failed and it’s even slightly efficacious at reducing risk of suicide the pros vastly outweighs the cons. ",False,False

Thinking of its appetite suppressing as similar to caffeine is a description that I would attest to. Caffeine makes you feel less hungry but it doesn't stop the ED mind from thinking about food. It also doesn't mix well with caffeine because it can give you reaaaally unpleasant side effects and amplify anxiety symptoms.   Dopamine is also associated with increased energy and motivation, so that can also be tied with being more active and losing weight. There's definitely a lot of nuance to medications and their side effects.",False,False

I only found out when I first got diagnosed as I started retaking them a week or two.

I'm on Wellbutrin but also Remeron so take that into consideration:  Before I was on antidepressants, I didn't have the sensation of hunger. Didn't care for food. I was that person who truly forgot to eat, was naturally skinny, but also ate unhealthy foods occasionally.  Then when I get on Remeron, a medication that TRULY has helped my depression immensely, everything changed. I started to enjoy the taste of food, feel hungry, think about food, crave foods, etc. Probably like a normal person but more extreme.   When I added Wellbutrin, it definitely suppresses my appetite. I can go many hours without eating because I don't feel hungry, but I definitely think about wanting to eat, have mental cravings. The ED part of my mind definitely still thinks about food a lot but if I'm super busy all day I can go a long time without eating.  So yes, it affects appetite but not necessarily weight loss.",False,False
