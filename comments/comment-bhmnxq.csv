Having and ED is not easy, and it's even more difficult when people around you just don't get it.  I feel like people around us without an ED will never understand, even if they try to be supportive and caring.  If I were in your shoes I would have a nice talk with my boyfriend, because the things he said are pretty rude.  I guess you could get over his mom's comments (I assume that you and her are not super close and she doesn't get the full picture) but your boyfriend needs to understand that every word that he says about your body could negatively impact your mental health.  Just talk about it, you'll be fine.   P.s. I'm sure you're beautiful, don't let people get in your head.  Sending love. ♥",False,False
