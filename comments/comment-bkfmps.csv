I told them up front that i strength trained but they failed to get me to admit it was anything for my weight or compulsory. Then they did the same with laxatives, my adhd meds and all this shit. I know some people can be very manipulative, deceitful and secretive about their EDs so I get the skepticism.   It just hurt and felt like such a hurdle as I went there without a referral 200% sought treatment for myself. So why would I lie?",False,False

I thought it was just plain ol anorexia, but I found the paperwork recently and was like :O lmao it makes sense and I (mostly) agree with it. just weird cos I know if I wasn't underweight it would've been an EDNOS/OSFED diagnosis which makes more sense to me tbh",False,False
