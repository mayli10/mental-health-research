What do you want? You want a plush toy? Wanna build some legos?"" Ultimately I decided that I was a fat piece of shit that didn't deserve a stupid, overpriced something but like fuck that, man, I should have bought tiny child inner me something, should have taken that bitch shopping and let her pick out something she wanted that she never got as an actual kid, you know? So a few outtings later I find myself in the dollar store staring at these tiny lego knock-offs and That's The Thing. That's the thing I was gunna buy tiny child me and no one had to know it was for me and no one fucking cared and I build that stupid little lego dog and even though it didn't do much, didn't solve any problems, didn't magically make me feel like a whole complete self-actualized person, it kinda made me feel a little better in the moment and that was worth the dollar or whatever. Woof.",False,False

Lately Iâ€™ve been into Barbie even more than usual and am constantly thinking about how to be positive like Barbie (the new generation one specifically) and Iâ€™m in my 20s. Youâ€™re not alone, but honestly itâ€™s not so bad sometimes! Barbie encourages me to sleep earlier and go for walks around the neighbourhood as crazy as that may sound ðŸ˜‚",False,False
