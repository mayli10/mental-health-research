Closest I can figure is I enjoy routine. I go between the same 4 breakfasts throughout the year. Nothing, cereal, grits and toast (all hail the 100cal grit package lol) and oatmeal. Rotate depending on weather and how I'm feeling. (like rn I'm sick, so breakfast has been a mix of cold meds and tea lol).  I know the cal counts for all of them (although cereal ranges depending on what my kids picked). If I have to eat anything out of my routine, it's suddenly a treat. Especially if I have to buy it somewhere rather than eating at home, regardless of the calories. I can get something half my normal amount, and still have to convince myself that it's ok to ""treat myself"".  Brains are dumb 🙄🤦🏻‍♀️.",False,False
