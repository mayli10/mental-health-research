Granted, I can tell she specialized in EDs from the literature on her shelf so she was really understanding and didn't make a big deal about it. I said I've had some issues with eating, she asked me generally about my habits, gave me some contacts for dieticians, and helped me with stress/anxiety reducing techniques. I hope things get better with your therapist situation and I wish the best of luck to you!",False,False

I did recovery by myself for a year but it was more like a mild cycle of overeating and restricting with still occasional purging because I wasn't addressing the core psychological/emotional issues and had no nutritional guidance to keep me on track. I just started seeing both and it lifted the huge burden off my shoulders of trying to do it myself without anyone to process the underlying mental factors with. If you don't have access to these services, I find that writing down a meal plan for the week with enough to sustain maintenance but with foods I'm comfortable with, and setting reminders on my phone helped. Feel free to DM me if you want any other suggestions!",False,False
