I’ve noticed less cramping/sick feeling in general after doing this",False,False

It is normal if you aren't used to it, once you body gets stronger and used to the effort it won't happen anymore. At least that's what happened to me, but I wasn't shaking violently like an epilepsy attack, it was more like my arms and legs didn't respond well because of how tired I was. I'd trip or couldn't hold heavy things. Stuff like that.",False,False
