I find it hard to believe that it wasn't possible to buy a shirt in your size, AND she kept changing her explanation for why she didn't have a shirt for you.

Human minds are absolutely crazy places, and I've found someone hearing you have a condition they feel possessive of they can be incredibly cunty.   I hope you're doing okay now and can get away from her soon.",False,False

I will admit. It took me almost all day to eat. I finally had a little bit of dinner, and I avoided weighing myself, which usually triggers restricting behavior in me.  But the good news is I’m working through it instead of spiraling out,",False,True

I can’t imagine being such a bitter monster, or having to deal with one. I’m sorry you have to interact with her OP. Consider going to HR if your company has that department...

The way she is treating you would be an issue even if she didnt know you have anorexia. Was your boss this bitter before she knew about your disorder?
