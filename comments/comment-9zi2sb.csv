It is just your body habitually bracing and preparing for famine. Fucking stupid really bc itâ€™s 2018 and I can door dash Taco Bell but here we are. I have no good PRACTICAL advice for you since, well, I didnâ€™t listen to what I was told by my dietitian. Just be patient to and gentle on yourself if you can. And actually my practical advice is lose weight as slowly as you can handle to mitigate the damage of cycling that much weight itâ€™s too rough on your body",False,False

I think you know, deep down, that restricting, and losing weight, is not a long term solution for binging, it only perpetuates the cycle. Believe me, I understand. I was at the same BMI when I decided to recovery a year ago, and in all my years of anorexia had NEVER binged until recovery. I gained 70 pounds in 8 months. I relapsed in August and I've lost 50 pounds but have gone through some horrible dark period of binging, purging, fasting, over-exercise, hell. My relationship with food is even MORE fucked up now than it was and I know it will be for years. Be patient with yourself. Binging is your body's NORMAL response to restrictive eating/starvation, which is why it often follows recovery/occurs with anorexia.",False,False

But a lot of the time my willpower is fueled with the mentality of ""oh I don't have to exercise today"" or ""if I choose to not eat anything today, then I don't have to be worried about calories."". Ironically fasting makes me feel a lot better than restricting. I feel like I can be lazy and not be consumed with juggling calories all day. It's a mental and physical break.

After my fast; I'll keep my intake low so my stomach doesn't stretch. Then, I'm going to do meal prep and only allow myself to eat what I've prepped. That will take away the awful feeling of restricting and playing the game of choosing the lowest calories. I won't have to use my brain/determination to choose what to eat every day. I just eat what I've prepare; nothing more nothing less. I plan to have 1 or 2 meals with one snack (12:30-6:30PM). All less than 700. :-)) Hopefully no binging!
