All the women in my family have gigantic batwings and it destroys me. I have visible collarbones, slender forearms, small wrists and hands, but big fat flabby upper arms. Even when I was lifting so much I had little baby capped delts they didn't go away completely. It kills me. I swear to god I'm going to get lipo in them one of these days.",False,False

It's more noticeable after I lost a bunch of weight a few years ago. I'm secretly genuinely afriad that the reason they're so bad and flabby no matter how many arm exercises I do, is because back when I was at my HW my mom would come and pinch my underarm and like... Massage it? But squeezing and pinching and very uncomfortably grabbing my arm fat and jiggling it in place. She said she liked how 'blubbery and soft' my underarms felt and that if you keep pinching and squeezing the fat there it would go away so she wouldn't stop even if I told her I didn't like it. After years now my underarms are worse and the skin hangs from how much she kept pulling and tugging at my arms, and people touching me there is now one of my worst triggers. üôÉ Just gotta love parents huh",False,False

Flashbacks to elementary school when kids asked me if I was ‚Äúemo‚Äù because I wore long sleeves all the time. I don‚Äôt think they even knew what they were talking about but that‚Äôs when I realized oh ... it‚Äôs because I hate my arms.
