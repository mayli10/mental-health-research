My mom has gone so far as to trick me into eating rice that had ghee in it, as well as lactose-free but not dairy-free cheese shreds that she misled me about (bc, quote, “it’s ridiculous to cut out ALL DAIRY!!!!11111!!!”).   However, I seriously doubt your mom will make good on her promise to force feed you. Are you a minor? Because that would be child abuse. If you are an adult, she doesn’t get to dictate your diet. Of course, she could choose to kick you out or something in retaliation, but frankly, it takes a special level of crazy to do something like that over someone’s diet.  Even my mom, who is pretty off the wall in general, settled down after a bit. She’s still pissed, and I still don’t trust any food she gives me, but she’s also not shouting about how I’m going to die from lack of protein anymore. If this diet means a lot to you, and is not just a cover for your ED, I would attempt to calmly hold your ground and see how things go.",False,False

I know for me when I first took it up, my mother fucking flew off the handle. Said she'd force feed me meat as long as I lived with her and lots of other shit that ended with me crying in my room. The following day, she said she only blew up because she thought I'd develop an ED. Too late.  Everyone was always going on at me, suddenly becoming a nutrionist. But with time they adjusted and left me too it. I was also spontaneously semi trying to recover, so I was eating normal amounts. Since I've majorly relapsed, I have had concerns about getting enough vitamins and shit, but they were only concerned because of rapid weight loss.  I'm guessing from your word choice, your decision to be vegan is based on morals and not just to disguise your disorder. Do you think you could compromise with your mum and take supplements. I know it's not easy to choose between your morals and your health, especially when there's an ED involved.  I'd also recommend searching for foods that are high in nutrients you might be missing, so that you can try to incorporate those into your meals without driving your ED wild over bigger portion sizes. If you do ultimately have to consume animal products again, you are not a bad person, nor do you give veganism a bad name.  Like I tell people who are hesitant to change because they can't live without xyz, if you need that one thing to survive, keep eating it. You're still having an impact by cutting everything else out. If you need to incorporate fish or eggs, which would be my first choice over other animal products, then that's fine. You cannot strive for change if you're unable to function.",False,False
