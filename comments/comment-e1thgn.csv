I am on day two of a fast prepping for Thanksgiving. (I know it is awful of me to do this to myself) DM me if you want I have never messaged before and I don't know how to do it.

Yes most of the KCALS in alcohol are sugar or starch and are seen by the body as empty KCAL’s but also present in the alcohol is ethanol. Which the body sees as poison.  So to be honest science can’t really agree on how much of these KCALS the body absorbs. Due to the presence of ethanol which the body sees as a poison and wants to expel as quickly as possible.    For ED suffers who restrict or fast it’s a grey area even more. Your metabolism is heightened, fat stores where ethanol is stored is lower, the fact alcohol stops protein synthesis etc.   So I would say, hard to say. Just have to watch your intake, outtake, your diet and exercise regime.   Sorry but if you want DM me might be able to explain it a bit further.",False,False
