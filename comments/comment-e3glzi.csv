I know that feeling of being completely alone. It feels like a black hole inside of me idk why.  It always hits me hardest at night. The sadness, especially the thought of living with the sadness for the rest of my life, makes me panic so bad sometimes. The only thought that calms me down is that I may have the option to rant to my psychiatrist if I ever need to ( I don't really plan to see him ever again tho).  My sister says that I can talk to her, but I know that she can't understand even if she tried to why I've been crying over eating for the first time in weeks.  I found my people here. Kind of comforting (in a morbid way) to know people are suffering just like you. Here I'm for you too &lt;3",False,True

I have social anxiety and I understand that all too well. I don't even want to think about seeing a psychiatrist again. I tried therapy but my therapist ended up unintentionally kinda traumatising.  I'm making  making my parents pay up for this mess they created. You gave me trauma, you gonna have to pay to fix this shit up.  Ah I know that the next year will be the same as all the rest.

Possibly, part of it was also availability of psychiatrists. Guess I wasn't high priority enough. Phone calls especially about this give me so much anxiety I haven't set aside the time for it. Was legit in tears after a mental healthcare receptionist was rude to me.  I'm also not sure I could afford an independent one lmao  I hope next year turns out better for you!",False,False

We offer you a month long fast free  Damn that sucks. Was it a GP who told you this? If so can't you see a psychiatrist on your own, without the GP as a middle man?   I understand how hard it is to get the courage to see someone. It was super hard for me to see a psychiatrist, but my life was turned into a whirlwind this year and I just found myself outside the office of one.   I don't think I'm depressed though. Just sad.",False,True

Literally could not see a psychiatrist because according to a doctor I'm not depressed enough. It only took me years to work up the courage to reach out but ok.
