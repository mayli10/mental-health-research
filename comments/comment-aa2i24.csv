Your relationship with your SO sounds really cute and sweet I'm glad you can laugh about it with him, that's how you know you're truly close with someone ❤️   I remember when I was staying at my partner's for the first time (we're long distance) I ended up clogging his toilet and tried to unclog it without anyone knowing but thE MAN DIDNT HAVE A PLUNGER (he still doesn't?!?!?!?!??!) so I ended up flooding his bathroom and he had to come and fix it himself with a makeshift plunger. The worst part was that his roommate was home and his bedroom's next to the bathroom so he heard everything transpiring from beginning to end lmao.
