I may be able to accept being at the BMI of 19 or 20 one day with much work and therapy and change of focus in life. But being forced to gain so much weight in a short time and getting told to be happy about it is just.. so invasive and absurd. I feel as if they are forcing a very low standard on me after I have built my life with sacrifice and effort. ,False,False
