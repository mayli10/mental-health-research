The 3500 calories = 1 lb figure is just how many calories is 'in' a pound. If you eat a surplus of 500 calories in a day (TDEE + 500) then by the end of that day you should have gained 0.14 of a pound of fat, because 500 of 3500 is about 0.14.",False,False

If you work out, some percentage of that extra will become muscle, not fat. Exactly how much depends on what you are doing.",False,False

But then again there's the question of how many calories a human can physically process at once, some have said that it's physically impossible to process those calories if you ate them all within a day but I haven't seen any sources that indicate so. It's my assumption that however many calories over your tdee you are, whether on a daily or weekly scale, will affect your weight the same way, just at different rates",False,False
