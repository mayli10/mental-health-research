At the parties, I loaded up on desserts  (rather than actual food lol) bc itâ€™s the only time I ever let myself have actual dessert that isnâ€™t fucking sf jello or a Quest bar and people would comment on how much Iâ€™m eating. Like of course they donâ€™t know I only ate a total of 1000 calories in the 4 days leading up to the damn party - let me have my stupid tiny cakes ðŸ˜­",False,False

A work party without having to worry about ED shit would be freaking bomb, but NOOOO, I have to worry about making sure people donâ€™t suspect that I have problems with eating and worry about being looking like a fat pig at the same time.

Once at a buffet since it was expensive and I helped organize it and I was like fuck it. The other was last week - at a fancy hotel ballroom so it was also buffet style and that triggered an entire weekend of binging. God damn it. I restricted so hard for the last party ðŸ˜­ then gained 10lbs after the binge weekend.   Love hanging out with people without thinking of work but fuck all the food. Thank god weâ€™re all done with ours. ,False,False
