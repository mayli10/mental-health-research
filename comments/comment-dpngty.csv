You should try your hardest to ignore them, though, and go ahead and get the jeans. They sound brilliant and it seems like you have a really cute and quirky style. Go for it!",False,False

I love bell bottoms and I always thought they looked good on me even when I was chunky? They're just fun pants!   One thing I like to do is get regular jeans and a seam ripper, pull out the outside seam of the legs to the knee, and sew in a triangle of brightly colored cloth. You get super hippy dippy bell bottoms and they're unique!",False,False

She kept it under the surface most of the time, but I could tell she never believed in me or my ability to succeed. She kinda treated me like I was disabled, talked down to me a LOT, and she does this to a lot of people. Not everyone, so it's a conscious choice. Good luck with your crazy family",False,False

It's hard to not take how our moms feel and talk about themselves and apply it to us. That's where I got my binge habits and emotional eating for sure and I can't remember a time when mine wasn't in a diet and binge cycle. And then it's easy to talk about it logically but so hard not to take what they say and do personally or apply it to yourself.   P.S. I have no idea what you look like but I am certain that bell bottoms would look hella boss on you bc they are peak retro fashion amazingness so you should rock them!,False,False

Her at her slimmest was half my size at mine and she was a Pilates instructor up until my baby sister was born and then she gained a TON of weight (and to be fair she had my sister 17 years after me and she was sick a lot so she didn’t have any time to workout) so she’s making 10x more body comments than ever before. It’s sad cause I don’t think she looks bad, she’s just a normal woman who aged and had kids but she’s so critical of herself and then critical of me",False,True
f5wtoor,t3_dpngty,t3_dpngty,Vompirate,1,2019-10-31 08:59:50,/r/EDAnonymous/comments/dpngty/moms_comment_bummed_me_out/f5wtoor/,Sounds like maybe she has her own insecurities about not being like that girl and in her own fucked up way is trying to nip in the bud a situation where you would get disappointed like she has been? Like stop you before you try so you don't get let down by something she thinks is unattainable?   Not that shes in the right to discourage you but maybe a better perspective to not have to feel like she's critical of you directly bc maybe she has the real issue with herself.,False,False

It’s really hard when you’re doing well and someone else triggers everything up again.,False,True

I hope that you convince yourself to get all of the beautiful pants you want anyway, though. You deserve all the little bits of happiness you find.",False,False
