If you looked at a handful of people around you, chances are someone has some form of disordered eating, like only eating treats at the weekend or engaging in various diets. For the most part, these people still manage to live there lives without much, if any, turmoil from the behaviours.  If the rule of only eating treats at the weekend meant that they punished themselves if they slipped up, avoided going out with friends so as to not be tempted, or expanded that rule to cover other types of food/more days, then it'd be an eating disorder.  When food preoccupies your mind more than other things which are important, and things like your relationships are suffering, you have an eating disorder.  But even if none of those things apply and you think ""maybe I really do just only have disordered eating"", you should still seek help. Such innocent behaviours can very quickly morph into somemthjng far worse and consume your life.",False,False

It can be a bit hard to tell – there is a grey area, with some very disordered behaviours being culturally validated and some populations having extremely real EDs under-recognised; plus, even ‘just’ disordered eating can be very serious – but ultimately, it’s not a judgement that can be made online. I know it’s a really frightening prospect to bring it up with a healthcare professional, but you deserve to have some support with this, regardless of which label applies. It doesn’t ultimately matter that much whether your behaviours are over the imposes label that makes something ‘an eating disorder’ vs. ‘disordered eating’ – it’s enough of an issue that you’re here posting in an ED sub. It’s enough of an issue that it’s distressing you. You can take it slowly, break it into manageable steps, but do try to tell someone &lt;3",False,False

The problem isn’t necessarily less bad or valid, but depending on the root of the problem it could be more beneficial for your recovery to use language that accurately described your relationship with the behaviour.  On a personal note, I do not have an eating disorder. I have disordered eating. I know my relationship with food is fucked because of childhood trauma and social anxiety. I know my body image and self esteem is fucked too, and that’s why I care so much about my weight. I don’t think being treated for an eating disorder would be helpful at all for me, even though I fit a lot of diagnosis criteria.  Talk about your problem the way you feel comfortable talking about it, the only right answer is the one that can help you seek good treatment or improvement for your health.",False,False

I know I'm all kinds of fucked up but is is *actually* and eating disorder? Kinda just feels like a coping mechanism, though I don't want to tell my therapist but she's going to notice soon cause I'm getting pretty low.  Thing is though, I enjoy it? I feel powerful and it lifts my mood when I make progress and this is basically the only thing that does now.",False,False

I've gone through cycles of starving and bingeing and now I'm in the binge phase and I hate it.

So for me it's disordered eating.",False,False
