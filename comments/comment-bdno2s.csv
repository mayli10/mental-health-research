I have more energy, even if it's a kind of high-strung, anxious energy. I become very uptight and my perfectionism really takes over, but it allows me to keep my house clean and keep up on my studies. I also actually want to go out and see the world. Compare that to when I'm binging, and my house is a pigsty, I do just enough homework to get by, and I spend all my time shut inside my house, afraid of the outside.",False,False
