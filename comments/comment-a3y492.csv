I didn’t mean it to come across like that; but you’re right.  I’m a fan of fasting, because it’s bettered my relationship with myself (spiritually, mentally, and physically) over time.   The people who’ve messaged me regarding partnering up for accountability - they know that we’re holding each other accountable for unhealthy eating patterns - either over eating or under eating. Fasting can be a tool to help with this, but only if that’s the intent behind it. Next time; I’ll make sure thoughts are better clarified. ♥️",False,True

I’d ask ppl at r/fasting for fasting accountability partners (and maybe on a throwaway because they don’t allow fasting + ED). ,False,False
