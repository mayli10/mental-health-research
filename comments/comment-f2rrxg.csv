If I don't have the dinner one, I can't sleep because my stomach needs something in it for me to sleep. Otherwise, the only snacking I do is at work between those two meals, but it never exceeds 100 cals.",False,False

I mostly out low cal veggies in it and no meat. Even tho its not an especially big portion its hard to eat cuz I usually feel full 1/3 rd through, but I force myself to eat it all because I know Ill regret if I get hungry later when Im not allowed to eat",False,True

I always feel like my ED bahaviour is weird cause I don't really have safe/ unsafe foods I just eat my one meal and so long as that's under my self imposed calorie limit for the day I'll cope.

This way i find it easier to fall asleep full than hungry, and waking up hungry you can just silence that with coffee until its food time again. Also you can eat foods most would deem unsafe because you can get full off of it for your one meal.",False,False

I eat one evening meal, I'm scared of eating at other times because I don't trust myself not to turn it into a binge. It's in the evening because that's the time I'm most likely to binge so I try to make myself as full as I'm comfortable with to stop that happening. Also eat dinner with my partner so it's harder to eat weird ED things or skip it, it's easier just to accept that's my calories for the day. I feel like if people see me eating a ""normal"" dinner they leave me alone and don't think about what else I've (not) eaten that day, whereas if I was eating low cal snack foods and tiny meals that would raise more questions.   Tbh for me it's harder to eat small amounts than it is to fast anyways, so I'd rather just fast and eat what feels like a satisfying amount in one.  Well I mean really I'd rather just eat like a normal person but that doesn't seem to be happening.",False,False
