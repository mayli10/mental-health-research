So the 'healthy' bodyfat percentage is pretty much up in the air.  I'm just listing issues trans women have because you asked... I'm not asking for solutions to issues I don't necessarily have.,False,False

So a trans woman should strive for a healthy female body fat percentage. I think that's like 20%. It can surely be distressing if you haven't fully developed breasts yet because at the same weight as other women you'll seem fatter, but some cis women do have small breasts and go through the same thing, so it's not really that bad I think.",False,False

Being small had become a part of my identity in a way and then I lost that. I hadn't considered it might be a trans thing. I never knew trans people do all of these different things when they have an eating disorder.",False,False

Or feeling out of control due to hormonal signals affecting hunger and weight dramatically.    - Being concerned with fat that you put on when you weren't on hormones, (because in my brain that's 'boy fat'.)  - differences between 'underweight' bodyfat percentages between genders.  - Passing and being gendered correctly and hence less likely to be violently attacked when at a lower/higher weight. Potentially encouraging unhealthy weights as a survival tactic.   - Bone density differences leading to a skewed perception of what is 'overweight' and 'underweight'.  - The dysphoric desire to be 'small' or 'large' based on biological sexual dimorphism.      For stuff that's not specific to being trans, but very prevalent in the community:  - High rates of abuse leading to feelings of loss of control / low self esteem.   - High rates of sex work, where the size and shape of your body often becomes commodified.  - High rates of mistreatment and abuse by doctors and psychological professionals, leading to issues with finding help.  - High rates of parental abandonment, same as the above for young isolated trans kids especially.
