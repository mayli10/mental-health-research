Things have been difficult in my household these days and frankly, we've collectively lost our motivation for any of the things that made us happy. I'm using to being depressed to the point of not eating, I'm used to being angry and stressed but I'm noticing that it's not just me, anymore. And since we're refusing self care, and refusing help from each other.... most days we don't eat. It's been difficult forcing myself to ask for help with wound care, which kinda leads to my point, I guess. I have some rather... nasty injuries and I'm... not really worried in so many words, but curious as to lack of nutrition and how they tie together? I'm starting to lose sensation in that hand. I can't keep anything down except fkn... juice. That's it. Juice. It's always my fallback as the singular thing I can stomach during these... breakdowns but. It's 50/50 even with that now. I just. I don't want affection or intervention. I've distanced myself from everyone in my life. It's just easier to forget I exist. Not eating, not sleeping. Just... decomposing, in a sense.",False,False
