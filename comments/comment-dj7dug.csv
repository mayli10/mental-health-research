I believe it's an anxiety symptom- and surprisingly the more you're yawning is actually making it worse afaik. It's a sort of hyperventilation. It seems to come up the most during restriction or during the colder months for me. No matter how deep you yawn, you never 'peak' to satisfy the urge to yawn. It's painful! Had it for years now but never managed to find a real answer.   When you manage a peak yawn, try holding it for a few seconds and then slowly let it out. That might slightly reduce the frequency of your yawns. You'll be okay, friend.",False,False

However, when you cellularly burn energy (via. aerobic respiration) you need oxygen, so that’s why yawning can go with being tired because you need oxygen to break down glucose. So you’re both correct. :)   There is also some research regarding whether it may also be to assist in cooling the body.",False,False

I'm not a doctor. However not having enough oxygen is very bad if you think you arent getting enough you need a doctor now.,False,False

I'm not sure about shortness of breath though. That sounds rough if it gets worse maybe see a doctor could it be something like asthma?,False,False
