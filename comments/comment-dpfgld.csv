With anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa, part of the diagnostic criteria is fixation on weight- “an intense fear of gaining weight or becoming fat, or persistent behaviors that interfere with weight gain” is I think how it’s put.  They also include “disturbance in the way one’s body is experienced”.  Something like BED is maybe easier to mistake as a normal behavior.  The word anorexia itself just connotes lack of appetite, though, and so people who forget to eat can be experiencing anorexia (the symptom) without having anorexia nervosa (the disorder).  Edit to add: anorexia (the symptom) can also be a symptom of other mental illnesses like depression or anxiety.",False,False
