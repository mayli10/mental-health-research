The philosophy you mention is the same one my partner generally takes - it was the little lies about what I'd had for lunch etc previously which I think was a main problem. As long as I know in myself I'm having what I need then we're fine and I've actually started having breakfast and lunch with my partner as before I was saying oh I'll have it later and then *I would* but it wouldn't be a proper breakfast or lunch, more just grazing. I have found things can be a little infantilised around disordered eating and I just try and ignore this, approaching it as an adult with a particular experience. My clinical advisor is very understanding and she's a good point of contact for me at the moment. Things are definitely improving and I'm definitely less anxious although anxiety does arise at certain times when I'm a bit stressed. Yes, I feel that the 100% presence in my mind is receding and I'm so happy about that. Also I really like your writing style :)",False,True

Diagnosed atypical anorexic at 22. I also don't think ED's can be put into neat categories, since everyone's experience is completely unique. I mean, a lot of people cite the same *kind* of inciting trigger for their disorders but none of them are 1:1 The Same.   I'm not in recovery but I'm not actively engaged in my disorder either, for the most part, although I'm aware things could take a turn at any time. Luckily I have a wonderful SO who encourages me to be open about things I'm struggling with and supports me when I'm having trouble. His philosophy is ""I'm not going to be mad or anything if you don't eat lunch, just don't lie to me about it."" Which I think is just about the perfect approach, for an adult at least.  I live my life using a combination of disordered and non-disordered behaviors to manage my anxiety and I'm fine with that. My weight is stable, I'm not having any health problems (other than the ones caused by my un-ED-related chronic illness), I'm not obsessing over food or weight, it's just kind of...there. The ED voice used to be 100% present in my mind, sitting right over my shoulder screaming at me, and now it's like she's sitting in a chair across the room only speaking when spoken to.",False,False
