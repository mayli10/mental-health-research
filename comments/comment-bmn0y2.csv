I tend to get less bloated when I eat small portions more frequently instead of meals, but that doesn't usually work out too well for me because I don't like to be constantly eating.",False,False

The muscles in your gut have atrophied from restricting, and the microflora that live inside of you have died off too. Digesting food normally is hard for your body right now, especially if you are reintroducing foods in your diet that you haven’t had in a very long time. Your body is healing from the abuse you have dealt it. Drink lots of water to help with water retention. Eat/drink foods with probiotics like yogurt, kimchi, kefir, kombucha, to reseed your gut with beneficial lactobacteria. Wear more loose fitting clothes, so you feel as comfortable as possible while going through this. The bloat will go away, I promise. Recovery is hard but you’re doing it and you’re so strong. Be kind to yourself.",False,False

What doesn't help: tums (I feel they make it worse).  I've been awfully bloated since I had sugar free gummy bears Saturday. Never again.,False,False
