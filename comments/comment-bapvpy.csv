It baffles me to no end, it just makes no sense. The only thing I can guess is lack of ‚Äòfood‚Äô weight and water weight loss, but that still doesn‚Äôt explain the fact I lost and kept off about 5 pounds from this lmao ",False,True

You could see the effects of the weight you were losing before you started the mono, not necessarily the mono losing the weight itself.  &gt; Granted, I was quite active - but not 2400-4000 calories active.  Yes, you were! You just literally burned the nutella off. I'd bet on it.",False,False
