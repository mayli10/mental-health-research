After starving myself for a long time my brain goes fucking nuts whenever it sees food or during my meals, i can never stop! If i have something in my house like nuts, cashews, cookies etc i will finish them. I go into like a zombie state, it's awful. I'm not even underweight but my brain and body are exhausted so they push me to eat as much as i can. If i fast no problem but as soon as i put something in my mouth/have food available i will go crazy.",False,False

It only happens when you're at a dangerously low body fat. It has been proven to occur though via the MSS. You don't stop losing weight but it does become much harder and your body clings to water weight to protect itself.,False,False

If you’re not giving it enough food, it uses the energy it stores in fat. There is no other source of energy either than your organs and muscles. Obviously, your body will only eat that up as a last resort (i.e., if you have absolutely no fat).   You literally cannot function without your body getting that energy. It’s what keeps your heart beating and your lungs breathing.   It does, however, effect your hormones. This is when you’re going to be holding onto a lot of excess water weight, have crazy appetite fluctuations, and body fat displacement (eg, most in recovery end up storing more fat in their bellies than they ever did before). It will slow down your bodily functions in order to use less calories to do what it needs, but it is not going to be by a drastic amount. Like if your BMR was 1300 before, now it’s going to be 1200 *maybe* as low as 1100. That’s the closest thing to the “starvation mode” idea. And that’s when you get a lot of the side effects of incredibly low energy, lower resting heart rate, dizziness, fainting, shortness of breath, etc.   Otherwise, it literally “holding on” to fat *no matter what* is bullshit. You cannot create energy out of nothing.",False,False
