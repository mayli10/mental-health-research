If they're bulimic, then a binge can be 5000+ calories worth of fast food, candy, biscuits, anything. A usual daily intake would be ~2000 calories, and you're eating over double that.  For an anorexic that restricts to 400 calories a day, a binge can be a bag of chips with a side of guacamole that equates to 1000 calories.  One person is eating 5000 instead of 2000, and th other is eating 1000 of 400. It's the same ratio from calories usually consumed vs. calories consumed in that one sitting.  I get what you're saying, but even three Oreos I sometimes call a binge, simply because they're not what I would usually eat, and because I couldn't control myself. I think that sometimes, a binge is rather classified by having a lack of control over what you're eating, and less by the amount of calories actually consumed. Or if it is, then by their perspective on calories.  Just wanted to offer some perspective. If a non-disordered person says that though, then I'm slightly pissed, lol.",False,False
