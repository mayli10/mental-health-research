Healthy doesn’t exist there. 1300 calories and up for a whole pizza. And I know I can’t stop myself. So I napped. Now I’m going to the gym soon.,False,True

I know Kroger affiliated stores have some personal French bread pizzas that are ~400 calories and a nice little fix, plus you won’t feel as guilty about binging.   Or maybe those Caulipower ones which are in the 700s for a whole which isn’t great but not too bad? A lot of deliveries have thin crusts and you could maybe try one of those to save some calories?",False,False
