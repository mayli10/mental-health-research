I'm trying to end each day around a 5 or 6, which is kind of ambivalent about whether or not to eat more, like it sounds good in theory but I'm also kind of low on motivation about it  and I haaaaaate the word ""full"".... so much.  it just doesn't describe anything that I feel until I hit 9 or 10 9n that scale, and at 8 I'm already anxious and self conscious and triggered to fast even though I dont I feel ""full"" yet",False,False
