If not for yourself, stay strong for the people you know who love you. You are loved and most everyone here has gone through periods of binging where it seemed hopeless. The voice in your head telling you that you ruined everything, that you have to binge - that ain't you. That voice doesn't control you and you are capable of so much more than you think. Life isn't perfect for anybody and we all gotta go through this thing called life. The best advice I can give is just take it one day at a time. Don't try to go any further - just take it one day at a time.  I want you to do your best to enjoy the rest of this beautiful Tuesday afternoon. Peace and love.",False,False
