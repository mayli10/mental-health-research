ED brains really are just the master of twisting everything in their favour to hurt you... I hope your day can at least get a little better from here on out!,False,False

It wasn’t there fault at all, just a normal reaction but I manage to twist it of course haha.  Your comment really helped - thank-you.",False,True

I was really embarrassed to talk about it but knew my psychologist would be messaging her soon, so I brought it up (in my country they work together for the patient). I said the letter from my psych will have more info, and I go back in once she’s read that.   She is a good doctor, but of course I manage to find many reasons to feel invalid! Thank-you for the comment, it definitely resonates. Sometimes I’m aware of how silly I sound, sometimes I fully believe it all!",False,True

Honestly I’m confused as to why they didn’t ask follow-up questions because that’s far less than a ‘normal’ diet amount? I mean, that intake level is not enough to keep any adult healthy...or even alive...so that’s significant.   I’m sorry you’re feeling such distress. That’s a hard place to be. My brain seriously looks for reasons to feel judged/dismissed - reasons to say what I’m doing isn’t ‘enough’. I can hear 500 things in the other direction, but that one thing that matches my fears is what I latch on to. It feels so so real, even when it’s not reality.",False,False

(And as always, people with ED's can eat up to or above 1200! It's all about mindset really...) I'm sorry that your doctor made you feel invalid, but I promise you that you're not at all, you're not invalid or eating too much - quite the opposite. ❤️",False,False
