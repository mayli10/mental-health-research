Like, I sometimes don't drink anything for an entire day, literally nothing. And even if I'm fasting I always hear about the importance of drinking tons of water but I just... don't.. and I feel fine (although my fasts are pretty short, haven't gone over 2 days so far). I track my water intake and on average I think I drink about 2 cups on days when I actually remember to drink something. What's helped me is that I drink that low cal hot chocolate which I love, so that's 1 cup right there, plus I'll have soup sometimes so that's another cup. The 8 cups/day is just a guideline, it really should be half your weight in oz., so I only ""need"" about 6 cups (48 oz) of fluid a day, which includes water and all other fluid from whatever you eat. I eat fruit and vegetables too which have high water content.",False,False

Room temperature water isn't good for my sanity. I do the same with a cold bottle of water when I wake up. Put it by my desk at home or take it with me wherever.
