Theyre in pain all the time and it's making me suicidal. Any reason is a good reason. Maybe a long the way I'll find new reasons but the main kickstarter is my teeth. First therapy consultation is tomorrow ü§û,False,False

My hair looks straight up dead (I don't brush it anymore) and it falls out like crazy. I am trying to get better, even a day without purging or allowing myself to eat what I want once in a while without obsessing over my body makes me feel a bit proud. But bulimia doesn't look like it's going to leave me alone anytime soon rn",False,False

People act like caring about your appearance can only ever be a bad thing, and I‚Äôve definitely bought into that in the past, but you‚Äôre right, I do care about appearance too (in this case my teeth and the beating they‚Äôre getting from purging, plus worries of Russel‚Äôs sign on my hand).",False,False
