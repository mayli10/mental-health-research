They just tell everyone everything is bad, cut this out, cut that out until nothing is left, out of context  Baby Boomers repeat what they hear on the TV without questioning, and they traumatise their adult kids w/ chronic ED's. The media prey on Baby Boomer common sense, naivety and acceptance of anything mainstream  It's coming from people in the public who are defensive and don't want to give up the power their ED's give them, Government, healthcare etc. My 60-80yr old parents were brainwashed. They don't have a clue what is going on  They listen to mainstream radio/media. Both of them were told off about their diets/health. I get told to cut out dinner, I eat crap, etc. They don't eat junk food. They're not ED literate, but they've shrunk- so it looks like nothing is wrong  I spent years with psychotic delusions and was treated for it. It was pretty scary to see delusions become active in people who were not schizophrenic, concerning food/weight- having had an ED for years, too",False,False
