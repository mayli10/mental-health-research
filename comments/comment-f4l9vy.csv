Personally I also binge but I know tons of people who purge and don't binge. One of my friends will purge after anything because she hates the feeling of anything in her stomach, but she never binges.  Also, when I was at a more restrictive phase in my ED I'd consider a binge to be anything over 1,000 calories in one sitting since that was more than twice what I'd normally eat in a day. imo as far as size goes, binges can be pretty subjective since the main hallmark of binge eating is a feeling of being out of control, not necessarily the amount of food",False,False
