I mean there is this guy who's genuinely amazing and caring. He knows about my depression and mood swings and all my issues but I haven't talked openly about my ed with him.   I don't want to load that on him. I don't want him to worry because I'm punching myself.,False,False

Both of us struggle with mental illness, but for the most part we’re really good support system for each other.  My ed is the worst, though. There are days when I don’t want him to touch me (last night I had to show up to his house high because I didn’t even want him to look at me because of how fat I felt), I constantly talk about food (that I’m never gonna eat), I leave his room all the time to ralph in his toilet, I have a mental breakdown when he cooks because of the amount of oil he uses, we can’t go on spontaneous restaurant trips because I didn’t have them planned out, etc.  Luckily he’s the most patient person in the world and supports me through this, but it doesn’t stop me from feeling guilty about it.",False,False

IMO you just need to lay it all out there for them so they can understand what's going on and also choose to end the relationship if it's too much to handle for them. Be open about your struggles with your partner and accept their help. I know it's hard, I'm 10000% someone who deals with problems in their own head only but it's ok and necessary to talk about what you're dealing with. You're a team, you can tackle this together :)",False,False

So 3 months ago I decided on a whim to try dating again, and hit the jack pot. But I was straight up before we even started dating, that this is how I am, I am on medication I have done xyz im not in recovery I have come a long way but I still deal with alot and I will go thru times things are really bad.. so if you can't deal, I don't think we should date. And he proves to me everyday he doesn't care hes here for the good and bad days he lifts me up he gives me space, he actually listens to me. I think its really hard to think "" I have to be in the perfect spot mentally in order to date"" like I thought thats where I had to be. But really i've suffered with MH my whole life was I ever gunna be 100% okay? and is it far for me to be alone forever?

But like nenpractitioner said, as long as your partner knows what is going on, then there’s no unfairness about it. You are deserving of a loving relationship, and your illness should have no effect on that. Your partner chooses to be with you, and it’s okay to want to be in a relationship when you’re ill.
