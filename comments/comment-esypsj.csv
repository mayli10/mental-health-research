I get that they were trying to make a point with it but it was clearly written by someone who thinks they know where an eating disorder comes from and may have done research on it, yes, but lacks the firsthand experience necessary to write a compelling and believable piece. Winter girls is the same way. And I wouldn‚Äôt read Wasted just yet if I were you then‚Äî it could be very triggering. She‚Äôs a very, very candid and straightforward author, but that book is infamous for being used to trigger oneself. Same with Unbearable Lightness apparently.",False,False

I‚Äôve been on the lookout for what to read myself since I‚Äôve never read an ED book until now.   Except I don‚Äôt want something too intense for starters.  I found [The Girls at 17 Swann Street](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39324901-the-girls-at-17-swann-street) and also [Tiny Pretty Things](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18710209-tiny-pretty-things?from_search=true&amp;qid=MXDV3co1nc&amp;rank=1). I read the first few pages of both. The first is a more mature book following a 26 year old ex-ballerina, and the writing is just lovely. It‚Äôs full of meaning. The second one is more of a teen drama which follows three ballet students, one of which falls into an eating disorder, so it‚Äôs not so much the main theme.   Which ED books have you read?",False,False
