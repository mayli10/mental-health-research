For days, usually the same week, I can eat ONE meal a day and only eat it because I know I need energy to run (my passion). But other days (usually for a week or two)... I can‚Äôt go two seconds without thinking about food. I won‚Äôt even be hungry and I want to eat. My body feels disgusting. My tummy pouch comes back because I eat a banana that takes up 90 more calories than my body was used to for the last two weeks. Then it just spirals into a lack of motivation and constant eating. Then it takes two weeks of misery to get back down to normal. I feel so pretty and skinny when I restrict. The second I eat, I feel fat and like I‚Äôm not even half the person I was in the mirror yesterday. Seriously, I genuinely want to know. I want a scientific and proven answer. Why am I extremely hungry some days and never hungry on others?  Is it hormonal? Is it just part of the monthly cycle for women that makes us low on estrogen for the week? Is it purely psychological?  Why is there not a set cure for this?? Why can‚Äôt I take some magic happy pill and be skinny AND happy AND be able to eat 2 meals a day?
