I know it's not what you want to hear in this situation, but it is the truth. You'll make it college, you'll find something you like to do, and you'll meet great people along the way. Hang in there, and try your best to enjoy your birthday, even if its just for a short moment. I believe in you, you'll make it through. If you ever need to vent feel free to PM me.",False,False
