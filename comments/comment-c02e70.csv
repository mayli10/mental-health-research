In high school I dated around this group of friends, and now Iâ€™m 25 and engaged to a guy in that friend group. Well his best friend, one of my exs, started dating a girl who was a lil thicker. Out of no where she lost like 50lbs and no one could stop talking about how hot she was. (Although my fiancÃ© denied thinking she was hot.)   One day he came home from hanging out with his best friend and his ~super hot~ girlfriend and joked about saving her from his best friend and being in a poly relationship with her and me. ðŸ™ƒ",False,False

During breaks, the women would talk nonstop about attractive men and what made them attractive while it flew right over the attending counsellors heads.   It became a running joke when they would talk about exes and say ""men are all trash.....oh wait, but not you ppid. Haha"".  Luckily I wasn't too emotionally affected by it, but the reminders that I was not attractive still bothered me since it's the main driver of my ED.",False,False

Mostly males and I'm the only female on my team. Though while I am the smallest one of the few females in my company, I'm average weight. They constantly talk about the hot chicks they see, make comments on female bodies and show everyone their tinder date picks. They have made me cry so many times and feel like shit, but they don't even know it. I pretend to be completely cool with everything, otherwise, I would have no one to talk to at work and would probably end up ostracized if I started calling their shit out. I like them otherwise, but they make me feel like the ugliest most homely fat girl ever. Like everything about my body is wrong and unworthy. I need to leave this job for my mental and physical health, but my contract is 6 more months... It is so toxic....",False,False

Hey, girl, that other girl is definitely way hotter, yeah? So insensitive, and also not really appropriate at work.  But honestly it sounds like this goes beyond any narcissistic feelings (which are totally valid and not even necessarily narcissistic anyway). Your coworkers are treating you differently from another coworker. That's just crappy. And them talking about how pretty another coworker is, just isn't cool at work. It's not like sexual harassment, but like you said, if it were a man they would be talking about his non-physical attributes. There's something gross here.   I actually did have a similar experience to this. There were a few more women at the office, but one was a tall, extremely thin, Eastern European model-looking woman. The men who worked there were all obsessed with her. It's not that I want attention from male coworkers, I don't. I just don't want to hear at work about how hot they think she is, or get ignored with valid work stuff because they're busy fawning over her (and not doing their jobs).",False,False

I realize I sound very self-centered writing this; however it's my experience and sort of relevant. So, here goes.  I'm very self-conscious, not just about my experience but about *everything*. I feel self-conscious whenever people get compliments because I start worrying about what they think about me. It hurts whenever people praise someone else tbh.",False,False

Ngl I get jealous pretty easily. In college I was in a mostly male class with the same guys for two semesters. We all became pretty good friends and I was at my lw then so I felt kinda sexy and flirty with most of them. Of course I wasnâ€™t the only girl tho. There was one specific girl I never personally met, but whenever sheâ€™d hang out with us, the guys attention automatically went to her like I wasnâ€™t even there. Sheâ€™d leave and theyâ€™d all turn around discussing how hot she was right in front of me. She could be a nice girl but I hated her for making me feel invisible when she was around. Just open the door to my insecurities why donâ€™t you.",False,False
