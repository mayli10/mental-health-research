Why fight for years to reduce the size of fat, when it can just be chilled and be killed?    I'm only doing the right side of my body and leaving the left untouched. I'm already 2-3 inches down just on the right half of the waist circumference, compared to the left. The softer the fat, the easier it seems to freeze and disappear. I've lost 8 pounds and am wearing my old jeans that did not fit in last year.   Pain was only a problem when the area thaws out. Hot wet towels warm it up fast enough to prevent too much pain, without the warming it stings like hell for 10 minutes.  I'm building a device, but I think freezer ice pads and cryo pads to prevent freezer burn could work as well, but it may take more than one set of pads and switching out to go for 2 hours without the pads warming up above freezing (32f/0c). I used aluminum beer bottles filed with antifreeze to (so far) remove half my pubic fat roll, by doing 1 hour a day, for 30 days, I'm still 60 days out on most areas to see full results.   The crazy side effect of doing only one side, the center of my bell is shifting to the fat side.   I'm a few hundred dollars into my project, plus an old refrigerator.   So far I'm very happy. I'm hoping by march to look like a circus freak, the ""half fat man"".   ",False,False

I think calling it a scam implies it’s purely a money grab with no chance of success, which is not true. Considering I’ve actually had it done, and know others who have had it done, I have a different perspective. I don’t think it’s for everyone or as effective as laser lipo or other invasive means, much like a chemical peel won’t give you results like a face lift. I think at more of a shit shoot than other treatments on how your body will react, so it’s up to individuals if they want to take the risk.",False,False

Realself seems to also have an issue with false positive reviews &amp; deleting negative reviews.  I've seen that study or more like the story where it gets posted over and over but that doesn't make it less of a scam, especially when so many people spent 2k for nothing.",False,True

It’s meant only for soft squishy fat and the results are not typically drastic. Also most bad reviews are people who are significantly over weight or only did one treatment (I think realistically you need 2-3). I paid about $4k all in and obviously have still been focused on weight loss since getting it done. It’s not for everyone but it’s not a scam. It’s based on actual science (they found that kids who sucked on ice had fat necrosis and dimples form on that cheek, and turned it into an FDA approved aesthetic procedure). Time will tell if it was worth it. Like lipo you can always gain fat back in your remaining fat cells ...there no way to get rid of fat to the point you can never gain again.",False,False

Did you think the bad reviews were authentic? There's so many women who've been scammed out of 2 grand or more it's ridiculous.     Apparently Lipo doesn't last long either... I just can't believe the FDA approved this. I understand it is supposed to target the ""fat cells"" but it just doesn't add up..",False,True

It will take another three months for full effects to show but I can already tell the difference (my stomach is much smoother, the fat pockets blend in way more). It was painful as hell and I have two hard (non visible) lumps from my last treatment two weeks ago that I hope are just swelling and will go down. It’s definitely not comparable to lipo in that it’s not going to make you weigh a bunch less or for anyone who’s overweight. But for girls with a little muffin top that stays no matter how much you lose but are otherwise fit, it is a nice option.  I struggle with wanting a flatter stomach (and feeling really good about the rest of my body) but having to be way below a normal weight for that to happen. I am hoping this makes me feel more proportional so I don’t have to stress about lose lose lose. My friend did it and liked her results, so I decided to try it. I can update in a few months when I am at full results, but so far happy with it.",False,False
