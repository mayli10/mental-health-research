I was accused of projecting my own issues into someone else. There was no winning no matter how I tried to explain it. Once you’ve had an ED, you can spot the symptoms on someone else a mile away.",False,False

If doctors don't know about your ED, it's shocking how much they will credit to perceived athleticism.

When seeing an obese person: lol u fattie stop making excuses, you just eat too much.  When seeing an underweight model with a BMI of 17 that eats ""diet"" ""healthy"" food up to 1,200 calories a day and exercises on top of that: oh but she's just naturally skinny, and she eats so healthy, and 17 isn't that low blah blah blah.

It's distressing to see those posts and to see all the women wishing they looked they looked that way and praising them.
