You're super tall! ☺   If you can't just buy smaller pants because of your height you can try pining your clothes in the back. Just fold them nicely and insert a safety pin so that it's hidden in the fabric.",False,False

I think I remember measuring it one time and it was a little over half my height lol). I definitely feel like a lot of pants are made for the 5’6-5’8 crew though, since I hear so many complaints from my shorter friends about pants being too long haha",False,True

It does seem like a lot of clothes are made for women who are taller than average. I'm 5'6"" but my legs are a little long for my height and I feel that most pants fit me perfectly. So being tall might actually be good. Unless you're like 6 feet or something.",False,False

Plus my pants are cheapo pants from amazon so I’d feel a bit silly tailoring them instead of just spending the money on nicer pants that actually fit me lol  I might try to get some nicer pants from a shop though once I get some money! It sounds like it’d be a good idea since buying pants can be tricky for me (being tall w a long inseam and carrying weight in my legs makes it hard lol),False,True

I’ve had to do this a lot with pants growing up and if I need a quick fix for something and get to actually sew it in time then I just take a safety pin, fold the waistband of my pants over itself (usually in the back because you can cover the creases the fold makes with like a cardigan or something) and then weave the safety pin through the 2-3 layers the fold creates and then pin it together. Just make sure the safety pin is on the inside of the pants, like don’t pin from the outside so the safety pin is showing, make sure to pin it from the inside so the majority of the pin touches your skin/tucked in shirt.  If I didn’t explain this correctly please let me know, I’ll try to explain it in a different way, but that’s what I usually do if I need something to fit in a pinch.",False,False
