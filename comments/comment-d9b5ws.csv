I had just done some reading on it and a lot of it is saying nutrition is important as well. It's kinda discouraging because I try really hard to keep a somewhat healthy and ""balanced"" diet through ED and veganism. Maybe i'm missing the mark somewhere. Will really have to look into it further. Thank you!",False,True

Lost down to BMI 17ish. Weight restored to about BMI 19 and maintaining ~5 months, eating abundantly and nutrient dense foods, just got it back yesterday!  In my non professional opinion, it's about quality of diet and severity of behaviours more than BMI, as I've lost gained weight and my cycle a few times now at various stages of ed",False,False

I really care about my health so the lack of period is like ***YIKES*** but it doesn't seem to be comin' back anytime soon so I guess i'll just keep playing the monthly game of mystery. Keeps my life exciting,False,True

Now would be the time where I'm actually supposed to be bleeding. But instead its just replaced with... (tmi) more than usual womanly fluids. I'm like... Is this supposed to be my period?? Lmfao not complaining but kinda complaining",False,True

It's very strange feeling all of the PMS symptoms coming on but with no actual outcome. It's a game of WILL I GET MY PERIOD THIS TIME??... Mostlikely, not. I've spent a lot of wasted money on pregnancy tests",False,True

I never really considered it being the reason why I've had crazily irregular period because I have never been actually underweight. But after looking back and doing the math, it really follows along the timeline of cutting my calories over the last 1-2 years. I really hope i can regain it without gaining weight especially since I have not even been in that underweight mark. Good luck to you too man I hope we can both get back in order.",False,True

I’m 4-5 lbs away from an underweight BMI and have pretty much fully lost my period (comes maybe once every month and a half or two months and only lasts a day)  I’m getting pretty nervous. I haven’t purged in awhile, only low-restricted. I hope we both get our bodies in order oof good luck to you",False,False
