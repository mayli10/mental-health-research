I had the same issue but pushed through and have a progress pic that may help you! TW for body checks/body pics (and NSFW!)  https://i.imgur.com/PSE8qvl.jpg  Edit: this was from lifting with little to no cardio other than walking to the store and bus and stuff.,False,False

It helps me realize that the scale is a piece of crap sometimes haha,False,False

And I say this as someone who had a heavy 2-hour leg day yesterday and ate only 500 calories yet am up a full POUND since yesterday.   Lifting is so so so good for creating/preserving muscle and protecting your bones (which are already in a compromised position because of the ED). If you need to, stop weighing yourself for a while and use pictures/measurements/clothing fit to measure progress!",False,False

You're building muscle and burning fat, and it's very important to remember that muscle weighs more than fat. So while the numbers may go up, that's due to muscle growth but you probably actually look leaner. I'd suggest maybe going by progress pictures or how your clothes fit or something instead of the scale.",False,False
