I'm glad she's laid off now though. I think the only way my mother will do such a thing is if I enforce boundaries, but I daren't try, lest she blow up on me.",False,True

Last year it got to the point that I'd literally refuse to hug anyone bc she made me so paranoid. Hand-holding, too. Like bitch you're not subtle I can feel you running your fingers over my bony knuckles.   I remember waking up to her feeling my bones one time. Really early in the morning, I was still half asleep, just vaguely aware she was poking my ribs and rubbing my collarbones. It was super disturbing. She's gotten better about it thankfully, so I hope yours lays off after awhile too.",False,False

Every fucking time my mom touches me it's like some sort of test. Same with my grandma?? Just last week my grandparents stayed over and I know my mom talks shit about my weight when she thinks I can't hear (even though she doesn't to my face too) and when I try to pull away from a hug it's lingers too long and it's like they purposely grab onto me or drag their hand over my hip bone or spine. It's like, yeah I already didn't like being touched but now I extra hate it.",False,False

In the past she's made a deal out of me squirming away, saying things like ""how are you gonna cope with a boyfriend?"" or  ""what's the matter, you don't like me touching you?"" when she blatantly knows I don't like it. She generally just has a disregard for boundaries.   It's almost like they forget we're our own people, not their possession just because they happened to give us life.",False,True

She does it under the guise of rubbing my back or something.
