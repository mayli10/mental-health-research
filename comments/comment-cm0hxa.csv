And even though I am kind of abusing it like a laxative, it‚Äôs still healthier than abusing actual laxatives.   I think doctors just worry it will trigger ED behaviors but I mean, i‚Äôm gonna do this to myself anyway, might as well be a little healthier about it.",False,False

But i‚Äôve been abusing laxatives for ages and have had some pretty bad side effects from them, but that was nothing compared to these pills. Like insanely bad cramps and being glued to your toilet for hours. It‚Äôs actually made me binge less because it‚Äôs such an uncomfortable experience",False,False

Only downside is though you have to lose almost twice as much as an average-sized person before people start to notice thanks to the paper-towel effect. I had to lose 30kg before people really started noticing.,False,False

Here‚Äôs my experience, pardon some of the TMI.   If I eat something fat free or with relatively low fat I don‚Äôt find it makes much of a difference with digestion. A high fat meal, or in my case a binge, you‚Äôll see a massive change in digestion. Basically immediately after eating some of the oil has already gone through your system. It‚Äôs fast, like don‚Äôt eat too far from your bathroom. Then for about an hour after eating you‚Äôll be in and out of the bathroom (literally shitty oil)   -You have to take them about 20-30 mins before eating, the effects last several hours.   -Because is this I have found that purging after eating does not reduce the effects of the medication.   -The experience after eating a high fat meal was enough to almost cure me of my bingeing it was so gross.   -I have not had to use laxatives once since starting this medication. Even if you eat a relatively low fat food, it still pushes everything through your system.   -It has helped with weight loss, not like a miracle, but it‚Äôs noticeably making my progress faster, not hitting long plateaus now. And even days I don‚Äôt see it on the scale I still feel it, like less bloated and such.",False,False
