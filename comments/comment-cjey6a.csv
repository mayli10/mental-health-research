Almost every day I have at least one pre packed thing.

I eat a lot of frozen dinners and canned things and individually wrapped snack foods. Otherwise sandwiches or raw ingredients. Cooking scares me a bit because I only do it in bulk and I don't feel I can be trusted with the bulk amount up front, plus it's a lot of math to figure out what homemade things cost calorically.

Example.  I would prefer to buy the 1 serving of carrot cake that is 440 cal over the 330 cal cheesecake but has 4 servings per container.
