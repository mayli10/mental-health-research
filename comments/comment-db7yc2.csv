Certainly easily explained away by having to take a trip out of town to... help a cousin settle their.... godmother's estate? Something something family emergency. Make a quick, vague excuse for that and reschedule. Email is great because you don't have to speak to anyone in person.  Reschedule now!! You know you won't get any less anxious the more time you put it off, so it's either reschedule now or risk never going back again, and you know you'll benefit from seeing them. Stop considering the scale, start considering the ""compose new email"" button!",False,False
