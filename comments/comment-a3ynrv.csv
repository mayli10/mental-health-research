The ratio is 2 tbsp coconut oil to 1 tbsp avocado oil, you whisk it with a fork, put it into a sealable rectangular container, and store it in your shower, and it lasts about a month before weird gray particles appear.  Use it once a week, and it makes detangling A LOT easier.  Like, using it first thing in the shower, letting it sit as you wash your face and body, then coming back to rinse it out before shampoo and conditioner.  When you condition, it'll take less than a minute.  Just don't overdo it with the mask unless you want to look greasy the next day.  I made that mistake with my bangs.  A little goes a long way.  Hope that helps somewhat :)",False,False

Do everything else regular. Maybe if you don't have anywhere to go right afterward if you are worried. It's good you don't wash it every day though. It at least gives your scalp a chance to recover a little. ,False,False
