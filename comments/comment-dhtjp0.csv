I used to exercise like mad to burn off all my binges but now I’ve got ME and I can’t exercise like I used to, so since I got diagnosed I’ve heaped on the weight because I just can’t stop binging and can’t purge so it just goes straight to my bloated tummy. Now I’m falling back into restriction, I can’t have anything good unless I don’t have anything else.   I’m sorry you’re in this situation ♥️ perhaps it’s a sign you should be a bit kinder to yourself",False,False

I guess it's the restriction-only life for me from now on.",False,True
