(i bailed last time and felt bad about lying about being 'busy' so i went). it was at a dessert place where the desserts were at least 500 cals, if you didn't get any topping or sauce- so really, the desserts were 700-100 each. everybody got one. i did not, i ate my chickpeas and veggies.  but then this one girl, who did eat her 900 calorie creation, told me about her diet and weight loss journey. she works out 6 days/week, 2 hours (1 lift, 1 elliptical), eats \~1200 with one cheat day a week. she's gone from 190 at 5'4"" (BMI 32.6) to 170 (29.2) with a goal of 150 (25.7). I immediately felt like ASS. Which is - ridiculous. I'm 5'8"", 117 (17.8) up from 115 (17.5), with my highest weight EVER (in restoration, during my overshoot) being 150- which was the day after a christmas dinner, when i was painfully bloated since i had dairy AND had my period bloat (;n; back when i had a period!). (bmi \~23). but no, the fact that someone, somewhere, is eating less and moving more - atrocious. despite the fact that i do \~20 hours of exercise through running, biking, bike commuting, indoor cardio. she also squats way more than me which makes sense since she hasn't been underweight and underfed for years.   and now i want to restrict and get thinner, so thin that people wouldn't dare mention weight loss around me. but i'm not a little bitch, i'm going to keep gaining. ugh, ugh ugh ugh. even my restriction is nothing compared to her deficit. i'm such a little bitch. i don't want health problems. but ugh, she eats less than me. calorie restriction is NOT my prescription.",False,False

I've been pretty ok in terms of avoiding ED thoughts, but I accidentally lost 5 pounds through laziness and long work hours. It's happened again and I'm just kinda low key freaking out. Double digits feel so attainable now, and I know I won't be satisfied even then.  It's so unhealthy the way this is happening, but I'm so excited that it's happening.",False,False

I told my girlfriend I would see a therapist about my ed in the new year so now I’ve decided I need to lose 10lbs before I go and see them so I look sick enough lmao.
