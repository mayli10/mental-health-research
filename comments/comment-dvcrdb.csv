Not every patient receives the same treatment, so it’s completely unhelpful (and probably harmful) to make this suggestion. OP, if you do wind up going through treatment you may or may not gain or lose weight, and whatever happens with your weight the most important thing is that you receive proper treatment for the cancer to give you the best shot at full recovery!",False,False

A coworker of mine got chemo for ovarian cancer over the summer (shes in remission now) and she said the chemo made her put on 35 pounds in like 4 months. It could have also been due to her not moving around much during this time, but still.",False,False
