Much more likely that they were sharing a funny memory, or one was telling a joke. If you got into an elevator with a friend, and another person was there, would you ever randomly make fun of/laugh at them? I know I wouldn’t. ",False,False

Happens to me too sometimes but mine tells me that people talk about me behind my back. I know it’s not rational but some days it’s not so easy to be rational, you’re not alone!",False,False

I swear it’s my head voice like “they’re laughing at you, you’re laughable, they’re disgusted with your presence” and that’s the nice stuff. It’s literally so frustrating, because I realize it’s my own projection but it fuels my self hate... I’m on a marry-go-round mentally. ",False,True

I’ve never heard anyone openly talk about someone right in front of them, I would certainly never ever do that and I don’t know anyone who would, it’s foolish to assume someone can’t understand! It’s very unlikely they were talking about you, hope that reassures you a little bit 🙂",False,False
