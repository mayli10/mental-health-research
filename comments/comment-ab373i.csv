Because what I actually want is to live, I just don’t want to live like this.  I want to really live. I want to have a husband and kids and friends and a career (or at least a decent job). I want to not be crippled by anxiety and phobias. I want to be a normal person who can get in my car and drive wherever I want or need to go, rather than being the person who is terrified of even driving two miles to the grocery store. I want to be able to look people in the eye and have a normal conversation, rather than avoiding eye contact and stumbling over my words because I’m too busy in my head thinking about how ugly I am and how stupid I sound. I want to be able to do normal day to day activities like everyone else, instead of being exhausted all the time and often foggy from migraines. I want to be strong and happy and confident and independent. I want to love and be loved. I want to be able to love or at least like myself. I want to be an actual person.  But I’m none of those things, have none of those things, and no matter what I do or how hard I try that’s never going to change. And it’s not because of the ED either. I always hear people talking about their lives before they got sick, everything they’ve lost to the ED. Or everything they will gain by recovering. But I can’t relate to that because there is no “before” or “after” for me. Everything that is fundamentally wrong with me/my life was wrong long before the ED, and continued to be wrong while I was “recovered”.  I am afraid of dying. I always get pissed off about still being alive and well when at my sickest I really should not have survived. But at the same time, when my heart is beating funny or I’m having trouble catching my breath, or whatever else happens where I’m convinced I’m about to die, I am terrified.  So no, I don’t exactly want to die. But I also don’t want to live like this for another few decades. I don’t like either option, but if I’m going to suffer no matter what, I’d rather it be over with sooner than later.",False,False

When I was in the depths of my ED, I wanted to die. Right now being more or less physically recovered, I don't actively want to die, but I don't exactly value my life all that much. We don't get to choose when we die. Tomorrow I could be hit by a car and that would be it, and honestly the idea of that happening isn't that big of a deal to me because I don't think any life, especially mine, really has all that much value. I know it's not right or Biblical to even think that way and I'm working on changing it, but two years ago when I went through depression and planned my suicide, my perspective on life changed a lot. Bottom line I don't think the ED itself makes you desire suicide in and of itself. That comes from other more serious underlying stuff and/or depression.
