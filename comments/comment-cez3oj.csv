And I feel so fucking out of control. I wish I could just eat. It seems so simple. Chew and swallow but no, I’m too crazy apparently. So the next time someone tells you (aka you tell yourself) that you wish you could be like one of those in-control restrictors, remember that’s your ED voice trying to tell you that you’re not “sick enough” or “worthy” of getting treatment or care.   We’re all just different colors of fucked up. Good luck to you!",False,False

I don’t think many people realize how it can be a compulsive mental illness not a cute and quirky thing like the other stereotype of the skinny athletic girl who carelessly eats huge amounts of food on a regular basis. Some people don’t even see it as a problem because it’s so habitual for them",False,False

There’s this perception that restricting = control and binging = lack of control but people with restrictive eating disorders are in no more control than you are. If anorexics had control, they could stop at any point, but they don’t, they keep going until they die from malnutrition. If you ever watched an anorexic trying to eat a meal that was forced on them, you would see that they have absolutely zero control over their impulses, same as you. Your problems are valid seeking help for. Please talk to your therapist — you don’t have to live like this.",False,False
