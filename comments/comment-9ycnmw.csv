My favorite flavors are Pina Colada, Black Cherry Vanilla, Star Blast, Cotton Candy, and Purple Guava Pear. The rest have an insanely sweet candy taste to me, especially Rainbow Unicorn, it was too much for me. I love Bang. Definitely considered buying the big packs from gnc but I always feel bad about the caffeine consumption and they tend to keep me bloated. But they are incomparable to other energy drinks in taste, nutrients  (lol), and caffiene content. I can hardly stomach sugar free rockstars but I'll do it if I can't get Bang.",False,False
