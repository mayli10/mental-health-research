I have been kinda forced into recovery and not really wanting it and it feels like I can no longer control myself. I got into it for body image but kept it as it comforted me and I honestly hate my period, so I didnâ€™t miss it ðŸ˜­ i was never really underweight, actually close but still looked healthy. Is there anyway where I can still maintain the look I like and be healthy? ( i know Iâ€™ll probably put on a couple pounds, but anything is better than what I have right now) I am honestly exhausted from this",False,True

No warning.  It's not even spotting, it's like a really light period (to be detailed, less than a third of a tampon) and it lasts 2 days.  Then I'll go 11 months, 15 months and it'll happen again.  It might just be your body being a dickhead like mine.  I wish I'd worked harder to get mine back because the pain from my bones is really disgusting all the damn time.  I get what you mean about looking ""normal"" 100%.  Hey, that's why I'm all brittle boned.  Idk, I'm not one to offer advice, but it's not worth it.  When these weirdo periods happen it's always a shock like the first time I started my periods.    I've recovered in the past (complete with periods) and the change into a ""new"" (ie healthy, ""normal"") body is difficult to adjust to, but it becomes part of you again.  (I know I relapsed, but that wasn't connected to body image).  I hope you don't fall back into the cycle of working hard to lose then working hard to gain.  It does mess up your system (as well as I don't like to think you'll be stuck with your ED for years in the future).  Inbox always open.  x",False,False
