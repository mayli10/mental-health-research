I’m scared it will increase tension in my relationship since my partner doesn’t see the need for treatment or understand it goes beyond “just eat 3 meals a day.” And I do not want to change my weight unless it was losing more. I know that if I gain any weight at all, I will start feeling like I don’t want to live anymore. Happened last time I was in treatment over 3 pounds.   My therapist is calling a different Center today to ask about PHP. The other girl in the IOP I’ve been in said she had a bad experience at the PHP place, stopped going, and would never go there again. If she’s there today, I’m going to ask her to elaborate. I had an assessment with the PHP place 4-5 years ago and did not feel comfortable with them. It took 5 hours, they said I did not qualify so I don’t know why they needed to make it such a long assessment. I have trauma issues and they used a male social worker. I said I wasn’t comfortable with that and their solution was to bring the female program director in with him and leave the door open (no privacy). I was talking about having been out of treatment for a few months and experiencing what I guess is called reactive eating, difficulty with cooking and some damage in apartment contributing to that but also fears, and the director said something like if you gain 50+ more pounds come back in. Umm ok, yeah I’ll have serious physical health problems, probably a lot of other issues by that point...thanks for minimizing my concerns, wasting my time and gathering all this info to turn me away and tell me I don’t need any help and it’s fine. I was asking if I could join an outpatient support group or IOP, she said IOP is only for people who complete PHP and you don’t need that. You’ve just had a bunch of treatment...  So, I don’t know the details of that program except that they moved from the top floor of a hospital where it was when I went for the assessment a few years ago to another location farther from where I live (maybe 45 minutes).",False,True

My boyfriend doesn’t see the need for any treatment at all. My family said try IOP first. Since I declined residential, the clinician said I could try IOP if I started right away, and that if I didn’t start right away that they probably wouldn’t accept me. That was on a Thursday and I started that next Monday. I had appointments Tuesday, then went back Wednesday and didn’t go the rest of the week or next Monday or Tuesday because we had a planned trip to visit family and celebrate my boyfriend’s birthday. I told the clinician this during the assessment and suggested starting after that since I wasn’t going to ruin his birthday weekend and they seemed ok with it. When I returned from that, the clinicians were all over me about missing so much programming, which was frustrating because they knew from the start, it was a planned commitment I had before I signed up and I would have preferred to wait to start until after that so I would not have missed 5 days of programming due to doctors appointments and the trip. If insurance covers by the week not the day, then those aren’t days I’d get back...like that I could attend. They cover 10 weeks, so that’s why I thought that wasn’t the best. The first two weeks covered I attended 5 days, the equivalent of 1 week. In my mind, maybe waiting until I got back and could have started on a full week or at least 4 days instead of having me start when the first 2 weeks I was up front with them and said I could only come 2x the first week and 3x the second week is like is that a good use of my insurance and the program if attendance is meant to be 5 days a week and could that have anything to do with not getting the progress they want...I’m really a week less into the program than the start date makes it appear.   Ugh, sorry that was a total rant and did not answer the question. I’m just so frustrated and did not see this coming. I don’t know if insurance is going to cover it. My boyfriend does not want me to go. My family now says if insurance covers it drop everything and go. I have a disability check that I pay rent and basic bills with. One of my parents is neglectful/emotionally abusive and out of my life mostly. The other I do rely on. They allow me to use a hand me down car and pay for registration and insurance for that. When I see them, sometimes they take me to get necessities that I might be having trouble getting usually toiletries, cleaning products, etc. I also get visa gift cards at holidays from them that really help out so I don’t have to steal to get toothpaste, etc or the occasional treat or going to do something like bowling or getting a picture frame or something to spruce up the apartment that I wouldn’t otherwise get.   I’ll talk more with the clinicians this morning. They have a consultant coming in on Thursdays, so I’m sure she will have something to add. They are going to call my family this morning. I’m going to try to have them call my boyfriend, too. My therapist asked to have them call her as she doesn’t get why they are discharging and saying I need residential and does think I’ve made progress and told me some of the ways she sees it. I’m not isolating myself all the time, am getting out and walking with a friend 1-2 times a week, getting outside and gardening, trying foods I wasn’t trying before, and eating a full meal during the day on weekdays in the program, which I wasn’t doing before either. I used to mostly stay inside by myself, too. I feel like the clinicians are expecting too much for 13 days of 3 hour treatment.",False,True

I'm Canadian, but I wonder if something similar happens here. There are plenty of private treatment centers here where you have to pay out of pocket. The public (provincially funded) treatment options tend to have long waiting lists and mostly consist of outpatient or IOP options, but at least we don't have to pay for it (very very grateful). Not sure about IP, I think most of it is also covered but in my city of over a million people there are only four IP beds available.",False,False

Very typical, unfortunately. Sometimes it's legit, but it can be also be sketch as hell, especially if the facility admits the patient KNOWING they have certain behaviors/diagnoses, and then shortly thereafter claims ""idk we thought we could handle this but it's ~too intense~."" Particularly if they then push a specific alternative facility for the patient. That could be a sign of a kickback/referral fee scheme.   I'm not saying that's what's going on here, but it's something to be aware of if you pursue care. Private treatment centers and their practices are not at all well regulated in the U.S.",False,False

Soooo.... you're too sick for this level of care, so they're discharging you? That makes me furious. Can you get into a residential treatment program? Will your insurance cover it? I noticed you said that your family didn't support residential the first time it was recommended - are you reliant on them for financial support?",False,False
