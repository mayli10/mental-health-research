I canâ€™t imagine living without finding joy in food. So much of what makes life wonderful is tied to food... family, love, celebration. The only thing that makes starving so much of the time worth it is that I get to truly savour and enjoy the food I do eat.",False,False

He basically just eats the same shitty meal every day and then is just done. Heâ€™s also vegetarian and sober.
