I think anyone who's hardcore into dieting, whether ED or not, will like to have the following though:  Cronometer Gold, a multivitamin formulated for malnourished people (chronic dieters usually are malnourished), a glucometer (in the third month, and there's a million ways a glucometer can be useful when dieting), beef broth and/or green tea, salt, NoSalt, magnesium in a bioavailable form, a gift card for their local grocery store, a talk-therapist finder service (so they can get looked at for EDs if they don't know they have one already), and strips and batteries for the glucometer (starting the third month).  Socks aren't exactly a consumable. Other than the glucometer, everything I have listed is consumable.",False,False
