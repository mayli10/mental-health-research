Whenever people ask what I’m doing I say “oh I walk more and don’t eat whole pizzas” which is true to a certain extent but either I don’t eat at all or I do eat the whole pizza and purge lolol.

I would wear nothing but leggings and oversized sweaters because I couldn’t dare to try in my old clothes or go shopping.   After I weighed myself for the first time since then (a few days ago) I had a nervous breakdown that I’d gained 20 pounds. I’ve eaten around 500 calories since then. I keep trying on my old size 4 and 6 shorts and crying when I couldn’t zip them up, looking at old pictures, and taking adderall to make me feel a bit happier and curb my appetite.   It fucking sucks man. I just wish I could be happy and think about something else for a change.   Sorry for the rant, it does feel good to get this out.
