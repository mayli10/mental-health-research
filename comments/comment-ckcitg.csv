When I finally saw a psychologist for the eating disorder I had been battling for nearly a decade, I was diagnosed with atypical anorexia. Only about a month before the appointment I was at my lowest ever weight, certainly within the parameters of your 'typical' anorexia shall we say. Even when I saw the psychologist I was still underweight, but had started to gain weight (due to pressure from those around me, not recovery). Since at the time I had only been fixing my body and not my mind, this diagnosis was like a kick to the gut, and drove me right back down the hole of restricting, so that I would finally be deserving of a 'real' anorexia diagnosis. Sure, I'm sick, but imo that label is destructive af.",False,False

A diagnosis does not give very specific instructions of individual treatment plan and never intends to, just highlights the issues that people with that diagnosis are facing.   And yes, it's definitely a huge issue that insurance companies view a very serious mental and physical illness as somehow less serious than another one, and that needs to change. This is completely on them and their shitty practices, though, not the diagnosis. Bulimia, BED, and OSFED are all life-threatening regardless of the weight of the patient, and this needs to be acknowledged.

Someone who is in a healthy weight range may gain weight when returning to healthy eating habits, but the change their is fixing their behaviours rather than the weight. Diagnosing someone with AN immediately flags to all healthcare providers that their weight specifically is an immediate threat to their health, whereas an OSFED diagnosis has different priorities.   I understand for that a lot of people, recieving the OSFED diagnosis is invalidating, but honestly I think the issue there is in a lack of public awareness of how serious and real these diagnosis are, and their own ED thinking interpreting it as ‘not as good as AN’. In reality, there is nothing at all in the DSM to suggest that an Atypical Anorexia diagnosis is in any way less valid. It just describes the presentation of the illness for many people. Just as the BN diagnosis doesn’t require being below a certain weight, because it can present at a variety of weights.
