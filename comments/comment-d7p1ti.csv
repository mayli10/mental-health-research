And yes, dry fasting is TOUGH no matter what your state of mind... But thank you for your concern and Shana Tova in advance :)",False,True

Especially as there‚Äôs a lot of feasting going on these 2 months. Unfortunately a dry fast is mandatory unless you can get an exception from a rabbi which I highly recommend if you think this will cause a relapse. Don‚Äôt hurt yourself over this the intent of Yom Kippur isn‚Äôt punishment. May H-shem give you the strength to get through this and help you realize you‚Äôre stronger than you give yourself credit for.  :( I wish it was only a fast not a dry fast but soul cleansing wasn‚Äôt meant to be fun.,False,False

Muslim here, and I was healthy enough to be able to fast during Ramadan again this year (had to stop due to other health problems years ago) and I really wanted to, so I did - but it was hard.   I was so scared of being too hungry by the end of day and then binge during my one meal of the day. Eating so late (finished eating around half 9) and so close to going to bed was terrifying. Not being able to drink water to fight the bloating was a nightmare, as well as the never ending offering of sweets, dattes, and fatty food during Eid.   Reading again and again about why I was doing it really helped dissociate fasting from the ED. Fasting can be so spiritual and does not have to be associated to weight loss at all times.  I hope you have a wonderful holiday, stay safe.",False,False

Allow yourself to feel what you feel and think what you think.  Pray for forgiveness of these thoughts and the things you did to your body in the past.  The holiness of the day will help you through.  No use quashing down thoughts that need to be addressed.,False,False

My family usually celebrates the end of the fast by getting tons of junk food, and I'm so hungry that I binge like crazy until my stomach feels like someone punched me 299392929 times.

I don't think it applies in this case since I'm still mostly recovered tho. My ED was always of the more back and forth kind, which meant it never caused much physical harm. Plus I still consider myself to be mentally healthy despite this little slump. It's more that I want to be able to fully immerse myself in fasting + shul without ED thoughts getting in the way :/ But you're right, that is a very real concern to take into account!",False,True

If you think fasting will cause you to focus more on your disorder and ruin your recovery efforts than the holiday, take the pass and do the safe thing for yourself and your body. That‚Äôs more of a mitzvah and commandment than strict fasting.",False,False

Though I'm not recovered, the last couple of years I've always had trouble with Yom Kippur EXACTLY because of ED thoughts.. I think the best idea of how to manage that is to not log in the fast in any app/diary, partaking with going to the Synagogue (which I don't do, but if you do then I imagine it can help), and maybe just try to be with close family/Friends for most of the day! If you can go out on Yom Kippur I'd suggest that too!  Where I live the streets are empty of any cars on that day (Besides for emergency stuff- ambulances, firetrucks, cops etc), and a lot of families are out walking and children go to the parks together etc.  P.S Sorry for my English, it's my second language (After Hebrew!)",False,False
