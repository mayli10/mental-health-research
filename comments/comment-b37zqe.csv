I had a similar experience while at a retreat that I desperately needed for my mental health. It was my birthday, and my first one of the next level retreats. Someone noticed that I hadn‚Äôt actually eaten lunch so they asked me to stay behind during an important small group session. I was then forced to eat in front of someone I was very close to and someone I was not whatsoever. Guess which one sat directly across from me at the table watching me eat every bite. That shit fucked me up so hard, I honestly think that I would have attempted to end my life when I got hope, but by some random intervention, another person asked me if I would feel okay just listening to what she had to say in a private setting. She told me that she had an ED and that EDs supposedly take 12 years to fully recover from and a bunch of other stuff to help me feel that I wasn‚Äôt alone in this.
