I am often surprised by how inward thinking I am. I would have expected someone like me to stare at what other people are buying at the supermarket or being more curious in general. But I'm too self obsessed lol. I think the only exception would be if there was someone at work who was very thin, but I've never known anyone at work to be as hard to figure out as me. I've known maaaannny skinny colleagues who are the 'mars bar for lunch' types (I judge those because I see that as lazy restriction) but I've never noticed someone who seems super balanced but thin - and that would be the only type of person to really make me curious.",False,False
