Binged for a month 1/2 and gained like... 20+ pounds lol. Was at my highest weight and felt horrible. I was /so/ done with restricting, and couldn’t even imagine having to restrict another x amount of months to get all the weight off. I was exhausted. Hardest thing I’ve ever done, but the day after that I began recovery. Been about a week but we’re pushing through.  I totally feel you. Why the hell does it half to matter? It shouldn’t. It’s so dumb. Yet it consumes our lives. Fuck. Anyways, good luck. This is all so shitty &amp; I wish you the best.",False,False
