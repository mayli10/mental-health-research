And it’s like mmm dat seratonin of feelin empty and knowing no way did you gain any weight todayyy ☺️  It’s up to you if you want to fast right after breaking the fast one. See how your body does after the first. If you get pretty miserable and close to passing out/actually pass out, I’d suggest having at least 1-2 eating days between fasting. After a few fasts you get a bit more accustomed and tolerant of not having food in your system and your body can handle more.",False,False

I feel pretty good rn. My friend wants to hang out outside and tan so that’s a good low energy thing. She already ate lunch so no reason to lie and say I already ate or whatever. I think I’ll be fine till tomorrow evening which will be pretty cool! I’ve never done this before! Would it be benificial to break the fast with what you suggested to eat then do another 24-36 hour fast again?   Also thanks for all the info I’m a a newbie obviously and at a weight plateau rn.",False,True

If I’m feeling bad tonight I’ll have a banana, maybe steamed veg with seitan. But if not then I’ll go till tomorrow.

Non-acidic fruit (i.e, a peach, apple, banana, etc.), plain toast, rice with a little bit of soy sauce, a small PBJ, steamed veggies. I usually can’t handle a lot right off the bat, otherwise I get massively bloated and terrible and either poop my pants or vom a bit.
