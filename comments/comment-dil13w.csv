I couldn't tell if you were looking for ""tips"". Your binges are real and that was a terrible way for me to phrase that.  Also, I meant that binges are irrational and thus hard to control, so I am agreeing with you. I didnt mean binges are irrational so don't do them haha. I guess I meant someone cant necessarily talk you out of one considering you don't talk yourself into one.",False,False

I know binging is irrational but it's just one of the parts of my ED that is hard to control.  I would keep only ""safe"" foods in my house if I could, but I live with my family. I wouldn't want to force my younger siblings to restrict their eating too.  I consider my binges to be real. I don't really count how many calories I consume while binging, but I would guess around 1000 - 1500. Usually I eat really unhealthy food like chips, bread, desserts, etc.",False,True

Binges aren't rational. You could try to keep healthy food around that you don't like to binge on. Are You talking about a real binge, or just eating?",False,False
