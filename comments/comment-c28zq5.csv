If you actually opened up, told people about your struggle, that you have an ED or if you started to look really sick.. Then I think your family and friends would support you and be worried, instead of laugh with you ðŸ˜Š  I would be shocked if they didn't support you if you tell them you are in need of help, and they know about it. ED's are secret little monsters, that are very good at hiding ðŸ‘¾",False,False

No one worries about me either because I make the whole thing in to a joke. That is what I am TRYING to do though. People are disarmed by humor.     You may need to actually tell them you are upset if you are upset. Think of how genz/millenials use dark humor and say ""I want to die"" jokes all the time. I'd people took them literally we would all be locked up. Humor disarms.",False,False

And they will laugh, even though I failed at it being actually funny to begin with lol If they knew you were actually struggling maybe they wouldnt laugh, or maybe they would keep laughing because they care thinking it's a way for you to cope with it :)",False,False
