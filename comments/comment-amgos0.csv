Nothing like needing special tights because the normal ones for the costume are too small to get over your giant thighs. Bonus that I have a small chest, so I may find a dress that fits over my hips but is huge up top.   I like my butt now because I've had so many guys who compliment it, but at the same time I wish i could be hour-glass shaped or something.",False,False

Women naturally tend to be bottom heavy, but I'm bottom heavy in a boxy, abrupt way. I've noticed the body type more often on people of 'my race,' but it could also be due to confirmation bias on my part. The best approximations I can think of is the differences between Rihanna and CLC's Seunghee, or even Rihanna and Brown Eyed Girls' Jea. Pants would always fit my thighs well before properly fitting at the waist.  &gt;but after puberty I developed into what I feel looks like squidward after he went ham on all of those krabby patties.  **Relatable.** I even retained his noodly squid arms and massive feet...
