I don't know if it's just because I'm awkward and ungainly, but the only way I was able to completely get rid of shin splints/overall shin pain was by transitioning from midfoot striking to forefoot striking. Your calves and ankles will have to work a little harder but once you get used to it, you're golden.",False,False

I got them very badly at my lowest weight when I ran a lot, and I remember being told it was overexertion OR incorrect running techniques. And even me running now w a higher weight I experience less shin splints   For remedies, the comment i read nailed it!  Also you can do toe raises if you don’t have a foam roller to stretch it out and try to rest if you can!   Good luck ❤️",False,False

I do own a foam roller and so I tried that after readin this but wowwwww it hurt like hell. I am going to have a hot bath so I may try again after that.  Unfortunately the little gym at my complex only has treadmills soooo I'm gonna ice the heck out of them and rest tomorrow at least. Maybe monday I can just walk my usual route outside. Better than nothing.  But again, thank you!",False,True

Icing and some ibuprofen to decrease swelling from impact can help. Stretching and rolling tight calves like you already do can help somewhat if that is a cause. If you have access to a gym, try working in elliptical running, pool running, or stationary biking to let your legs recover. If not, avoid running on pavement as much as possible. Obviously it's best to totally rest and not run but let's be realistic here",False,False
