It’s not even a weight thing anymore, I’m just repulsed by my naked self so I can’t imagine anyone else could see something different. Underweight, I feel gross. Normal weight, I feel gross. I just can’t stand being touched anymore anyways so it all works out. Even a good hate fuck with a fwb wouldn’t make it worth it because I’m sure he would actually be repulsed by me in my current state lol. I’m underweight but have loose skin from all the weight I’ve lost and I just feel like...yuck.  And now I’m in treatment so I get to deal with weight gain and the fucked up weight distribution. So yeah what up life of celibacy lmao. *fuckingcry*",False,False
