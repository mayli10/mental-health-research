But it's not from too much restricting yet. I could just eat everything, anything. Sometimes I'm afraid if I'm not paying attention, food will just magically become something I've eaten without me actually eating it, and I'll feel it in my stomach and congealing under my skin.",False,False

Your hunger signals are fucked right now and you can't rely on them. All of the times that I've made progress you start of on a meal plan that is scheduled. If you keep following it and manage ED symptoms eventually you will get normal hunger signals back. I've been in recovery for over a year and i can say that I'm not completely insane with hunger any more like it used to be. ,False,False
