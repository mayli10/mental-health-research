One thing you could do in terms of numbers/values is have the subtypes as breakdowns of the criteria they're under, like how on nutrition labels you have fat and then it's split into the different types, or carbs are split into sugars and fibre. I do that sometimes in my charts like I'll log a meal with the total calorie values etc for easy reading but then under that I'll have it split into the meal components.   I also think having boxes summarizing each section is a really good idea! Colour coordinate for ease of reference (or not, I just like to colour coordinate everything haha)",False,False

I'd put some sort of disclaimer though, since it seems almost a stereotype of what an ED looks like. Of course not everyone with an ED uses food logs/CICO apps, and not everyone who uses Lose It has an ED.",False,False

App looks), and then have different categories for each day. So like, Diagnostic Criteria could be march 1st, Etiology as march 2nd, etc.  I would then assign calorie values to each bit of information. I was thinking of giving higher values to more significant info, but i realize that what i find significant could be different from what othef people think is significant, so I may not do that and instead just give random values.   Information would be broken up. Ex: under the diagnostic criteria, i could have one criterion be listed as one item in the log, and another criterion as a different item in the log. Different subtyoes would also be listed in this fashion.  For most items, I'm thinking of summarizing them in shortish sentences. If i need to write a lot in order to enconpass all the important info, i could have a box off to the side that is listed as ""nutritional info for *item*""",False,True
