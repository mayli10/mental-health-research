My last Christmas event surrounding food was last night (23) as I work in healthcare (so on Christmas Day) and I had the same mentality! I ate 4 mud balls and 4 peanut butter balls and ice cream cake *and* a full turkey meal.    When I got home I tossed all the remaining junk I got for the season, even whatever I got as a Christmas gift. I'm just *done* with the junk. I had my fun and I'm ready to have my control.",False,False

It sucks but like eventually I just end up forgetting to drink sometimes.  I mostly just drink during meals anyway and not much else during the day (ARFID) so when I fast I donâ€™t have meals to have drinks with.  This is a terrible problem I need to work on but basically thatâ€™s my answer: cuz most fasts are dry fasts for me,False,False
