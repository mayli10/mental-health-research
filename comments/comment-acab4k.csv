I'm more inclined to get all preachy with people who've had EDs for a shorter time than people who've been alive for a shorter time, though, yknow? If you started at 12, by the time you're 15 you're very aware of the fact you're hurting yourself, while somebody's 22 and just starting to flirt with restriction or purging might not know anything beyond the generic ""iTs DanGeROuS"" that's drilled into our heads in high school.

I think in the case of underage posters, my go-to is:  1.	Encourage communication with caregivers if possible 2.	Harm reduction/assuage irrational or compulsive thoughts (I really like the trend of telling posters that although they FEEL fat, their stats indicate that they objectively ARE NOT fat)  ",False,False

It is important to let minors have a space to vent (like OP suggested) and that is why this space and proed were so special, because we try to focus on how this is an *illness* and **not** a lifestyle.   Harm reduction is important, and making it clear that eating dissorders can cause you to have untrue thoughts/ideas (sometimes to the point of delusional thinking). It is important for us to help eachother recognize those types of false thoughts/ideas.  For example, I saw a post the other day about how some people are afraid taking a bath/shower makes you gain weight. We can help recognize that you cannot gain fat through skin absorption. Water will not make you gain actual weight. I saw a documentary about adolescence with eating dissorders and this young girl literally thought she was going to gain fat on her body from drinking water. She thought the world was lying and water had calories. It was heartbreaking to watch.  At the same time I think it is really important to treat people like people. Sometimes it is hard to speak in a way that is not condescending. I try to remember what I was like at 14 and how I would feel if someone acted like they knew more just because they were older.

I feel like it is kind  of a RESPONSIBILITY for an adult to point it out when a child is engaging in harmful behaviours....   &amp;#x200B;  Thank you for making this post.
