If veggie burgers had the same B12 quantity as meat I could see them being a good replacement, but B12 is rare outside of meat. It's usually added into fortified foods. Fat and salt aren't necessarily bad. I plan around the amount of salt I intake to get enough without getting too much. Lipids are needed to maintain a healthy body just as carbs and proteins are in the right amounts. If you check out [this meal plan I made](https://imgur.com/KTLu8k2), it does contain almost entirely healthy fats, contains an optimal ratio of omega-3 to omega-6 fatty acids, offers perfect macronutrient ratios (45% carbs, 25% proteins, 30% lipids) according to my personal needs, offers healthy amounts of all vitamins and minerals without supplements (*except D3, but that's very rare in food and we typically synthesize enough from the sun but I live in Canada where supplementation is recommended*) including potassium which only 5% of people get enough of, it provides just the right amount of fiber (*which is good because too much can cause problems just as not enough can*) for an average person, contains very few added sugars and not too much sugar overall even when natural sugars are included, does not contain more than the recommended upper limit of caffeine for someone of my size, provides the recommended amount of water for an average person, many of the foods listed are single-ingredient foods or made with less than 10 ingredients (*more than half are natural foods, few processed foods*), and it's an easy plan to follow which is great between my poor overall health and busy schedule. It is rather expensive though and I can't eat that much without getting sick, so that's something I would need to work up to after becoming able to afford it. It would be tough to work up to eating that much and working out the right amount to be able to exercise at the same time to help improve my health without overdoing it and making myself worse or making myself lose more weight instead of maintaining a healthy weight. I currently stick to [this similar meal plan](https://imgur.com/ZKWouG5) because it's easier and cheaper, but it relies on a multivitamin and could use another 1.25g of fiber to properly balance the net carbs and the macronutrient ratios are a little high in carbs and low in protein. Not by much though. 20% protein and 50% carbs. Not ideal, but not bad.  Bringing up the meat industry, yes it is terrible but so is every other industry. Capitalism is awful in general. Even the vegetable farm industry is awful. Tons of ""pest"" animals are killed to protect crops, plenty of human workers are exploited, plenty of communities lose their sources of food or access to arable land in order to support Western markets, plenty of companies use up too much water which leads to droughts around their factories and farms, and so many other problems. You can't live without supporting terrible industries. We can all do our best by doing things which help in small ways; by not buying unnecessary products like bottled water (*I know bottled water is helpful in some cases, but the average person can use a reusable bottle*), by properly recycling any trash that we can, by voting for politicians who care about labour rights and environmental responsibility, by choosing fair trade options when available, and in so many other ways, but at the end of the day no individual is able to make a substantial change. Even if the majority of us made all of these choices and stuck to them perfectly the impact would be marginal in comparison to the vast damages done by governments and corporations. Often time we may even rely on the people doing the most damage and so avoiding them isn't an option. Like, for example, I can't just avoid all government service or refuse to pay taxes because I don't support the way my government is treating the people of Wet'suwet'en in favour of an oil pipeline. I can only help in tiny ways by spreading information or speaking out against it. The impact of my own behaviour will be very small though. It won't be enough to single-handedly shift the balance away from the government and the oil companies. I can't even avoid supporting the oil companies because I need to go places outside of walking distance sometimes. That means I need either to be personally driven to those places or use public transportation. Either case uses oil because electric vehicles aren't standard yet. Even if they were coal power plants haven't been entirely phased out yet which is another thing I can't personally control. I can try my best to change these things, but I can't even guarantee that my actions will help even a little. That's exhausting. There are many good things I can do with my energy that have guaranteed results or at least are more likely to have successful results. So in short, it is of minimal concern to me how bad the meat industry specifically is. I care, but I not more than I care about all of the other issues I mentioned. I try to avoid meat in most of my meal plans, but I'm trying to look out for my health and I have to make realistic decisions which means decisions that I can follow through with which will have a positive effect on my life. At the bottom line I at least can't help others if I can't even look after myself.  For veggie products specifically, I know that Canada has a really good pea protein industry which would be nice to support, but I can't stand peas and pea proteins are a main ingredient in the highest rated meat-alternatives. They can use other pulses as well like beans and lentils sometimes. I do like some beans like soybeans, kidney beans, and pinto beans, but I also absolutely hate some like black beans. Most non-pea pulse proteins are made of soy which I personally like, but a lot of people are strongly against soy proteins which makes them harder to market than pea proteins as a vegan/vegetarian friendly option. I definitely agree that the average person eats way more meat than they should. There's no reason for meat to be present in every meal or for it to be the main component of a meal. That doesn't necessarily mean people should consume no meat at all though. I don't believe I have ever come up with a totally meat-free meal plan that didn't rely on supplements for any vitamins or minerals. I checked all of my best meal plans and the closest I came was a plan with multiple supplements that had very little fat or protein, so it was super carb-heavy. Unless you don't count fish in which case I did come even closer in a meal plan that includes canned tuna. Canned tuna is known to be pretty low quality though. You have to be careful with fish in general because of the abysmal state of our planet's oceans. Ocean fish also aren't a normal part of the human diet. Compared to the entire evolutionary span of the human species it has been a rather short amount of time that we have been seafaring creatures. Most veggie burgers also do not actually have as much protein as a McDouble as you claimed. Burger King has one that does, but most veggie patties are between 7-12g of protein. Some are around 15 or 20, but not most. It depends on the ingredients used to make the patty. Most also don't taste the same, but I can't necessarily say I prefer the taste of meat over vegetables. It's simply not the same as people often claim. Maybe those new ones that came out recently, but I haven't tried them yet. The marketers advertising them could easily be lying for all I know.",False,False

One thing that no other adults understand is they each get one dessert a day no matter what. So if they want to eat a spoonful of Nutella for breakfast, ok. That’s fine, they just won’t have some other dessert later. I ask them what they are at school and if they didn’t get enough of any particular macro so we can make sure to cover that at dinner. We try new things on a regular basis, but no one has to finish their food if they don’t like it.
