Decades of gaslighting has led me to doubt that I'm anything but lazy and incompetent, despite years of therapy and health interventions.

Difficult to deny when there's a massive list of symptoms and I'm like, yup, yup, yup.  The only ones I don't have are cutting food into small pieces and eating slowly.    The fact I never exercised made me convinced I wasn't anorexic because walking aimlessly for hours isn't hitting the gym or doing star jumps.",False,False
