I’ve never felt better honestly. I don’t get hungry and never feel “too full” I eat with intermittent fasting during my 8 hour window and it works great!   I’m always up to talk keto! I’m sure my boyfriends sick of hearing about it at this point 😂,False,True

I really do feel better when I don’t eat carbs, but it gives me that feeling of control over my food and diet without really slipping into physically unhealthy restrictions. I also don’t get that feeling of “ugh I’m so full I’m going to pop” when I eat very low carb, even if I have the same volume of food or the same calorie count.   I also legitimately have some weight to lose, and I’ve found that even without consciously restricting, I stay within a 500-1000cal deficit. In addition, I feel like I respond to a high or low cal day more like a “normal person.” If I eat a lot of calories one day, I’m less hungry and eat less the next few days (and vice versa).   PM me if you want to talk more about keto with an eating disorder. I am a huge advocate of it and I’m willing to answer any questions people might have :)",False,False

I use Cronometer to make meal plans so I know exactly what I need to eat to maintain perfect health.,False,False
