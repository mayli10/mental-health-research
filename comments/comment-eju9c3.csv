So I'm also pretty fucked up in head is it just a symptom or is it the main problem and how the fuck do I go on with it. Substance abuse is pretty fucked up cause I can't put a finger on why did I decide to use speed all the time, to feel better or to be skinnier, or cause I wanted to be an addict or... fuck I'm going  cold turkey off amphetamines and alcohol and you scheadlue me just for ED treatment with a waiting list. I think I'd go crazy without my therapist cause psychiatrist are for fuck here.",False,False

Not only did I end up with PTSD but an eating disorder too from all those ""unprocessed"" emotions.  It's kinda all interconnected. If you see a therapist they can help you sort it all out.",False,False
