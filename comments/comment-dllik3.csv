Likely anything 1000-1500 calories isn’t going to make you gain at all. Water weight, yeah, probably. I would sincerely doubt you’d need to fast for more than a day to counterbalance it.   I do a lot of planned binges, so damage control is kind of my thing. And even with these binges, I only need to fast for 36, *maybe* 60 hours. Never 5 days, even if it’s a liquid fast. (I do 36 since I start my fasts at night, so then the fast ends the next morning and I actually have a day with nothing except Red Bull logged).   I plan my fasts around my sleeping schedule, that way I’ll spend a chunk of it asleep and therefore not thinking about it. Melatonin or sleepytime tea can help a lot since sometimes sleeping can get difficult.   If I’m lucky, my fast will be on a work day and I’ll have 8+ hours where I’m running around like nuts and too busy to stop and eat. If it’s an off day, I figure out things to do that’ll take my focus off of any hunger or food. Going for walks with little to no money so I can’t buy food, going to the park, etc. I’ll shop around for things I don’t actually need but wanted to look into like a new bike or garden set up. I’ll read, play video games, do a lot of self-care. Lots of long baths, painting my nails, face masks, shaving my legs incredibly thoroughly. I actually started epilating my legs because it takes almost 3 hours and hurts like a bitch. I’ll nap a lot. Spend time with my rats. I’ll clean a lot. Lots of big deep cleans that take hours and everyone appreciates.   I personally drink a lot of caffeine, but if you’re younger, I’d advise to stick with green or black teas. I down probably 500mg+ of it on fast days, and that’s not healthy for anyone’s heart. But caffeine is an effective appetite suppressant. I find flavored waters can feel almost filling; normal water doesn’t really cut it. And I don’t really do any electrolyte drinks, but that’s because I just don’t buy them and ignore my own health. But things like powerade/Gatorade zero are good to have on hand, and if you’re willing to sacrifice a few more calories, body armor lite has drinks that have a *lot* more substance to them than gatorpowerade. But basically I’m constantly drinking and peeing. Which is annoying. If I’m doing a fast thats 2+ days, I’ll allow broth + corn starch “soup” before bed if I’m literally Too Miserable To Sleep.   Basically it’s all about killing time until you can go to bed and wake up and be done with it. Then when it comes to breaking my fast, I eat some oatmeal with almond milk. Gentle on my stomach and filling enough I don’t want to eat more than that. Then I just restrict like normal. 🤷🏻‍♀️ or fast again. Whatever sounds good in the moment  Honestly once you get a “successful” (i.e., one you don’t binge after” fast under your belt, you start figuring yourself and your body out and how to be successful again. Learn when the hunger cues start to become too much and how to calm them down before it becomes a monster.",False,False

Consider getting something to give you an electrolyte boost, either an actual supplement or a bottle of Gatorade. It’s not important if you aren’t doing an extended fast (more than 2 days?), but will help you feel better especially if you are regularly restricting and not eating enough calories overall.   Most importantly, it’s not a failure if you don’t complete the fast you planned to do. If you feel sick and need to stop, take care of yourself and eat something. Fasting seems like a quick fix for weight loss, but it’s not worth it if you bring yourself to the point of nausea and extreme hunger. Stay safe ❤️",False,False

You wont gain anything itll all be water weight and you will be fine.  You can do it, try to forgive yourself and mind yourself. Give yourself a break and treat yourself to something like nice clean sheets or watching your favourite tv show  You'll feel better tomorrow I promise xx",False,False

So do something now to distract from your thoughts, maybe shower, clean something, go for a walk. Do something your brain just does on auto pilot and try to forget about it.   Now a lot of people say fasting is bad after a binge, what I find helps is about 5 days of just liquid fasting, so you can drink coffee with cream, tea with milk, soups and smoothies and all that.  Or you could spend a week focusing on eating 1200kcal and making sure most of it is veg and proteins.   I have found that liquid fasting after a binge is a great way for me to 1, keep at it and 2, I feel so good doing it especially with smoothies.",False,False
