But in my defense, I take really good care of them. I use retinol and sunscreen and moisturizer on them and even wear driving gloves. When Iâ€™m at a lower weight, the tendons are more prominent and my skin is more translucent but not ghostly. I donâ€™t think Iâ€™d ever describe my hands as beautiful, but I like them.
