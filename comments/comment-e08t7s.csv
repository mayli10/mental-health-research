It’s just knowing that the possibility of someone coming out of nowhere or my parent(s) coming home just causes this type of anxiety that makes it nearly impossible for me to purge. The worst is when you eat a 1000cal+ binge and go to b/p, just to spend 30min standing over a toilet knowing that the longer you wait and try then the quicker the food will digest, having a panic attack because of it, yelling at yourself because of this... and having the end result leave you with a bloody and painful throat and this lost feeling of hopelessness. I really don’t know how to truly describe the feeling.",False,False
