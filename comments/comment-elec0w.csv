I guess no sleep until you get more exercise in. With gym I had an excuse, but with this and living alone there are none.  I bought a bike that has a ‚Äútable‚Äù extension so I can put my laptop and mouse there. Computer work and reading is easy, writing not so much.   My favourite is putting on a series on tv, setting my bike in front and I literally forget I‚Äôm working out. I can do it for hours, my NYE I did 8 hours.  Again I do it at a super moderate pace to avoid injuries and while it burns less calories I find it more sustainable. Even if I eat over my calories per day it‚Äôs hard to go over my TDEE and my body looks better 3 weeks in than in restriction prior.  I used to do a lot of yoga and dancing, but had to stop so the bike keeps me sane.",False,False
