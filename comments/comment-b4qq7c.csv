Though I think it's better to live how you want to, do what you always wanted to do and be whatever you want to be, like being yourself and striving to make a better version of yourself. By being yourself you'll attract people who will like you or dislike you and that's ok.. It's your life and you're living it so making it enjoyable would make you feel more fulfilled and content.  Most people mostly care about themselves and their problems anyway, so caring what others think about you is kinda useless. Your happiness is more important than you think. Fears stops us from doing certain things, but they won't go away quickly, so I feel like accepting them and learning to live with them could make us have less regrets in the future.  Idk if this could be relevant to you, I'm just a dumb teenager ¯\_(ツ)_/¯",False,True

I probably make them so uncomfortable.  I also have this weird need to tell others why they should drink coke zero instead when they mention they drink normal coke  me: ""iT hAS likE onE caLorie, iT's aLmoSt wAteR"" Then they look at me like I'm the most insane person ever..

Thinking about all of the things I could/should have been doing while I sit around stuck in my head makes everything so much worse. It doesn't really help anything to just get frustrated with yourself, but sometimes it seems impossible not to.  Such is life, I guess. ",False,False
