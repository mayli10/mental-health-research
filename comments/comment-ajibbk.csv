I also do it with chocolate coated protein bars (the sugar free ones because health) and just eat it like that Kardashian eats her KitKat , but throw out the inside part.  It's so strange and I even know that while I'm doing it! I'm like, ""hey self why not just buy a chocolate bar if you just want the chocolate?  It's less $ and less wasteful""  IDK but maybe it feels more indulgent this way?  Like ooooh, I'm eating these delicious cookies (but really only the chocolate chips out of them).",False,False

I’ll binge on poptarts, but pull off the corners because “it’s less calories that way.” Pulling the corners off does not negate a 400 calorie package of poptarts, but try telling that to my brain.
