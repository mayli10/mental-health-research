Best thing you can do is talk it out.   Don’t be so hard on yourself. If you did eat 200 or 1000 kcals you would still crave a pizza. It’s the thoughts behind it not what the bodies feeling. It’s also a lot of other factors not hunger related.   You should be proud of yourself your working to control you BP. It won’t happen in a day, a week or even maybe a month but you will get to live how you want to live. Sometimes there will be set backs I know I have been there.   From someone who had a bad binge problem I understand. If I can help I will.  Keep talking keep posting.",False,False
