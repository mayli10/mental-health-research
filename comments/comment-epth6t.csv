I have a 25 inch waist and it makes me want to die that it won’t budge below that. Like I don’t think it would get smaller if I lost weight. And I had no idea there were women with 34 inch hips. Tbh that would make me insecure but those would look wack on my frame when I already barely have curves. I think my hips are 37 inches. I hate my fucking body.,False,False
