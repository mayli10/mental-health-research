I've made a spread of it before using water like the directions say and it was super bitter, but making it with unsweetened vanilla almond milk only adds 3 calories (50 vs 53) and it tastes almost exactly like regular PB, just slightly less oily and sweet. Which is fine, because I'm putting it on waffles with syrup, so the syrup sweetness is sufficient to cover up the slight bitterness. Great hack, thank you!
