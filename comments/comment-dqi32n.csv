I'm in relapse hard right now and I know it's been triggered because I just have a lack of control over things in life. My brain wants to have some sort of grip on knowing what's coming next and if I can't have that with things like work or my own safety or financial stuff then I can sure as hell control my own body.   If everything else feels uncertain then at least there's a certainty around how many calories a banana has and I get to make my own decision about whether I want to eat it or not.   Sorry your new job is so chaotic! I hope you manage to find a balance and spread your wings there a bit.,False,False
