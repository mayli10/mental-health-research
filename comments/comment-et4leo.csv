And woohoo, found out that I'm even fatter than I thought I was. My body fat percentage went up post-injury. My leg is healed now, though, so high-restriction and working out all day long here I come!",False,True

If you *want* to obsess and scrutinise and torture and punish yourself then go ahead. If not, CANCEL IT. The results of mine were relieving yet shocking and unhealthily motivating and triggering. I found out things my ED *loves* (“severe fat deficit” and sarcopaenia — evidence to my disorder that I’m making progress at harming myself) but I’m so much more motivated to just get sicker.   I have been obsessed with this scan for the last week. When I’m at the gym, all I can think about is the image from the scan. There was not much fat on it but I know where the most fat on my body is now and it’s all I can imagine when I’m working out and it makes me almost break down at the gym. I’m getting a follow up scan in a couple of months and I *need* the results to be worse to prove to myself and my ED that I’m succeeding at being sick.   At first I thought this scan was an amazing thing but I’ve realised it’s not. I highly recommend cancelling.",False,False

At all. Last month it measured me with what would be regarded as insanely good measurements and bf% by any non-disordered persons standards. And you know what? THOSE numbers didn’t mean shit. All I could think was, “well, I’m 4 pounds from my UGW so I might as well just keep going”. Do not do it, it will do nothing for you. 6 months ago I would have killed for what I saw that day, and I still wasn’t happy.",False,False

If you go and regret going, you're probably going to obsess over the results. You may regret not going, but at least you won't have more nu!need to obsess about",False,False
