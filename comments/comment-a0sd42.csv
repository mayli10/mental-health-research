Honestly I was already low restricting but not obsessively weighing or calorie counting, i guess you could call it kinda a disordered diet? But after I binged the first time I lost it with guilt and turned to fasting/overexercising to compensate, which turned into 15+ years of eating disorder behavior. It's really when my self worth started hinging on how much i weighed and how little I ate. ",False,False

It's addictive.  For better: When I was so exhausted from fasting that I decided to just sit down on the floor for a minute but instead ended up losing 30 minutes staring at a wall without any recollection of time passing.

I was on a couple meds that made my appetite go way up to the point I was borderline obese. I was extremely upset about this but I just could not stop eating. I went off those meds, started a new one which killed my appetite dead for awhile. I literally had to get high to force myself to eat and sometimes that didn't work. And I was like, hey, I could harness this into achieving the weight loss I always wanted and went on to lose like 40 pounds over 6 months. This is also when I started binging for real, although at this point it was only occasionally. Then I started reactively binging throughout the summer, gained ten pounds back, and now I'm back to restricting. It was like, once I became aware that I was capable of losing weight (my weight fluctuated throughout my teen years but never like this), I just ran with it. Ugh.",False,False

On my 3rd relapse (now) when I started outpatient treatment I vowed to myself that I wouldn't lose any more weight, not gain any, but maintain the time I was being seen.  I managed to figure out how to maintain with each weigh in being either a pound under, over or on the dot of my starting weight there.  It felt like a challenge and I felt the way I had done when I realised I could lose weight.  Now I left treatment (didn't gain, didn't lose) and I'm sticking to maintaining until I feel I might want to gain.  I realised that if I wanted to drop weight I could do it easily.  I mean, it's the only thing I know how to do well?  If I did though, I'd have to deal with doctors, treatment teams, medics etc etc more and I want to avoid all that.  The turning point was that really.  I could lose weight if I wanted, but I don't HAVE to.  Maintaining takes more effort.  Even though it's all still disordered eating and calorie calculations and blah blah, it feels hella weird for the first time after so long that I don't have to lose weight.    &amp;#x200B;  The biggest negative turning point was in my early teens.  I didn't even want to diet, but joined my friend on hers for support.  She found it hellish and I found it a buzz.

I just wasn't hungry. I drank water and some juice but didn't eat for a little over 24 hours. It made me feel superhuman, it was so strange how obsessed I really was with eating all the time. It started to click that I gained 120 pounds after high school. So I started to lose weight, lost about 60 pounds and didn't really do much else to get lower.   Next turning point would be when my SO told me he had infact cheated on me with some skinny whore ""friend"" I used to have. Self hate, rage, jealousy, and vengance has become my blood since. I've lost about 15 pounds since, then this month I really got determined now that the grief is gone and all I have is anger. So this month alone I've lost 8 pounds, and intend on losing as much as possible as quickly as possible. I'm fasting frequently, throwing up about 3-5 times a week, and exercising about 20-40 minutes 4-6 times a week. I'm also taking laxatives after I've reached the 24 hour point of fasting to clear out excess waste so when I get on the scale it's my true weight.   So whether it's for the better or worse on how you look at it, for me this is control. I lost control of myself when I decided to eat out of control after getting into my relationship. I lost control when I decided to believe in others over myself. I became powerless to change or to take control of myself. I had my reality robbed from me. So in order to feel in control of myself, I need to be in control of my body. And when I earn my body back, it will be more than earned. So for me this is all for the better. Despite the hate I will always have in my heart, the ruthlessness and endurance I have found within myself will be used for personal and greater good.  ",False,False
