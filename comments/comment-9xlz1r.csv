For now, just make sure to take care of yourself.  Drink a big glass of water and change into some comfy clothes if you can.  Maybe do your eyebrows or paint your nails.  Simple, routine tasks can help you feel more in control.  Stay safe.  &lt;3",False,False

She talks about how she overcame some of the stigma and had a successful life an career.   It does talk about mental illness stigma, so fair warning, it may be triggering, but if you feel up to it, it may give you some hope. She’s an incredible person.",False,False

She does feel hopeful and that makes me feel better. My fiancé has a different psychiatrist than I do and he’s on like 13 pills a day, which scares me. His condition is really complicated.   Yeah, the diagnosis fits my symptoms to a T. We kind of already knew I had it, but to be officially diagnosed just made me snap :(  That’s a great idea! Do you have any suggestions? ",False,True

That is big news to hear.  Does your psych feel hopeful about treatment?  Does your fiance manage well with it?  Do you think the diagnosis fits your symptoms?  I think sometimes the best way to edge back from bingeing is to just try some real and gentle self-care.  Nurture yourself a bit, and give yourself something soothing (and non-self harming) to remind yourself you deserve that too once in a while.    &amp;#x200B;",False,False
