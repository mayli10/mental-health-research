It just hurts so much. This is one thing I almost never bring up to him because I'm so ashamed of it. I am bipolar and come to him at times to talk about that so yes that could be draining. I just don't understand how he could say something so cruel. He has his share of issues and no matter how hard it is I have never and will never say something like that. I don't know what's going on in his head right now as I had to stop talking to him but hopefully tomorrow when I wake up we can talk. I don't know. It just hurts.,False,True

It's important to remember that you can't rely on others 24/7. It can be draining on that person. And if he can't recognize the progress you've made it can make him feel helpless which can be discouraging for him. Understand his perspective and then have a conversation with him about this. About how it made you feel, about how you've made him feel, and about how you can both do better to make each other happy in the future.",False,False
