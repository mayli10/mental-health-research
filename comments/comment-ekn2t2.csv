I notice that you're engaging in a lot of negative self-talk; I don't know if it's like this for you, but when my self-esteem is really low and I get yelled at by someone else, I fall into restriction to punish myself, and that makes me feel like I've set everything right. It becomes a self-perpetuating cycle of feel bad, restrict, feel bad about restricting, restrict. Hurt, hurt, hurt. BUT, why is it that we should feel that we have to harm ourselves for things that aren't all our fault? Why is it that things have to be all or nothing when it comes to how we judge ourselves?  You did a wonderful job recovering and reconnecting and building a relationship, and it just happens that you're sick again. You absolutely can make steps towards recovery again, even if it takes weeks or months or years. If your BF finds out, you can have a conversation about what would build trust, and what would help you to also feel better in your relationship together. You deserve to live a life where you are allowed to stumble and are encouraged to keep going.  I am a massive hypocrite because I am also hiding my ED from my boyfriend and in a cycle of self-harm, and tbh I wrote this as much for me as it is for you. But I sincerely hope that you are able to feel better. I don't know you, but I do know that you are deserving of love, hope, good health, and a better sense of self-worth, and I hope this helps.",False,False
