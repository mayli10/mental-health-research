I’m lucky that my parents have always been fairly hands-off with me; but they still worry and make their comments and try to talk about it with me. There’s only been a couple of times the concept of IP has been brought up and they’re decent about respecting my choice not to go.   But, this disorder does hurt them. They’re not going to ever be “chill” with it. When I get really bad, there’s a lot of anger and tears. So it’s like... I dunno. Just avoid it and try to brush off comments the best you can. And even if it’s shitty, *eat*. Don’t turn down food when you’re there. You can make up for any possible weight gain later. If you really want to avoid a big confrontation, it’s what it takes. As miserable as it is.   Dealing with people who genuinely care about you is the hardest part, I think. It makes you really face what you’re doing to yourself. So the best you can do is ignore it. Wear baggy clothing, say you’ve had a really bad stomach bug so keeping food down had been difficult to do so you did end up dropping a pound or so. In my experience, there’s really not much else to do without a fight.",False,False
