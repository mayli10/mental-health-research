Oddly enough I have found myself able to drink soylent if I just can‚Äôt eat, and I know it has proper nutrition. However, soda, lemonade, or anything ‚Äúuseless‚Äù gives me severe anxiety. It‚Äôs weird, my brain will definitely target some odd things.",False,False

This past five days I‚Äôve been fasting with only liquid calories so I won‚Äôt pass out. I do recommend not ordering something with cream because personally it makes me feel bad with myself, but that doesn‚Äôt have to be you! I‚Äôm still not ready for milkshakes, but things like iced coffee and lemonades always make me feel better when eating because they are easy calories to make rid of.(I don‚Äôt purge, and these calories often go by jogging or by the body itself trying to gain energy for the organs) They are the first step to feeling confident again on eating.",False,False

I'd have way less guilt drinking 200 calories worth of almond milk than eat a couple cubes of chocolate.  On the other hand, I'd rather have a big solid meal of 500 cals than drink all that in a milkshake.",False,False
