I found that when I have horrible binges, it helps to fast for a day or two and then low restrict/maintain because if I push myself too much and fast for too long, I end up binging again. Make sure to take all of your vitamins and supplements, take plenty of electrolytes (I do this through drinks), and keep hydrated. I usually go back to my pre-binge weight just by doing this and I found that going too extreme with the fasting as a punishment actually doesn’t help in the long run. Good luck :)",False,False
