I would binge drink like half the week just so it would be ""normal"" to purge. It also gave me a way to talk about my vomiting without looking too sus.",False,False

Not sure if that’s physical or mental but I’ll take it.   Sometimes I will pretend to be on the phone outside of a public restroom while I wait for it to empty so I can quickly do my thing and pretend it never happened. Always good to have mints on hand! ,False,True

I used this excuse when I was hanging out with a guy. #noshame. Okay, it was actually kind of embarrassing. We sat down and enjoyed a drunken meal together during which I took like two shots (with him telling me to chill... But that's no fun!) Then I claimed nausea and went to the bathroom to throw up, got him all worried unfortunately. But generally I don't really like to drink alcohol  because the reduced inhibition always triggers a binge, and I'm worried that eventually others would piece two and two together.",False,False
