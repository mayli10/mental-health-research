A significant portion of people with food addiction that try and fail to fast will just binge even worse because it's another way they've failed to lose the weight and they comfort eat to feel better. Ask me how I know. I successfully did IF and extended fasts for about 10 months. But once I fell off, I never got back on fully. It's just be a binge and restrict cycle ever since. But I still have the expectation I can do it like I used to. Every single morning I wake up telling myself I won't eat until dinner, or at all today. When I eventually do, no matter how low-calorie, my day is ruined and I'm irritable for the rest of it because I hate myself. Because I ate an apple to take my medication with.  It promotes the incredibly harmful black and white attitude that so many people with eating disorders have. I feel like a lot of people, if not most people here struggle with the ""if I fail my eating plan, everything is ruined and I'm a failure"". Some deal with that by restricting more, some deal with that feeling by eating more (and possibly also purging it in some way).  I'm sure if they saw my perspective they'd roll their eyes and think I'm just not committed enough and don't have enough self-discipline. Which, even if that's true, that line of is literally Pro-Ana Tips 101.  It gets me so stupid heated. Even more so because deep down I can't help but feel like I'm just mad about it because I've gained a significant amount of weight recently even though I know rationally that nothing about fasting is mentally healthy in the long run.
