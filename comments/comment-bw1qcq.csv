My sister is trying to lose weight rn and she said she regrets selling her treadmill from several years ago and I had completely forgot she ever had one. I told her I thought they were expensive and she said if they're new they are, but she sold hers for $75. I was so shook. I've never cared about whether or not things are used as long as they work. If I had a treadmill or elliptical I would use it all the time??? Because I love the comfort of my own home and I spend 99% of my free time laying down while I read or watch TV and I could get f i t af if I had an elliptical or treadmill. Also I've heard cycling classes are hard but also fun. You could do those at home with a YouTube video!!",False,False
