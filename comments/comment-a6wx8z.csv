This is actually really helpful! I’m going to work on making my portions just a bit bigger. Make it a gradual change! ,False,True

I had an issue where I intuitively overate by 300-500 calories and I just slowly told myself to do small tasks each day (just don't eat for this hour, eat only half this cookie) and I started feeling more full until my body was trained to eat near maintenance. I think you should still count at the end of the day for now (like monitoring a dog if they are getting into trouble) until you trust it enough to not do things you don't want. You can ""easily"" sneak in calories as in sipping juices, or adding a snack and it's uncomfortable but still tolerable, like how you would train a dog gradually to sit, stand etc. and not give them 20 commands to learn in one day.

It’s a matter of getting used to it, just like it was with restricting at first. I have to say I don’t like it, I’m not really comfortable about conditioning myself to eat more :( I’m already worrying about overshooting my goal even though my goal is still underweight ffs!

It’s when your body craves all of the foods it has been deprived of and your brain is still in “all-or-nothing” mode because it thinks it’s never going to have these “forbidden” foods again. This phase passes eventually when your brain realizes that it can have those foods whenever, although most people overeat and gain weight during this time. That’s why many people (including me) are turned off by or scared of eating intuitively.",False,False

Intuitive eating doesn't mean you hit your tdee on every mark. Theres just too many different factors in the day that alter it (hormones, PMS, bloat, past days caloric intake, weather, exercise, sleep etc) the point is to trust your body that even though you will overeat somedays and undereat others, you'll average out to maintenance. If you are still under, then you just nudge yourself and eat a little more each day. Good luck ",False,False

I tend to overestimate calories so I’ve had to start strict calorie plan. It’s super hard, I literally have to force feed myself sometimes. It’s worse than restricting imo.",False,False
