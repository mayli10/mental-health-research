It can be made worse by anxiety and your stomach can also involuntarily contract. In my case it's a weakened esophageal sphincter--the muscle that keeps your esophagus closed off from your stomach. I can't bend over or lay down immediately after having liquids or else it will just come back up. I didn't purge at all for a few years and even after relapsing last year only purged occasionally (I have stomach issues and am under strict orders from my GI NOT to purge because it keeps causing stomach bleeding lol) and it still happens.
