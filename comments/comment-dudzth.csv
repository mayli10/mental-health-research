While *some* foods (i.e. a diminutive minority) are indeed *potentially* laced with questionable additives/chemicals, the scaremongering surrounding such things is quite ridiculous.  And yes, ""processed"" meals and snacks often have more calories/carbs/sugar/fat/salt than ""whole"" foods and are therefore labelled as ""bad"" foods (crisps, lollies, McDonald's etc). But all these foods come in uniform serving sizes and provide nutrition facts accurately reflecting values for said serving sizes, so people actually know the calories and macros in their food without having to painstakingly weigh and add up every ingredient. Even then, the booming market for ""healthy"" desserts/snacks means there are a plethora of alternatives to the ""bad"" processed foods, like Halo Top and the numerous sugar-free snacks out there, which have fewer calories than the original.",False,False

So I get it. I get that there is this huge dunk of cold water when you realise exactly how many calories are in food and exactly how many I'd been eating in a day to get to that point, especially when most people are convinced they ""don't eat that much"". When you're used to eating 3k~ in food a day, cutting out a third of what you eat can seem really drastic, and it's almost like it's impossible to know where you could start or how you could possibly maintain a diet like that.  People's perceptions of portion sizes are screwed. People's perceptions of how much oil/dressing/etc they use is screwed. People's memory of how often they eat or snack or how often they have the ""occasional treat"" is screwed. It's hard to know where to point the finger because society both damns it and encourages it depending on how they want to profit off you; education is woefully lacking and even shows/resources made to supposedly counter the issue can just continue misinformation (I love Secret Eaters for example but some of what they do/say is just factually wrong!)  Now... that all seems like a distant memory. Once I got over the initial shock, I started shaving that number down to 1800, 1500, 1200. The thought of intentionally eating 2k a day feels luxurious. Even when I go back to my old binge eating habits I'm keenly aware of how many calories I'm ""helplessly"" consuming. When I'm restricting I can comfortably fit 3 meals and a dessert into anywhere from 600 to 900 calories. The idea that I ever once had trouble ""restricting"" to 2000 feels like I'm looking at someone else. Like how could that ever have been me? Was there ever a time when I didn't look at food and mentally (over-)approximate its calories?  Sorry for the long response lol, I went kind of off-topic... I guess it's just like, yeah, I get where these people are coming from, because when you VERY FIRST start losing weight, it can truly feel impossible to be actually satisfied and happy eating 1500/1800/2000 a day. So I empathise with them. The people I DON'T empathise with are the people who have been dieting for a couple of months now and STILL act like they can never have anything but dry salads and unseasoned chicken breasts and get bitter about it like YOU CAN FIT A WHOLE ASS DONUT INTO YOUR CALORIE PLAN DON'T @ ME!!",False,True

Such a karen move. honestly people should exercise because they enjoy it and bc it's good for you and bc it gives you the tiniest bit of wiggle room in your diet, not because it's going to undo three big macs and a thickshake for lunch  My last roommate ate rubbish even when she was ""trying"" to lose weight (but completely rejected any advice from me or other roommate, who had both lost weight before) and I'm convinced it's bc she thought that plodding around the gym 3 times a week meant she was literally impervious to any weight gain. Even though she was also compensating for her exercise by eating more. Lol.",False,True

This whole mindset is so frustrating. And like, on the one hand, I feel bad for these people because really, it's just evidence that our education on nutrition is SEVERELY lacking. Like, it is not difficult to teach kids the basics of nutrition and calories, but for some goddamn reason they think nobody could possibly understand the advanced physics of ""calories in &lt; calories out"" so they try and break it down into things like food groups and ""healthy foods"" vs. ""sometimes foods"" etc. Which just confuses people more, because they have no idea how weight loss/gain happens, it just... ""happens"" to them. So they don't get that an egg mono diet will lose them weight because they're just eating LESS food, even if they eat eggs all day, they think it must be some miraculous property of eggos.  But. You are so, so frustratingly right. Lol the initial water weight is so alluring but it's like a job at a call center, they plant a fake call on your first day so you get a sale and trick yourself into thinking that it's sustainable...",False,True

In the west it's like... oh sugary cereal, or a pastry, or something deep fried. We've placed this weird emphasis on it for our health when the food we eat to break our fast is so crummy. wtf.  I think eating smaller meals more often throughout the day works for some people but like... one, it doesn't work for everyone, and two, it's not better for you or anything.

Like I believe that if a diet works for you you should stick with it, and that different methods (keto, paleo, etc.) appeal to different people and will work for some and not others. I can respect that. But when they start insisting that there's some Special Reason why their diet ""burns fat"" that doesn't come down to CICO, it's so hard for me not to roll my eyes. Like I don't want to step on anyone's progress or anything but no, Barbara, you're not losing weight because putting butter in your coffee activates some primordial fat-burning gene in your deep unconscious, it's because you are so exhausted of eating butter all the time that you give up after lunch",False,True
