I would personally just recommend a USP-certified multivitamin because it won't have too much of any nutrient and it will cover your bases. Obviously heavy restriction can be dangerous, and I would say that macronutrient deficiencies will start to cause more harm than micronutrient deficiencies. Sometimes in periods of heavy restriction, I convince myself to drink some Boost for the nutrient value.",False,False

(Dunno why, but it's helped mine work in the past.) I would recommend B12 for energy, some kind of electrolytes supplement, and if you drink a lot of caffeine l-theanine to combat caffeine-induced anxiety, all at the recommended doses.",False,False

I just take prenatal vitamins but it depends how heavily you're restricting and what you're eating when you do eat.,False,False
