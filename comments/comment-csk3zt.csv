Be careful of the flavor you‚Äôre getting though Blueberry Crumble and Sea Salt caramel use almond butter but everything else minus the obviously named nut flavors should be safe if my memory serves.  They have their nutritional info and other allergen faqs online on their site and I love their maple doughnut bars the best out of the flavors I had (Birthday cake was great still though). I‚Äôve been megadeath allergic to peanuts since I was a small baby and a family member had recommended I try them when I was talking about how most protein bars contain nuts.   Fiber One makes mini bars called Protein One which aren‚Äôt exactly high in fat but contain about 10-12 grams of protein I think and 4 grams of fiber which is nice for the calorie content. I‚Äôve had their strawberry and cream flavor which was nice, there‚Äôs a chocolate chip one out there if you can find it. I think the rest contain nuts of some sort",False,False
