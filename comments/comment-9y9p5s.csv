And I'm like WHY DOES EVERYONE ASSUME THAT that's the LAST thing that happens when I relapse!   So am i fake if I'm not purging and occasionally eating at my TDEE.

I'll accidentally go on about not eating for 36 hours or say something ed related and my bf (well we might break up now) just nods and rarley seems to care.   I try to eat normally (in front of my friends) one day a week but that's hard. Last week I only ate breakfast and chugged coffee all day/night as they had pizza, ice cream etc. Then we start drinking and look who blacks out and can't remember the new Harry Potter movie? So it's still never enough. They are concerned but sometimes trigger me. ",False,False

I don't feel I have to be ""worse"". I'm really just forcing myself into a place of accountability - ""everyone knows now so I have to do something about it"" - but doing so also gained me extra support.

I try to be as open as I can with my bf but all it leads me to is a vicious cycle of ""I really need him to ask if I've eaten today because I can't be trusted to take care of myself and need some guidance"" followed immediately by ""oh fuck now I can't eat even if I feel okay about it because if he asks and my answer isn't 'no' he'll think I'm a histrionic fraudster.""
