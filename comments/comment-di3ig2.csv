I wouldn't (lol) but at every restaurant I've worked at, we add a little oil when making rice.  Also, TW?, but apparently scientists have found that adding oil (I think specifically coconut oil) to rice actually *reduces* the amount of digestible [calories in the rice.](https://www.healthyandnaturalworld.com/adding-coconut-oil-to-rice-makes-it-healthier/)  \&gt; The method of cooking rice with coconut oil and then chilling the rice cuts the calories by changing the rice‚Äôs chemical composition. Digestible starch turns into indigestible starch (or **resistant starch**), so the rice doesn‚Äôt get readily metabolized into glucose ‚Äì if not used, glucose eventually converts into body fat and contributes to weight gain. So this cooking method could help to prevent body fat accumulation. In that respect, it‚Äôs worth noting that the *Journal of Nutrition and Metabolism* [found](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15507129) that consumption of **resistant starch** ‚Äúcould decrease fat accumulation in the long-term.‚Äù   Anyways, it seems like he's trying to sneak you calories via oil but unfortunately that doesn't ""fix"" anything.  Just shitty band-aid.",False,False

I've managed to eat more varied food and even brought back some dairy products I was very scared of. I'll weigh myself on Sunday. I'm trying to gain half a kilo this week.   The doctor thinks my ankle pain isn't from bone problems, because I haven't been underweight for too long.   Then a rant about my husband. (TW: weight and calories.)  - I still eat different food than my husband does, because I think he overuses cooking oil. He even adds it to boiled rice. He refuses to measure it to prove that he's not using too much. He says that using too little oil can make the pan get worn out faster, but all out pans are cheap, so I don't think it matters. He also has this cast iron pan that he really likes. Whenever he fries something with it, the kitchen gets filled with smoke. Ugh. I showed him that our TDEEs have a 300 kcal difference, and the calories in excess oil matter to me, but he thinks it's OK if I just eat a smaller portion. And he called me a glutton when I said I'd rather eat a bigger portion of lower-fat food üòë   - He said some more dumb comments about my weight. He said that currently I'm ""probably 30-40 kg"" and I should aim for a weight that is actually heavier than my weight when we started dating but he thinks I was always at. He thinks I didn't gain any weight during our relationship from eating his cooking, even though I had to get rid of many of my size S and M clothes and buy size L. I think he's really bad at estimating weights.  - He tried to get me to eat fear foods by proving that my safe foods are unhealthy.  - He keeps suggesting healthy additions to my diet, but then talks about how they could be harmful too.   - He googled my panic attack symptoms and decided that I have a heart disease.  - He blames himself for not being able to cure my ED in a couple of weeks, as if it was his responsibility. I understand where he's coming from, but it makes it difficult to talk to him about my problems, because he blames himself for everything, and I don't want to make him more stressed. He wants to know everything I eat, but I'd rather not be subjected to scrutiny and criticism.",False,False
