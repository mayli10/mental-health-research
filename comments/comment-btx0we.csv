It's much more envigourating that way... but the 'dreadmill', as some may call it, does its job. I keep telling myself 'I'll go out when I'm good enough' -- when I can run an effortless 5K, but regardless of my improvement that's morphed into an effortless 10K, and I guarantee you I'm not gonna be 'allowed' outside until I can run a wholeass marathon without the break of a sweat. Oh the complications we create just to avoid confronting ourselves.",False,False

Otherwise I would go with the obvious home cardio choice and recommend jump-roping.",False,False

I own a treadmill for this exact reason but I'm so anxious about potentially disturbing my neighbours (&amp; the concept of them *hearing me,* God almighty,) that I will often stress too much to use it.    I used to do early morning runs before everyone else in my house got too pissed from all the times I'd unintentionally woken them, oof lol. Unlike late at night you won't see nearly as many lights, you will 100% *never* encounter anyone you know, and in the darkness no-one would ever know it was you. I know that's only really applicable to people who live in safe areas but that's all I can suggest. Good luck :)",False,False
