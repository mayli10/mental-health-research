I know Ana can make us very very very resentful toward comments about eating and food bc we feel like we know everything (and tbh most of us do know everything about food. Ever) so I don’t want to overreact but. It. It feels so mean of him. I just could never ever see my boyfriend telling me not to eat something. Even when I binge BINGE like 1000 in one sitting, my boyfriend wouldn’t ever say stop. Or I shouldnt do that. He’s there to listen to the regret after and help me make better plans next time.   Idk.
