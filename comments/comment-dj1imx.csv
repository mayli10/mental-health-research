All the photos of myself of when I was actually overweight (5’5, 210 lbs). I see all my progression photos and think to myself “I never want to be that way again.” Today I saw a photo of myself when I was 130, and thought I looked gross. My mind is so messed up, my God. Even a healthy weight makes me cringe. Here I am, at 110, wondering if I lose more weight, will I look back at photos of myself today and think I looked horrible. Jeez.",False,False

I was so little and now I’m all chub.,False,False

I'm always beating myself up for having gained a few pounds after leaving an abusive living situation/getting a better job that left me with enough time and money to eat a normal diet. Now I just see my reflection and get upset that I don't look like I'm malnourished. :'),False,False
