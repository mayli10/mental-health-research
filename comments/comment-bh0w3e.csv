I'm BP2, been off meds for a couple months, and I'm on the lowest downswing I've had in years, like every moment is just this muted panic that only builds. I've become afraid to talk about certain things for fear of them coming true and I think I'm dipping into mild psychosis again. I'm considering lying to my GP to get SSRIs to see if I can swing back into hypomania without gaining the weight. Every pound is such a fight to lose and I don't think I could live with gaining it all back.  I'm sorry things are so shitty right now. Still, I think we can make it.",False,False
