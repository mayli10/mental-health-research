I know that if I just went crazy I would regret it afterwards but FUCK I just wanna be satisfied for once",False,True

And it's dumb but I'm kind of jealous of people who can binge? I know it's not healthy, and I know they hate it....but I would love to just go nuts one day.     At most I'll do something kinda like a binge but it still ends up being under 1200 calories. Like last night I had a whole box of Rice-A-Roni and that was a huuuge binge for me. But it was only 950 calories. I'm still starving lol I just eat ""a lot"" at once sometimes.",False,False

Like I haven’t had one in probably 3 years. It’s just one blizzard! What harm could it do. Idk. If you want a brownie you should get a brownie. It may help the craving to pass. Maybe you won’t even eat all of it. Maybe you can take bites through out the day. I’m sorry it’s so hard. I understand and I’ve been there.,False,False
