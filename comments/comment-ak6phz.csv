I feel like she couldn't take me seriously when I told her the reason why I couldn't stop logging was that I didn't want to lose my streak though. I just reached 700 days today though and idk if I can just not log the food there. ,False,False

Went from a BMI of overweight almost obese to normal. I‚Äôve cried over this moment wanting it so badly I‚Äôve thought about it in every spare moment I‚Äôve suffered over the hunger pains and the dizziness and denying myself for this... and it‚Äôs clearly not enough because I still have a stomach. I‚Äôm thoroughly disappointed. ,False,False

I had been on 20mg of lexapro for 1.5 years and went off the deep end, picking up a SH habit, being suicidal every week, getting a BPD diagnosis, and even kickstarting my ED. I didn't fully connect the dots until my most recent session, that it was being overmedicated that caused literally almost all of my mental health issues (except for GAD, but I've always had that). I went off lexapro at the beginning of fall and my GAD came back in full force, getting to the point that even leaving the house was an ordeal. I just restarted lexapro (at 5mg, which has helped me before) and I've been doing some soul searching. The only remnant left of that dark time of my life is my ED; I'm 10 months clean from SH, just surpassed the anniversary of my last attempt with no more serious suicidal ideation/writing anymore notes, and no longer meet the diagnostic criteria of BPD.   The weight loss has become more scary than satisfying. I hit an 18.9 BMI yesterday and my body just looks gross and sickly. So. I've started seriously considering attempting recovery. It's a scary decision, but I think it'll also be scary to hang onto my ED. I'll probably solidify my decision further once I've stabilized back on my antidepressants. The only thing that might be stopping me is waiting until I hit an &lt;18.5 BMI so I can officially say, ""I'm recovering from anorexia,"" rather than just, ""I'm recovering from EDNOS,"" or ""I'm recovering from an eating disorder."" The latter two just doesn't have the same ring. ""Anorexia"" weirdly gives me a sort of satisfaction, like my struggles to lose enough weight finally paid off. On the other hand, no one needs to know if I don't actually meet it and if anyone says anything, then they're just an ass.  I'm feeling more hopeful and more alive than I have in about six months, so maybe this is the first step in living a healthy and fulfilling life?",False,False

I tried on a swimsuit and sent a snap of me in it to my friends. It was a video and my ribs are visible again. I felt so small watching the video. It was weird. But after that, I start feeling extremely nauseous and breathing really shallow. I was also shaking.  All I could think about is how I felt like I was going to pass out but that isn‚Äôt fair because I had a 200 cal sandwich like 3 hours ago.
