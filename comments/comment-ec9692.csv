I didn't even go on a single date in that time period, but then a girl I was friends with reached out to me and started getting flirty and now we're seeing each other.

I'm fucking *terrified* and my brain is screaming for me to just ghost her for the sake of self-preservation, lol. But despite all of that, she makes me happy and I want to be with her, so I'm putting myself outside my comfort zone and going for it.
