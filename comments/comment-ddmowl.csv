Unless you were a specific weight before you gained and it *happened* to be BMI 18.5 then no,False,False

Healthy weight loss goals have to do with how we feel, energy levels, functional strength, improved immune systems, improved blood tests scores,etc. If you feel/act your best at a BMI of 21 (or whatever), but force yourself to get down to 18.5, that’s unhealthy. If you feel/act your best at 18.5, then it’s probably fine, but getting to that shouldn’t be the goal.",False,False

But in my opinion ""healthy weight loss goals"" are just goals that have health as the main reason instead of looks or numbers. I feel like any weight loss that is not focused on being healthier has the potential to compromise either mental or physical health. Idk man Im dumb dont listen to me",False,False
