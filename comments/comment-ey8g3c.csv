The only thing that really saved me was going to DBT sessions once a week. You can always choose to go back to college, heal yourself first and gain the tools you need to keep fighting. Good luck.",False,False

I can imagine how you are feeling right now because I have been there to. About a year ago I was so ready to dye because just getting out of bed caused me to have a full on panic attack. College is more bearable now, maybe even enjoyable (?). Is there anything that you enjoy doing still, or at least donâ€™t absolutely despise? If there is, then make it a priority to do more of that. If you like to draw, then draw for an hour a day and look forward to that hour. For me, I have found that exercise really improves my mood and my relationship with my body. If you are easily triggered by exercise and have a tendency to over do it, then try a light flow yoga class. Yoga has really helped me to calm down (anxiety wise). Also, please make sure you are not too low on your micronutrients; many deficiencies have been shown to lower mood, increase depression, and increase anxiety. You could get a blood test or at least start supplementing with a b-complex as it is water soluble (you will pee out excess) and zero calories. Please know that things can improve if you let them. Life may seem utterly hopeless now, but they may not in a few months. Are you speaking to someone? A therapist can really help with this stuff, even if you donâ€™t want to tell them everything right away, they can at least help you with some coping mechanisms. Stay safeðŸ’•",False,False
