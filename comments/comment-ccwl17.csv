A complex carbohydrate is a carbohydrate that releases slower as energy than a simple carbohydrate. Pure sugar is a simple carbohydrate. It's fast acting, spikes your blood sugar and does the job quick! Beans, potatoes, bread, unfrosted breakfast cereals and oatmeal are all really good sources of complex carbohydrates. They prevent the rapid fall of your blood sugar by generally keeping it steady.",False,False
