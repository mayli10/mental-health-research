Luckily I'm too self-conscious to go out and buy junk food because I don't want to look like the fatass I really am, but other people keep buying me snacks for me and I lack the self-restraint to not eat them! Aghhh!   I've lost two pounds in the past week but it's slow progress. I recently had a photo taken of myself where you can see my muffin top and bulky upper arms (a mixture of fat and muscle). It isn't the worst photo ever but it disgusts me. I dared to set it as my social media profile picture and it's working as a wonderful motivator.",False,False

Stuck in this goddamn cycle, I don't know what to do. I know I gained. I just don't want to see it. I keep telling myself that if I want to, I can always snap back and lose it quickly. But I can't stop. I can't imagine how you feel being in this situation for 9 months.  I feel miserable. How TF did I get here, I used to do omad too, and that was the start of my BED. Then I started restricting and I was so good at it... I don't know where I stand. I started therapy/treatment.  I want to get better but also want to lose weight. Fuck my life.  Stay safe. Hope we'll get better. Sending hugs.",False,False
