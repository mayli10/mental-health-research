I can partly empathise; my lizard-brain response when somebody is mad at me is to stop eating as well, and I definitely had issues with my dad growing up where he would chide me if he thought I was over eating and warn me not to get fat. He was coming from a very misguided place of love though, and it kind of sounds like your dad is just being mean. Is there any way you can eat dinner before/after him?  I don’t know what your relationship with him is like, but is there any way of starting to stand up for yourself? People who are judgey like this are usually projecting, in my experience, is there anything you could call him out on? Or even just establish a boundary, that you don’t like when he comments on your food intake and that if he continues to do so you’ll stop speaking to him for x amount of time? ",False,False
