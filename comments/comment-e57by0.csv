I always hated the clean your plate bullshit and the comment on being wasteful. Like okay but either it goes into the trash or gets turned into shit so either way it's going away. And you know sometimes your eyes are bigger than your stomach and you're starving and then fill up fast and it's so not fair to force someone to eat. I hope you are doing better now and get only the best mashed potatoes :),False,True

My daughter is the 12 year old. She's already as tall as me and she's about a size 12/14. She's the most confident person I have ever met and that makes me so happy. She is a very very very picky eater and sometimes it is frustrating but it keeps me patient because I remember how my mother was and I do not want her to have that relationship with food. And my boy is my boy haha. He's tall and skinny and eats like a horse and I just let him roll with it. Even though his sister is younger than him, she is like his security blanket. He feels so much more confident when she is around and I love to see their teamwork. Here is something surprising. I of course have a scale and I keep it in the kitchen and I weigh myself pretty frequently and make sure not to comment on the number or get upset. A couple years ago when the kids were littler they made it into a competition. If my little girl weighed more than her brother she totally won. Lol no idea where they got that but I was just like yeah you won haha. They don't bother with the scale anymore thought thankfully.",False,True

One time at summer camp (heh), I filled my plate up with boxed ""mashed potatoes"" because everything else was meat and eggs and I don't eat those, and I took one bite and it was so disgusting that I couldn't eat anymore.  A counselor got on my ass about it and told me it was ""uncool"" or something to waste that food and made me sit there and finish it and the whole table heard and was looking at me.  I wanted to die from embarassment.  That shit still haunts me today.  Plus, I'm positive they threw out a bunch of food anyways.  But, it's a bittersweet memory because my super sweet best friend was sitting next to me and would take huge heaping spoonfuls from my plate when the counselor wasn't looking.  I love her for doing that and now I wanna see her again and tell her how nice that was.  Okay, thanks for listening to my therapy session :)",False,False

It's hard because they'll pick it up from external sources too, but she tries not to comment on her kids' appearance in ways they didn't choose - so instead of saying something like, ""you look very pretty!"" etc. she might say ""that dress is very pretty!"", etc. So making a positive comment on the things her kids have chosen, but not their body/features. She compliments her kids in lots of ways but she doesn't want to reinforce that ""looking prettier"" = better. I think it's healthy and her kids have pretty good self esteem so far!",False,False

Like it might seem counterintuitive, but I've heard that just forcing them to finish their food or eat ""enough"" can be bad.

I want them to be like those gloriously rare beings who treat food like a normal thing and eat the right amount without any worry or guilt or fear.   Also, if you don't mind answering, how have you personally made sure your kids don't adapt disordered habits?  I'm really curious about what can work.  Also, I assume you are keenly aware of habits to look out for, but how totally sure are you?  I feel like kids subconsciously pick up on shit or notice things we think they can't see and that worries me.",False,False
