Like I eat so many sweet things itâ€™s embarrassing.   My lo-cal favorites:  CANDY â€¢Smart sweets Swedish fish  â€¢Smart sweets peach rings  (Smart sweets anything is amazing Iâ€™m sure, but Iâ€™m vegan so can only speak to the vegan-friendly ones) â€¢Lankanto chocolate bars (sweetened with monk fruit)  â€¢Nada Moo ice cream (way sweeter than halo top, arctic zero, etc, but it does have more calories)  FRUIT â€¢ I love cutting up strawberries, mixing in zero calorie sweetener (truvia is my go-to) and adding a LITTLE bit of water. Mix it all together. This tastes like your traditional strawberry topping.  â€¢I also cut up apples, add cinnamon and truvia and microwave (tastes like apple pie filling)  (Iâ€™ll add either of these to lo-cal vanilla ice cream if Iâ€™m feeling fancy)   Iâ€™ll edit to add more if I think of any but all of the above 100% helps when Iâ€™m craving sugarâ€”which is basically always. ðŸ˜Ž",False,False
