It does sound like you struggle with food sometimes and appear to have some symptoms.  You know yourself better than all us strangers on the internet. Is your eating disordered in some manner? Only you can really ponder that unless you want to speak to a therapist/professional about it.,False,False

I do it too, I can eat a normal amount or more of food but feel awful about later, or sometimes I wont feel anything at all. The fear of gaining weight is also a huge sign. Remember, it doesnt matter if you can eat easily at times. If you are scared to gain weight and have fear of eating... That sounds like an ED ",False,False
