You are absolutely doing the right thing be reaching out somewhere to say you need help.    No matter what, you deserve health and happiness. You deserve good days and I believe you’ll have them. It’s hard work to get there, but admitting you need help is one of the hardest steps to take.    I’ll be thinking about you. I hope tomorrow is a better day.",False,False

If your relationship with your parents is good and supportive then yes, please go home and tell them what’s going on and that you need help. They might not know what to do but hopefully you can come up with a plan together.    If your parents are generally *not* supportive, I would find someone who is to confide in first and come up with a plan to keep you safe and get the help you need.    I hope things start turning around",False,False
