My dad used to say things to me when I lived at home about my eating habits and my weight. Mind you, in highschool and college I was at the gym 2 times a day, cheer practice and ate about 1200 cals. I was not doing anything unhealthy, and I was actually pretty buff. I was a base in cheer and I'm 5'2. I was 130 pounds. SO PERFECTLY NORMAL. My dad, however had cancer at this time and couldn't keep any weight on at all. (Hes fine now btw). My point is, when something is overruling someones mind, like your fams obsession with health and being fit, other people might look distorted to them. You most likely are a normal person with a normal body and a normal eating pattern, but because of your sister's need to be healthy, she probably just wants you to obsess as well. I moved out in college because I needed to. My mental health was having a hard time with comments and not being in control of my life. And sometimes you have to get away from the things that are toxic to your life. Even if that's family. I now live two blocks from my parents and I get ZERO comments on my life and health, because they know that's a sensitive subject and I do better without their two cents.   Try separating yourself from them for a while and WORK ON YOU. Ignore everything else, you and your mental health COME FIRST. No matter what. Don't ever let anyone else make you feel any different.  Mind you, my parents have always supported me and loved me and I am so thankful for them and we have a great relationship now, so I don't want anyone thinking my dad is just a shit person lol.

If your body bothers her THAT much then she has issues of her own. I feel am terrified of going around everyone tomorrow. So much that I actually am contemplating not going. Just sending my daughter with her grandpa. I have to find something to wear and I didn't get my hair cut this week like I wanted. So I look extra disgusting and nothing fits me right and I ate like shit the last two days so I'm bloated. I want you to know your sister and mom sounds like real fuckin turds. My first reaction is to be dramatic and tell everyone to fuck right off. But I cut ties with my immediate family long ago so don't listen to me. ,False,False

You really, truly don't have to make yourself miserable by forcing yourself to go to a family Thanksgiving that you know will be toxic to you and your emotional/physical/mental well-being just because it's expected or for tradition's sake. YOU are more important than that.  If you're worried that calling them out on their awful bullshit treatment of you is too confrontational to deal with right now, you could either a) bring a good friend who's a ""stray"" themselves with you to your family's gathering so you at least have one true ally in the room, or better yet, b) as u/SpaceWhale88 said, go with a friend to THEIR Thanksgiving; give your family whatever reason/excuse you need.
