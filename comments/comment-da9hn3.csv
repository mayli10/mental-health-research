Even though my boyfriend is a little bit overweight, he has pretty healthy eating patterns. Like only eating when hungry, stopping when full and occasionally he'll eat snacks without caring to much.   If he eats less than me, I cannot stand it. And I hate hearing him chew while I'm restricting. If he eats more than me, I'll get triggered too. Honestly I'll never tell him. I do not want him to feel uncomfortable while eating. I try to feel grateful that he can eat with joy. My negative feelings are coming from jealousy. I want to eat without thinking about it SO much too :(",False,False

He still eats very intuitively and he’s thin. He eats when he’s hungry and stops when he’s full. If the texture, taste, smell, is off he won’t finish it. He doesn’t overthink everything. I aspire to one day also have this mindset about food and eating.",False,False
