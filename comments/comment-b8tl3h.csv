First you've got the internal pressure to lean out when you're already lank. Then you've got the crash dieting and patent fasting. Then you've got malnutrition from chronic crash dieting. The malnutrition stops your brain from being able to make connections so you temporarily get demented. Active ana is a burden on the body and mind in a million ways.,False,False
