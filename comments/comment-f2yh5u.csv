I know I'm not immune to the laws of thermodynamics but an extra fruit or vegetable or piece of cheese shouldn't tip me into becoming like a whale overnight",False,False

It's not fatlogic to say that a cupcake as a special treat won't make you gain weight, for example. It's literally just a fact, and then they create this gross caricature of fat people who say that 100 cupcakes are fine to eat daily.  I really, really hate that I look at it, and I hate how effective it is. It and websites outside of reddit have played a large part in my ED.",False,True

I sometimes see things that I think fit the true definition of 'fatlogic,' and I'm not at all on board with people claiming that BMI's in the 30's or 40's are healthy long term. But not everything has to be taken to the logical extreme FFS.  Good point in your last sentence haha. I grew up online, but mostly stayed away from Discourse™ so it's weird to see.",False,True

I follow it to trigger myself too. Sometimes there's just straight up fat hate on there (it gets taken down but I see it). And they always claim fatphobia doesn't exist, and it's so triggering.",False,False

Then again that's kind of a reddit thing in general so I should know to expect it by now ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯",False,False
