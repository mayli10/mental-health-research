This makes me nauseated to even say it but my parents and my boyfriend all check my food log. I want them to worry less and even getting to 1000 per day might help.  2. Make meals. It's easy for me to just eat peanut butter or cheese. Fast things I can get done with. I need to make salads with chicken, avocado, tomatoes etc. or other nutrient-dense foods. I try to do this and some days I just can't face that much prep and eating time.  3. Stop rescheduling therapy. I've done it three times because I don't want to talk about what I know we're going to talk about.  4. Don't punch the dumb bitch in my Viral Biodiversity class who keeps making remarks about how small I am. Loudly. Every session. ""Do you even eat?"" Yeah, with great difficulty.  5. No fasting. No fasting. No fasting. Not even a day.  6. Yoga on the days I don't have class. No one will let me run or go to the gym... But low impact yoga doesn't seem to worry anyone and I probably won't overdo it.  7. Go en pointe every other day even if I'm too tired to actually dance. One day I'm going to be better and I'm going back to class.  8. Stop fighting with my parents. It's not helping. They pay for everything and I need to finish school. More importantly, they just want what's best.  9. Meal plan with my guy on Wednesdays. It makes me less stressed knowing he's eating healthy and I'm more likely to eat if we're making similar foods.  10. Keep my non-veggie carbs low. I get way more depressed and paranoid about being fat when I'm eating a lot of carbs.",False,False

I haven't weighted since the beginning of the month. I was in the mid 140s I definitely binged too much.

So i binged a couple days ago and i was whining to my fiance about how fat I felt and he kinda snapped at me. Like just told me I need to see someone and that he can't deal with me on his own anymore. And he's right and its not fair to constantly be looking to him for reassurance and  needing him to convince me i'm not fat. So long story short im gonna try and find a therapist and so i gotta switch back into restriction mode asap because if i'm not skinnier soon i'll fucking scream. I need to be thin so i'll get taken seriously and not judged for having shitty disordered patterns. been thinking about asking my dealer if she knows where i could by some adderall ughhhh. I need to lose weight. Sorry this is a crazy person rant. In terms of goals I'd like to get down to \~115 and hit the gym every day this month. That gets me to bmi 16.5 which maybe will feel like enough? ,False,False
