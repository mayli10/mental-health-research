I will probably not eat a doughnut again for a long time. I fucking love pastries but they‚Äôre becoming a huge no no for me. Cake has already bit the dust, and i also love cake. There are a lot of things i loved before that i am afraid of now :(",False,False

Currently I'm very similar to where you're at, but I've had this thing for 7 years. I can tell you a) it almost gd killed me when I was 17 and b) it's slowly getting worse again.  The disorder never went away, I even went into recovery for a year, but the severity changes. The whole time I've never been able to get numbers out of my head.  So maybe you're not at death's door, but the idea is to not get to that point. You belong.",False,False

This.  People without EDs see food as nutrition, as something that gives them energy and satisfaction, as something to enjoy. Some might count calories or macros, or even follow a special diet. But they don't obsess over food in a way that's damaging!  For people with EDs, no matter which one, food is a constant struggle. Restricting, purging, binging until everything hurts, fearing unhealthy foods, having specific rituals, having to go for a walk after dinner to not feel guilty for eating, ... and so many more things. Eating is essential for our survival but for all of us it can make us feel guilt, panic, stress, anger. THAT is NOT how it should be.  Just because your symptoms aren't consistent it doesn't mean that you ""don't deserve to be here""! Everyone's eating disorder is different and it can also change overtime. And a diagnoses is only a label which allows professionals to categorize your struggle and find a way to treat it, but it is not what ""makes it real"". An eating disorder is real and valid, even if you don't have a specific description for it.  So don't worry, you have every right to be here. Don't let anyone tell you that your struggle isn't real or that you're not struggling enough just because you don't do this or that.",False,False

I have days where I'm fine eating 1600 calories and days where I'm crying because I ate a grape.  I think EDs thrive off invalidation and competition, so it's easy to feel like you don't deserve help or 'aren't ill enough' because sometimes I can treat myself and be fine. I still purge and restrict and calories are the only thing bouncing around in my skull, it causes me the same amount of grief.",False,True

And for me on this sub I see people who get upset when they have a binge that adds an extra 200 cals. I‚Äôm not invalidating their feeling of experience but when I have a binge day it means I‚Äôve stayed up till 3 am eating 5 meals, pint of full fat ice cream, way too many portions of pbfit, then just anything I can‚Äôt get my hands on even when I‚Äôm extremely full and it gets to the point where I feel ill. That one food I fear triggers this. If I do eat something for flavorful that I like I pair it with a safe food. Chili with cauliflower rice (rice is a fear food).

I‚Äôve lurked this sub because a lot of the posts here I feel like I can relate to so much.  I‚Äôve never been diagnosed. Sometimes I feel like I have an ED, sometimes I don‚Äôt. I don‚Äôt look frail, I gym and do heavy ish weights for my size  My BMI falls in the underweight category, but no one has ever said I need to seek help of some sort  My TDEE says my resting is 1150 for my height/weight, and I eat at around 750-1000 most days.  I‚Äôve purged and restricted, but it‚Äôs never consistent. Some days I‚Äôll eat a salad and feel like I want to die.  Other times I‚Äôll eat around 2000 cals at a social setting.  Some days I hate my body, other days i feel great in this new body of mine.  All I can think about are still fuckin calories, and I don‚Äôt have any ‚Äòfear‚Äô foods.

I don‚Äôt feel like I know anyone who can relate as my best friend is a guy who tracks calories for fitness/muscle building purposes and doesn‚Äôt understand the mental blocks that I have when I overeat... overeating for me will not make me feel good cause I‚Äôll be stronger at the gym or build muscle.
