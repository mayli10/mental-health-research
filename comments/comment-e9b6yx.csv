The going gets touch sometimes, and in a weird way, if you kept yourself safe by engaging in one behaviour over a more damaging one, then that's a sort of victory. I know it won't feel like it no matter what I say, but it would be a good idea to tell your therapist. The feelings of shame you might be experiencing need to be addressed or you will only spiral more. Get it out so you can get back on track, or triage/analyze why things are going back down the ED path. If you purged only once every 6 months, that's still better than doing it frequently. All is not lost. Most recovery stories look like.. 3 steps forward, a couple steps back, a few more forward, one back, and so on and so forth. If you are like me, then you default to black and white thinking. Try to appreciate the greyness of this event and not let it spiral into a binary thing where you are either a success or a failure. We're all works in progress, technically. Fluid and constantly changing.      I'm noticing you went to bed early as a means of switching off the feelings, which is a pretty great example of distress tolerance. You shifted what you were doing in order to cope with the difficult emotion around what happened. That's probably progress, and great use of the technique of distraction or activity switching (one of many distress tolerance/coping strategies). It will sound weird but... well-done :) there's a lot of good going on here... Maybe you can address what lead to this with your therapist and it can end up being the last, or one of the last times you engage like this. Or maybe you will continue to struggle from time to time with break-through emotions that are too tough to manage. Either way, you're trying and that's something.",False,False
