I just start my job a month ago, and was getting comments within the first week as well! But to be fair I only had a protein bar those days... and coffee that people conveniently seemed to not notice (that was not black coffee!! Just a nonfat caramel macchiato though)   I feel like everyone at work is keeping track for some reason. Like they’ll comment oh you don’t eat a lot do you? Or is that all you’re bringing?   I always try to check in with either the work mom/bestie whenever I bring real food haha just so they’ll keep quiet lmao   I honestly never thought people cared so much about what others ate until now",False,False

Then on days I did decide to eat everyone wanted to know what I was having or what I had brought in. I've made a habit now of always going outside on my lunch break so I can avoid everyone else.,False,False
