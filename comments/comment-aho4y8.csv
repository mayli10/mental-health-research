Mental and emotional baggage/trauma. No one gets by in life without having hurt and been hurt. Don‚Äôt let your ED define you. I did that for all of my late teens and all of my twenties. It‚Äôs just an issue:mental disorder like OCD or anxiety/depression. Unfortunately, in the deep throws of an ED, you can have all of those things, so it‚Äôs more complex at times, but not always. Sometimes it‚Äôs more manageable, whereas some disorders like schizo/bi-polar will never be manageable for people, and not something they can recover from. Silver linings.",False,False

My bf almost certainly has an undiagnosed ed. I am a little worried sometimes that we enable unhealthy behaviors, but ultimately we have so much love and care for the other person. I definitely talk him out of unhealthy behaviors (gently and lovingly) that I would totally do myself. And he does the same for me. I think we will get through this together.",False,False

But I think we need to understand that everyone has their own ‚Äúthings‚Äù and other issues so there are people out there thinking the same about their conditions. So this worry is probably more prevalent than we think and when/if given the chance just treat the other person with the same compassion and comfortable amount of space we would want for our ed ,False,False
