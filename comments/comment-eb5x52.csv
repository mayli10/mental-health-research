I could not agree more. proana is such a toxic community. every proana post i’ve ever read has always given me a strange feeling, half of it being my ed brains near jealousy (which is very unintentional) and the other half being me sheer discomfort. it’s such a weird and horrible feeling. there are ways to bond and communicate with other people suffering from EDs without encouraging it, egging it on, and making it seem like it’s the “right way”.",False,True

I had 2 friends who I hadn't even met from anything ED related who had that kind of mentality of ""Who can eat less?"" and it made me feel terrible and it honestly still feeds my ED to this fucking day.  I get that we're all struggling, but just because you're struggling doesn't give you a pass on toxic behaviour that encourages everybody who sees it :/ it's just unsettling, I don't know how to explain it",False,False
