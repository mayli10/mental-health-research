My first kiss was pretty recent. I was really drunk and had mixed alcohol with cough syrup (because I was sick, not to get high) and ended up making out with a guy at the club my friends and I went to. It was a lot of fun, but I don't actually like guys. I don't think I ever even looked at his face throughout the night. I think if it wasn't for the fact that he was a really nice guy that could have been an awful night. I did feel kind of bad though the next day because he texted me to ask me out for tea and I was okay going as friends, but he wanted it to be a date. I guess when I tried to tell him the night before that I only date girls I didn't do a good job.

I never got overweight, only ‚Äúnormal and healthy‚Äù weights after inpatient treatment. Looking back now, my teen years didn‚Äôt mean a thing and nor will yours.

I have found a really good comfortable place with my ED. I have learned self discipline and I no longer binge (always been ana). My body just knows how much I need to stay healthy, while maintaining my weight where I feel most comfortable. I never feel hungry. I eat and enjoy the things I like, just in small portions. Self discipline is key. While my eating is still considered disordered to most, I‚Äôm still healthy. I don‚Äôt workout or anything like that and I‚Äôm definitely NOT naturally thin.
