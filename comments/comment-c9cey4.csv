Maybe a bit less?? (No clue as keeping track of all that triggers me). My story may be triggering to some so forewarning.  But, I think I've finally come full circle, and I feel like I'm about to relapse *hard*. I have never been diagnosed, nor have I ever received any kind of treatments for recovery.   I've also never really talked to anyone in depth about it, basically I've been called *anorexic* my whole life, because I was naturally thin, so I wanted to not be that, and I wanted to jump on the thicc trend train to feel *beautiful* and not look *anorexic*. I learned that I do not carry weight like I want, it all goes to my thighs and ass, yes whooo, and it slightly goes to my stomach. So not whoo, and I realized I didn't like myself either way.  **Cue major body dysmorphia**  Looking in mirrors and at photos of myself has always been surreal, no matter my weight. I can never look at it and ""that's me"", it's always ""who is that person? That can't be me.""  And one day, a comment from a very close loved one, who I put above all others said ""you should exercise to tone up"". The straw that broke the camel's back. Idk why, but it was just the end, it absolutely crushed me to hear it from that person. And although I have never been overweight, I've always had an lower end of normal bmi, but I just couldn't get away from the thought ""I'm a whale, and need to exercise, because someone I love said I'm fat"".   So I spiraled into a controlled diet, and shed the 10 pounds I hated, I continued that diet only to plateau and stay there. I was ok with maintaining, but I began to feel like I could be a *tad* more strict and cut out a part of my diet. I lost some weight, my loved one thought I looked more attractive and was more receptive, so I was thrilled and it made me want more. I realized I liked the feeling of hunger and feeling like I beat the day with so few calories. Then my whole diet changed, every calorie was counted, only water to drink, one measly salad with a few leaves a day. I also began  to exercise excessively. How to lose ""1000 calorie"" workout routines done in secret in my room.  The comments and praise are what kept me going. ""Wow, you look like one of those Korean girls (kpop)"". Comments like that had me over the moon, riding a high for days for each one.  Then, I started to get hungry again and was plateauing. I had heard of purging, and thought ""I'd never do that"". Welp, I was wrong. I would eat absurd amounts of food, but I didn't want to lose progress, so I started the seemingly neverending bp sessions. I became very underweight, but was still receiving praise, and I thought ""shouldn't I look sick at this weight?? Do I still look too healthy??"".  Then it became ""look as sick as possible"". Which I got close to, people just always thought I was *petite*. So 2 or 3 years of disordered eating and thoughts.  Before it became life threatening, I somehow recovered on my own. No one ever knew I was sick. I'm a normal weight now, I get thicc and sticc comments. So it's feeling like it did in the beginning. I weigh enough to be called thicc, I weigh enough to still be called sticc.  I'd rather be neither. But being thin enough to disappear sounds good too. I'm ready to snap.
