Then I discovered purging —&gt; weight loss.  If someone had given me the tools and education to understand nutrition (and coping skills) I think I would have escaped EDs entirely.    I hear my kids’ friends learning a lot of the same nonsense from their parents and it breaks my heart.,False,False

Image a plate of broccoli, corn and peas, then imagine several slices of toast. Which one is going to be harder to eat more of? Fibre triggers the satiety response and tells you you've had enough. Yes, you are right, we know waayyy more about nutrition than most people!",False,False
