I struggle with binge eating and Iâ€™ve recently released it got worse because my old housemate would eat absolutely everything I bought.   I was making a frozen pizza the other day and thinking how I cannot eat half and put the rest in the fridge for later like I used to to. Then I realised, itâ€™s because my housemate would always eat my left overs and it got me in the habit of forcing myself to eat a whole pizza even though it made me uncomfortably full. Now it doesnâ€™t make me uncomfortably full anymore.",False,False

Thatâ€™s not even an ED thing, itâ€™s just basic fucking respect. The only food I ever feel open to is at my mommaâ€™s and even then I will still ask if itâ€™s fine",False,False

Getting arrested for possession is not equal to eating a package of someone's food. Not to mention it would be supporting a war on drugs and a private prison system that is fucking over thousands of people.    --your friendly neighborhood stoner",False,False

Iâ€™m a full time smoker and if I get the munchies I order a damn pizza or eat my own food. Thatâ€™s ridiculous, Iâ€™m so sorry she does that to you. Maybe try to keep it in your room just in case, that is if the talk you have with her doesnâ€™t work. Good luck bb",False,False

I think i might have to too. She stays home all day and smokes weed and just eats and always tries to get me to give her my food. Im really tall and shes barely five feet so i think im just gonna put it all up on a high shelf so its out of sight for her.
