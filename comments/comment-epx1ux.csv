No hate to them, but sometimes the misinformation they tend to spread leads to things like this and can end up hurting more people :/  And yes the subreddit is horrible ugh",False,True

For me it took a lot of pressure off of the ""what"" and ""when"" I'm going to eat, since fasting gave me simple ""rules"" to follow.  It's kinda like veganism imo. Veganism and fasting are not inherently disordered, but I think a lot of disordered ppl latch onto those things because they provide ""rules"" and ""structure"" that fulfill ED ppl's need for a sense of control. Also, veganism and fasting encourage more restriction than anything- the ""rules"" are not about what you CAN eat, but what you CAN'T eat.  But at the same time. When it comes to fasting... I think the fasting subreddit is full of super disordered thoughts and behavior. It was super triggering for me when I got into fasting. Like wayyy more than the fasting itself.  Idk it's complicated no matter how you slice it. I can totally see why people think it's inherently disordered- it can totally be a slippery slope. It depends on the person.",False,False

At first I was worried because I definitely use fasting to punish myself, but it's not like that with him. Sure he wants to lose a bit of weight, but that's it.  When I told him that any time I try to get with intermittent fasting I start with 16 hours and when I reach that I just keep adding hours to the fast because I can. He very firmly told me not to do that and that 16h is the maximum he's gonna do so that he still has time to eat three meals a day.  So no, it's not disordered in itself. The IF sub is sometimes a bit sketchy but I think it's because only hardcore fasting people care enough to be active on that sub.",False,False

After all EDs are first and foremost a mental illness, and saying someone who fasts correctly is suffering from one is just insensitive and rude.  Everything in life has its pros and cons, just because it didn't go well for you doesn't mean it won't go well for someone else (and vice versa). If anything, we should stop saying certain things or habits are a ""one size fits all"" type of thing :/",False,True

There *are* literally scholarly articles finding benefits for overweight/obese and sometimes healthy weight individuals as well - but absolutely not one person in the world is saying it’s healthy to do regularly if you’re underweight.   Also, fasting is just fasting. If your maintenance is 1800 and you fast for two days of the week but eat 2500 every day you’re not fasting - you won’t lose weight but you can still get the potential ‘benefits’ of a fasted state. This is a pattern that healthy weight people can do to maintain their weight but eat with more freedom when they do.  But our EDs will usually twist this into:  fasting healthy and normal for some = healthy and normal for me   And I feel like this mindset also allows us to project onto those who are doing it (or any diet really) with a healthy mindset as ‘disordered’",False,False

I know a friend who has bad eating habits and intermittent fasting gives her a schedule to go by, which so far has helped her for the better. I hate how it's demonized without actual facts just because ""omg skipping meals!!"". Imo as long as you eat well and enough during your feeding window its completely fine.",False,True

I think some people do it because it feels good for them, but for some of us, we do it as a punishment, almost? Like I know some people who do intermittent fasting and it actually works for them in a healthy way. I feel like whenever I fast it’s because I’m angry or sad or something so it’s used more as a self-destructive thing rather than a positive thing. I think that’s the main difference between fasting being disordered or not. But in and of itself, I don’t think it’s necessarily disordered, I feel like it’s only disordered when it’s used in a way like how I mentioned I do it",False,False
