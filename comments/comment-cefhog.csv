Itâ€™s there and it offends TF out of me. Itâ€™s *not* a normal abdomen belly, itâ€™s very flabby and soft and casts a shadow. I hate it.   People think Iâ€™m bonkers for wanting to lose more weight, and I have to choose my words wisely. I have a feeling my ribs are going to be showing but Iâ€™m still going to have this little belly so I plan on losing weight until my stomach is flat.",False,False

Guys feel an innate, natural desire to be big and strong, which often conflicts with the desire to not be fat. There is only so low a guy will tolerate going. Many women have no such limit, they seem to want to restrict themselves into oblivion. It hurts to see, but I have no idea how to address it because our very nature demands that we stay strong.  Obviously I am painting with a broad brush here, but I have been paying attention to enough to see the trends.",False,False
