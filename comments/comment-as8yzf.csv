I feel organized. I get excited when I first start to see progress and it inspires me to keep going. Then, I will start seeing everything as numbers. I become obsessive and overthink things even more than I usually do. I panic when I don’t know the exact nutritional information of something and knowingly overestimate it, just in case. Numbers that I once viewed as small will start to seem like too much, so I have to keep setting new standards. These standards start off like a snowball rolling down a hill and suddenly become an avalanche. I can feel my body eating itself, which makes me feel great somehow, but I’ll look in the mirror and think that it’s not enough, so I’ll keep going and make my restrictions more extreme. The brain fog sets in and I become exhausted. I feel like my body is shutting down, and I know I have to pick myself back up.   Since high school, I have averaged about two relapses a year. I don’t know if I will ever fully recover, but I would say I am in “remission,” and I don’t think this illness will be the end of me.",False,False

In the beginning I feel on top of my game.  It always reaches a point though where it starts to fall down, and from then the chaos just increases exponentially.  ",False,False
