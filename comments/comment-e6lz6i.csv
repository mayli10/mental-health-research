It's a very, very vague memory and it would have been an *old* episode. I think it was some young mom whose diet was basically just coffee and nibbling on her kid's leftovers. And if I'm right, it was the same season as the guy whose entire diet was energy drinks and cigarettes. But I might be totally wrong, and I may have come up with number after having the same realization you did and doing the math myself.",False,False

Idk I just wish they had taken more of an opportunity to show how unhealthy and unhappy EDs can be since most/like all of the people on there probably have an ED of some kind. I feel like thatâ€™s more of a deterrent than just hiding it or basically acting like itâ€™s possible for an average healthy person to get that thin on 1400 calories bc someoneâ€™s gonna found out that itâ€™s not true one way or another :( (like way younger naive me would have wanted to DIE if she saw 1400 cals a day for someone as thin as Tatiana)",False,True

More like 700 Max on a heavy calorie day.
