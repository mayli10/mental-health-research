I'm hoping this new way of eating for me helps me to continue to not binge and purge. ,False,False

The problem also occurred for me to a more minor degree before my ED, so it hasn't entirely gone away, but after a few weeks of eating mostly liquids (Ensure Plus is my go-to, but juices and smoothies have been great too) and soft foods like yogurt and ice cream, I've been able to reincorporate small portions of solids with minimal bloat and discomfort. Maybe it would work for you too. I also *seriously* recommend iron supplements. Anemia is pretty much a guarantee for anyone who has an eating disorder (and very common even in healthy women) and I found that after I starting taking supplements it was way easier to naturally use the toilet which seriously reduced the urge the purge. It's important too to stay hydrated, as dehydration makes constipation (and thus bloating) worse. ",False,False
