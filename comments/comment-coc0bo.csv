In my state in the US, substance use disorders and eating disorders are considered personal choices, so doctors and mental health care providers cannot place you on a psychiatric hold / force treatment, unless if you’re suicidal, a danger to others, or are *cognitively* unable to take care of your basic needs (ie, it doesn’t count if you’re cognitively intact - also called having decisional capacity - and “choosing” to not eat). The last situation would apply to, for example, someone with schizophrenia who is experiencing a delusion that is causing them to not eat or drink.",False,False

(assuming it's a competent doctor/therapist, they most likely understand that you can't force someone to recover when they don't want to). they might frown upon it, because naturally these people's jobs are to help you get better, but a doctor can help monitor your symptoms more closely if they're aware of what's going on and a therapist can help with a barrage of ED issues without insisting that the only solution is to recover right now. it would be really good idea to talk to them about it, and i don't think it's anywhere near easy to legally admit an adult against their will, so i think you're safe.",False,False
