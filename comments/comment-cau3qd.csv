It's bad, but I know realistically that no one is judging my body and I'm considered to be on the thinner side. Ideally, my goal is to be fairly underweight, and my reasoning is related to how other people perceive me but I still feel like it's very much my own decision based off my own opionions. I want to be seen as extremely thin, but I don't ever feel like there's that expectation placed on me so I'm not incredibly self conscious about how I look now. I have no idea if this makes any sense lmfao",False,False

Eating disorders can and will affect the people around you. I’m still upset my mom tried to justify my grandpa’s statement even after he called to apologize to me afterwards because he realized how poorly he phrased his words.",False,False
