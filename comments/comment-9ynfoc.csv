If you don't want to confront him about it, at least know that he's probably only saying that because you're thin. No one would EVER comment about a fat person eating (at least not in a work environment because we universally recognize that that's a mean thing to do). He's probably calling you hungry, etc, because he's the same sort of person who would say ""go eat a burger you're too thin"" y'know?   I sat down with my in-laws and ate like a 1/4 of the portion of everyone else and they were like flabbergasted that I managed it. They also constantly remind me to eat.

However, I feel like he probably says it as a playful joke, not comprehending how such a comment might be interpreted by the second party or how it may be affecting them :( As long as he remains ignorant on that part, I don't think there is an easy solution to your situation.
