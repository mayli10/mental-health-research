I work at a restaurant and Iâ€™m saddened by people who order three pieces of bacon and then eat half of one piece and leave the rest. Happens all the time. Just including that cuz while it makes me feel terrible, it alleviates some of my personal guilt. Knowing the problem is so much bigger than me and my consumption.   But yeah if ur comfortable with ur dad u could explain a little. That when thereâ€™s such large portions u feel pressured to put it to use because of ur respect for animals.
