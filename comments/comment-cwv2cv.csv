He knows I had an ED back in high school and I'm sure he recognizes some of my behaviors as disordered eating, but I haven't told him outright. I have no problem admitting to close friends that I have an issue, but they're all out-of-state; if I tell my fiancé, he's going to be all up in my business actively working to help me fix my eating habits, and...I don't want to gain weight. I want to keep losing weight. It's so hard to recognize you have a problem that you know you should resolve but...also...  I wish I had advice instead of commiseration, but I believe in us!! We'll get help and healthy in time.",False,False
