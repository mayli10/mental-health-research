I just started taking the ramen sauce and using it with zero pasta noodles and like thats my ""ramen"" but Im really restrictive with sodium because that's one of my fears. and tomorrow im just really restrictive with my food and it kinda sucks and right now Im so OBSESSED with halp top right now like on walmart im just going on the website and just looking at them and watching people taste test them and ugh its just I wish i can just go in the kitchen and eat some but I cant. its just annoying and Im glad your going to go eat a bagel and eat lunch. I dont know you but your great and I just really want the best for you, I just wish I can know what's stopping me from my dreams you know.",False,False

I know you’ll be able to stop counting someday soon and I hope that day is tomorrow :) My goal is to start eating lunch again. I’ve just been drinking a coffee in the morning and then eating dinner for a long time so that’s my first goal. I’m going to buy a bagel tomorrow (one of the things I’m afraid of eating) for lunch and I’m going to enjoy it because bagels are so fucking good. I hope all goes well for you!! You’re so strong,False,True

Any friend that would disregard your honest expression of your experiences isn’t acting much like a friend (or is reacting poorly because they’re afraid or confused about how to respond). I hope you are able to receive recovery support both from professional sources and from friends. Good luck. You deserve recovery.,False,False
