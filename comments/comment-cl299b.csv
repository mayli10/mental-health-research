Maybe when you’re settled in your new place the stress will lessen and you’ll feel better able to control your impulses.   I get you. It’s not the healthiest suggestion ever, but what’s working for me is I implemented an interim month of pure restriction with no binging, eating slightly more daily than I usually do and not overeating on the weekends. Eliminating the permission to eat whatever I want occasionally has really helped me to reset because if I don’t start, I won’t be able to not stop. I plan to go back to my normal routine in mid August. It was sustainable for me for a really long time and I am confident it will be again!",False,False

I used to maintain a low BMI easily but now I can't.   I really wish I could just do something sustainable for life .. like I want to eat one way forever,False,True

I’d been successfully restricting for a year and a half. I had been consistently dropping weight to an extremely low bmi, was barely eating anything during the week and then eating whatever the hell I wanted on the weekends. I was riding the high of being very underweight along with not feeling like I was denying myself the things I wanted.   In June of this year a few different events collided that made me feel very out of control of my life and started a binging episode that lasted over a month. This wasn’t like my weekends had been previously; I wasn’t eating whatever I wanted, I was just mindlessly binging, completely unable to stop myself even when I wanted to, not giving into cravings necessarily because it wasn’t like I was eating my favourite foods, I was just eating whatever was there and not stopping until it was gone.   Every day I’d try to start over and every day I’d fail. I was panicking, feeling like I’d never get my self control back and that this was just my life now.   Well, eventually after a few weeks the binge impulses tapered off and I’m almost back to normal.   For me, having those outside factors recede so my regular, non-ED life returned to normalcy was hugely helpful, but I also just think that sometimes after long periods of restriction, the body and mind need to go through a sort of cleansing process in order to reset. Maybe just try to accept that you’re going through this phase right now and that more than likely, it will be over soon and things will shift back.   Also take a look at external factors and think if anything changed in your life around the time you started binging to see if you can identify what triggered it. You may be able to work on that and it might help reduce and eventually end the binging    Good luck.",False,False
