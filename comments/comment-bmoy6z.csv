I'm trying but it's so easy to just say ""fuq it"" and grab mcd and get rid of it. But I want a slimmer face if I'm even able to.",False,False

And I had STRONG bulimia face lol- I was purging about the same amount you are. I also thought it was because I was fat but... I lost a bunch of weight while purging and I still had a slight double chin from swollen lymph nodes. :/  I'm at one of my higher weights now actually, and my jawline is sharp and thin, no double chin no swelling.

I've been purging daily, DAILY, 1-3 times since the beginning of the year. I have no idea what happened. I guess my marvelous restriction phase faded into a bp phase. Put on 10lbs. I'd like to believe my face is fat looking because of ""bulimia face"" and not just me being fat in general lmao  Do you have any experience with facial swelling? Has there been a difference between when you stopped and now?  Congrats again!!",False,False

What keeps me going is taking steps to manage my body dysmorphia and orthorexia.  I'm trying to divorce myself from the idea that weight dictates my self worth and success in life.  I'm smart, I'm funny, I'm kind, I'm loved... and none of it has to do with my weight.  [This interview with Jameela Jamil and Sam Smith](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qas79teBXk) conveys a lot of what has helped me to do that. (:    I've also realized the concept of safe foods isn't conducive to a healthy relationship with food.  I was very scared of carbs and sugars until I realized that categorizing those as ""unhealthy"" was setting myself up for failure.  If I have 10 safe foods, that means I have an infinite number of ""unsafe foods"" that if consumed in any amount, I would feel like I binged and would want to purge it.    I also realized the whole concept of carbs/sugar make you fat is just... marketing. I went to China recently and EVERYONE ate rice and noodles with their meals... and they were so thin.  I demonized carbs so much but then I saw an entire country of thin people who ate carbs with every meal!   I've noticed many bookstores are stocking books about Paleo/Keto/whatever diets now.  Not saying the diets don't work but... it's all just marketing to sell their product.  Just like how back in the 90's advertising pushed the idea that fat makes you fat to sell margarine and other low-fat products.  It's all a cycle of exploiting insecurities and creating trends to make people buy products.    Sorry I rambled. (: I wish you the best, I really do.",False,True

I totally recognize your victory because I promised myself a reward if I could go one week without purging... still no reward. Do you have any tips that helped you over the past 3 weeks?",False,False
