On some days it's so easy to not eat almost all day, and on other days I start eating at 10am and won't stop until I go to sleep at night... And all I could think about is food...  For me, when I am hungry and don't eat, it feels like success, I feel superior kind of, and good about myself. And as soon as I eat, I feel chubby and fat and disgusting and these feelings make me eat even more. It's horrible.  &amp;#x200B;  A year ago I ate so much crap but I was able to maintain my weight and I thought I should really go swimming on a regular basis and start eating more healthily... few months later? I am back on here with this stupid disorder, making me want to starve and binge and starve and binge... as if I could never do anything right.",False,False
