I’ll try to work up the courage to tell someone but if I’m honest I’m not sure when I’ll be able to. Regardless I needed to hear this so thank you again",False,True

I remember that exact feeling of gradually realizing that I was no longer in control of my thoughts and behavior like I thought I was.  I've learned since that it's part of the disorder that you will *never* feel sick enough to recover or feel like you ""deserve"" help and recovery--people dying in the hospital still don't feel like they deserve that. Regardless of whether or not you qualify for a diagnosis I think the fact that you posted this means you know you have a problem and any kind of disordered eating behavior/thoughts is enough to merit seeking help. I'd recommend telling your closest and most trusted family/friends/support system and going to therapy if you can afford/get it covered by insurance. It can be scary to ask for help at first but it pains me to think about the massive amounts of time/money/health/pain my ED caused me and the sooner you get help the less of  precious life you will waste with this.   Sending love :)",False,False
