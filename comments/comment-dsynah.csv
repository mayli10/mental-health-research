The lunches were really good but they gave *ridiculously* large portions. (Genuinely ridiculous...like 2-3x USDA portion sizes.) A lot of folks there were very low income and food insecure so I felt guilty throwing stuff out (we weren‚Äôt allowed to give our portion to others...some health code thing). Ultimately I asked myself, ‚Äúwhy am I treating myself like a human InSinkErator??‚Äù Good and adequate nutrition was the goal...not too little but also not too much. It felt uncomfortable to toss stuff in the trash, but overall that was better for me than tossing it all in myself and fueling a conflicted relationship with food and my body.",False,False

I work as a cook in a long term care home, and we do catered events for managment occasionally.

Wasted food is bad, but it's the university's responsibility to resolve that. Not yours. Additionally, so much food gets wasted every day - two sandwiches won't make any difference.
