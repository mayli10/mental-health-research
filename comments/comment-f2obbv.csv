I had a bio teacher in college who wanted the class to log all their food for a week and count up the calories at the end. He was trying to teach the practice of mindful eating and being aware of what we eat and how we feel.   I told him I don’t feel comfortable taking part in the experiment but I’d do anything else he assigned to me like write a paper, do a book report, interview people and write it up, anything. His original assignment wasn’t healthy for me as I was in recovery and doing everything in my power to take the focus off of food and calories.   He of course allowed me to alter the project and he asked if I would write out my story for him, and even went as far to say he wouldn’t read it but would just allow me to show him the paper and trust I did the work.   **He came back to me a few years later and told me that conversation changed the way he taught that class forever.** He said he never stopped to consider that there are people in his class who struggle with eating disorders and that he was so sorry he had been teaching that “health” unit the same way for years prior to having me as a student. He doesn’t teach it the same anymore, and he went on to ask me to share my story with his class about the entire experience.   Really powerful stuff. Never be afraid to talk to your professors because the good ones *want* to keep you safe and protect you while you have been entrusted to  them.",False,False

You are doing the right thing. Also, when i first developed my ED it wasn’t because I wanted to be skinny, i did it because I felt completely out of control of my entire life and eating was the one thing I could have complete control over. The stereotypical portrayal of who has an ED (specifically anorexia or bulimia) being a skinny white teenage girl is so harmful and also miseducated all the non-ED folx in your class who are going to now have an inaccurate image of how EDs work and who is affected by them, which won’t help them if they or a loved one of theirs develops something in the future. Hope this made sense and was cohesive, it’s 6 am and I’m p out of it right now.",False,False

It wouldn’t be out of line for you to talk to your professor about it.  You can mention your own experience if you feel comfortable doing so but you aren’t obligated to. You could help her gain a more nuanced view of the subject and, if she looks for more appropriate media, then you will be helping future students as well.",False,False
