Because the way i am losing is not healthy. I struggle with *here name the worst things you struggle with* and i dont expect you to understand why. Just please understand that i dont feel in control of it and it's making me miserable. And i want to get help""   Obviously i dont want to put words in your mouth. But it sounds like he really doesnt understand eating disorders. If you try by saying something like ""i struggle to feel okay eating literally anything and when i eat it's like theres another person in my head bashing me for it"" it may help him realize it's not necessarily 100% about the weight. I dont know if that will help at all. My dad doesnt understand why i have my eating disorder, but he tries really hard. What it took was me being vulnerable and him seeing how seriously it was affecting me. I hope that helps",False,False
