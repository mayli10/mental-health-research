Or just skip the bagel altogether to get rid of the carbs. (I use the bagel because Iâ€™m on the go and my commute is long). My local Trader joes has this good egg white salad thats 120 calories for the whole container so sometimes its just that with a spoon. also in the past have bought the 100 calorie packs of roasted almonds or mixed nuts since its good fat. I also usually have a coffee too since caffeine is essential for me to function. If I feel like being fancy, ill have some salmon the night before on a salad (less of a snack more a meal though). Or I buy smoked salmon and eat it straight from the package. I realize if youâ€™re vegan these snacks arenâ€™t great but they work for me ðŸ˜…",False,False

I raise to maintenance at this time and budget this in although I do get if thatâ€™s hard for you. I would focus on trying to make sure youre sleeping consistent, some self care activity (face mask, bubble bath, nails done, aromatherapy), and try to make sure you leave the house once a day",False,False

It's that time of the semester for me too. For non related food stuff I make sweet hot tea, draw, journal, and try and rest my body comfortably (snuggling in some sheets) just vibe with whatever hobbies or interests you have. If the ED finessed hobbies from you try just relaxing w hot beverage and watching funny content to chill out. As for the food situation you have to rember that grades are truly more important. Easier said than done but its crucial to remember that this time of the semester is when you really really dont want to let your ED win. Latley I've been trying to eat a sustainable amount but when I was actively restricting I would rely on protien heavy foods/drinks to cut through the ""zombie"" groggy brain foggy feeling. I found that protien gave me a lot more bang for my buck energy / brain function /  satiety wise than carbs or fats. My personal faves are egg whites / protien powder / chicken. So if you cannot stop restricting I would say up that protien intake and get on them quizletsss lmao. I know its rough out here but were gonna make it trust and belive sis. :)",False,False
