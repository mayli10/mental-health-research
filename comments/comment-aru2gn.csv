Now thinspo has been quarantined. As a member of proed who was active i can say that it was a support system yes, but not in the more wholesome and “any stage of recovery (even if you’re not ready yet)” way that ED anon is. Now here we don’t offer tips. We give you a place where you can vent about stuff, be scared, stressed and happy. But we’re here for each other,to support the people who are effected, not to elevate our disorder. I hope you find a place within our community but I hope it’s for more beneficial for you to help see and vent about the disgusting truth, and not to glorify it ♥️",False,True
