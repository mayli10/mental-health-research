My weight fluctuates so much and Iâ€™ve started dreading going to the doctor because they always comment on it (and itâ€™s like +- 3 lbs usually) eventually my therapist called and genuinely yelled at them because we had been asking them to stop commenting on it for 2 months and I started dry fasting for 36 hours before appointments ðŸ™„ðŸ™„ðŸ™„,False,False
