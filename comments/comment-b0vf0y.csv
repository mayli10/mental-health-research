Like other people have it worse, theyâ€™ve gotten over it, this is normal? So whatâ€™s the big deal",False,False

Some notable exceptions though:  * My parents used to do crash diets together. They were usually spiritual though, less appearance-based and more faith-based.  * My mom had a stint EDNOS in her 20s, but just kinda stopped when she'd had enough?? She restricted herself to only eating specific foods and B/Ped on bad days. She used to count calories a lot around preteen me, which I picked up.  * My dad started binge-eating when I was a preteen and ate himself into a prediabetic state. Then he started intermittent fasting, intensely exercising, and *obsessively* counting calories. Lost like 30lbs, got almost sickly thin. When he realized I was anorexic, he relaxed his eating rituals and gained a bit back.  * A friend of mine went through some ED issues when we were kids. She'd talk about how fat she was getting (she was really quite thin), how much/little she'd been eating, whether or not she'd gained weight. We were only like 12-13 at the time. I think she's doing okay now.  * Another friend has always struggled with being a little overweight. Around freshman year she started dieting and exercising. Became pretty obsessive but remained pretty unhealthy and chubbyish. She was a huge trigger for me and it destroyed our relationship.",False,False

Its probably why I had EDs now.  My friend in college started a keto diet which spiraled to orthorexia and we pretty much hang out together at lunch and meal times because we usually avoid eating with our other friends  I have a fling that suffered anorexia and we would both remind ourselves to eat everytime ðŸ˜‚ Idk what will probably happen if we did became boyfriends lol  My mom's sister was diagnosed with anorexia years ago and she seems recovered now, and eats well. I guess it shows that EDs probably run in our family",False,False

They're both recovered though. - other friend from college was bulimic, she's also recovered - another friend is recovering from bulimia, she still has some hang ups with food but is doing a lot better - I'm 99% sure my aunt has an ED. I've seen how she acts around food and know for sure she has some issues. - I feel like my dad binge eats but I'm not sure if its quite on the BED level. like it doesn't seem pretty compulsive? either way its not healthy though. - a couple other friends from college admitted to having EDs but AFAIK are recovered  only one of the above knows about my ED though lol  ",False,False

Fucked up her intestines so much she's dependent on it now. Saw it in my childhood but I only recently realized it as disordered behavior.  * Best friend struggles with body dysmorphia, model, tiny.  Admits to overexercising and restrictive eating. Gets really upset at the minimal fat on her body. * Old roommate restricts and fasts- also tiny.  I didn't catch on until she told me about ""lemon water detoxing"" aka water fasting.  We'd only go out drink together- she wouldn't order food and would lick salt instead.  Purged the alcohol when we got home under the guise of being wasted. * Another friend admits to yo-yo dieting.  Loses weight by eating 300cal on top of exercising.  Gains it back from binging.    None of these people have told me they have an eating disorder, but they openly discuss disordered habits...  the writing is on the wall. :/ ",False,False
