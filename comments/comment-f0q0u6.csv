Hides my deathly looking eye bags. I also like his highlighters!  BareMinerals Hydrating Mineral Veil is great for a touch up/getting makeup to last.  Skindinavia setting spray locks everything in really well.  RMS Beauty Luminizers and Buriti Bronzer for the ‚Äúhealthy glow‚Äù look.  Dr. Jart Camo Drops - it‚Äôs technically a color corrector (green turns to beige) but I use it as foundation and my skin looks really fresh and clean.  PeriPera Sugar Lip Tint - really nice lip stain that stays on through everything!,False,False

At all. Threw up in this also (funnily enough, at the exact same time I threw up in the NYX eyeliner), and it didn't move an inch",False,False

They have a matte and a hydrating version and it‚Äôs only like six bucks! I love it for covering up dark circles and acne both.  Milani make it last setting spray so your makeup doesn‚Äôt budge while using any behaviors (this bitch likes to exercise) I feel like UD all mightier would be good too but I‚Äôm broke  A good primer with some grip. I‚Äôve been using the elf poreless putty primer or mixing the smashbox primerizer with a ciate watermelon primer sample but I really want to try the cover fx gripping primer so my makeup stays on.  Fake the healthy glow with a highlighter. I‚Äôve just been using random samples from Ipsy. Blush and bronzer can also help fake healthy.
