Pedialyte (one serving is about 25 cal I think) can get you some nutrients. Pickles/pickle juice is great for electrolytes and so is bone broth. Smoothies (make it yourself and you can also find some with lower calories, add some protein powder) also really helped me out when I was your age  I’m so sorry you’re struggling. If there’s anyone at all you can reach out to like a friend or teacher, please do. If not, there are resources online that may be able to help and of course we’re all here for emotional support. I don’t want to alarm you, but the amount of weight you’ve lost is highly concerning and extremely dangerous. Since you made this post, I think there might be some small part of you that is wanting to get better. Please latch onto that feeling and try anything you can❤️ we want you to get help before irreversible damage is done. We want you to be here in 3 years when it’s time to go out on your own because I know you have so many things to offer and you deserve to be happy and healthy",False,False

Are they not really in the picture somehow?",False,False
