My husband still doesn’t know. I can relate to the lying- it’s so exhausting when he questions why all of a sudden I’m making separate dinners again. My husband is a big guy (6’3”) and he eats A LOT. I hate lying to him about how much I’ve eaten, how I’ve lost 25 lbs over the last several months. I hate telling him I’m not hungry when I’m starving, I hate when he thinks it’s adorable that I’m inhaling food when I’m binging and he’s like “where does it all go?!” This disorder is terrifying and it changes you into a person that can be hard to recognize, but just remember, you’re not alone. We’ve got your back here. It’s ok to mess up, we all still love you bb.",False,False

I recognize my logic is incorrect, but that doesn’t mean I always see it at the moment. I guess I equate being skinny and tiny to being more worthy of love",False,True

Before I relapsed, I literally was 100% honest with my boyfriend. I never lied. But I'm beginning to lie now about ED stuff, and it doesn't cause me to feel good in the slightest.  And I'm always so fucking tired now, and my boyfriend tries to have a normal conversation with me at night or something, and I just get irrationally irritated because I feel like I have to talk to him but have no energy to.  And it's like..a huge reason why I want to get skinny is because I want to be the perfect girlfriend for him. It just feels horrible knowing I'm partly doing this for him but hurting him in the process. It's like, the journey basically negates the destination.  It's okay though, because I'm doing it mostly for me anyway lol",False,False
