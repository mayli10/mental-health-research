I was raped by a man I considered a close friend and it is a special kind of fucked up. Please do reach out to me if you need to talk about anything. I definitely understand you on the binging thing but you are not going crazy and you are hurt because this mega fuckwit betrayed your trust and violated you. In terms of food maybe you could find something comforting but less scary for you? (I personally love popcorn with cheese powder) with drinking, if you can I recommend trying to stay away from it for a while because it can really really magnify negative emotions but if you really have to (which I totally understand and was definitely my coping mechanism of choice) try to be safe. I wish I could kick that shitstain. You are wonderful and I hope you can feel a bit better soon",False,False

Dude, he's not your friend. He's a self-absorbed little cunt who's revealed his true self and isn't worth any part of your time and energy. And I mean yeah of course it's going to take time to heal from this, I just wanted to reinforce that we're on your side and it's truly awful that you had to be betrayed like that. Something similar happened to me and just, ugh. If it's heartbreaking to feel like you can't trust him anymore just remember you don't *need* to be able to trust him again because he is an untrustworthy person and doesn't deserve vulnerability from you or forgiveness. There are better people in this world",False,False

Seriously, I’m tearing up over here, and I didn’t know I had any tears left. It was a really fucked up situation.    Things didn’t go very far, but it was far enough that I felt scared and violated and disgusted, and when I worked up the courage to talk to him about it he seemed way more concerned with the fact that my boyfriend is going to kick his ass than anything else. Honestly, the worst part about all of this is how little he seems to care about me or our relationship when he was my best fucking friend. I made it clear I’d be willing to forgive him because not having him in my life seems like the worst thing ever, and he made it clear he’s too afraid of my boyfriend for that to be a possibility. I’m hurt, confused, and betrayed. I was raped by a stranger several years ago and that was hell for its own reasons but I never thought that something like this would fuck me up as bad as that experience since this assault was much less traumatic.    I really, really appreciate the support and I’m sending you lots and lots of love as well. The most fucked up Part is that a big part of me wishes I hadn’t said anything because then I wouldn’t have to go through the loss of the friendship, but hearing your experience was really helpful. Thank you ❤️",False,True

It is so important right now that you seek any help that you can, even though it’s hard as hell.  Do you have any other friends you can process this with and lean on? A good friend can help carry you when you can’t carry yourself. I am sure this seems impossible right now, but can you go to the authorities?   Again, I’m so, SO sorry this has happened. I’m sending you so much love. I wish I could carry some of this pain for you. Something similar happened to me, and I continued acting like nothing happened. I saw him and interacted with him in my group of friends afterward. I HIGHLY do not recommend this. Looking back, I wish I had sought help, through friends or professionally.   I’m sorry if I’ve bombarded you. I just want you to know, if nothing else, that this internet stranger believes you are loved and can come through this. To reiterate: sending you all of the love. ❤️",False,False
