T asked my weight yesterday (she's a pre med student and was doing some BMI project) and I told her my weight and the first thing she says is ""I didn't expect that number to be so high""   Like thanks now I want to starve myself to death.

I was 5 pounds from my pre-pregnancy weight after having my son and two women I knew felt the need to tell me I carried the extra weight well. It was such a low blow to me because I was actually feeling pretty confident again.,False,False

I went into this nice boutique and was looking at some sweaters that were oversized and loose. I saw one I really liked and the sales lady noticed and asked if I wanted to try it on, I said yes and as she was walking me to the fitting room she said, ""hmm that's a small but let me try and look for a medium for you in the back"" then she closed the curtain and I was just dead inside.   Like I know I have a very warped sense of body image but I also know that there is no way any sane person would think that I needed a M size in an OVERSIZED sweater.  You must be right about the second part, because I did feel insecure and bought the stupid sweater.",False,False

That's literally just like a couple kg from clinically underweight.  I don't like to make rash judgements about ppl I don't now but that was 100% just a straight up moronic thing for your coworker to say. That doesn't make ANY sense. No body type is ever going to look remotely even a little overweight at bmi 19.,False,False

When I was a teeny tiny size XS a woman in a lingerie store asked me ""so what size are you, M or L?""      I was *obviously* not a size M or L. But the women in that store are known to be bitches.  I think it's supposed to be something with making your customers spend more money if they are insecure and looking for approval from the staff.      It's so backhanded and passive agressive",False,False
