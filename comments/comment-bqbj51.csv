I ate 2550 today and still burned enough to lose half a pound of fat today.  It may feel like 683 is the end of the world, but you will be okay. Your body naturally burns at least 1200 plus any exercise you do. You will be okay!!! Remember, long run, it is just a number and today is just a blip on the radar! Assuming you usually restrict much lower, I'm sure your body is thankful for any extra nourishment you managed to give it today",False,False
