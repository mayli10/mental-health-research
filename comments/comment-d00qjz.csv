But I just bought potassium powder so I can do the snake fast diet. So I'm not going to let that go to waste. So I'm probably going to fast at least 2 days a week and screw my routine up anyway!,False,True

But fasting and exercising with it is so weirdly freeing. When I fast as opposed to even low-restricting I feel much more energized, the problem is that I have a harder time falling to sleep.   Also feeling more productive strangely? That's something that happens with me.",False,False

I completely relate to this. I feel so accomplished when I am doing both. It’s the best feeling in the world. That empty feeling stomach is blissful. I wish I could sleep on an empty stomach. My life would be so much easier.,False,False
