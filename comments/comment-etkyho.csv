My dental hygienist asked me what my ""secret"" was after losing a significant amount of weight over the year and I just clammed up. I'm sure I had this deer in the headlights look and she just said, ""ah, no secret, just diet and exercise, right?"" Yep, that's definitely all.",False,False

A little while ago I was temporarily wearing pants at work that were more like black “jeggings” than slacks, and she made a half joke half serious comment like, “Hey those aren’t work appropriate!” And I said, “Yeah sorry, it’s temporary— I’m on the hunt for some new pants. These are the only black pants that fit me right now. :( ” And she said, “What, like, your others are too big? Because GOOD LORD you are SKINNY.” I just awkwardly and shyly said yeah, actually they’d become loose on me and I had trouble finding pants that fit me correctly. So it’s not the first time she’s commented on me weight unfortunately.",False,True

My boyfriend's grandmother has made some comments like that too. The other day she asked me how much I've lost and I muttered something about not really weighing myself which is a fucking lie I just didn't want to talk about it.",False,False
