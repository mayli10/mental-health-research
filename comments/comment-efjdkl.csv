I don’t even understand why.   I try to remember sizing is so confusing and unpredictable that it’s hard even for me to know what size will be right. And to remember that most of the time people just wanted to give me something nice, and the size carried no judgement. (Though there totally are people out there that use clothing as a weaponized gift - I’m just blessed not to be related to them.)",False,False
