I feel like when most people try to get out of a binge cycle they aim to stop the bingeing but what I found worked for me somewhat is stopping the purging. I used to purge several times during a binge so when I stopped allowing myself to purge (not as easy as it sounds, I know), I found that the bingeing levelled out a little. Idk but Im sorry you're going through this its tough shite ðŸ’•",False,False

Iâ€™ve been to the grocery store twice today and purged every little bit of food that I purchased. Not a good feeling.   My advice to you: meal prep.   For me, when I get the motivation to actually do it, it helps me SO MUCH. I make fancy little low-cal sandwich wraps, portion out TJ cauliflower stir fry, toss in some crunchy seaweed chips and maybe some skinny pop if I trust myself... or I make spinach salads and carefully cook egg whites, portion out my exciting low calorie dressings, weigh my sugar-free jello...   Making the food is so fun to me. Knowing that everything in my cute little lunch box is SAFE and HEALTHY makes me feel okay with keeping it inside of my body. Throw in a few wertherâ€™s (spelling?? Idk) original candies to treat yourself after you eat, or maybe some of the exciting dessert teas to finish your meal on a guilt-free note.   Iâ€™m really sorry for what youâ€™re going through and I hope things get better. Donâ€™t forget to love yourself! Good luck on your exams!",False,False

I find it helps to plan out my entire day of eating in advance if I know I really need to do work that day. ",False,False

I keep promising myself I'll just exert a little willpower and break the cycle but clearly it isn't that simple.  I'm pretty afraid of the physical side effects / risks of b/p. I've been feeling worse and worse each morning when I get up - I know it's related. Also if I'm going to allow myself to be at all vanity-driven then, well, my face looks dehydrated and haggard.  I don't know how to help but I definitely get it.",False,False
