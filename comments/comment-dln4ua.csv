I lost weight and lost my tits and ass and thighs but with PCOS I have a belly still. I'm now in the higher end of the healthy BMI range. I still get hit on occasionally when I'm alone at work, but now that I go out mostly accompanied by my boyfriend it's hard to gauge.   The right kinda guy won't give a shit and like you for you, I promise. When you're attracted to a personality they become a 10/10 anyways, that's how it is for me anyways. My boyfriend is a bit overweight but I still drool over him because he makes me laugh and he's smart.   You don't want someone who just cares for looks anyways, they're just concieted and boring.",False,False

I get hit on way, way more often when I‚Äôm in the healthy BMI range- like 19-20. Once I hit underweight it‚Äôs like *tumbleweed bounces across an empty ghost town road*.   I also lose my tits as soon as I skip a meal, so. ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è  That and apparently the thinner I am the more ‚Äúintense‚Äù I seem. I lose all of my approachability, I guess?
