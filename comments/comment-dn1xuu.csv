It is not possible to gain on 1000 calories a day if your TDEE is higher than that. If you are counting calories and know you can lose at 1000 calories, then you should see a doctor.",False,False

Is your starting weight super low that you might gain on lower intake? It’s just that if you’re really gaining weight on fewer than 1000 kcal/per and there’s no chance you’re not just mistaken about your intake then you seriously need medical attention because that is really abnormal and there are only a handful of metabolic disorders that could account for that!&lt;",False,False

It is hard I know but actually it can happen to gain with a minimum calorie intake. Not gonna bore you with the nutritional science facts, we all are here because we care about them too much in the wrong way, so I assume you know about starvation mode etc. Just gonna say, if you are trying, even in baby steps, continue. You're worth more than numbers on a scale. Your mental health is worth more.  If you are not... well just gonna send a hug anyway and hope you get better.",False,False
