The past year being sober, the first 6 months of that I barely ate. I replaced drugs with drinking. Throughout my 20's I can count the time periods between being drunk and partying and not worrying about my weight to being clean while obsessively working out, not eating, and maintaining the appearance of a healthy person who cared about her body.

When I was addicted to cocaine, drinking heavily, and abusing benzos, my ED was in the background; now that I’m no longer using, it’s moved to the forefront as my coping mechanism.  I have BPD, and I’ve found that restriction really chills out my more difficult symptoms. I used to frequently self-harm and I haven’t cut myself in over a year. Hunger does indeed give me a high, and my little ED routines give me a sense of purpose and stability. While I do wish my dysmorphia caused me less anguish, being immersed in my ED is way easier than being a borderline trainwreck.",False,False

I'm going through one of my worst relapses in years, and I think that this bout is being caused by a need for self-worth, self-validation, and attention.
