My SO and I spent time together and he made me feel so special. I was so at ease to the point we shared a Vegetarian meal together which was HUGE for me since I hadn‚Äôt had dairy in so long in which I became lactose intolerant after years of  Veganism. Yet I‚Äôd told him the only way my mom was able to give birth to me was because she ate a pizza...or else I wasn‚Äôt coming through to this planet...I was due late and she had to have a C-Section to get me out.    So he and I concluded I should grant myself cheese once in a while when I feel my lowest since it generally was a great source of happiness for me. We ate enchiladas and goddamn was it good made me wonder how I‚Äôd gone so long without Mexican food and I thought fuck I must‚Äôve really hated myself to dismiss such great food.   Of course I‚Äôm back on my EC Stacking for the next two days...friends want to go out and party tomorrow and I‚Äôm praying I don‚Äôt cave and eat heavy carbs. I plan on EC Stacking through my entire shift and then going for a late night run after work which will make me feel better. Stack tomorrow as well till I just have to eat.... I want to see my hip bones stick out more :(.  I refuse to check my scale and use my 3/4 getting looser as a way to know I‚Äôm getting closer to fitting into a size 0. Still desperate to get there a little bit upset that I caved but fasting and running on this Stack should help.   But I‚Äôm still definitely struggling with ED I want to be fit have meals and not feel ashamed at some point in my life. I know I‚Äôm getting weak because after sex I feel so goddamn sore and sure it‚Äôs passionate but it‚Äôs like I barely have any strength. I don‚Äôt want my ED to screw up my sex life and next thing I know I‚Äôm avoiding it because I‚Äôm too small.   I will say I‚Äôm happy I ate yesterday it was literally the best and I also know how to starve well enough to be back down to starvation mode :/ I‚Äôm not sure how I‚Äôll recover but secretly I hope my SO will be the key to breaking this viscous cycle and finally I‚Äôll be happy because I can know I‚Äôve found healing for myself through his love and love for me I suppose.,False,False

It's probably just because of my atrocious posture at work :(  In other news, my coworker has decided to eat at her desk (we're normally not allowed but no-one's in the office today so whatever) and she's eating something crunchy and chewing really loudly so here I am on a 30 hour fast browsing an ED subreddit with her constant crunching in my ear and I want to scream.",False,False
