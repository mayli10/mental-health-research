For me, it was useful to regard the thoughts I had about my weight as simply that, thoughts, and they don’t have to mean anything more than they fact they’re just my brains reaction to some number, but they don’t have to be *my* reaction to the number. (Of course this isn’t an easy thing to do, and I hope I don’t come across as diminishing how you feel)  I also compartmentalized, and placed the memory of my weight in some back room of my mind. This isn’t the healthiest; it’s much better to try to work through your feelings and discuss them with a therapist or the like. But it’s a type of harm reduction.   With that though, definitely discuss these things with a trained professional. I’m sure you’ve already had a lot of discussions based around weight, numbers, and the value which we place on these things but are not innate to them. I tried to view my new body and weight through a perspective that placed value on my life, happiness, and health; my new weight shows my commitment to myself and is a form of resistance against the oppressiveness of eating disorders and a society which imposes arbitrary ideals onto its members.",False,False
