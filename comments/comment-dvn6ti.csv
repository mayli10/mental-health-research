I will eat anything as long as it's in my calorie limit mostly. I do have fear foods but I still eat them sometimes   Mostly the stuff I wont eat is stuff that is very high calorie or that makes me feel bloated. Like I'm afraid of dairy so I eat mostly vegan because cheese has a lot of fat and it makes me so bloated",False,False

Even pasta.. even pasta and bread in the same meal.. as long as it‚Äôs weighed and all calories are accurate  What I can‚Äôt do is eat even a plain burger patty at someone else‚Äôs house bc I don‚Äôt know what % beef they used or how many oz. they made the patties.. I don‚Äôt trust anyone‚Äôs roasted veggies bc Idk how much oil they used.   As long as I can count the calories I‚Äôll eat anything.

Bread and pasta are both ""fear"" foods for me not because I explicitly have trouble eating them, but because I'm either concerned that they'll trigger a binge, or that I know the amount I'm comfortable eating would not be enough to satisfy me because I like them so much, which would make me anxious.  I will happily eat bread/pasta as a part of a restaurant meal or a meal someone else prepared, for example, partially because then I feel like it's ""out of my control"" and partially also because there is a finite limit to how much of it I can eat; I can't binge at a restaurant or at my friend's place, and the time between eating and when I get home (and the way I'm much more hyper-aware of myself when I'm eating in public) will mean I probably won't binge when I get back either. So most foods are safe foods when I'm out of the house, but things like bread, rice, pasta, oils, sometimes avocado, etc. become fear foods/semi-fear foods when I'm at home because it's like... well I know that 1/4 of a cup of pasta is not going to be enough for me and if I try and eat just 1/4 of a cup of pasta it will awaken the Carb Beast within me and I'll eat 4 cups of pasta instead so it's easier in the long term for me to eat no pastas",False,False

(Also for weight restoring.) Oatmeal used to be not safe. Rice cakes are medium safe. Lentils used to be not safe. Popcorn is medium safe. Butter is not safe, pasta is very not safe, bread is usually not safe. Bananas usually safe but used to be a fear, as were pineapples. Zero calorie energy drinks are not safe rn???
