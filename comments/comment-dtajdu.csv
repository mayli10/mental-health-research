I resized an extremely sentimental ring to fit me when I was at my worst thinking my fingers were unlikely to change much. Once I got back up to a healthy weight I couldn‚Äôt fit the ring around my knuckle anymore.   The specific metal cannot be resized to make it bigger and now one of my favorite rings cannot be worn on my hand.   I would highly suggest putting your jewelry on a necklace or something of the sort instead of resizing.,False,False
