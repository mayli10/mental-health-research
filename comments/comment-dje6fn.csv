I need to, it is so good. I wish I lived closer to Trader Joe’s because I see so many tasty low cal things I want to try. Periods mess with my head in so many ways, they up my anxiety, zap my energy, and make me feel helpless. I feel fuller on my period because my cramps are so severe I can’t tell what’s going on in my stomach. But my chocolate and candy cravings go way up. Halo top is a lifesaver, but on my last period I was at my boyfriend’s house and I was embarrassed to eat it in front of him for some reason. Yep, I relate to that, I will eat half a fast food meal and then be back to high restriction to compensate. Makes me feel like I am a faker or something.",False,True

And yesterday i had sugar free jello and broth which you would think aren’t safe foods but by golly they felt so good to have! And i feel like it’s okay to binge on sugar free jello? Better than the 150 calorie per two Trader Joe’s cookies i need to get out of my house!  I hate periods! It’s literally the only time i feel out of control with my eating. This time i really lost it though.   And yeah, i felt the same “i don’t have disordered eating I’m eating at Roscoe’s! I just finished and entire waffle and biscuit smothered in gravy!”  But then the next day i ate 500 calories...",False,False

I feel so guilty about any boxed foods and artificial sweeteners are starting to freak me out. More and more often I just drink water or unsweetened tea so I don’t have to guilt myself. I am with you on the PMS thing. It is so hard to stay positive and eat clean during that time. I feel so invalid now just because I ate over my heavy restriction during my period and had a few planned treats at my boyfriend’s house.  I have trouble getting to the calories I should eat at breakfast, as seeing a number over 120 freaks me out so much and I feel like I am overeating.",False,True

Dark chocolate. Almond milk. Bagged shredded slaw. Zucchini. My list of safe foods is actually pretty small when I’m on a heavy restriction.  I consider most proteins as “safe” although Sometimes eating fish like tuna or sardines makes me feel like a failure, even if the sardines are prepared in water.   Bread and sugary foods make me feel like I’m failing. Any bread, even my coveted bagel thins. Carby stuff like rice cakes even make me feel like a loser. Things with dairy. I love halo top but I’m starting to feel a little frightened of it because of the dairy and the sugar (edited to add that i mean the sweetness of it). Beans and rice are big no nos. I really enjoy a steak about once a month but i spread it over three days because they’re so dense and high in calories.  I have just come out of a PMS induced binge and i am ready to heavily restrict until I’m sure I’m in the clear from all the days i went over my allotted calorie limit.  Edited to add that over processed boxed things also give me anxiety. I have a very difficult time seeing the entire calorie count on things, and i tend to feel dirty when i eat boxed/prepackaged food. I can eat a 300 calorie meal if everything is logged separately but seeing that amount on a container scares the shit out of me.",False,False
