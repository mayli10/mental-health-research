For me it was all about control. And because I didnt get help when I noticed it, my need for control just spiraled.  I'm proud you want to help yourself feel as great as you can. I hope you can get whatever help you need and just know we're always here for support ",False,False

I’d advise speaking to a therapist about it, preferably one that specializes in eating disorders.  The sooner you reach out for help, the easier it will be to fix your habits and mindset.  Imagine it’s like a black hole.  You’re feeling the effects of it’s gravity, but you’re still in the outer reaches.  Use all your tools to get out of danger’s way because the closer you get to the black hole, the more resources and more energy you’ll need to escape.  I wish I’d gone to therapy when I realized something was wrong.  Now a year later, I’m expecting years of therapy and am considering outpatient treatment.  That is, if I can put my eating disorder aside for long enough to set those things up and actually show up.  Good luck to you.  Have hope and strength, you’ll make it outta here :)",False,False

I'm really happy you're recognizing it in it's early stages, and urge you to seek professional intervention before it goes further. I myself am not qualified to give you good advice, but I can tell you to seek out somebody who is.   Best of luck to you, and I'm proud of you for recognizing you have an issue and wanting to correct it before it gets worse! ",False,False
