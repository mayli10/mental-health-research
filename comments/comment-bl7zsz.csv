It goes against so many recovery principles and recommendations.",False,False

I watched it with the other dietetic interns in my program and it triggered the fuck out of me. Her character acted super moody and you never saw her eating which was shitty. In addition, I hated that she was chosen for To The Bone a few years back because she has the appearance that people *think* eating disorders should have which perpetuates the idea that you have to be super thin. They had CGI'd her to look even thinner than she already is. Ugh, I hate her and wish I looked like her.",False,False

I loved Skins and seeing her made me want to fast for a month.  I'm super tall and overweight... I've always wanted to be petite and skinny. It's just never gonna happen.:(,False,False
