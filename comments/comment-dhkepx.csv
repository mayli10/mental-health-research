Either way, I know it’s not normal and so very out of character for him. I’m going to stay with family",False,True

To make you experience what he does? Because if so it is toxic and extremely damaging to both of you. Support each other in healthy ways!

I do have to say for the sake of the child you need to take a second look at what’s going on. His behavior sounds narcissistic honestly.  Besides that point, wether he is or not, this sounds like a very unhealthy environment you’ve made with one another. You deserve better. And so does that baby. Take some time away from him and reevaluate. If you leave then LEAVE but if you stay and go to counseling with him then commit.  If this happens again, don’t convince yourself it’ll be the last time, like I did. Save you and that baby the heart ache and leave and don’t look back. There are no excuses.  Stand your ground.",False,False
