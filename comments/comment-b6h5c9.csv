You don't have to explain why or how your needs aren't being met unless you really want to. Psychiatrists are used to patients leaving due to personality differences so it's not a big deal.  In the interim (if you can't stand to see her any more) you might be able to have your GP doctor prescribe your meds until you're able to see a new psychiatrist. As long as your previous psych sends your chart info to your GP and you have an intake scheduled with a new psychiatrist (even if it's a few months out), many GPs are willing to cover that in-between time to make sure you get your meds.  Hope that helps~ I used to work with mental health referrals (in America) so if you have any other questions feel free to PM me and I'll answer as best I can. We'll get you through this.ðŸ–¤",False,False

At least at my university they take complaints like that pretty seriously. I mentioned to my counselor (who works at the campus health center) about what one of the other psychologists who works there said to my friend and she asked me immediately if I knew the guys name so she could report him and get that corrected. Universities are pretty afraid of things like student suicide and they'll likely at least try to get it fixed ASAP if they know their mental health professionals are acting like that towards vulnerable individuals.,False,False

I canâ€™t get my refill without seeing her, and I canâ€™t afford to go to someone not connected to my university. Part of me really wants to tell her (or the university health center) that sheâ€™s being really shitty.  Imagine telling a grad student, who is clearly already under stress, that they should expect to fail their classes. If I get below a 3.0, I get dropped from my program. ",False,True

Since Iâ€™m a new patient sheâ€™s actually scheduling me every two weeks and not giving any refills.  The other drs in my area have 2-3 month long waitlists and donâ€™t take my insuranceâ€”part of why I went to the one through my university. ,False,True

I know in Australia, your GP can refer you to a new psychiatrist (and you can research before and request one you believe would be appropriate). From there, your GP or the new psychiatrist can request a copy of your file (or at least a letter of summary) be transferred to your new psychiatrist.  You don't owe your old psychiatrist anything; if you've made future appointments, obviously cancel them well in advance but otherwise you're not obligated to stay under the treatment of someone who isn't helping you/your mental health.",False,False

For the medication issue, if you are going to start with a new psychiatrist, you can just schedule an appointment with a new psychiatrist and explain what medication you are on, that you would like to remain on it, and just the issues you had with your previous psychiatrist that caused you to stop seeing her.
