The therapist they assigned me was actually pretty useless, and most of what I remember from it is that they would ask me questions and me, being the little brat I was at the time, literally would not answer them. And if I did answer, it was a really short answer. I don’t remember getting anything out of that therapy experience.   Granted, at the time, I was angry about how I was being legally forced to talk to someone about the divorce when I didn’t want to, so that made me be uncooperative out of sheer spite. Which, now that I think about it, may be why the whole therapy thing was so wildly unsuccessful for me.  Anyway, if you don’t want to out your ed, the easiest way to avoid doing so is to just not bring it up. Therapy, court mandated or not, won’t push you to talk about things you haven’t brought up. If they ask you about it, say you have no issues with food. It usually just takes a “Do you worry about the calories in the food you eat?” “No, never really thought about it.” And then something else gets brought up.  Sorry if this isn’t helpful, but that’s just my experience.",False,False
