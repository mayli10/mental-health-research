The % of my calorie limit is equal to the amount of nutrients so it's pretty subpar. Healthy would be like spinach which is like 15 times as nutritious compared to the amount calories compared to my limit. That's a weird sentence. It's not really nutritious, but it's not overly calorie dense and what little nutrients it has were enough to push me to 100%. I mostly just put it there because ice cream tastes good.",False,False

I can't because some of the food on there I would need to make enough for a few days of leftovers and I'm going out of town in a couple days. But I'm so excited. Especially because I was just looking at it now and realized I could totally cut out lunch and still get 94% of my required nutrients for 300 calories less than my already kind of low intake. I mean, I could also cut the ice cream out of that plan, but it makes me feel like I'm not spiraling if I eat something that's considered junk food. ^((Even if it is a low calorie version of junk food that I specifically picked for it's nutritional benefits.))",False,False
