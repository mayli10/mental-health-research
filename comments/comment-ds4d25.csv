Is he comfortable hanging out the three of you? If not, he seriously needs to do some soul searching into his motivations. Chances are he hasn't even thought about it that deeply and just lonely-clicked *Add Friend*, remembering how good it felt like to have someone wanting you in those new relationship sort of feelings, and never thought about it again.",False,False

Friends you have had for longer than you considered dating or that never were a dating prospect feel really safe. I try not to have rules about that stuff with my partner but I also can wish we could just stick to the friends we already share. I wouldn’t mind closing off some of my periphery in return. If that makes sense. I’m typing while walking so this is probably horribly nonsensical aha.   And usually I feel like an ex you ended things with and then became friends after is a really safe person because you have now established you dont click but she is different. His ex we are good with was his friend for years after and they could have rekindled but never did. With this ex they had a split and then didn’t talk again till now. I can’t help but worry about feelings.,False,True

Why does it have to be your ex or pretty girls? Or how about getting some new hobbies and make new friends? I’m probably projecting my own insecurities but as much as people say you can be friends with the opposite sex, that only makes sense to me with childhood friends, coworkers, and friends of both you and your SO.",False,False

Thanks for the ideas! I really like how you worded that.   Earlier when I talked about it with him he said he isn’t interested in her anymore and just is interested in rekindling old friendships because he feels isolated. I have to respect that but I am still feeling sour about the ex, though I feel better on the other girl now because it makes more sense now to me that they were friends AND he considered her (yet it never happened) but I don’t really feel as good on his ex because they were most recently together not friends.   Also I am the same and will bring up one thing infinitely until I’m 100% at peace with it.",False,True

I love to talk things over and beat a dead horse which my SO hates, but honestly I would say to him, “hey, from my perspective, there’s no reason you’d friend your ex/ex-interest unless you were looking to stray from me in some way. Are you feeling like you need to supplement our relationship physically/emotionally for some reason? Why? How can we address that? Do you see why it hurt me to see that?

On the one hand he's sexted girls behind my back before.
