People like to share, discuss, and eat food together because it’s a way of creating community and relationships. It’s an ingrained part of our humanity and why so much cross culture starts out with food.   Your boss would be thinking “it’s just the two of us and we’re doing all this cleaning, what a fun treat if we got pizza!” Because to most people pizza IS a fun treat. There are a few things you can do.  1. You can suggest a different cuisine that you’re more comfortable eating, “yum! Does it have to be pizza though? Could we get mexican?” And then get a taco full of salad or something   2. Make up a food allergy/reason why you can’t have the pizza and bring your own food. Maybe even bring your own food to share with him “oh I can’t have pizza but I brought this &lt; insert delicious but secretly healthy food here &gt;”  3. You can be brave, remind yourself that 2-3 slices of pizza is a totally reasonable and normal thing to eat on occasion, and just have some pizza with your boss.  I get it, it’s hard, but try to remember that others have no idea about the wild internal world us ED people have",False,False

You could perhaps try to redirect him to pick up something less intense like a tea or coffee if he’s already out picking up food. That might scratch his itch if he’s really just trying to be a giving type of person.",False,False
