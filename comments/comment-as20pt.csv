But we want daily weights on them in order to ensure they aren't being fluid overloaded by IV fluids, retaining fluid due to renal failure, or otherwise losing weight due to malnourishment (critical for our tube fed patients).   We zero out the beds after every patients discharge so that the weight of the blankets and things aren't included in the daily weights. I will also usually do a zero out of the bed every time I change the linens or the patient is out of bed working with therapy, just because sometimes extra blankets and things get added.   They're fairly accurate. I weighed myself in one the other day and it was only off by about 1 lb compared to the standing scale. ",False,False

Probably the most common reason is for dosing medication. having scales built into the beds is just way more practical than trying to weigh patients on traditional scales.,False,False
