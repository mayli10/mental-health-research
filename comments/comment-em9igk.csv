If you're around your late teens to mid 20s, it is quite common for these things to develop/intensify during this time. Even without any significant diet/weight changes.   This said, depending how fast and significant that weight loss was, 6 months might just not be enough recovery time.",False,False

Not really sure why but it sort of makes sense that being allergic to something from a young age and not knowing might 1) get worse over time and 2) make one less inclined to want to eat, so it really could be something ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è",False,False
