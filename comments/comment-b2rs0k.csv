This girl I've been talking to recently has an ex who used to make her feel just awful about her ED and he ended up making it a lot worse then left her. She says he caused her relapse. If he makes you feel bad about your illness he might not be a good boyfriend. Though it is also fair for him to express how he feels. He can't just be expected to hold it all in forever. If he's frustrated and making you feel guilty that's bad, but if he's expressing concern that's probably good. The former paints you as a problem and might just make things worse while the latter just shows that he cares about you and wants you to get better because he's worried about your health. You should never feel like a nuisance to him because of your illness.",False,False
