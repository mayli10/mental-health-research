So I can guarantee u very much are dealing with anorexia, remember if u literally stopped eating you would just die. So anorexia does include eating, often just restricting and binging.

It's very challenging.       but it seems like the longer I have an ED, the more complex it gets  Precisely, these EDs can shift and over time become very complex. You are so valid and you so count.",False,False
