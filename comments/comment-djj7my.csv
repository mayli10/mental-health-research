I hadn't eaten any actual dessert foods in probably half a year, if you don't count my birthday. I don't have any regrets, except that I feel a little guilty about not eating fruit instead.  At first, I started scarfing it down, but then forced myself to slow down so that I could actually taste every spoonful. It made me realize that I've almost never got to eat slowly and without distractions. For example, during lunch breaks, I would eat as quickly as possible to get out of the stressful noisy cafeteria and go back to studying. And half of the lunch period would be spent waiting in the line, so there wasn't any time to be wasted. Enjoying food would make me feel lazy. Home has also always been full of distractions and stressors.    I wonder if one of the reasons why I'm scared of losing control and overeating is that I've rarely got to eat in a satisfying way. If you barely taste what you're eating, you need much more to feel satisfied. But by eating slowly, I was surprised how much flavor there was in each spoonful.",False,False
