Keep that epic feeling of ditching a binder in your mind :P  I know some SNRIs can help with the obsessive urges. When I started venlafaxine it made it really hard for me to obsess in the same way (ssri didn’t have the same effect). Not that your psych doesn’t know that, just saying meds can be super helpful it can just take what feels like forever to find what actually works for you specifically.   Good you have a team! I hope they can help you out on this front too",False,False

Idk what type of behaviors your ed is, but for bulimia I think there are some medications that can actually help (off label perhaps?).   Top surgery is going to be AMAZING!! If there is any way you can keep that thought in your mind, cling on there. (Ed logic - I mean it kind of also equals weight loss too... so maybe that can help quiet the thoughts?)   I hope you get other good advice, you deserve to get surgery, this shit sucks and I so hope it doesn’t mess up that timeline. So much shit is extra hard for trans folks :( sorry you have this on top of getting access to surgery.",False,False
