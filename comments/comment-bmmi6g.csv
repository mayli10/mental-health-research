I've been maintaining for a while now but kind of went out of control in the winter and gained 5 lbs so it was hard to see the scale go up after trying to do all the right things. I'm going to keep at it and I'm counting calories so I know it's physically impossible for me to have gained fat, I just hate seeing the scale go up ugh",False,True
