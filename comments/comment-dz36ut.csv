Depression, anxiety, EDs... it‚Äôs all stuff most people don‚Äôt know much of anything about and won‚Äôt know what you need to hear to feel supported.   IMO it sounds less like blowing you off and more like your friend is trying to be as neutral as possible in order to not upset you to an extreme. Obviously this has backfired, but I can understand the mindset. If they‚Äôre not confident in how to handle something to make it positive for you, neutral is the safest path as extremes tend to get fucky if you don‚Äôt know what the hell it is you have to handle.   I‚Äôm glad you chose to open up to someone. That‚Äôs a step for you to address things, yourself. You‚Äôre getting bad again and you‚Äôve even said it aloud. You reached out, whether meaning to or not, for support. So it‚Äôs up to you if you‚Äôre going to do something with that. I highly advise not putting it on your friend that you feel triggered right now and take the situation at face value. You told someone. What‚Äôs your next step? To keep spiraling and know someone knows and is watching you destroy yourself? Or realize that‚Äôs the worst thing you can do to a person and look more towards fighting the spiral?",False,False

As a person with anorexia I totally understand looking for validation to starve yourself; I do it as well. You have to understand the dynamics of the situation, and take a step back and look at the disordered behaviors though. I hope that you are able to see that your choice to listen to ""dive back in"" on starvation and the reactive response of ""Fuck it. Let's do this."" is give your power to your Eating Disorder. You can be stronger than this, I know it is hard and really frustrating. I can only suggest that you use your anger about this situation to help yourself instead of hurting yourself; IT IS IMPORTANT because you are! (Hugs)",False,False

I just needed to tell somebody that it's getting bad again.. because telling someone usually keeps me from spiraling too far. I just wasn't expecting him to tell me it's fine that I'm spiraling.. he thinks ""at least you're eating something"" (I was having plain lettuce.. yeaaah that's gonna make all the difference)   Fuck it, why eat anything? ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Let's go all out.",False,True

It‚Äôs totally natural to talk to those close to you first. Unfortunately not all friends are equipped to handle that information, or do not understand mental disorders enough to understand the severity of what you‚Äôre going through. If you are seeking support, i suggest trying to get help from a professional.",False,False
