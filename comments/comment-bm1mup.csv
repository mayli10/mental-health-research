You can talk about why you don't want to recover... maybe ask yourself ""is therapy likely to make my life worse?"" (recovery is hard so the answer might be a temporary yes).

Waited 5 months for them.   First session was cancelled because counsellor was ill.   Second session was cancelled because counsellor was on leave.   Third session has just been cancelled (tomorrow) because counsellor is ill.   I‚Äôve seen her once for a 50 minute session and for the other 3 weeks I‚Äôve worked myself up to them only to have last minute cancellations. I have so much shit going on and it was such a relief to just be able to let it out and that option keeps being taken away.   I‚Äôm really tempted just to cancel the whole thing because it‚Äôs mental torture every single week. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs helping at all.
