I was overweight at the time from recovery and use skinny photos of myself lol and snap chatted just above the neck. I went full restriction mode and lost like 30 pounds by the time we had our first date. And now weâ€™ve been together ever since and heâ€™s been there for me and my roller coaster of weight, binging, purging, restricting, everything and he still loves me. Iâ€™m so lucky ðŸ¥º  But donâ€™t think you have to be skinny for this guy bc if he doesnâ€™t love you for who you are then he doesnâ€™t deserve you! He seems really interested in you online and if youâ€™re just craving a one night stand then I say go for it!!! Tbh it might be more empowering and the confidence boost u need&lt;3 youâ€™re beautiful and just remember to be safe and only do what youâ€™re comfortable w doing.",False,False
