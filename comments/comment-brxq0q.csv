But you dont want to. Cause I know that feeling. Although personally I enjoy seeing my chest bones and ribs and bony hands, I know that my boyfriend will be upset next time he sees me (LDR) but I cant bring myself to do anything but continue losing weight.  Anyways, good luck &lt;3",False,False

It sounds like you dont enjoy how you look but feel like you have to stay that small. If you can, please talk to an adult if you're young and if you can afford it, find a therapist. Because an ED will convince you that to be happier you gotta lose more weight but it seems like you honestly want to gain weight to be happy with your appearance  Good luck",False,False

My ribs and collarbones have always been visible even when I was at a healthy weight, I just had really big thigh muscles because I was a sprinter.  I mean, I guess you said you have a thigh gap, but if you have wide hips or something I guess that could be possible without being like *too* thin.",False,False
