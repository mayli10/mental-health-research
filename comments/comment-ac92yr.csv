When most people stop all that extra breast tissue and milk drops significantly, making a smaller boob with loose skin, since it‚Äôs been stretched out during the big booby days.  Happens to most moms who have breastfeed, including me, as far as I know.    This Is why a lot of women want a breast lift to perk them babies up afterwards, or breast augmentation to fill em in, making the loose skin less noticeable.  Also just weight gain in the boobs and entire body during pregnancy can do a similar thing even without breastfeeding.  Happens a lot on the stomach area, which can have a lot of extra skin after baby is born and why a lot of women want tummy tucks as well.  Not saying everyone resorts to plastic surgery or even have any of these issues, but I have personally heard a lot of people complaining about this and why one of my good friends had a ‚Äúmommy makeover‚Äù after having her 2 kids (which is usually some combo of tummy tuck, breast lift/augmentation, and in her case lipo as well).
