I’m not satisfied with myself after just one day of heavy restriction, it takes a week before I can start to feel happy about my intake. So therefore it doesn’t make sense to hate myself for one day, or even a couple days, of over eating. I mean I still sort of do but at least I have a dialogue going on in my brain rather than it just hurtling abuse at me",False,False

Keep going strong!",False,False
