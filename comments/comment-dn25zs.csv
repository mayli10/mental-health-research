It feels like a time capsule from like 2016 or something  - they're all just saying the same stuff they were then, but the internet has moved on when it comes to weight discourse or whatever. Like, I'm not expecting them to be all supportive and progressive or anything, but they haven't even changed their arguments??? Like, give me new spicy takes on why fat people aren't allowed to have thoughts about being fat and why we should all just be super skinny. Then I'd listen (by listen I mean be triggered).   Imo, they're not even good at being condescending anymore. It's such a waste.",False,False

For a hot minute, I really got off to the drama of all these gawking websites and subreddits, but now it just makes me mad that people want to make fun of others like that. It's so lacking in empathy. I'm down for correcting misinformation and helping people get to a better place, but doesn't feel genuine at all on that sub! Like you said, it's so holier-than-thou and it makes me sad and kind of mad that I ever engaged in or with it.",False,False

HAES supporters think that all dieting is disordered and that’s really damaging to people who are casually dieting AND people who actually have eating disorders. it also makes me annoyed that a lot of people on there that are the biggest assholes also post on this sub (obviously not all, but a LOT do). like. come on, dude. criticism isn’t the same as being a straight up cunt. that’s my piece on it.",False,False

It's full of people who take CICO 100% literally and think they know everything about nutrition (which true, a calorie deficit will lead to weight loss but people don't lose weight in a vacuum). You should unsub for your own mental health- restrictive EDs can only end in recovery or untimely death.",False,False

They regularly have posts making fun of the tumblr accounts and instagrams of girls recovering from eating disorders. Instead of targeting actual fatlogic, they just make fun of overweight people trying to feel better about themselves, which I can only assume is driven by projection and self hatred. I used to like it a lot but I eventually unsubbed a year ago. It was making me feel guilty and anxious about enjoying any treats ever.
