I bet your ED is making up bullshit because this girl sounds chill. And you know what if it doesn't work out it probably has nothing to do with your weight. Maybe she feels insecure maybe she realizes she's not ready for a relationship. Maybe there's just some personality differences. These things happen you know! But just try to enjoy it while you can. I always try to remember the idea behind Carl Sagan's pale blue dot. You are here.... On a mote of dust suspended in a sunbeam.   Take it a bit at a time. If you can't have both the fear foods just have one you know? ,False,False

Thank you so much for this post. I'm not relapsing yet, but it was moving in that direction. My ED brain wants me to lose the 13 lbs of recovery weight I've ""gained"" (8 or that is just water weight) and then lose another 10 on top of that... Sigh I won't do it.   Seriously though on the not knowing what to do.. should I have some of my mom's Chili if I had some yesterday? What about more pumpkin pie... more is not always good, but also not always bad. Is that my ED brain or my brain?  It's so hard to know... I am trying to make sure I eat something that is not ""safe"" stuff everyday and getting enough calories for now, but it's hard.  I'm also scared about getting fat for the new girl. My rationale brain knows that she really likes me and she seems to think I look great and has straight said that she is totally ok if I gain some weight, but my ED brain is just like... no she will leave you right away when you gain.   Yeah, the worst part is my ED voice was starting to tell me to keep things secret... my friends will just get worried... that is when I was getting concerned. I told my bother yesterday and will tell me friends so that does not happen. ",False,True

My relapse came on sudden like a brick wall. (I mean it was actually gradual in that I was trying to lose weight the healthy way and it wasn't working and then I got weighed at the doctor and all hell broke loose).   So I too feel like I'm stuck between ED brain and adult healthy brain. ""Eat like a normal person BUT WOAH NOT SO MUCH"" "" You shouldn't eat less than a thousand cals a day BUT WHAT IF THAT DOESN'T WORK AND YOU GET FAT AGAIN MAYBE YOU SHOULDN'T EAT SO MUCH TODAY"" ""your boyfriend loves you, his family loves you your friends love you BUT HOW DO YOU KNOW THEY WON'T BETRAY YOU AND CONVINCE YOU TO GET FAT AGAIN""   my advice is have as many people as possible to keep you Accountable, trusted friends, therapists anyone. That way if you're ever too far gone someone is looking out for you ❤. We all know the Demon thrives in secrecy so don't keep her a secret. Let that biiiiiiitch have some light ",False,False
