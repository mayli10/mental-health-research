Thirty is still super young, but it’s very admirable how long you’ve been wrestling with all this. You’re strong, even if you don’t feel very strong, you have to be because you’re still here and fighting. I know you’ll beat all this. Keep a death grip on that hope.   If you ever need someone to talk to I’m here. ❤️",False,False
