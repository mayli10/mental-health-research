Next morning, did my first and only 24hr fast  while walking over 20km aimlessly in my city while lying to my mom that I had dinner when I got home. Flirted with what could have been a far worse ED than I dealt with.  Other rock bottom story included feeling guilty about throwing food away but not wanting to eat it myself since it was ""bad"" to me. Ate a bite of real old stale pizza (from freezer) spat it out, kept eating, spat out again etc.   Lastly I had to throw a box of cereal away and spat some out during my biggest binge because I didnt like it but kept eating it and forced myself to throw it away.  Ik it's not near what others rock bottoms are but I've flirted enough with ED to know how devastating  ED can be after losing 15 lbs and having deteriorating bloodwork.",False,False

The ED specialised psychologist when I was 16 told me that she didnâ€™t think Iâ€™d ever truly recover until I hit my rock bottom.

So like, yeah I'm anorexic, but that wasn't/isn't my only problem.    This year really brought me to my knees.  I was homeless for a bit, and I was using that as a (pretty damn believable) excuse to starve myself/not sleep/do drugs/chainsmoke/generally be a hot mess.  The thing about being homeless (especially if you have an ED) is that food is scarce, and sleep is like, the best thing there is, and there's never enough of it.   I'd sleep for 3-4 hours, work for 8 hours doing like, physically exhausting labor, eat maybe one meal a day and a snack, and the rest of what was keeping me going was cigarettes and drugs.  I just remember this one time specifically, sleeping in an alley midday. When you're in situations like that you never \*really\* sleep; you just kind of go into this state of self-induced hypnosis that's \*almost\* sleep, except you always wake up when you need to, even without an alarm.  Keeping one eye open, so to speak.  So I'm drifting out of consciousness in an alleyway, ugly crying because my mom just called me and asked if I'd like to come over for dinner and I felt like the energy it would take to pretend I was okay for two hours might just kill me.  I felt like, physical pain almost from how emotionally/physically exhausted I was.    After I had cried until I was too dehydrated and exhausted to cry anymore, I decided to try to sleep. I couldn't tell if I was high or coming down or both, I was so cold, I was hungry, I was alone, and to top it all off, I had a lung infection and I have asthma.  So naturally I decided to smoke a joint and then smoke cigarettes until I fell asleep, and I just remember sleeping on top of my backpack, putting my phone in my underwear so nobody would jack it while I slept, and coughing.  Spluttering.  I felt like I was asphyxiating, and after days of this, coughing hurt so much it made me cry, and every drag I took of a cigarette was just pain.  Didn't stop me.  There were so many nights this year where I fell asleep wondering if I'd wake up.  And I just lay there wondering what the fuck happened.  I was an honors student, graduated a year early with awards; I was so independent, I was the kid everyone wanted, everyone said I was so smart and mature and talented, and here I was, laying half-dead behind a dumpster.  Oh, and then I realized I was laying in someone's piss.  Good times lol.",False,False
