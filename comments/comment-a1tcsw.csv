It breaks my heart. I also don’t see myself ever being an interpreter because I’m shitty at signing and pretty shitty at everything in general. I go to therapy, I’m just in a bad place right now.  Even if I was willing to, I don’t think I have time or energy for that. But thank you. I appreciate the thought.   Thank you.  I’ll try. I don’t agree, though. Thank you nonetheless.",False,True

But thank you.  Yeah. That’s exactly how I am. I’m not sure what peach is, but I’ll try to message you.  Thank you. I’ll try. I can’t take a bath because my (I live at home still) bathroom is too disgusting to stand in for more than a few minutes. I don’t think any male person has ever done a face mask ever, I’m not sure what they even are. Haha. It does look like I’m doing the third option though. Hot chocolate and spider man 2. It won’t make me feel worth it, but I guess it’s something to do that postpones ending my life.   Thank you for being nice and supportive. It means a lot.",False,True

I just stalked your profile a little.  You volunteer at a hippotherapy clinic. You want to be an ASL interpreter. You're so interesting. Those are such wonderful things to do, to aspire to be. The people you're helping and will help is fantastic and impressive. I think, if you haven't tried already, you should help yourself a bit and speak to a doctor or a therapist.  Treat yourself for a week like you'd treat someone else. I know it's so much fucking harder than that, but you're smart and you're kind and you're worth more than this.  You're going through hell and I'm so sorry.   Stay safe. We'd be worse without you here.",False,False

You may think you have nothing left to live for but you do. Thats the point of life. You ALWAYS have something, whether it be to do, make, or even think. Life is what you make it. Think of things you like and go from there, you'll eventually find your way",False,False
