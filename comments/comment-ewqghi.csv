I will say that while it's scary she's around the same weight as me at a much taller height, she does seem to have a very narrow ribcage which is a bone structure thing I think. I know that muscle plays a roll in how the ribs sit, but I don't think the ribcage can get that small just by losing weight if a person had a normal chest size at a healthy weight. I hope people know that even if they starve the way she does that they will probably never be as small.",False,False

But I think most ppls reactions was surprise that she engaged in such unhealthy habits, til then people were arguing that she was ""naturally skinny"" lol.  Like sure it sends a message that starving yourself can make you skinny, but it also sends a message that achieving a body like Sora Choi is impossible without starving yourself. Which is better? Somehow I almost feel like it's better for people to know what it takes, so they won't try, instead of constantly aiming for an unrealistic goal they can't meet without sacrificing their health.  But idk really that's just my perspective",False,False
