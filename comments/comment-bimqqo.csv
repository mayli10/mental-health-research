I'd seen eye colour subliminals before, and the people who claimed they worked and knew that was all an obvious hoax....      ... so naturally I thought the comments of this video would be ""wtf this is stupid. stop being lazy u gotta CICO and WOrKOut s GUyS!!""      ...     But it wasn't? Like, everywhere I looked, *all* of the comments, actual thousands of them, were full of people praising this shit and genuinely believing it worked. I went through video after video, channel after channel, because I HAD to convince myself that these people were just fakes or bots. But there were so many, and these were active channels (some of them had Google+ pages lol)... And they all believed it.      The comments are all saying ""Drink lots of water!"" and apparently that's a big thing with subliminals? Anyway I listened to one and it freaked me out more than I'd like to admit. The content was fucking weird, but mostly I was spooked because I thought listening to subliminals might make me believe they worked like the people in the comments did, like mind control or some shit. It was 2AM, it was whack, you're free to call me an idiot lol.",False,True

It's so fucked up because I KNOW that I'm also objectively a ""tiny Asian girl,"" but when I see these idols it really messes my impression of my body.

That last sentence is *so* true, and speaks volumes of everyone's seemingly perpetual inability -- specifically regarding the Korean entertainment industry, of course, but it's not as though it doesn't have any applications to the West (or anywhere else for that matter).

I think it's potentially the nature of many K-Pop circles that might encourage latent ED behaviours within new fans... K-fans are often criticised for being monolithic; a hive-mind (any fandom experiences that to some degree but it appears to be quite severe here) and if that's true in any regard it might help to propagate harmful ideas. The last thing you said I didn't initially think about, but is almost certainly true -- it makes sense that such a culture would attract people with ED, whether they're actively seeking some form of 'thinspo' or whatever it may be.      *""Genetics load the gun and something like a weight loss attempt or life event pull the trigger.""*     Eloquent, illustrative and succinct.

A lot of fashion was designed to be flattering only for very skinny people, like low-rise jeans and crop-tops that show below the belly button. Saying someone had a big butt was a horrible insult, where as nowadays it's one of the most popular Instagram compliments.  In the past couple of years with Kardashians and Jenners being famous the trend has swung to favor a very curvy (almost fake-looking) figure and fashion has adapted to it. High-rise jeans are much more popular and crop-tops tend to only show above the belly button. Maybe with increased influence from Asia it's time for the trend to swing back to favoring skinny people again.  As for EDs, having skinny role models can make more people attempt losing weight sure, but EDs are a mental illness that can't be caused purely by outside pressure to be skinny. Genetics load the gun and something like a weight loss attempt or life event pull the trigger. Maybe the correlation could also be in reverse, those who already value thinness more than normal are just more likely to idolize skinny K-Pop idols.",False,False

As someone of Asian descent living in a Western country, I didn’t really have people who looked like me in popular media to compare myself to (or even people in my personal life to compare myself to - I was one of the only Asians in my hometown), so I mostly evaded body image issues throughout my adolescence. But then in college, I met more Asian people (a lot of whom are smaller than me...!) and started paying attention to kpop idols, so I became more aware than ever before about my body size. *And* I started having to be responsible for feeding myself (or, more accurately, not feeding myself). Hearing about kpop idols’ “diets” definitely gave me some fucked up ideas about the abuse that my body could go through for the sake of weight loss.  I can’t blame kpop entirely for my disordered eating, but it did make me want to lose weight, and that + a number of other factors merged to create the mess that I am rn lol. So I share your concerns, but it’s hard to know what to do about it, especially since Asian culture simultaneously values skinniness and stigmatizes discussion of mental illness.",False,False
