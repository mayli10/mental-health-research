I feel that when I don’t eat the entire day I am so ravenous that I mistake wanting wine for actually just wanting a meal. Somethings that’s helped a ton is eating a satisfying meal that doesn’t feel too overwhelming and then I literally don’t want any wine anymore.  My body was just craving food not alcohol.   Another side note is that when your so ravenous it’s easy to binge on drinking too because your body just wants something - but then that lets inhibitions down and you eat the food your body is craving. Hope this helps!,False,False
