Chewing sugar free, minty gum saves me from so many binges during stressful school/work related things (though I often go through so many sticks it’s obscene). I might be kind of an emotional chewer lol but it’s better than taking in tons more calories that I don’t actually need. Gum also helps me stay awake and stay focused somehow, idk",False,False

I have been in the exact same situation as you (only binging though...for hours) and one thing that helped is making a huge kettle of hot water and just sipping on tea through the day. I'm serious, just 4 tea bags saved me from 10000+ calorie binges one day.  Hang in there honey, you'll get through this.",False,False
