Any ""weight gain"" would be literally fluid that was outside your body, going into your body, and you'd pee it out in a few hours. You do NOT have more weight to lose. Does it help to think ""what would I tell someone else in my position?""  Cling to the putting family and friends through hell. That's been motivating for me. Thinking of you.",False,False

It’s *only from the IV fluid*, not actual weight, but if you see it and get super upset, immediately purge etc, that will drop your potassium right down again. IV fluids will be processed by your body basically just like an oral drink and you’ll pee it out, so hold off on weighing if you can &lt;3",False,False

Got through an eight hour drip by watching Game of Thrones! They did a blood test when I came in and my potassium was 2.1, which means that the tablets I took at home did absolutely nothing. I was purging about an hour after taking them, but I thought that'd be enough time for it to work. They had two drips in at the same time and I ended up taking one out (pabrinex) because I'm pretty sure it contains glucose, which is sugar and sugar is calories. I freaked out, because I had about a quarter of it gone by then :( I told the nurse it was because it was painful though (oops). I'm having another blood test and if it comes back somewhat okay (around 3) I can go home. I don't know why, but I feel super paranoid that the IV's made me gain weight ??? I know I have to get this over with though or else I'm gonna end up back in the hospital. They've told me yesterday that if I discharge myself, they're scared I will not make it. It's absolutely insane. I still feel like I've got more weight to lose, but that's probably not it. I'm really growing tired of putting my family and friends through this. :(",False,True

Maybe you can find something to watch, read, or listen to to pass the time and get some rest.  I'm sure you've heard it a million times, but your low electrolytes are probably part of the reason you're feeling so badly, so you might actually feel better once they let you go even though it sucks in the meantime.",False,False

You could die at any minute... your BMI and potassium are really low. Since I've started following this forum and the #anorexiarecovery community I've seen two people die; one of them last week. It's very real.  You are absolutely allowed to lie in bed forever at home... or in the hospital.   Keep us updated; thinking of you.",False,False

Seems like you are in the UK? They never hospitalise casually here, so be assured they are only doing this because you truly do need to be there. Can you focus enough to read? You could put the Kindle app on your phone and download some books. Or youtube/audible is good in hospital. I’m sorry you’re hating it so much :(",False,False
