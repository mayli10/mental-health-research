If she really means a lot to you I would suggest talking. Because it seems like she just has disordered eating and body image issues herself. I would say: - I noticed how you make comments about my body and do a lot of diet-talk - This really upsets and triggers me - Do you think we could avoid such topics when we are together?  If she does not change I would end this relationship. People who are jealous and unsupportive of us are not friends...,False,False

I don't want to say she sounds like she's doing it on purpose but if she already knows you hate what she's doing and she keeps doing it...... You're way better off without toxic ppl as ""friends""",False,False

Mainly because I have a stomach issue and itâ€™s too hard on me when Iâ€™m restricting (acid reflux). She knows I hate comments on my body. She even jokes about my SH scars. I just donâ€™t know what to do about her anymore. I donâ€™t have many friends.,False,True

Not sure if she knows you're in ED recovery but that kind of request would be reasonable by anyone's standards I think,False,False

Idk what to suggest other than avoid her where possible if you think that would help?  I hope you stay safe and strong ðŸ’–,False,False
