I first developed an ED at 14 and wasn't really back on track eating wise until 17 and I swear to god I went through what was basically a second puberty. Grew two inches, breasts went from a B cup to a DD, filled out all over. And since it happened all at once it was mad triggering. The memory of how painful that was at the time always makes me wish I would've eaten more and had a normally paced puberty. :(",False,False
