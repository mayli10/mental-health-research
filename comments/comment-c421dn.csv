It gives me hope knowing that I might not be alone, not that being with women in recovery is bad, but that it might be easier to relate to someone else if they are also a guy.  There is a treatment facility near me that says it treats all ages and genders so I think I might go and give that a try. This will sound like a really dumb question, but are you able to negotiate how your treatment happens? Like, I work full time and need the job for my health insurance. I know it sounds awful, but it seems like the US makes you prioritize working to live than your own mental health.",False,False

I was there for two weeks and there was always at least two men except for my last two days. When I was in residential, there was about a 45 minute period when I was the only man, between when my roommate was moved to a higher level of care and when someone new was brought in. In my PHP, there's five men of about fifteen people. It all can vary and I'm not going to lie to you and tell you that I was in equal proportions to women, but I was rarely the only man, and at my current level of care there are quite a few of us! Where I went is also one of the only places in my region that accepts adult male patients in residential, which is... Troubling, honestly. But it's not...uncommon? There was regularly other men. But I wouldn't let it ruin your chances at recovery. To be entirely honest, some of the other men in the program make it harder because they get really weirdly attached to the women who are in the program. It's so bizarre. Some of my closest relationships within the program have been with women, it hasn't made it terribly difficult to relate.",False,False

I think that is a huge stigma I have in ever thinking about recovery because I don't want to be the only guy.,False,False

EDs (like any mental illness)  are not limited to any gender, race, social status, etc.  And like many mental illnesses, they are treatable. The earlier they are detected and the sooner treatment is sought, the better the outcome.   There's absolutely no shame in seeking help for this! We're all here for you.",False,False

Although they’re more common in women and less talked about in men, it’s 100% possible as a boy/man to have an ED. I’d say if you went to the trouble of posting in an ED sub on Reddit it’s worth maybe seeking out a doctor to confide in and look for help from. It’s never too late to take care of yourself.  And please remember, even if you aren’t formally diagnosed with an ED, your struggles are still valid and you’re still worthy of support as you heal!",False,False
