Have a biiiig bowl of spinach as a side. Whilst fats are hard bc calories try having a some more protein and add just a bit of fat. This sort-of combo should leave you nourished and hopefully help you feel satisfied.   Drinking more water and ensuring you're getting enough salt is also a big one x ,False,False

But really stopping smoking weed is a definite way to reduce your appetite, I'd say that was a good call.  Anyway, when I get stuck in a binge cycle I always just eat a disgusting amount one day to the point where I step on the scale the next morning and am shocked back into action. Also (lack of) money can definitely be a good motivator. Maybe go to the grocery store and buy a bunch of healthy food like yogurts, eggs, meats, fruits, etc., then you'll feel compelled to eat at home until it's gone because then you've already made the decision of what to spend your money on, and not eating at home becomes wasteful.   Good luck xx",False,False

I'll just be at home, bored and ready to binge. I've started to ask myself, ""Alright, if I just go to my kitchen right now, eat a few thousand Calories in twenty minutes and come right back to this chair, then what will I do? I'll still have four hours before I can realistically go to bed."" That thought process helps me muster up the motivation to do whatever I think I'd do if I was a normal, not-hangry person. Play a video game, watch a movie, work on one of my projects, go for a walk - none of these things actually require me to be full.",False,False

Then you can start to recognize that eating a whole bunch isn’t going to fix anything &amp; you can stop binging before u start ,False,False
