I think a lot of people don’t say anything because they don’t know what to say. I’ve purged in public bathrooms with people in the stalls next to me and no one says anything, but what would they say? They don’t know what’s wrong with me, if it’s ED or medical issues and they wouldn’t know how to help.  Maybe people at your work are in that same boat where even if they wanted to help, they don’t know how. It’s still hard for a lot of people to deal with the sensitivity of mental illness.  I hope you find recovery. You don’t need permission from your coworkers in order for you to start healing. Please don’t feel like you need to wait until your coworkers notice your ED.",False,False

That’s so kind it breaks my heart a little. I know it must feel like you’re abandoning them, but I promise no one will see it that way. Instead, you’ve been going beyond what you’re required to do by caring for them. Very few people have the strength to devote even a fraction of their life to helping others like that. No one could possibly do it 100% of the time, and for that reason, you need to take the time to heal your body and mind. It’s important that you become a source of love and encouragement for yourself, as well. It’ll be a great example to your students to overcome this. Please don’t give up yourself so easily!♥️",False,False

I love my students. I want to be a teacher. I try to be a voice of love and encouragement in their lives. I know for a fact many of the kids don’t have that at home. Two of the kids I work with are being abused and all we can do is report. If I have to leave, I’m just another person who essentially abandoned them. I don’t even know if I’d be able to tell them why I’m leaving or if I’d get a chance to. I’ve been so worried about loosing my education award I was going to use for COS when I student teach if I have to go inpatient and I can’t stay the rest of the year, I’ve forgotten about the kids. I sat there earlier today, waiting for my second graders to come back from recess, I looked in the face of one second grader walking back and almost lost it right there. And of course I feel guilty that I can’t give them 100% because I’m devoting so much to my eating disorder. This is literally the hardest decision I’ll ever make. If my dietitian ends up having to refer me to a higher level of care, and I’m 90% sure she will, I will have to leave my kids. But I want to get better even though I don’t really see that as possible. I’m so heartbroken and I wish I’d get hit by a bus randomly so I can die without hurting others by killing myself",False,True
