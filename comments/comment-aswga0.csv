Someone mentioned the non-hormonal aka copper IUD and that's really helpful! I'm getting the implant in on my next cycle because I'm afraid of the weight gain that comes with the depo shot by and the idea of an IUD scares me",False,False

I got a non-hormonal copper IUD (ParaGard) instead and I can't recommend it enough! It's really really effective and you don't have to think about it. It's just there. Working. For years and years. More of an investment up front but you may be able to get one from Planned Parenthood free/reduced. I know this won't solve your problems but maybe it will help with one aspect ‚ù§Ô∏è",False,False

People who couldn't get out of bed to eat now have the energy to do so. So a lot of the weight gain that is reported with antidepressants is because of increased motivation, not because of increased hunger. Hopefully that helps you feel a little bit better about the possibility of taking them ‚ù§Ô∏è",False,False
