It's just that lots of fiber rich foods are also my fear foods for some reason, so maybe I should just take some supplements for the time being. I think I'm gonna wait it out for a while, fingers crossed lmao",False,True

I poo once/twice a week and I’m a bit constipated but the fibre and water intake definitely helped compared to before where I had the poop I just couldn’t poop. If it’s causing you a lot of discomfort then you might want to go to a doctor and ask, they will most likely recommend you a laxative but it might be better to get some advice from a medical professional because they likely know better than us. :’)",False,False
