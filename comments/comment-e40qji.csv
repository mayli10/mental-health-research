How many hours did you play for?   I will so often finish a game and wish I could start it over from the very beginning with no memory of it. If you liked Eastshade maybe look into Fable (the first one, it’ll work on any computer) and Oblivion! Especially The Shivering Isles DLC in Oblivion. The game is worth buying even if just for that DLC alone!!",False,True

My new cheap laptop won't run it very well though :( I'm excited for you! The game just gets better and better the more you play. I can't rave enough about it,False,False

Have you finished it yet? I haven’t. I have been in Nava for a bit, that’s as far as I am.   It also made me get more tea! I have been having pomegranate tea mixed with black tea while playing or sometimes cider because the cider reminds me of Meadowspice Mead!",False,True

It's such an interesting, atmospheric mix of goofy and insanely pretty and moody and strange and exciting in a calming way. I went and bought a bunch of new teas after playing it! I know just what you mean by triggering - basically you survive off 'inspiration' instead of food. Major Breatharian vibes. I found it so freeing. All you had to worry about was staying warm at night and finding new places, solving quests and hallucinatiing in sewers!",False,False

That makes me so happy. Someone online described it as “fantasy but without the chaos” and I felt that captured it well. I love the paining part of it, you can paint anything you want in it which is just a delight!",False,True

Triggering bits aside it sounds like a beautiful game and I fell in love with it after your description and a very quick google.  I’m going to buy it tonight!,False,False
