When I first tried it I thought it was pretty bland and I didn't have it again because HaloTop had emerged and i was totally hooked. But after trying all the HaloTop flavours several times over I needed to switch it up. There was a toffee flavoured Arctic Zero at my local Walmart so i decided to give it another try...  Arctic Zero must have changed their recipe because I swear its the only low calorie ice cream that actually mimics the consistency of real ice cream. Halo Top is now my second favorite only because it's sort of chunky/blocky.  But I totally agree Arctic Circle is amazing now and I wish I could find more flavours because most times the grocery store is flooded with HaloTop and only has 2 different flavours of Arctic Zero on the shelf =(",False,False

I got a random craving for arctic zero for the first time in 4-5 years. Went to the store and was pleasantly surprised to see the new flavors (didn't even realize they changed the recipe). Chocolate chunk and brownie blast were both incredibleeee. I won't go back to halo top now.,False,False
