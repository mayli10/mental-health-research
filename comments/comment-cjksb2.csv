Because when I started losing weight this last time, I would actually WILLINGLY weigh myself on those bigass store scales if you can believe it!! I didn‚Äôt even own a scale myself.  Now my scale needs new batteries. It‚Äôs needed new batteries for a good couple of weeks, but I‚Äôm in therapy and am really Trying To Stay Alright and am of course not supposed to be weighing myself at all. So I‚Äôm tentatively putting off replacing the batteries and/or getting a new scale...for now...  Sometimes I gaze longingly at that old Publix scale but would rather shoot myself in the face than weigh myself around other humans at this point.  Even though I still weigh *less* than what weighed *when I actually did that.* (?!!!?) Like I‚Äôve gained some weight back? But still weigh less? Than what I weighed at that point????? ??? And *now* I‚Äôm too fundamentally ashamed...??!!? Lmao??! ???!!! Ugh.",False,False
