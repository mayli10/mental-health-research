I take it every morning on an empty stomach at least half an hour before I have a hot drink. Unless I ate, I found I wouldn't have a BM, and when I did eat, I got bloated real quick. Once I started the pro-b's (as I like to call them), after a few days I noticed that I was having semi regular BMs when fasting, which was a huge improvement. I still get bloated, but that's because I eat the wrong foods when I break my fasts, but there's been a slight improvement in that area too.  Get one that has a variety of bacteria and doesn't have to be refrigerated. I haven't noticed any negative effects on my weight or hunger, so you shouldn't worry too much about that. They can cause you to be extra bloated to begin with, but as your body adjusts to the bacteria, that'll sort itself out.",False,False
