The whole profession in my opinion is filled with people with strange personalities. They gossip and I think some of them just label people with bulimia as crazy. I try to avoid the old, white, male crusty ones in particular.  None of them have ever been even halfway nice. But tbh I haven’t found one that is even half professional or helpful. I really wish I had better things to say about dentists, but yea, I really hate going to them.",False,False

I was scared to death.   It’s okay to feel afraid. I hope your dentist is compassionate. They are a health care professional and want to help you be healthy. I opened up about my struggles immediately and we got to work.   I had been actively purging for 2 years since I had last seen him. There was damage but we made a plan and I’m almost through most of the work. The worst of it is a recommendation to have two teeth I previously had root canals on to be crowned, and that was already a plan prior to the bulimia. Also, I unfortunately already had soft enamel before the ED, so my damage may be worse because of that.   Sending you love and support. It will be okay.",False,False
