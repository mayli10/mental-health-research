I’m also slightly convinced we are the same person because I also used to back like crazy. Cakes and buttercream from scratch and I had a super amazing banana bread recipe as well! I had a dream of having my own bakery. It was so fun and I really loved doing it before my depression took all the fun away. One day we’re gonna be able to cook and bake like we used to and we’re gonna kick butt at it ♥️",False,True

I'm actually really proud of you, though, if that helps any. I miss cooking, too. I used to cook a big dinner for my family at least 3 times a week and loved every minute of it. I'd bake cakes from scratch with buttercream icing I'd make up myself. I was never a chef, there were just as many flops as there were successes, but it made me happy to create. I used to bake the best bannana bread, and now I wont even eat reguar bread, lol. If I got back into cooking again, I know it would help some of my depression, too bad my depression brain tells me no.  Im really glad you made that meal, and enjoyed it after. Nothing anyone says, even someone who you care about, can take away that you accomplished that. And then felt good about it!  For that time, however long it was, you recognized that you did something awesome, and nothing that happens or that you feel after mitigates that joy. Im proud of you, but you were proud of you first and thats what matters.",False,False
