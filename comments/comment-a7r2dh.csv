You aren't to blame. One of my closest friends had an ED and I met her long after she recovered, and she's the only person I can talk about my obsessions to. She says she has never once been triggered by all my talk because her mindset and life is just different now. So if you're afraid your presence is triggering this person, just know that's not a hard and fast rule, and she probably has other baggage she may be unloading onto you. Good luck and be safe &lt;3",False,False
