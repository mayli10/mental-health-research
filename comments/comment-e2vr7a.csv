I've seen so many (mainly student) videos where they add eggs to ramen and I've always wanted to try it but I can't stomach egg as anything but egg white omelettes.  A bowl of ramen and something resembling dessert feels like a true meal and is so comforting in this weather!,False,False

I'm a big fan of bulking up ramen with loads of veggies and maybe egg. That way you can then split it into portions and get lots of volume/nutrients as well as feeling full on less calories.,False,False

Plus you can take most of your supplements after this too (never iron and calcium together, just one at a time). And if you add enough stuff to it and have some self-control (lmao) you can have half a ""serving"" at different times.  Ramen has 6-8g protein per serving too I think?  Sure it's not ""healthy"" in the long run or whatever but atleast we're eating? And we're just trying to stay sane-ish not live for 800 years.",False,False
