I had a similar thing happen to me after me and my boyfriend got together. We spend a lot of time together and therefore, ate a lot of the same meals. Since my eating habits were pretty fucked up and irregular, it led to him losing weight while I maintained. He is a super tall muscular guy, and at the calories I need to maintain (which is around 1.5, maybe 1.6k) he loses pretty much a pound and a half a week. This is not happening because you can't be underweight or because you are unable- it's physics and stature. I hope you can work this out with him and, well, yourself :)",False,False
