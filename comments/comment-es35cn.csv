I check my pictures obsessively in the afternoon to calm myself after Iâ€™ve eaten and feel huge.   Iâ€™m a crappy friend and family member because my thoughts are always absorbed in myself. I used to do more, be more, get more done. I was so effective, and a great person, a high achieving fully functional adult.   Now Iâ€™m so exhausted all the time, and always stressed and focused on myself. I feel guilty and frustrated and sad because I know that no one is thinking about me even a tenth of as much time as I spend agonising over how I look.   Logically, it sorta comforts me to think that it is a phase, that right now I need the extra care, and extra self attention, Even if only from myself. That in a super fucked up way, Iâ€™m trying to care for myself, because I need it and am not getting it elsewhere. I think it wonâ€™t always be like this. ðŸ’•ðŸ’•ðŸ’•ðŸ’•   Iâ€™m sorry you are hurting.",False,False

All day, I think of me, of food, of whether I look whale like or delicate or lost. Self hatred and obsession is the mix.
