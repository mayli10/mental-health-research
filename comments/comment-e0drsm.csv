I guess I'll just pop in and try to let my non-disordered rational brain out for a moment.  If I'm honest, I don't notice small changes in other people. I don't know if you do, but either way, we notice those changes in ourselves much more than others would. It doesn't seem like it most of the time, but when I'm not clouded by this nonsensical disorder, I know that to be true. This is entirely me saying what I've been told time and time again, but other people don't care about our bodies as much as we think they do. We see our body every day and notice every little change because we live with it. And just like us, everyone else is concerned about their own body, and far too much to really care about those small details. Weight gain isn't going to make someone think less of you, and if they do, then you don't need them around. I'll be frank and say I have trouble coming to terms with that reality myself, but the more I try to assure myself of this, the closer I get to really believing it.   Other note: consider talking to this person about how comments about weight make you feel. If he knows that you struggle with that, then he should also know that him saying that doesn't do any good. It's not easy to correct people on that, but in the long run it saves so much stress.",False,False
