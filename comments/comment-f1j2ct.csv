Angers the shit out of me. Thankfully After lots of explaining (and tons of videos cause I am complete dog shit as trying to explain things) to my 2 best friends they finally get it. My mom suspected something was up before I even knew what was up with my self. Now whenever I visit her she makes sure I at least have SOMETHING even if its just a simple can of soup.  My dad took awhile to explain it to. He is super cool though just a little weird around my eating disorder so I steer clear about that with him unless he brings something up.,False,False
