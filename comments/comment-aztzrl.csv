(Note: ymmv my ED was always about ""perfection"", the definition of which changes every time I get closer to it, more so than being visibly boney. If your ED is saying ""moar bones!"" this probably isn't good advice for you)   I've been in recovery mode for some time now, but the thing that sparked me into recovery was I actually saw myself naked and realized how scary I looked. Bones everywhere but skin just hanging off them. It really freaked me out but I didn't want to eat still because I thought the skin was just fat. So I started exercising and eating with the intention of building some muscle (weight lifting and rock climbing) and im actually a lot more comfortable with my appearance. A lot of the other stuff is still very much there, though (obviously) so I'm still very controlling and untrusting of food, and I still struggle with dysmorphia (is it a tricep? Is it just flab because it moves sometimes? We'll never know) but at least I'm in a healthy weight range again and that doesn't upset me in and of itself. So, to clarify, I'm not saying purge your food through exercise. I'm saying recognize that a lot of the grossness you think you see is related to a lack of muscle and can be alleviated by gaining some muscle (which does require food!). You can keep losing if you want, preferably staying in the healthy range because going too low is not only horrible for you but also really uncomfortable and really *cold*, but do eat and do exercise because it does make you look and feel healthier. Good luck and be well. ",False,False
