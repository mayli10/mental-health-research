He now knows to never comment on my body or eating habits and supports me getting better no matter what (not pushing me though). He has seen me lose 80 pounds in our relationship and his opinion of attraction to my body has never changed. Be honest. Be transparent. If they are the right person for you at this time they will understand.,False,False

To be fair though I only developed whatever the hell this is this year so sheâ€™s seen this all go down.
