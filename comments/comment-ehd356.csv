I prefer the creamy vanilla flavor, but I end up smelling like it when I drink it, for some reason. I didn’t have that problem with the chocolate flavor.  I used to drink Soylent but they always ended up hurting my back, for some reason.",False,False

A bit grainy but I’m not picky. My favorite is Nature’s Way Metabolic Reset-low sugar, great flavor, and truly truly filling BUT I can’t find it anywhere for a reasonable price and the last two times I got it on Amazon it had mold...that was the best though if you can find it. I wouldn’t have more than one shake a day btw.",False,True

They all have this weird chalky aftertaste that I've come to enjoy tho. It's not horrible that you can't stomach it but it's not so good that i look forward to drinking it or want to over indulge. For me it's been pretty great, it fills me up and it's only 200 cal a scoop so i can have three or even four a day. Also i mix mine with a tablespoon of instant coffee in the morning",False,False

Pretty great macros for a meal if you ask me. Bonus points for tasting like a milkshake.  Can double as a healthy coffee creamer.,False,False
