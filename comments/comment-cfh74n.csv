They are all getting degrees, married, having kids, buying houses. My whole university cohort has graduated and I'm still over here with my eating disorder.

I can still continue to live a good life, but the quality will be slightly more diminished than if I had been able to stop this. It may continue to take more things as well. Such is life.",False,False
