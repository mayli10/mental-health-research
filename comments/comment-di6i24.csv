My period is 157 days late, but I don't know if it's because of my BMI or because I had a baby. I had two periods after his birth, and then they stopped when I was still normal weight. I weaned the baby two months ago, but my period hasn't come back.",False,False

I'm on day 169 without now but I've been trying to restore it by making sure I get a healthy amount of dietary fats (tbh somedays I haven't and I've cut calories lower than I should have. I don't heavy restrict but did do a lot of exercise that may have contributed).  Any improvement is progress and that's a major positive change! I'm so happy and proud for you! Just take things one step at a time and you'll be better off that way than if you just did nothing for yourself.  I'm hoping I'll either manage to still get mine to come back or doctor appointments fall back in the cards for me again because I would love to be able to go to a doctor just to get the peace of mind from a professional opinion on things but don't have that option at the moment.,False,False

Idk how serious i should treat amenorrhea tbh.",False,False
