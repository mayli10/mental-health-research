HOWEVER i totally relate to noticing the meals and random foods characters are eating in films and it drives me mad sometimes. Riverdale (which is high-key not good anyway) is quite bad for this bc they're always drinking milkshakes and eating burgers while maintaing tiny tiny figures. I know it's fiction but it takes me out of their world and into my ed mind. it's exhausting.",False,False
