You don't have to go into specifics or anything, but just be like ""Hey, that pic you showed me of my cousin triggered me/messed me up a bit/stressed me out (whichever one you choose or your own wording) and I'd appreciate it if you didn't show me pics like that again. I know you care and that means a lot but I need to deal with this on my own, and when you make comments about my body it reminds me how much I don't like it and then that's all I think about. Thank you for caring but I am dealing with this and the best thing you can do is not bring it up and not comment on my body."" Believe me, it makes sense.",False,False

He always compliments me and my body but every time he mentions my body it reminds me about how much I don’t like it and then it’s all I think about. I feel so guilty for this because I know he’s only trying to help if that makes sense :/,False,True

I'd be honest with him and say how you are really feeling though. And maybe even say that the pic of his cousin triggered you. Maybe tell him ways that he can help you and maybe even words or phrases to stay away from. Communication is key, and if you aren't ready to tell him face-to-face, writing it down will be better.",False,False
