I love weed because it helps me sleep and feel good, but all bets are off and it’s like restriction doesn’t exist when I’m stoned. Just completely out of control. I’ve had my most successful restriction phases thrown out the window with no hesitation from weed. Win/lose :(",False,False

I have been completely sober from all drugs and alcohol for the last year or so because of the constant bingeing.
