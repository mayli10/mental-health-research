It sounds extreme but so is plastic surgery and people are empowered to spend thousands on that but we’re crazy for restricting? I know I’m gonna get hate for this but it’s how I feel. And honestly today “healthy” weights are actually in the overweight range. It pisses me off everyone’s approach to this. I might be paranoid but it feels like sometimes people are just jealous and wanna see us get fat.,False,False
