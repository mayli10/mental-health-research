But last time I went to treatment (for issues other than my ED) there was a woman there who was fairly overweight. I found myself judging at first but then she shared her story about how she was sexually abused as a child and she used her weight as a means of keeping people away from her, like a shield from abuse. It really broke my heart and then I felt like an asshat. I see it a bit differently now cuz of that",False,False

If you hate overweight people, and you hate people that eat poorly (under eating is just as unhealthy as over eating), it really shows what you hate about yourself . it's a horrible, toxic defense mechanism. If you hate yourself for long enough, it manifests in hatred of others because you see what you hate most about yourself in them. It's easier to accept the self hatred that way, because you're basically hiding from yourself.  &amp;#x200B;  Calling yourself out on it when it happens really helps - notice the thought, call it out for being what it is - judgemental, unfair and replace the thought with a kind one towards them, and yourself. Because these thoughts come from deeply ingrained self hatred/disgust, aswell as a fear that you are the same as them,  which you are. We are all the same, struggling, no matter what weight, what food we eat, etc.   You don't have to shut yourself away, just talk to yourself each time it happens. I've found doing that has helped me a lot. It stops it from getting worse, growing into something truly horrible. This is just another way your eating disorder eventually grinds you down into a shell of a human being. But you can change it, and you're not a bad person. It's a really good thing that you can see this, and are concerned about it :)",False,False
