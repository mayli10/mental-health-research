Food is a very multi-faceted aspect of our lives, both through evolution and society, and we place so much emphasis and importance on it - especially when disordered - that it's natural to panic when things don't go as planned.  I hope your next order goes perfectly without a hitch. I even hope you get a discount.",False,False

I love McDonalds and I consider it a big deal to have it so when the order is messed up or comes out cold I am very disappointed. The self-checkout is awesome as I can customize the order as much as I want and avoid human contact.",False,False

I had a similar experience last week when my husband took me out to a BBQ place for date night. I obsessed over the menu and ordered grilled chicken, salad, and broccoli. They gave me *fried* chicken and my heart just sank... But I was too timid to complain and raise (any more) suspicion.",False,False
