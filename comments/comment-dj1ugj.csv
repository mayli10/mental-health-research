You're smart as fuck and I am so proud of you. Nobody gets to choose whether or not to have an eating disorder, but to recognize it for the problem that it is and take the steps you need to be healthy and safe is so important, no matter your age. Online support can be great, but if you have someone you trust I definitely also recommend talking to them about what you've been going through. Not everybody will fully get what it's like to have an eating disorder, but they'll care about you and want you to be healthy and happy. Recovery might be hard at first, but it's worth it and I know you can do this.",False,False
