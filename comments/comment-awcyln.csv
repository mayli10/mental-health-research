It's never worth it, trust me. And I'm sure every other binge/purger here will agree that it's not worth it.",False,False

I am not upset but your warnings and advice at all.  I just hate that I let myself get out of control like that...I wish I could do more to stop it besides DrInKiNg WaTeR.  I will try my best to not make it a habit.  Thank you ðŸ’•",False,True

Also, itâ€™s likely l you didnâ€™t purge it *all* away in terms of calories absorbedâ€”but thatâ€™s okay!! A few hundred calories wonâ€™t make much of a difference truly, even though I know it feels that way.",False,False
