It is certain however that that farther someone goes from 18.5, the less likely they are as healthy as they could be.",False,False

I think you should emphasize being healthy in general and the weight itself should be a lower priorityâ€” making your weight a priority in any way can be a very slippery slope.   If you take care of yourself, your weight will stabilize on its own and you have to accept whatever that stable weight is.",False,False

Important distinction to make. I have come to terms with being mentally unhealthy my entire life, but oddly enough that leads to extreme anxiety and paranoia about being physically unhealthy, when I put myself in these positions in the first place lol.

I think it is possible for someone to be underweight but they feel great, pass a physical, bloodwork etc. I think how you come to that weight is where it becomes healthy or not. One can be seemingly healthy physically overall, but unwell mentally.",False,False
