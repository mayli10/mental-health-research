I used laxatives because the idea of having half digested food and shit inside repulses me. I also feel like not eating will purify me morally which is honestly probably my number one motivation to restrict.,False,False

I don't use laxatives, so when I eat something ""bad"" I have to have 3 bowel movements over 3 days to feel clean again. First and second days are for expelling the bad food, and the third is just in case.",False,False

I want to be as perfect as I can humanly be, and my head does mental gymnastics that I can only reach perfection by being pure.  It’s so weird to me.",False,False

Yeah, I hope it’s included in the next manual; I think it’s common because it’s much more socially acceptable. Praised, even, to be so “dedicated” to a diet",False,True

Ortho is forgotten about a lot because it’s not technically a diagnosis rn. It’s discussed as a category and is under further study, but without it being included in the DSM it’s not an ed that can officially be given/covered by insurance. It might be included in DSM 6 though!",False,False

I haven’t read the diagnostic criteria for orthorexia in a really long time because I’ve always just bounced back and forth between AN, BN and OSFED. Even then, it was sorta a fixation on purity, but I guess more of an emphasis on losing weight. I thought it meant someone who is extremely food-conscious and spends excessive amounts of time at the gym...  Reading this post back with the criteria open on another tab, it really looks that way  Thank you, I’m a fuckin idiot!",False,True
