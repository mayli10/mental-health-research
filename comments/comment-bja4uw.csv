They make me feel so full because of the bubbles. After downing one whole can, I couldn't eat even if I wanted to.    Also, they come in great variety of flavors so it doesn't get boring and you can put together a whole ""menu"" for the day.    I live in Germany most of the time, and here the selection of sugar free softdrinks and energy drinks is very restricted, so I was really super-excited when the Monster Ultra Range was introduced here a few years ago.",False,False

And then after I’m sufficiently awake, a steady stream of green tea, and diet soda. The diet Cokes with flavors are a good choice—Feisty Cherry, Ginger, Strawberry Guava, Twisted Mango. Also, Diet Dr. Pepper. The Bangs and Reigns are awesome because in my opinion they taste just like what they say they do :) Oh! And also Powerade Zero in the blue flavor (lol can’t remember the name) is amaaaaaaazing. No caffeine but BVitamins and electrolytes yay! I Iike it even better than the blue Gatorade Zero—which is also yummy!",False,False

Other than that I force myself to drink half a monster zero because I can never finish a dull can. Gatorade zero (5 calories - it’s a LIE) is decent but I really tend to like the orange Powerade zero a lot!,False,False
