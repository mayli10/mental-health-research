I think it can help to some degree get you to ketosis but if you’re not on a keto diet you’re not getting much benefit.",False,False

For example, a lot of people will sit on the couch for a few hours after dinner, tired from working all day, watching four episodes of something on Netflix before bed, and they will be mindlessly grazing on cookies or chips or whatever the whole time. If they’re mindfully and actively participating in an intermittent fasting program where their eating window closes at six pm, it can really help with getting out of that snacking habit. It’s just another way of holding yourself accountable for cutting down on calories in.",False,False
