I've been doing pretty damn well with my ED over the past 2 years (right now not as well, but it happens) and I can assure you that when I've been most obsessed with this stuff, is when I've felt most detached from other people and thought everyone around me hated me. I know now that they don't. Feeling detached/rejected(real or not) fueled my ED and vice versa.   I would definitely recommend asking them questions. Show them you're interested in them. What do they think of [insert thing here]? It'll probably make you feel better by creating a better relationship with them.   I dont know you, but you are definitely good at other things, you're just feeling shitty right now. Even if you aren't great at the things you do now, there's probably something you haven't tried yet that you'll be awesome at or you will be great at other things once you practice more.   I also wanted to say: Losing a dog is harder than losing people in your life sometimes. I'm so sorry you're going through this.",False,False
