The cafeteria at my place has so much  junk food, pizza, burger, fries, but also healthy foods as well. ",False,False

I think it's a combination of hiring beautiful beautiful people because in general people are more trusting toward them as well as nurses leading very active lives being constantly on their feet. Pretty triggering for someone who pretty much only goes to the hospital for for ED complications though. It's even like that in IP which I think is kiiiiiinda insensitive to all of us. One of the lead staffers literally looked like a model- 5'10, MAYBE 115-120lbs, blonde, glass features. Man she made me us all hate ourselves a little more. ",False,False

And by ""not trying"", I mean that I cooked everything with butter and barely knew what a calorie was.    I was exercising frequently and fairly fit, too. But it was just way harder to eat back the calories from working on my feet for the entire day than the calories from a daily run. ",False,False
