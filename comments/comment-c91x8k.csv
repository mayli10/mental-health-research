Honestly you can’t rely on the general public to comment on how your eating disorder looks on the outside because you’re right, peoples idea of healthy weight is truly out of whack. I really hope you’re okay. Xx",False,True

I'm so sorry for what you've went through. I hope you're better now and thanks for the support &lt;3",False,False

People said the same thing about me “omg I’m so jealous you’re so tall and skinny you should model” ....and then they’d follow it up with “but you should totally gain weight and get healthier though!!!” Bitch, you just gave me a ton of reasons NOT to gain weight. So helpful.",False,False

I lost about 15 pounds in 2 month when all of this started and when she asked me how i did it I panicked and told her I stopped drinking. At first she thought I was an alcoholic (I was 17 at the time) lol  Later she started looking at what I'm eating at and and bringing homemade food to work so that we could eat together. I think she knew.. She was like a mother to me and seeing how happy she was when I ate her food made I actually enjoy those meals after a while, I miss working with her.

I got underweight and everyone just said I looked healthy and toned, but otherwise not very different. It was a mixed feeling for me. I felt like my months of starving myself and working out every day  were invalidated, but I also was relieved that I had more room to continue my habits and lose more weight since it clearly wasn't an issue to anyone.",False,False

My BMI was 15 and I was wheelchair bound but I got comments from people saying I looked like a model and they wished they had my motivation. Thanks guys, that’s totally not helping my recovery.    Even if people irl aren’t noticing, we here all still love and care about you very much. Please don’t make yourself sicker to feel more validated. &lt;3",False,True
