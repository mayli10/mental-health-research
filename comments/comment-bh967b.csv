I’m not trying to say I’m insanely fit or anything because I NEED to lose weight but fit=skinny and fat=lazy is such utter bullshit.",False,False

""Compliments"" literally don't make me feel better about myself, they do nothing for me. If I'm being honest, they tend to make me feel worse about myself. I don't wanna think about how I look, because I think about that all the fricking time already.",False,False

People think thin automatically equals fit.   I had cancer and constantly hear how much ""more fit"" I look when what they are really trying to say is how much ""more skinny"" I look. Yup. Chemo and body image issues will do that to a person. I'm much LESS fit than before. I used to be a competitive powerlifter and was just solid muscle.",False,False

He's not going to change. So OP, it's up to you whether you want to date him or...virtually anyone else.  Not that I'm biased against dudes who live by ""FAT BAD SKINNY GOOD"", yet couldn't guess the calories in the Hot Pockets their mom buys for them. Can have only the highest of respect for such worldly, empathetic human beans.",False,False

He said he had “nothing against fat girls” but that he would only date fit girls bc they could keep up with his “lifestyle”. I pointed out that I was far from fit and he goes “Yeah, but you’re *skinny*. It’s different.” OH LAWD THE HYPOCRISY. I may be projecting, but ditch his ass, if he’s making comments like that, then he’s made his values clear!",False,False

Make the best of it. If he calls you weird for wanting plain protein and vegetables, just tell him you're the ""fit"" one and you know best.",False,False
