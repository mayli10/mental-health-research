To rid yourself of the excess weight, you need to rebalance your electrolyte levels (sodium, potassium, chloride, calcium, magnesium, and phosphorus) by drinking more water - I find &gt;128oz to be optimal - and take an electrolyte supplement - or just make sure you are getting enough of those essential minerals (at least 80% of RDA). Don’t drink more than 30oz of water per hour. It could take up to 3 days (from experience... not medical literature) for your body to get rid of all the excess water. I would also recommend cutting down on artificial sweeteners if you consume those (ie. diet soda) because they have been linked with an increased occurrence of metabolic disorders and it will make it harder for your body to carry out the chemical reactions involved in the ‘metabolism’.",False,False
