I still had thoughts about my body, but food just wasn't a thing. I ate when I was hungry until I was full and didn't think much of it.  My stupid ass then took advantage of this sudden loss of interest and decided to restrict, bringing extreme hunger right back. But maybe try to learn from my mistake. It was such a blissful couple of weeks.",False,False

This concept alone has gotten me to be very very good at intuitive eating. IDK what other advice to give. When you allow yourself to eat absolutely anything, you might be surprised and find that you actually don't want to eat anything. Same probably goes for drugs, caffeine, porn, masturbation, any addiction. My 2 cents. I believe in you :)",False,False

I also think that hormones such as leptin and ghrelin play a part in hunger and fullness in underweight individuals.,False,False

But it's also true that we're constantly surrounded by what is essentially weaponized food that's way easy to consume too much of.   In my experience, it's way easier when not underweight. But it's easy to keep gaining if you don't work on developing a genuinely reasonable relationship with food (which for some people does mean counting calories)",False,False
