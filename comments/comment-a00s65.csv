I also find it helps to shift the topic from yourself to the other person, since people love to talk about themselves - I'm sure your coworker would love to tell you all about her new gym routine :) Hope things go better for you soon (and thank you for your kind regards)!",False,False

No one ever has things 100% figured out - but doing our best is all we can really do, and I really think that all of us will get to where we want to be eventually. Take care of yourself and good luck my love üíú  Oh and tell your coworker to fuck off, 'guessing weights' is inappropriate and rude as hell.",False,False
