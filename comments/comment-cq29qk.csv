I was worried I was smoking too much weed.  At one point I was driving home from work and like faded out for a bit then ""woke up"" while driving and that scared the fuck out of me. At that point my deficiency was pretty bad though.  For low iron I think it makes you feel like you're going to faint, but I'm not sure on other symptoms.",False,False

I had a B12 deficiency and it can get serious and cause permanent brain damage.  You can get enough in a varied plant based diet but esp when restricting I'd rec a multivitamin with that, vit D, and iron.",False,False
