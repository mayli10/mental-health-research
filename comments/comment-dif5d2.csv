That is actually my holy grail now :) I will go to my local pho place after not eating for a few days looking like a zombie and sit in front of a bowl slurping for like an hour LOL. It helps soooo much though!! I usually can get myself to eat some of the chicken and veggies as well.,False,False

Have you tried chicken broth?   When I'm fasting and getting sick because of it, but the idea of food (or actually trying to eat food) also makes me sick, I find chicken broth tends to be really safe. :)   Then I can go from there and try to wean myself into having some veggies or a snack or whatever else.",False,False

Like, my stupid ass thinks I absorb calories by cooking and smelling the food or some shit.   I just made this huge dish of zoodles and spinach and mushrooms and this crazy low calorie pasta sauce. And every so often I would taste how the sauce was coming. And by the time the dish was done, I was like super full and thinking ""didn't I eat a ton already or...."" nope. No you didn't. You just tasted the sauce and kept smelling everything cooking. ü§¶üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è",False,False
