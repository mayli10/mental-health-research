It is strange and I'm not sure where the fatphobia comes from...but it seems like a lot of the ""fat logic"" type people are/used to be overweight or are just generally insecure and it manifests in anger towards other. It's really just a way of redirecting their own insecurity and self-loathing and a way to feel (falsely) superior.  I honestly don't give a fuck what other people look like, even though I want to look a specific way and hate feeling fat (I realize that sounds shitty and dumb).  I just watched all of the episodes of Shrill and loved it. There is an episode where the main character goes to a fat positive pool party and even though I am currently in the middle of restricting and fasting, I thought it was awesome. Seeing all of their bodies, bodies that we are constantly told are disgusting and indicative of laziness and slovenliness, in bikinis and being the vehicles for a good fuckin time, was really really cool.  It wasn't even triggering at all, it was just...really nice :)  Anyways, I'm sorry that you have to deal with that and I hope that this subreddit is a safer place for you. Maybe we can all try to be more sensitive.",False,False

Sometimes it's hard when everyone comes together because beliefs or fears that one person has can be really hurtful to another. Unfortunately intrusive thoughts can't be controlled and it's often these toxic beliefs that maintain EDs in the first place. Its difficult to determine if or how they should be shared.   I'm sorry if you have ever felt invalidated or hurt here, this community should be a safe space for everyone.",False,False

I saw a post a few days ago slamming people who ""normalize"" obesity but supposedly become worried about ED's and the whole thing was just riddled with fat phobia. It really made me feel awful as someone whose BMI has always been obese. And then when people talk about numbers and stuff and how they need to even smaller when they're beyond my wildest dreams of small, it hurts man. Super triggering sometimes bc I don't feel like I'm as valid as them",False,False

I haven‚Äôt seen it much here at all. Or I just don‚Äôt notice it coz I‚Äôm ignorant. Which is likely because I tend to skim read posts  ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è an Ed is an Ed regardless of body size.
