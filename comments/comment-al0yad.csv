I hope you are not in too much pain physically, if you are I always try to hug a firm pillow against my stomach it really helps both physically and mentally comforting. I have literally felt like I was going to pop before.   &amp;#x200B;  I think many of us have been here before and while you can not fix the damage right away, there will be far less than you think. If you are a daily weigh in person, I would skip the scale for a few days and let the water weight go down. I often think I will feel like it forever but you will feel better soon!   &amp;#x200B;  As we all are, try not to be too hard on yourself. It happens and it sucks! Try to look toward the future, you can get back on track tomorrow!",False,False

I have kept down 5000 cal binges many many many times and I am still bmi 19 (so not THAT heavy). it is scary though... I understand that. I try to come out of bad binging episodes looking at what triggered it and how it happened. but it's not the end of the world, I promise you!",False,False
