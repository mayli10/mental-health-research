It’s interesting to compare with ED especially because EDs are (at least stereotypically) an upper class problem. I remember reading a book in French class with a really disgusting description of a woman licking mayonnaise off her fingers, followed by another woman drunkenly throwing up everywhere. French stuff is full of all that LOL so gross but also so hard to look away. ",False,False
