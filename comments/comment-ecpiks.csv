I didn’t lose or gain weight and I wasn’t hungrier or less hungry than before.,False,False

And you best believe I took it for as long as humanly possible because my ED loved the ease of restriction. But then I started hallucinating and had paranoid delusions from the lack of sleep and had to immediately stop because I thought a chair was following me and stalking me on social media lmfao",False,False

Always was good at helping me with my bulimia.  It makes me incredibly tired and decreases my hunger to almost zero. Lost about 20lbs so far (was overweight beforehand).   But now it gets abused by my ed, sooooo",False,False

I’ve lost weight but I think that probably has more to do with the ED than the medication. I was terrified of its affects on my weight and appetite but honestly it didn’t effect either at all. If anything for the first couple of weeks I found my appetite decreased. I’ve been taking it for anxiety and depression and honestly I’ve found it a huge help.,False,False

I’m sorry if this was no help ;_; I just wanted to give my experience",False,False

She didn't have any weight gain or changes in appetite. I had some gain while on it, but I'm not sure if that was the Prozac or something else I was on at the same time.",False,False
