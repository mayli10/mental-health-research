Feels like the flu but all the time. When I fuck around and decide I’m cured (I have dumb bitch disease) it takes a few weeks to get back to normal after I start back on a supplement. I’m really sorry you’re feeling this way. I hope someone has some good advice for you and you start feeling better soon ❤️,False,False

I take a very high dose every week + stand in the 40 degree sun for at least an hour or two a day). I also take a general B complex one when I don't take the B12 one(I switch sometimes) and I take iron and omega 3 and soon will add magnesium, potassium and zinc. I am still tired af. Idk what's wrong with me tbh.",False,True
