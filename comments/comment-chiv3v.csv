Put the recipe into mfp and calculate how many portions. You weigh your bowl and then make the batter. You weigh all that and then subtract the weight of the bowl and divide by x amout of pancakes. Now you know how exactly how much batter you need for one pancake. And then you cry in butter because you don't have a non stick pancake pan,False,False

I like the European ones that is per 100 grams, is easier to make conversion. Normally for snacks it comes the 100 g and the weight of the package, lets say whatever the energy bar weights.

That is why they are moving to make nutrition labels make more sense. In the US they are supposed to put the total package calories on the item beside the single serving size if it is something a normal person could feasibly eat themselves. Unfortunately they haven't quite gotten the grasp of what a normal person can eat.,False,False
