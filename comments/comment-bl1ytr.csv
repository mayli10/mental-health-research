I don't have good advice for you but I just want you to know that it's okay to hate diet talk (I do too) and that doesn't make you an unsupportive partner. You'll probably just have to strategize on how to communicate your feelings to him in the least accusatory way possible so that he doesn't feel shamed but also you don't have to trigger yourself just by talking to him.,False,False
