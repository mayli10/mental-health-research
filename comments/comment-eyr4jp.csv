I think of it like flood gates; once you give your body food after a long period of heavy restriction it’s going to go a bit crazy. I have found if I have a very nutritious and vitamin rich dinner, I’m less likely to binge at night. Take it day by day. Your body will settle down after time, and after it regains  trust that food is a consistent thing. I know it’s hard, because it’s driving me nuts too. Sometimes I write down why when I’m full, and healthy, my life is better. It’s all about retraining your brain, and creating new habits. Walks and daily activity help too. Good luck, and stay strong ! :)",False,False
