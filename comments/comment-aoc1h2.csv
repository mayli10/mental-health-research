What I needed to do was find new methods of coping, as well as new avenues for weight loss. So what I would do is take long walks whilst listening to music, come online and help others with *their* problems (trust me, in the end you feel a lot better), blog about my personal life and my own self-image issues, write poetry &amp; prose...   Walking allowed me to clear my mind and, at the same time, lose weight. That is why I leaned on it so much.",False,True

A lot of ""striking out"", per se. But I noticed that the harder I tried, the longer I was able to go. A few times I was able to make it to double-digits, but then I would slip and end up purging. It was a mess and I hated it. But you have to remind yourself that you're stronger than you think, that you have the guts to make it. Also I had to confront some of my inner demons and conflicts within my life which were causing me to purge, and I was forced to confront my own issues with my body dysmorphia; and once I did I realized I had to find new avenues of weight loss.  But don't forget, I'm only at 24-25 days now, which still isn't that much..  But to answer your hypothetical: If it's a Sunday at 8pm and I'm out of things to do, and my willpower has lost all its strength, what I would usually do is take a very long walk and just think about things whilst listening to music. That was a technique that I would use all the time. Another thing that I would do is come online and try to help others with *their* problems, which always helped make me feel better. You'd be surprised how much compassion for others can help you conquer your own problems!",False,True
