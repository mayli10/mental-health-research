I've definitely tried to include myself in photos, even if I hate seeing how I look in them. It's a struggle, but seeing my friends happy is always worth it :')",False,False

When I was younger, I used to hate being in photos too. Now, I regret not having as many pictures of myself with my friends. The little things you might pick out and obsess over, no one else would think twice about - they'll only notice how happy y'all look, or remember how much fun you had.",False,False

It's just....shocking? Confusing I guess? Because it's a totally different person that I don't recognize? Just doesn't match up with my mental image (but my mental image is also not a girl either so I guess that throws things off too lmao). Sorry you feel it too ðŸ’œ,False,False

They always comment ""Oh, breadndread, you're always taking photod, but you're never in them"". I realized a big reason is because I hate my face unless it's a selfie I've taken, and candids make me look like the ugliest creature on the planet.   I've also tricked myself into thinking I'm prettier than I actually am, so a glance in the mirror becomes obsession and disbelief",False,False
