It seems like a lot but its seriously not. Plus tomorrow just by fasting or walking for an hour you'll have burned those 500 no problem. They are insignificant calories in the day to day running of your body alone.   This is certainly not the best way to look at it but when I'm fasting and then have to eat I say to myself that those days I have been fasting and plan on fasting cancel out the '500' calories I have eaten today. You'll be fine it's such a small amount of calories in the large scheme of keeping your body together that it's nothing to worry about.   Go have fun at your dads and drink! Have a good time!! And please dont worry about it, like try to I know it's hard not to.",False,False
