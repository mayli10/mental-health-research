I’m in the same situation where my diabetes is controlled while being totally and completely uncontrolled somehow.   We’ve got this though, even if both disorders wanna fight each other",False,False

I know things are hard right now, but it really sounds like you're trying. That is so commendable, and you are seriously brave. Hang in there through the highs and lows!",False,False

I think for me it was having to read all the nutrition on everything. Before I was diagnosed (at almost 16) I remember having bad body image, (and having what was rapidly turning into BED without having a name for it at the time), but I didn't really know much about calories and virtually nothing about carbs.  I started restricting my insulin at about 17 so I could lose weight. It all seemed so easy, I didn't really have to restrict food, and I'd take -some- insulin, just not enough. I remember telling a close friend, who had anorexia at the time, that I was going to run just a little higher than normal so I could eat and lose at the same time.  And it worked! For at least a year or so I could do that without feeling anything worse than thirst. I also low restricted calories for a while, but I couldn't keep it up while keeping my grades up too. I went through diabulimia for at least two years. My A1C was through the roof. High cholesterol, high triglycerides, I couldn't walk for more than 5 to 10 minutes before my leg cramps forced me to stop.  Eventually I had to accept that I was damaging my body too much. I forgot insulin a lot because of bad habits from the diabulimia. I'm trying so hard to get better, I no longer restrict on purpose. But being so hyper aware of the nutrition labels on EVERYTHING feels so triggering because it's so hard to see carbs as just a number I need to take insulin for and not a personal judgement on my self worth.  This ended up being long- tldr: yes, reading nutrition labels and monitoring my intake made me too aware of food and it became a huge disordered issue I might not have had otherwise.",False,False

So I guess I can’t really put any input into if the disease helped create an ED.   My a1c results are always amazing when I barely eat, as well as my blood sugar in general. It’s really hard to not feel like I’m doing something “right” by starving myself.   I sometimes only take my basal insulin when restricting or else my BS will go low and Ill have to eat something. The whole thing is a very careful numbers game",False,False
