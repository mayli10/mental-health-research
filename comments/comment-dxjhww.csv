Making sure management knows that you're switching a shift that was originally yours with someone else is your responsibility every time it happens. You should always let them know as early as possible. Also, not showing up to work when you know there won't be anyone else to work the shift is not cool. It's better to show up feeling like shit and ask to be sent home sick than to do a no call/no show.  Are you hourly and the person you want to switch with is salaried? Is it possible that this might have had a impact on your ability to have your shift covered by this person? Either way, it's annoying that they bailed on you at the very last minute, leaving you without any other options.  Sorry your plans got messed up. It can be tough working such long hours and being responsible for so much. You deserve to have time to yourself to unwind sometimes, especially when you're celebrating. I hope everything goes well for you when you talk to the GM.",False,False
