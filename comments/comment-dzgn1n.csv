Up until this point I was eating as many days as I was fasting, but now I canâ€™t stop being afraid that my ed has gotten worse, therefore the natural progression is that Iâ€™m about to shift over to binging, if I touch food itâ€™ll be the last I know of losing weight and aaaaaaaaaaaaÃ¤",False,False
