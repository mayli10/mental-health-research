These days I tend to go weeks eating the same thing though so itâ€™s pretty easy lol. Once I get to macros I like and they feel safe and I feel okay on them, my ED and my OCD are like....we live here now. NO CHANGE. And so Iâ€™ll stay like that until I have a mental breakdown about something, a health crisis that causes me to increase my intake, or some other weird reason makes me change it. Iâ€™m losing whatâ€™s left of my mind and thatâ€™s okay. ðŸ™‚",False,False
