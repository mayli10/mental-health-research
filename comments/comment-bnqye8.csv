I obsessively use MyFitnessPal everyday and get my calories around 1000-1100 even though I do like 500-600 cals of exercise everyday. Whoops,False,False

While I totally get why that would be problematic for a lot of folks here, it has helped me a lot.   Getting an accurate ish estimate of my calories for the day makes me so much more comfortable eating especially on days where I'm working on my feet all day or if I'm particularly active. I used to restrict on days like that since it was easier but now I'm learning to work with it.",False,False

I think the reason this has happened is because tracking my food helped me quantify it as nutrition and a source of energy.

(don't worry i made up a lot of the missed calories by going out for lunch today haha) Anyway that made me think about all the times my friends would mention that they'd accidentally missed meals and I'd get jealous (cringe, ik) because that seemed impossible for me since I was always thinking about what to eat next. But I realised today that since I started CICO and losing weight, that problem has gone away. At first, I had to prep several low cal snacks so that I could constantly eat like I wanted to, but eventually stopped and now I really do only eat when I either need to or when something worth it crosses my path. Cravings pass by instead of making me crazy trying to approximate them. I haven't been stress eating.
