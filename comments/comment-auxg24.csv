I used to binge and purge huge amounts every single day. Everything in my body hurt. I tend to restrict/fast/eat normally more often. If I do purge, it‚Äôs generally a regretted meal but never a full binge anymore. My ED still occupies my brain, but I do consider myself better than I used to be.   Some habits are less destructive than others. Purging is one of the worse in my opinion. The heart damage and possible esophageal tears are terrifying. But we all know you don‚Äôt go from an eating disorder to completely recovered in one step. You‚Äôre making progress. The steps are small, but they are moving forward and you are awesome.

I tend to measure how ""well"" I'm doing by the amount of time and Brain power being used up on food.
