I feel like this is only going to cause problems when you want to lose weight and he'll be unhappy about it which will cause  tension and more problems. Break it off while it's still new sis.   Also, just my opinion. ",False,False

Not because you'll become thin, but rather because body image is an issue for you and maybe you want him to be aware of it. To prevent harm I suppose. He might even offer help since he helps other people with other problems.",False,False

If things are going well and you're happy together, I'd say go with it. If he seems to be backing off a bit as you lose weight, I'd ask him directly if his attraction to you is contingent upon your weight.",False,False

If he starts to make a comment or say he thinks you should stop losing weight then the relationship wont work and Id dump him.. you dont need that kind of negativity in your life ðŸ˜…... just my opinion tho,False,False
