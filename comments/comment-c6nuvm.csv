I guess my worry is that it's too late to develop a ""full"" personality in recovery because the eating disorder took up so much brain space during critical developmental periods. But I don't know anything about psychology so this could all be total nonsense.",False,True

Mental illness started for me when I was about 6 with anxiety and OCD and I feel like I never really got to develop a personality. I guess the good thing about recovery is that you get the chance to explore your identity and figure out who you are outside of your eating disorder.,False,False

You have to remind yourself that your ED is absolutely the most boring thing about you. It’s not tragic, exciting, noble or brave to struggle with this. It’s monotonous, time-sucking and BORING. Imagine if someone could hear your internal monologue: “how many calories in this, how much do I have to run to burn off my last meal, I bet that person is looking at me and thinking what a fatass I am, who am I kidding they definitely are and they’re right, better not have dinner, how much does the scale say today?, that can’t be right let me reweigh myself naked, impossible that I weight that much, I need a different scale to see if it’s broken” A person who builds their identity around the fact that they collect socks would have more interesting things to overhear in their head.   Idk if this helps you but it really helps me to kick my own ass mentally when I have thoughts like this. I tell myself “your dumb ass is really going to be proud that you’re good at starving yourself and exercising until you want to die??” Then I go and spitefully make a list of things I like and don’t like and make myself read it like “bitch that’s just a part of who you are. It’s impossible to conceptualize the multitudes within you and put it down on paper but you have proof right here that you’re more than your bullshit”   Here I’ll write some things down that prove I’m more than my ED:  Things I like about the world and myself: -I am a nature lover. I feel most at home in the woods or by the sea -I love to learn and I am kind of the encyclopedia in my friend group  -I am intuitive and excellent at reading people and their intentions. I often know how people are going to react to things even before they do -I am good at listening and am often a confidant to people. This means people trust me with their secrets and to be honest with them -I am good with animals and they trust me too. Can’t be a piece of shit if even animals think I’m cool -I have a natural knack for artsy stuff. I have a good eye for color, and composition and I’m not bad at rendering things -I love food and cooking. Even if I’m not great at eating, I am good at making healthy, and delicious food. I’ve had multiple people moan in ecstasy upon trying my cooking -I am good at making people laugh. When I’m in a good mood, I can be charming and command a whole room. When I actually speak up, people stop and pay attention to me -I am not rigid. I am flexible in my thinking and I can be spontaneous  Now you can’t just list the positives about yourself. Feels fake if you just list nice things so here’s some parts of me I’m not too happy about myself but can work on: -I can be impulsive and don’t spend my money wisely -I am sensitive to rejection  -I am very emotional and feel like I blow up very easily when I’m frustrated or upset. This makes me suppress my emotions and makes me more stressed down the line -I have trouble admitting I need help bc of pride and needing to be seen as perfect -I struggle with fatalism and cynicism. I don’t trust people as easily as they trust me.  -I struggle with identifying my emotions and often distract myself instead of confronting my issues -I deal with shame a lot even when I have nothing to be ashamed of.   It was easy for me to make this list bc I’ve done it at least a 100x to remind myself that I’m more than my eating disorder. When I look at my “flaws” list, I can see that these are all very manageable issues and that I am actively working on them. I see my virtues list and think “hey I’d be friends with a girl who described herself that way” and feel a little better about myself. Try making a list like this right now! Keep it somewhere  you can see it often. At first you’ll struggle to put 3 things down in each category, but it gets easier, the more you do it. Try sitting down with your friends and ask them “what’s the best and worst thing about me?” And go around and share with each other.",False,False
