I was watching a Ted talk today about a woman in recovery and it must be super easy to recover when you're already thin and perfect looking. I cant ever recover. Being thin and not being obsessed with food is a pipe dream for me.   I keep fucking overeating. I tell myself its recovery bc I'm not purging so I lie and say it's better. For me, not purging is 100x worse because I have so so much weight to lose. I mean for anyone else I'd say it's an improvement but for me it just makes me hate myself even more. I'd honestly wish rn I was back to being afriad to eat bc I was actually losing weight. ",False,False

Trying to turn that boat back around this year ... ,False,False

Iâ€™ve always just restricted with no purging but I really am trying to get better and I  convinced myself yesterday that throwing up after a binge was what I needed for recovery. At least Iâ€™m aware Iâ€™m absurd. Hopefully it was a one off event and not the start of a new chapter of disordered eating. ,False,False
