If you have a Costco membership they have these light muscle milk things with 20g protein for 100 cals( you can prolly find it somewhere else itâ€™s called muscle milk light I think but I can double check). I drink 1/2 a day. And yeah the meatless stuff is great. I will do the veg burger on the side of my salad or if I do shirataki noodles I mix in the beefless beef crumbles from Trader Joeâ€™s and itâ€™s like 60cals for 60cals and itâ€™s like spaghetti with meat and marinara sauce. Tofu is good too in a veggie stir fry. Or beans in progresso light soups. Iâ€™m giving all these suggestions cuz I got so sad when I started losing my hair and wouldnâ€™t want anyone to go through that!!!,False,False
