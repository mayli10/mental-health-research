If the current starts taking you offshore, there isn't much you can do about it. You're just adrift, subject to the currents of circumstances. No amount of you you you responsibility endowing is going to change that. If you are swimming in the ocean and get caught in a rip current which starts taking you out to sea, and are unable to fight the current, there isn't much you can do. Often there isn't anyone on the beach, actually there are, but they don't see you. You wave to them and shout, but they just wave back. They don't see that you're in trouble, and of those that do, most don't care. And of those that care, most can't swim. I'm not going to argue that we don't have a great deal of influence over our circumstances, but even the act of getting someone to realize that, or reminding them like many people on here do to not give up, is an act outside of the individual struggling. It is like throwing supplies over to the person in the water. And they will often say, well if you understand that, you shouldn't need me to tell you. That's bullshit. I ran out of hose particular supplies. I had fresh water, but ran out. So, you threw me a bottle. In the end, we need each other. Nobody has ever gone through life and whatever struggles they faced entirely, 100% alone. Even reading a book or looking at quotes that serve as motivation isn't entirely of that individual, since somebody wrote them for people like them. Nobody is self made. That is completely impossible. And even in the colloquial sense of the word, again, nobody is 100% the reason for the virtues in their life or their successes. If you were, all the food you eat, all the basic necessities you need, and all the work associated with creating the very blessings you have had to be done entirely by you. Going to work at a coffee shop and then using that money to buy groceries doesn't count. Somebody had to grow those crops. Somebody had to process them. Somebody had to transport them. Somebody had to present them. All you had to do was perform one task, get paid, and exchange that money for that final product, that is the fruit of the labor of many people. So nobody is self made. We are social beings that depend on each other for survival. You you you responsibility endowing is just another form of mutual support, since it encourages the other person, like giving someone 5 dollars to buy gas. But at a certain point it breaks down. Some problems aren't as simple as needing gas. Sometimes the currents are too strong and we need someone to come out and get us. At that point, no amount of your life is your responsibility rhetoric is going to matter, and if it does it is because that person ran out of steam and needed a boost.",False,False

That's such an awful thing to say. So no one can love me as I am? Why would you say that?!  yeah I hate this! that's like saying we all should be horrible to people who have low self esteem or something. wtf",False,False

Like when I say I want to get better what I mean is I want to stay scary skinny but still be able to eat and have energy. I know that’s not possible so here we are   I don’t understand why people feel the need to say that bc w a lot of mental illnesses ESP w eating disorders, just the way it develops and acts, we feel like we need it and it needs us and it’s not really a matter of wanting in the first place",False,False

Shit doesn't happen because someone just *wants* it bad enough.  Actual, actionable, practical solutions are required.  For example, if a person has a mental illness, they can't just *want* to not be mentally ill and have all their problems be solved.  Holy shit, if there was a pill I could take and just not have an ED anymore, I would overdose on it.  But there's not.  As a matter of fact, the people for whom the currently available palette of treatments ""works,"" are actually in the minority!  EDs are an illness for which there *isn't* a very good set of treatment options, and it's so utterly disingenuous and downright cruel to imply that a person who has one can just wish it away.",False,False

It's like telling people ""no one will love you until you can love yourself."" That's such an awful thing to say. So no one can love me as I am? Why would you say that?!  You deserve to feel better OP, whether you think you can get better or not. You need to be introduced to ways to get better before your brain can understand the alternative to being miserable. My depression got better when I went to therapy, not when I wished really really hard to be better. The fact that you're not getting better right now is not your fault and your parents are way off base.",False,False
