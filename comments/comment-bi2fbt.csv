I haven't bought anything there since the all new size thing came in, but I know that once I bought my regular size and they were more like one and a half sizes up.  It made me feel good until I tried the same size on somewhere else and they were  tight.  It's a headfuck.  It's kinda false advertising that they sell small sizes that aren't generally available but it's vanity sizing.  Saying that, I really don't know what it's like now. I only buy tights and socks there.  &amp;#x200B;  I keep wanting to do measurements of myself but it's been an obsession in the past I managed to kick.  I stick to elasticated waist skirts and use safety pins if I have to just so clothes shops don't start messing with my head.    &amp;#x200B;  HOPE YOUR DATE GOES GREAT BTW !",False,False
