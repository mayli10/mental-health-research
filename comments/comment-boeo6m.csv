My mother raised me for awhile by herself. She's always been tiny and I remember being self conscious and sucking my stomach in before I even started first grade. My mother has always commented on my weight and my eating habits and even recently while ordering my cap and gown they required me weight and I told her I was 165 and she sighed and said ""really?"" in a disappointed and disapproving tone. She has always been open about her eating habits which are clearly disordered and her exercise routine. My father is morbidly  obese and has also been open about his dieting and made a lot of comments on my body growing up and still does which grosses me out. My sister is a few years older than me and she took up my mother's habits and advice and made me diet with her and always commented on my weight and let me borrow her clothes and told me I stretched them all out whenever I returned them.",False,False

Asians have always cared about physical appearance, especially weight. Sadly, it‚Äôs common for your relatives to point out stuff that would probably be considered rude in other places, things like ‚Äúyou gained weight‚Äù ‚Äúyou look fat‚Äù ‚Äúyou should lose weight!‚Äù ""when did you get so tan?‚Äù ""you looked so much better before‚Äù and it wouldn‚Äôt be considered rude. Some say they know their relatives mean well, anyway.  Many people think Asians are skinny, but it also has something to do with serving sizes. Our serving sizes are much smaller than those in other countries. An Asian diet typically contains a lot of vegetables as well.   However, many Asians resort to fad diets for weight loss, such as not eating (because many parents tell their kids not to eat, so that they can lose weight). It‚Äôs so normalized here that people don‚Äôt realize how damaging it is to their health. What‚Äôs worse is that parents encourage their kids to do so. These parents believe losing weight = beautiful. It‚Äôs especially saddening to hear people talk about how they barely eat to lose weight to please their families and relatives, because you start to see how empty it makes them.  Also, I remember one celebrity (I don‚Äôt remember who, as I am not familiar with celebrities or jpop. Sorry) here in Japan posted a photo of her scale, showing her weight of 38kg (I don‚Äôt remember the exact number), and from what I hear people were amazed and idolized her. Despite her being underweight, no one seemed to show any worry or concern. Instead, they idolized her and said that they wanted to be as skinny as her.  Sorry if I had made any mistake in this comment, this is based on my experience as an Asian and experiences of others.",False,False

Unfortunately my dad is a 6'2 giant (I'm mixed) and I take after him. Combine that with my mom's expectations and you get a really stressful childhood.  My mom bought me diet books and pinched my fat all the time growing up. Her depression is partly because of her massive post-partum weight gain (even then she's only a size 8). The only bright side now is that she's the only person I trust to give me objective comments on my body instead of that bullshit ""everyone is beautiful"" crap that frankly, is just not true.",False,False

I agree with the whole thing where people would praise you for being so dedicated to your diet. I mostly do low carb so I stay away from rice, which is a main staple here, and people think it‚Äôs amazing that I do that - but they also preach that I‚Äôm starving myself or am being unhealthy because RiCe Is LIFe.

My mom has always trash-talked her tiny body and routinely ‚Äúforgets‚Äù meals, while diligently cooking healthily and making odd health-justified ingredient substitutions. She‚Äôs never been overweight in her life. She comments positively on my body when I lose weight, called me ‚Äúpainful looking‚Äù when I gained it, and noticed how tired and pale I was when I was rapidly losing weight.   My dad was overweight for most of his adult life but isn‚Äôt anymore. He is pretty candid about his low-carb lifestyle now that he has diabetes, but can be condescending about other people‚Äôs food choices. He has also made weird comments about my body (that I should have eyelid surgery to ‚Äúbecome prettier‚Äù or that I shouldn‚Äôt be overweight but that men like ‚Äúmeat on your bones.‚Äù ....cool, dad.   Any conversations about diets or food choices turn into them circlejerking about knowing better than other people about nutrition and losing weight. It reveals a lot of their insecurities to me and explains why I‚Äôve never had high self-esteem about my body.   They also binge eat on junk/fast food after eating exceedingly cleanly for arbitrary stretches of time, so I guess that‚Äôs where I learned that from. Yay.",False,False

My mother is very traditional and claims she doesn't uphold typical Korean stereotypes but she definitely does. She used to always hint at me (sometimes not so subtly) that I should lose some weight and she is pretty thin, definitely nothing ED related but she does watch her figure/complain about how she gains fat on her tummy area. The more I try to learn about the culture I missed out on (grew up with my American/European dad) the more self conscious I become.   But from my pretty Americanized POV Korean diet culture is so strange. 'Starving yourself' (aka crash diets and intense restriction) is a common way to lose weight and people critique each other pretty openly, not always harshly but bluntly. It seems like everybody is doing pilates, or some other kind of light exercise. But I feel to some extent it can be easier to stay at a healthier weight because Korean food is a lot simpler than traditional American meals; less fats and oils usually. It's not an everyday thing to eat fried foods but it's normal to eat it every so often. Of course, this is just a generalization of sorts but it's all based on things I've observed either firsthand or watched in videos.",False,False
