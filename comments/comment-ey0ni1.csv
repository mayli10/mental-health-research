I’m at a really good place in my life and all these cool things are happening but I can’t let myself be happy bc I’m wrapped up (alone) in this DUMB ED. I know you need an IRL support system, and god knows I do too, but I’m rooting for you dude. We deserve to recover. I hope you can find someone to open up to, mom or friend or therapist or whatever. Just saying words out loud will take a lot of pressure off. Good luck ❤️",False,False
