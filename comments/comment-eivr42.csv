Like 5,000+ cal/day binging. Like *cant* *stop* *eating*, *am* *I* *eating* *myself* *to* *death* type. Gained 40 lbs fairly quickly recently and that was already **on** **top** of a 50-70 lb weight gain between treatment and pregnancy. I stopped all restriction, all lax, all purging, etc. Now I just eat myself into oblivion and barely move. Its really sad, but I just keep doing it day after day. Anyway, you're not alone and if you ever need anyone to talk to I'm here.",False,False

BUT it is not irreversible (Iâ€™m down a good 60, with 40 to go to reach my UW goal again), and it is such a natural physical reaction after intense and prolonged restriction to feel like you need to eat constantly because your body is terrified!   itâ€™s going to be okay either way, regardless of what happens with your weight ðŸ’•",False,False

Firstly just wanted to say that expressing yourself with your clothes isn't vain at all, most people do it and it can be very subtle, but for many people clothes are part of your identity so it isn't out of the ordinary for you to want to express yourself in that way! Also, having an ED isn't vain. We can't control how we feel about food (because I know if we all could there would be a lot fewer people struggling! If you could choose then why would you choose to struggle?). As you know, EDs aren't just about being skinny and pretty, there's a lot of self hate, punishing yourself and feeling out of control; it's so so much more than just being vain about your body. It isn't your fault, and you shouldn't feel bad for having involuntary thoughts.  I know it doesn't mean much but sending virtual hugs! BED is horrible and feeling out of control is scary, but you're already fighting back because you want to change. And going vegan isn't always easy so you've made huge strides there! Even if you feel that you haven't done as well in other areas you should be proud of what you have achieved!",False,False
