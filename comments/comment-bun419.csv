People with lots of body fat have their veins a lot deeper, under the layer of subcutaneous fat. Drinking a lot of water will help veins pop, being very dry and dehydrated will make them hide.

I believe its normal maybe you notice it now because you lost a layer of fat making them more prominent through the skin. Make sure to stay hydrated and try to stay cool this summer ü§†üëç,False,False
