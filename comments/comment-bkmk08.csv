My boyfriend is a bartender and he’s so into beer. He doesn’t know I had an ED and I have to pretend to not like beer and I feel like I’m missing out sharing that passion with him. ED’s are terrible :( they take away all our joy,False,False

I swear to god even if I just drink a really small amount I don’t ‘lose’ weight the next day. It’s really frustrating because I LOVE beer and I want to be fun/impulsive with him,False,False

Beer is also my favorite, I love trying new microbrews and “fancy” beers, but recently have completely stopped. Unfortunately, EDs can and do affect every aspect of life :(   Now I stick to wine, and red is my favorite, but recently have switched to white cause less carbs/cals. Sigh. Stupid stupid brain.",False,False

However, since you describe it as a hobby, I find it a bit sad. Outside of alcohol, what are your meals made of? If you ingest few carbs, there will not be much to bloat, even with those in the beer themselves.  In fact, days in which I consumed almost nothing but did get a couple of pints in the evening gave me the best figure the next day, because of the dehydration. I won't condone getting your calories exclusively from it, merely eating low-carb.",False,False
