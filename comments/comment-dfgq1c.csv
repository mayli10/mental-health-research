I eat only when necessary for school/work and in very small portions. The most important part for me is that I plan and pack everything I will eat that day beforehand. Also, I make sure that I eat lean protein since it keeps me full for a while compared to other types of food.  Heres an example of my typical weekday:   For breakfast I'll either have coffee with a little milk or a pouch of konjac jelly (this is a type of korean diet food that is only 5-10 cals per pouch/~150 g).  For lunch, I pack 75 - 100 g of plain steamed chicken breast (sounds gross but I actually like it) and eat it right before I head into work. I usually work for about 5 hours and the chicken keeps me full for 5.5 hours so it works great for me.  For dinner, when my grandma prepares something for us I'll allow myself to eat a small bowl of it. Since she cooks us Korean food, which is typically pretty healthy, and doesn't use much salt/fat I feel okay about it. I also do not eat any rice/carbs with my meal. Also, I do not count or weigh out this type of meal. It helps keep me a little saner to have a small break every once in a while.   When it comes around to dinner time and my family is not eating together, which is the majority of the time, I will either not eat or have something small like 100 g of 0% greek yogurt.   On the weekends, I do not calorie count or try to control my meals. Since I'm with my family the whole time, I just eat small portions and try to eat as healthy as possible.
