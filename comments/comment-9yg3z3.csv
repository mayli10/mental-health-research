When you're short the weight has nowhere to go but horizontally. I have to maintain a smaller weight to not feel so heavy and slovenly. 5 lbs weight gain looks like 20.

But like in your a different way  There's a reason why I'm deathly afraid of weighing above a certain number because the minute I get even close I start to feel incredibly squashed and portly and unfeminine. I also share the same body type as my abuser (60% of my weight is carried on my front stomach and ass and it just disgusts me. I will NEVER have feminine proportions. I will never have a tiny waist and round hips. But I'd rather be thin toned flexible and small then squat and rolly.   I used to wish I could be tall so that I could eat more and stay even close to thin but I can't. Grass is browner am I right üôÉ,False,False

I'm not a POC, but I'm tall too and understand what it's like to never feel like you can be that dainty/delicate girl that can be neatly tucked under someone's arm (or god forbid swept up and carried without breaking 'em, ha).  I think one of the hardest things about being tall with an ED is that so much of this mental fuckery centers around wanting to take up less space, or wanting to be delicate and cared for, or a hundred other things that all somehow center around being thin and small and no matter how low your BMI gets, being tall will never equate to petite/tiny/""pretty"" in that sense.    &amp;#x200B;  BUT. I bet you'll hear from a lot of short gals on here about how much they wish they could be as tall as you. How tall women like you look more elegant in high boots, or how much they wish they had gorgeous long legs. Or heck, how nice it would be to have a higher TDEE to eat at maintenance with more treats (I take all the good news I can get, ha ha). It's so hard when you have a comparison like a sister right next to you, but I promise there are so, so many people out there that would love to have your height. It doesn't really help when you're feeling bad about yourself, and I'm definitely not trying to do the whole trite ""bE HaPpY WiTh wHat yOu HavE"" bullshit to you, but from one tall lady to another, I hope you can also sometimes see the special beauty that you have that comes with being a long-legged amazonian.  : ) ",False,False

I used to be bigger than both my sisters (one younger, one older). I was bigger than them for 11 years. I relied on makeup, which did not do much for my confidence and I compared myself to them constantly. My older sister, who is 5""4, was pregnant twice. The second pregnancy caused her to hit 190lbs and I still weighed more than her. Then she lost all of the pregnancy weight, hit 125 pounds and I reached a new HW of 205. I'm 5''8, 135 pounds now. I was fat and unconfident for so long that even now I feel like an ogre, especially when I'm around them. I feel hopeless, I feel fat. ",False,False
