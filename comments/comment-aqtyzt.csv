I've spent hundreds of dollars on food in the past month, just stocking up on things. I did it in part because there was at least a month long period where I would have c/s sessions two or three times a week that would last for two or three hours apiece, until my jaw was sore and my tongue was raw. I decided I might as well stock up on anything I was craving so I'd have options for each session. And now, for the past two or three weeks I only c/s maybe once or twice a week and each time it's only a little bit, like one sandwich or a granola bar and then I'm done. I'm glad that somehow I'm having fewer urges to c/s because I know it's bad and I really do think it's tied into me now having a giant stash of food that I bought specifically to c/s because I get panicky whenever I feel like I'm running out of food but I'm also really annoyed at myself that I have all this fucking food that's going to either get spit down the garbage disposal or may potentially never even be eaten because I don't have the urge to c/s anymore. This disorder has made me a horrible fucking person and my pantry is full of sugary cereal and cookies and non-diet ice creams that I won't feel safe actually eating unless (god forbid) I fall back into binging all the time like I used to.  - I miss being able to sleep through the night. I have a four day weekend because of President's Day which is super rare because normally between class and work it's impossible for me to get that many consecutive days off. I planned to sleep in a little today and set me alarm so I'd get eight and a half ~luxurious~ hours of sleep. And then, as usual, I woke up every two hours to stumble to the bathroom to pee, and now an hour before my alarm is meant to go off I've just given up and decided I'm awake for the day. I don't know if it was just my depression manifesting in a different way but back when I ate a lot/binged pretty frequently, I could sleep for ten hours straight no problem. Sure, I was more suicidal back then, and I actually kind of like that I seem to be functional on less sleep now, but sometimes I miss that.  - I don't know when my enjoyment of food and cooking waned but I'm pretty sad about it. Last semester, I looked forward to my weekly meal prep and loved coming up with new recipes to make. Over winter break, I switched over to OMAD so I could go all out making myself a bunch of delicious volume dinners and desserts every day and still restrict, and I got to try all sorts of new ingredients and ideas and it was the highlight of my day. Now, my meal prep is turning into basically the same foods every week, with recipes parsed down to be as easy and as quick as possible. The days I do OMAD, I usually end up eating the same combos of foods on loop. I don't dread cooking yet, but all my recipes are now about maximizing how much I can just microwave, or how much I can minimize dirtying pans that I'd have to hand wash. I wonder if I'll like food again like a normal person when I eventually switch over to maintaining. I just hate that I don't even love food like I used to and yet it's still all I think about.  - Speaking of constantly thinking about food, one of my big hobbies now, especially when I'm bored in class or on the treadmill, is to look up menus for vegan restaurants around the world and plan out what meals I'd get there. Usually I pick a meal for if I was restricting like I am now, and then I pick out a meal that I would have ordered back in my horrendous binging days. Sometimes I imagine that I go there with my former FWB who's a 6'5"" man who's told me he eats probably upwards of 3,000 calories a day, and I think of what I could order with him so that I could try a little bit and then make him eat the rest. I don't think I've eaten at a restaurant in like two months. I hope I hit my UGW, or even make it into the 130s (my UGW is 132 and then to maintain under 140) soonish so I can start working on fears like eating in restaurants because I'm going to be in Korea for almost a full month in April/May and I'm going to be eating at a lot of restaurants.",False,False
