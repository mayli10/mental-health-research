I think out of all three of them IOP was the most beneficial because it simulated real life the best out of all of them since I was still able to go about my everyday life. Inpatient is honestly a fucking vacation when I've done it, so it makes adjusting to real life worse. PHP is fine but I typically get super stressed out about what I'm missing.",False,False

Inpatient x2   Residential x5   PHP x4   IOP x6     I really don’t want this ED and hate what it does to my life. I’ve been attempting recovery since fall 2012.   Inpatient is the worst. Holyyyy snickerdoodle I hate it.    Residential is usually pretty great for me. I feel really motivated when it’s my only stuff going on. I go hard at this level of care and work through all kinds of stuff and feel protected from myself for once.    PHP usually sucks for me. I’m nearly always commuting for it and that makes me feel very tired and sick of treatment. I have a hard time going through step down and PHP usually pushes me back into trying to succeed with outpatient or it kicks me right back into a higher level of care due to the immeasurable amount of self loathing I feel when I have evenings alone to myself without true structure.    IOP has usually lead me to an upper level of care very quickly because I’m trying to get help but they tell me I need more help.    I have my second day of a new IOP tomorrow. They have this weird thing at this program where they tout the fact that usually their patients don’t need a higher level of care. I have a great full time job right now so I’m gonna try to push it out at the IOP level. Hopefully things will be different this time.....,False,False

This is spread across what I consider to be two rounds/attempts at treatment.   I hope to god that I NEVER need inpatient. But when I’m feeling overwhelmed and hopeless but still recovery-minded (aka exhausted trying to manage or battle my ED), sometimes I think residential would be good. Just cede control and know that there’s always someone there just in case I hve a freak out or health issue or whatever.   But then I think of all the things I love like work and family that I would have to give up. And that they’d be encouraging me to eat always aka no meals alone or in my control at all. And I would have a much harder time working out. And yeah fuck that bc it sounds awful too.   But yeah, I’m in a form of outpatient rn. I’ve only ever done outpatient levels of care.",False,False

I feel like I do better when I start in patient then go OP. If I go straight to OP I don’t take it as seriously. But then again I’ve only done IP when things were severe.  IP does help me make progress but I hated every moment because I have no freedom or control.,False,False

I had a really good program that helped me out a lot. At first, I hated it. It was terrible, and it made me act more on my behaviors. But after six months of it, I started to get better. Three years later I was fully recovered. I still struggle from time to time, but I had a good program that I was in. There was a lot of mindfulness, and I learned how to cope with negative thoughts and feelings in a healthy way and not an eating disorder.  Bad side is that it was really expensive and my parents had a hard time affording it.",False,False
