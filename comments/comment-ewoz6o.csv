When he picked up ice cream he even called to make sure the calorie count was something I'd eat too, and dealt with me crying over it lol  You're right that I'm annoyed at myself, not him. For relapsing, and for failing to relapse properly, and for caring about food so much. Poor guy. He tries so hard, and one casual sleepy comment can send me spinning anyway.",False,True

You want to scream at them about how much they don’t know, but you can’t because you don’t actually want them to know what they don’t know :)))   Then I realize that the person I’m really annoyed at is myself and I feel guilty about being irritated at my poor boyfriend who can’t help that his gf is a psycho",False,False
