I've utilized my school's mental health counselors. They're really good at advocating for students however necessary.  I've also used my school's disability resource center which gives me accommodations like getting more time for assignments as needed.  Also, my school has a rape crisis center which I'm sure helps students navigate exactly what you're going through.  If you're able, talk to your professors and academic advisor. Mine have all been *extremely* kind and understanding, willing to extend deadlines and give incompletes instead of Fs. I'm still completing courses from three years ago.   Even sending an email like, ""I am going through a challenging time right now and I'm currently seeking out appropriate help/resources. I have been unable to do work and I anticipate not being able to for a few weeks while I get back on my feet. I do not want this to affect my grade and would appreciate any support or accommodations you find reasonable. Thank you for your understanding,"" sooner rather than later -- better to get out ahead of it than try to explain your missing work after the fact.",False,False

Your school's mental health services can do the emailing for you if you give them permission. Mine just gave the heads-up that I was going through some stuff and the professors were great about it.

Please try not to  blame yourself. YOU ARE NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR ANYTHING THAT HAPPENED. Even I'd you feel like reporting it could have prevented violence, someone else actions are NOT your fault. You aren't responsible.  That said: you also do not need to explain anything to your professors. I would suggest contacting the counciling or health services office of your school. They will put you in touch with resources specifically set up to help you. And they will know how to help you.  I find that most professors are very accommodating if you tell them you have serious personal matters which are affecting you scholasticly. Tell them exactly what you need. As in, ""I will be unable to hand this assignment in on time. Can I hand the assignment in next Monday instead?"" You should have a solution in mind before visiting them/emailing. Remember that they have no vested interest in failing you. They WANT you to do well and will help you in the ways they can, as long as you are upfront.  That doesnt not mean you have to dish your whole story or tell them anything personal. Again,  support from student services should be able to help you have those conversations, as it can be very confontational and overwhelming. They know how to help you. You do not need to do this alone.  I hope this is helpful somehow.",False,False

Second, I'm going to tell you what I try to tell myself every day: There are all sorts of reasons why survivors may not report rape or sexual abuse, and it's not your fault that other people got hurt. I know how easy it is to feel ashamed and guilty about not coming forward, but no matter what our traumatized minds say to us, survivors aren't the ones at fault when this happens to other people. Rapists are the ones responsible for their actions, and they're the only ones who are to blame for the violence they choose to inflict on people.  Unfortunately it's been a while since I've been in school, but from what I remember most schools and professors should have information on what's allowed with regards to asking for extensions or academic consideration. Trauma and mental illness are almost always listed as valid reasons for this sort of thing, but whether or not they'll accept it is something else. As a starting point, I'd recommend looking up your school's policy with regards to these types of requests and going from there. And when contacting your professor, it might help to mention that you want to give them your best work but are unable to do that in the state you're currently in. (That's something that helped me get them on my side back in the day, at least.)",False,False

Classes are mandatory so I've never missed one or handed in an essay more than ten minutes late. Extensions are on a tutor-by-tutor basis. I might be able to get in to see one of them, would that be better? How specific do I have to be? Say ""I've been to the police to report a crime and it's taken a lot out of me"" or just ""personal issues sorry""?  Sorry, I'm just really all over the place. I think I just need a few extra days, because as soon as you finish one essay you start on the next so even if I get an extension I'll still have to work really hard to catch up.

You don‚Äôt need to tell them what happened, just that you expect to be ‚Äúout of action‚Äù for a week or more (it‚Äôs good to specify the amount of time you need). If you‚Äôre a relatively good student (you show up to class and do assigned work regularly) they should be understanding. You should look online to see if your university has a set procedure for asking or applying for extensions.
