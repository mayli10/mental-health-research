I train mostly maximal strength and endurance, but over this year I've done some ""vanity"" aka hypertrophy work as well, on the smaller muscles, since I wanted to make the most of gaining weight.   Right now I am just doing the same thing, only a bit less, because you don't need to train as much to maintain as you do to build, and I do a lot of functional stuff. I'm doing a lot of skill/endurance work in the new year.   I also do a shit ton of cardio, but that's just my preference. I run a lot because it is convenient, but I also do other things..",False,True
