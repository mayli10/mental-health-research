(Admitted at 89 lbs, released at 120 lbs, got back to 150 lbs, dropped back down to 116 more recently). I lost my period at my LW, got it back a few months after I was released from treatment. I can‚Äôt even tell if I lost my period anymore, since then, I got an IUD inserted. It makes me never have periods, and if it does, it‚Äôs only very very light spotting, and lasts for a day or two.",False,False

I told my mom after about 6 months and she took me to the doctor who ordered bloodwork. Long story short, I had a benign pituitary adenoma (non-cancerous brain tumor) making my brain secrete way too much prolactin (a hormone). My body was behaving like I'd just had a baby including [sorry for the tmi] painful lactation. Honestly, I thought it was just my changing body/puberty bs.   Luckily didn't need surgery. Just took a small dose of expensive medication 2x a week for years until it shrunk down to not existing anymore. My appetite evened out and I was totally okay until some bs started me on this ED path in my 20s...my point is, I wish I'd looked into it sooner. What's happening to you may or may not be something serious, but don't let a GP dismiss it. If I'd found out sooner I would have saggy stretch mark tits with no baby to show for it now and the symptoms/tumor could've gotten much worse and harder to treat. Take the medicine. Either go back and make that doctor listen or find one that doesn't make you feel like you have to pull teeth to get them to take you seriously. I've had luck in the past with female gynocologists mostly... I hope this helps!",False,False

But it doesn‚Äôt sound like you‚Äôre pregnant then lol! Especially with heavy restricting...so much physical and mental stress would not let that ..happen so easy üòÇ  But if you do decide to go back to a doctor, maybe mention that you‚Äôve been on a ‚Äúdiet‚Äù or something if you‚Äôre scared of them finding out about your ED and see how they react? Because if it is restriction keeping you from being fertile then that is yikes for having kids one day!  but yknow like I said ...I dunno how I‚Äôd deal with that myself because I can‚Äôt even see myself *trying* to reproduce if I‚Äôm not at a lower weight smh",False,False

I‚Äôve lost my period multiple times at a normal weight and underweight and it takes months and months for my body to regulate after severe restricting so even if I go through a binge cycle or eating at least maintenance it takes a while to get it back. I would definitely mention it again to your doctor just to be sure it‚Äôs not being caused by something else xx",False,False

She just said to have ""balanced healthy meals 3 times a day"" and I was like :) ok thanks will do :). I should probably say something but I'm really afraid of being forced to gain when I already feel like I weigh too much, yknow?   I'm starting to get paranoid that I'm actually pregnant but if I was already 3 months along I know I would have experienced some sort of symptoms and I would not be able to lose weight like I have been. Plus I think pregnancy tests don't lie. I'm CONFUSEDT!!!! 1!!",False,True

But anyway yeah that‚Äôs so weird!   Hmm. Did you tell the doctors you‚Äôd been heavily restricting? If not, I‚Äôm sure they‚Äôd warn you to eat more. But like you said, even if they did say that, not sure if that would happen!

I'm starting to think I have some kind of hormone imbalance. I haven't even gotten spotting but I've gotten ""symptoms"" like PMS and light cramping. Every time I think I'm gonna start my period, but I don't.  I was hardcore restricting for months, and I've lost a lot of weight rapidly but I'm not UW at all. I really need to have productive doctors visits but I just end up wasting money and it's frustrating. I thought maybe if I binged a shitton then I would suddenly start my period but I don't think its gonna happen lol.",False,True

Well...I‚Äôm on my ‚Äúperiod‚Äù right now but it‚Äôs occasional *LIGHT* spotting, and I used to have 8 day long periods that required buying two boxes of supers and maxi pads.   I‚Äôm not even near being UW but I‚Äôve had blackouts and trembling fits after only restricting for about a week.   It makes me feel invalid because I‚Äôm still eating a lot (?) and my body‚Äôs acting like it can‚Äôt function when there‚Äôs plenty of fat to go.   And I really want kids so??
