I also really dug it into my brain that you need to eat 3500 calories to gain even one pound so I can totally eat more every once in a while and not gain any noticeable amount of weight. I'm not afraid of food anymore. Still, I do often feel like I should eat less and I constantly want to be smaller.",False,False

My issue is actually just a control thing though, like I have a lot of anxiety and when I feel overwhelmed by that I will just heavily restrict my eating as a control thing. I actually like food and love to cook but I do often feel really anxious after I eat something heavy or greasy, I just normally don't worry before I eat it.",False,False

Then I went to restricting, the to b/p, then I did my ""health but phase"" of kinda-sorta eating enough but making damn well are that what I did eat was ""clean"" (that was actually when I had the most textbook ""ed thoughts"": I was neurotic about what and how I hate, with rituals, religious measurements, careful macro counts and many forbidden ingredients) and back to restricting and bingeing/purging. My official diagnosis is AN/BP but at times i've met the diagnostic criteria for purging disorder. I've had that ""I can just work it off"" mentality too, as well as subscribing passionately to the ""a calorie is a calorie"" mantra. a 220 calorie crunch bar isn't going to affect me any worse than a 220 calorie organic oatmeal bowl, so I don't discriminate between the two. I think part of it is rather than control, my eating disorder has always been more about seeking attention and infantilizing myself (I basically want to look as helpless as I feel) and, where b/p is concerned, distracting myself from painful thoughts.

Fears of contamination, inarticulate imaginings ofbad things happening at a cellular level, etc. Weight is also extremely important, but less so than feeling clean.  For me, the fear isn’t about calories, it’s about the moral purity of what I put in my body. I’ve binged on healthy food before and it’s horrible, but junk food at this point would make me suicidal. The scary thing is that there are some high-calorie “acceptable” foods I’ve developed anxiety around now, too... it’s like I don’t trust myself around them. I think that’s the fear.",False,False

They were small, they didn't taste great but it was the most food I'd had in a while so I kept eating it. When I did the research on the calories I realized that those small 8 little balls were over 1000 calories. I wanted to die.
