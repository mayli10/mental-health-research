Caffeine was seriously affecting my mood and I already have high anxiety so deep down I know I’m better off with little to none. To be honest I wish they were liquid happiness but I think I was worse off on energy drinks. The jaw clenching sounds super painful. Sending good thoughts.,False,True

(coffee and tea still have less caffeine than your average energy drink.) so yeah. it’s probably for the best that you don’t drink that stuff, tbh.",False,False
