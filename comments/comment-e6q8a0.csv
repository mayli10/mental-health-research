She had an ed since she was like 14 and I developed one later into our relationship. I wont go into details but it ended up not working out lmao. Had to break up with her. It really is a shame though cause she was and still is one of the most beautiful wonderful souls I've ever encountered. But when shit ain't workin it's not workin. If you think you can easily sustain/maintain a healthy relationship with food and eating while being with him then yall should keep vibing.. but if you think it's going to seriously come in the way of your health consistently then you know what to do sis. In life other people can be important but you yourself should always be the number one priority.,False,False
