I missed my dentist appointment because too much was happening.  You just have to do your best.  You got this.   I slip the same way you do, and trust me, it is hard, but you are strong; you got this!!",False,False

I thought I was in control of my eating but one slip and iâ€™m comfort/emotional eating again. I need to be stricter this week, starting today.   Thanks for your concern, I only purge once a week or sometimes twice a week if I have to, so iâ€™m hoping my teeth arenâ€™t too affected. I havenâ€™t been to the dentist in a while, I was planning to go this month but then I lost my job and couldnâ€™t afford it :(",False,True

I do worry about you purging though because it is bad for your throat and teeth, so stay safe, okay?  ",False,False
