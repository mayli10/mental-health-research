I get where you are coming from, and those with restrictive tendencies definitely should be careful. But those who stress binge, especially impulsively, may find delay techniques helpful. In reality, finding otherways of relieving the stress is the best way, but that is often much harder. Recognising when you're stress eating is the first step to breaking the habit.   I also agree with the people who commented about not keeping trigger foods in the house. Though that itself can be an ED behavior if you're not careful. I ended up buying snack packs because I was much better at stopping myself from eating 7 individual portions than 1 big bag of anything. I still have trouble with big bags and stopping at a healthy amount. But the little bags remind me what an ok a amount of food for a snack is without me having to weigh it out. ",False,False

I didn't mean to give any critique, I just wanted to remind you so that you or anyone who reads this would be able to identify the tendency if there was any risk for it! I did not mean any offense at all! What coping mechanisms are healthy and which are unhealthy can of course be very different for different people, and I just wanted to raise a warning finger and make people (hopefully) make a healthy decision this time. &lt;3",False,False

Ibhave a secondary condition (adhd) which makes me emotionally reactive and impulsive, so if I can identify that I am emotional, I recognize that I need to delay almost any action by a bit of time to prevent making poor choices (I wait until I'm calmer to decide to eat, I take some quiet time before discussing my feelings with my bf, etc). I don't delay food just because I'm hungry. I delay because I'm hungry AND angry. Because I don't always make good choices then and often regret them later. ",False,False

Instead of letting myself have that food right away, I would delay it. Do self-care instead - so, take a hot shower, have a cup of tea, get a healthy snack, drink some water. Then evaluate if I really wanted the food or if I was upset. The hardest part is finding an outlet for the anxious energy that helps but isn't food. You can't just ignore your feelings. But starting to process them can help stop the stress eating. ",False,False
