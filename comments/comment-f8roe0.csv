But wanting to look good and enjoy seeing yourself in the mirror and being pleased with and happy at how you look doesn't make you a bad person, and neither does having an ED, whatever it stems from. An ED is a mental illness and you can't 'give yourself' one or develop it because you have a particular personality trait. I know it's often easier to beat yourself up about developing an ED but that's not how it works, it's not your fault ‚ù§Ô∏è",False,False
