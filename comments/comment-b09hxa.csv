I didn’t have my first kiss until I was 18, or my first relationship/sexual experience until I was 20. Which I’m now thankful for because the person I had my first relationship/sex with is the same guy I’m still with now, three years later, and hopefully will be with for the rest of my life. It might suck now but it’s so much better than giving your heart away to someone that’s not right for you, ",False,False

In ten years he’ll probably be as busted as he is an asshole.  That beauty will fade and he’ll be a garbage heap.  If he had discreetly told a friend that he wasn’t into a girl who was your body type, that would be harder to deal with, I think.  But at least he had the decency to be a flaming fucking asshole right off the bat, so you can start using your logic to get over this crush.  If anyone else asks YOU if you’re dating, consider saying: “FUCK no.  We like the same kind of music, but he’s way too much of an asshole”",False,False

Anyway, I’m sorry that happened to you :/ There’s a part of me that wants to be thicc so I can get guys’ attention (yes, I depend on their validation), but the other part of me wants to be skinny-skinny so I can get attention from everyone???
