You probably know enough about nutrition already (Maybe in the future but I think a meal plan would probably sound horrifying and scare you away from recovery right now). You shouldn't be threatened into recovery. You need to tell your mom you dont know what to do and need to see a therapist. You need to work on the cause of the eating disorder and not *only* treat the symptoms. Your family threatened you bc they love you and dont know what else to do. Even though they have your best interests at heart they have no clue how to help you.   I wish I had done that when I was your age. I was so obsessed with food. I was chunky in middle school and lost 20lbs in 8th grade. Freshman year was constant bingeing and restricting (non purging bulimia). I gained some weight but I also got taller. I often wonder if I'd have bigger boobs or be taller if I hadnt starved myself during a key growth phase.   I struggled for years with dieting. It wasnt until I started throwing up that I realized I had actually had an eating disorder since I was 11 (BED). You have great self insight. Get help now. I wish I had. I always just thought i was just bad at dieting. I was very wrong. I had an eating disorder that severely impacted my social life and physical health. And guess what I still have yet to recover but I really only realized I do have a valid eating disorder a few years ago. And I've had one ever since puberty.,False,False

At the very least please see a therapist who specializes in eating disorders. I'd also reccomended group therapy. I hear DBT is good but I'm not really sure what it means.   I'm bulimic and 31. It sucks. I havent purged in like a month but I havent stopped bingeing and I'm back from just overweight to obese again. You dont want to be dealing with weight problems at this age. You want to be able to just maintain a healthy weight that doesnt require constant hypervigilance.,False,False
