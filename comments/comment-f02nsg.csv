I’m almost 20 and haven’t really been in a relationship (dated a bit but idk) so I feel kinda unwantable and it just sucks. Just thank you for putting out something so hopeful and kind into the world.,False,False

At then end of high school I had never dated, never even been flirted with to the best of my perception. I felt...deeply ‘other’ and unwanted. But a decade later, a wonderful and gentle human got down on one knee while “You are the Best Thing” played.   In our teens, we’re very much still...becoming. And granted, all of life is one grand becoming, but I think there’s a massive rearrangement in how we see our selves and how we interact socially between finishing high school and about age 25. We leave behind our forced cohort and begin to meet people who care about the things we personally care about - mutual interests or hobbies, shared priorities or enthusiasms or values. The physical form is always part of who we are...but I’ve been fortunate to meet people who live and interact as though it is just that - just one part, and not the most important part. Go find your people &lt;3",False,False
