They are only posting their positive results and not what goes on behind the scenes. Many of them could very well be struggling with an ED too; they just arent posting about it. Dont believe everything you see on the internet. People hide and lie all the time. Though they may appear ""normal"", they're only leading us to believe that.   Don't be ashamed and you are never a failure.",False,False
