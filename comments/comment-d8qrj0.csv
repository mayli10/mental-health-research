Your comment didnt come off as sarcastic or anything. It was just too on the point for me.  ""Dont call me out"" or similar things are online meme formats?? I'm not quite sure but I'm sorry for the confusion.  I also struggle between eating and not eating. I don't feel as much guilt when I eat nor calorie count. Mine comes in itnervals when I'm doing fine then suddenly triggered for a month. It depends on the days and even on good days purging and restricting appear on my mind.",False,False

EDNOS is what I was diagnosed with and at the time I just felt like I wasn't purging enough to be considered bulimic.

I didn’t qualify for a full diagnosis because I was doing a little bit of everything- some restricting, some binging, some purging. Enough that it was seriously fucking up my life and I wanted help, but I guess not enough for me to be underweight or receive a clinical diagnosis. I was “too healthy” for it. Umm, okay, so why not try to fix it then? Why did it have to get worse before I could get help? Feeling your pain here, hun ❤️",False,False
