I didn’t think I’d watch the whole video because it was so long, but I watched the entire thing and bawled my eyes out through it all. I’ve been attempting to recover but struggling to do so, and this video gave me that push to continue to do better and to keep doing my best to improve my health, especially for my son. I always think I’m not “sick enough”, both mentally and physically; especially during periods of attempting to eat at maintenance. Which makes me want to get worse before I get better, to “prove” something. But this quote from her really struck a chord with me: “You’re never ill enough. So if you don’t think you’re ill enough right now, you definitely are— because if you weren’t ill, you wouldn’t *want* to be ill.”",False,False
