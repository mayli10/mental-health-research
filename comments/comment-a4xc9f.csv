Obviously tons of protein, and I just season it however I like to keep things interesting. I also eat frozen veggies which last forever in the freezer and are super cheap. Good luck and be careful!

It can lead to Mercury poisoning.     As for going vegan, I personally would recommend against it. Most meat sources contain at least small amounts of every vitamin and mineral your body needs to function, this is not true for plant sources. If you went vegan you would have to eat more to get everything you need for your body.    I also think you're current diet is far too restrictive which is likely a major factor of your hair loss, why add another extremely restrictive diet on top of that?    I went vegan last year and it was hell on my body. Obviously everyone is different, but I truly think that restrictive diets like veganism can cause more damage than good if you have an eating disorder already.    I'd definitely encourage you to increase your calorie intake above 800kl at least as well as start taking a multivitamin.  ",False,False

Drink plenty of water and electrolytes, and eat tons of veggies. The good part with the vegan eating is that vegetables are really low calorie. Fruits Tend to have more calories so id stay away from bananas mostly and eat watermelon, strawberries and melon if you crave some glucose. ",False,False
