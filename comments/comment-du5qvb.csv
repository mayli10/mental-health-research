Started out overweight and starved myself to a normal weight. Over the course of a few years I put it back on and then some and now I’m starting over. I feel like as an adult it’s really hard to get help. Nobody sees what’s really going on, especially if you start out overweight.  This shit is really hard, I’m sorry you’re going through it right now.",False,False

I get freaked out if I go over 500 now.   Sorry you’re going through it too, it sucks :(   Thank-you, sending them right back!",False,True

I like the way I look more now and everyone I know does as well. It makes me so sad when I think about what I put myself through emotionally and physically.   The scary part is that I’m still restricting heavily and fasting. I want to lose more still even though I know I don’t *need* to. I am scared of eating like a normal person now. I am working on it though.   I’m so sorry you’re going through this. Please try to be kind to yourself because you deserve it. I hope we can both begin to heal. Sending internet hugs.,False,False
