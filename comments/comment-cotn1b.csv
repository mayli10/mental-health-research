Sometimes it smells like the stuff I just chewed but other times I feel like I can smell all the ingredients separately and the texture is sooo off-putting, I want it out of my sight as soon as it's out of my mouth because I feel so ashamed of myself.   But I definitely see how you'd want to sip it back into your mouth because c00kie smell and c000kie taste. Whyyy do cookies have to be so fkn gooood and comforting?!",False,False
