Careful, there’s gluten in basically everything, soy sauce... read every label.   Re-introduce after 3 weeks with 3-5 servings of gluten per day and see if you have a reaction. If you do, I’d go see your doc and see if they’ll test you for celiac. Hopefully it’s just a sensitivity though!",False,False
