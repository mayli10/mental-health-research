I realized I had a problem when I wanted to throw up after accidentally eating a spoonful of ice cream because it had high fructose corn syrup. Also I followed this extreme blog that acted like if you didn't eat all organic food you'll end up fat and sick. I agree that America is super unhealthy especially the area of the country that I live in. Eating healthy is not the norm and I'm going to continue to be different by trying to eat healthy, exercising, and not binging. I just don't want to be so obsessed with the cleanliness of my food. My ED was not just ortho. It was kind of a mix of all of them.",False,True
