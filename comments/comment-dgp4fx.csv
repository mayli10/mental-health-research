Gotta say body weight exercises (even pullups and chin ups) are way easier at a small weight. At a low bf% my muscles are easy to see.   Then I get torn because I'm at a weird mid point between the aesthetics I want. My arms and legs are disgustingly small for being the strong aesthetic.... but they're too muscular for the delicate aesthetic.   Then it also occurred to me that there's no way I'll ever be pleased with my body ü§¶üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è,False,False

I haven't lifted in months and I'm pretty bummed about it because it makes me feel great, but also it's kind of good that I'm not.  I would do the same thing you did - not restricting at all because I thought I needed all of those calories to get swole but I still just looked the same - fat.  I feel weaker now and that sucks but I just want to focus on losing and doing lighter exercise for now.
