You should be able to find out what they will and wont tell your parents. I highly doubt they will try to trick you. If you are still unsure/ they are not giving you straightforward answers and your parents knowing would do more harm then good (like theyd hit you, tease you, not take you seriously rather than being over caring and wanna put you into treatment) I'd wait a few months until you tell, but that may not still be the best advice.   What's CAHMs?",False,False

You're young and need support. Ask for a referral for a therapist. ,False,False
