LOL j/k  I mean... But really though, You really don't have to hang out with her if you don't want to. She sounds toxic TBH... And it feels like maybe she wants to get into a ""health"" war with you. (an ED war disguised as a ""health"" war.)  Do you really need this person back in your life after what she did?",False,False

As in: if you want her back into your life, and continue the friendship in the future. If yes, meet with her and see whats up. If no: you can politely decline. Like you can write it down to her, that you think the two of you have grown apart during the last few years, and seems different now, from the time when you were still on good terms. So you dont want to hurt her feelings, but feel that you two dont share any common interest and life experiences anymore, and it would make having a conversation harder? Or something like that you feel is true but not (too) hurtful. I think being honest is sometimes better than wearing a mask and pretending to be happy that you are meeting up, if you really dont want to.",False,False

I want nothing more than to drop 5 more lbs by Tuesday :/ I will put myself first but she‚Äôll be bugging me for weeks if I don‚Äôt do this. I think if I get through this quick lunch, I could be off the hook. And if she acts like this in person, I absolutely will not stand for it and I‚Äôll say something. I‚Äôm a lot more confident in myself and if I have to call her out I will.      I think the trick is to have everything planned out and don‚Äôt let her blindside me. Temporary suffering for long term relief, I guess.",False,True

If you can, try to get some space and distance yourself from what she said, and maybe think about why she said it. She probably is really insecure when she tells you that.  I have a friend and our situation is very similar, I also often want to tell her how much less I weigh than her etc. What helps me is thinking that she is actually not thinner than me. And that she just tries to justify her eating much. Gives me a sense of superiority.... Well I guess I am toxic lol:/ sorry I think that wasn't helpful at all.",False,False
