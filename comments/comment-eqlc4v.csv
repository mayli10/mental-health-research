Although, it doesn‚Äôt hurt to try but don‚Äôt spend all your time on it. :‚Äô) Good luck!",False,False

Idk, I'm sceptical too lol. But I'll still give it a try cause why not",False,True

The subliminal would have no effect on your body physically but if you truly believe that it works then you might make a semi-unconscious effort to lose weight then assume it was the subliminal. I don‚Äôt believe in it so I don‚Äôt bother but it is interesting to read the comments below the videos.,False,False

The only way anyone would actually lose weight listening to them is if they played them all day and didn't eat at all (and guess which one actually contributes to the loss, because it's not the video) Sorry that you're new to the sub and I'm being cynical off the bat but it's good to bust some myths",False,False
