I don't really think I have BD but when you said that I realized I don't think I look bigger than before but I definitely feel like I look the same as 30lbs ago. AND even thinking back to last year when I was 15lbs less than now and while I had a few more bones showing I was still just as soft/squishy/fat. I only like how I look after fasting for a while.,False,False
