I have also bleached and dyed it for years upon years and recently went back to my natural color to let it grow without ruining new growth. It falls out the most when I wash it, like big clumps. I don't know how I'm not bald yet.  I try to tell myself it only seems that way because I always wear my hair up, so rather than strands falling through out the day/s, they fall out all at once after I finally take it down to brush and wash it, so it seems like an alarming amount.",False,False

Started using Olaplex a few months ago because a (non ED) beauty YouTuber I like was raving about it and it’s been night and day. It’s still not *healthy* but it falls out way less and it’s shinier and thicker.",False,False
