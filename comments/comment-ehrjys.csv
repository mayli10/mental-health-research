They just want to see trends and general range. Sudden drop, large change? concern. Way over? Concern. Very low? concern. +/- 1-4 pounds? Doesn't matter, you could be a bit constipated, had some extra sodium, or dehydrated.  Also, the weight my doctor has me at from my last appointment is 15 pounds above the weight I was actually at that day. Don't worry about it.",False,False

A couple weeks ago I was admitted to the hospital through the ER, and by the time I was put in a room I had received a couple liters of iv fluids, so when they weighed me on the bed scale I wanted so badly to point that out. What made it worse was they wrote my weight on the white board in my room. So upsetting.",False,False
