Now I'm like 60 lbs lighter and super skinny in some parts but my fucking stomach and thighs seem like they haven't shrunk a bit. I'm a dude and kinda have a feminine body which wasn't really prevalent before. I have super prominent hips and ""hip dips"" which seems to not be common in guys and a somewhat hourglass type figure. It sucks.",False,False

My weight is technically healthy but like it‚Äôs ‚Äúhourglass‚Äù as in boobs to hip and upper waist/below ribs but I have like no ass and it‚Äôs like all on my stomach and boobs km   Adding on to that it always kills me to see people in progress pics where they‚Äôve lost weight but still weigh more than me at my height but look like 1000x better because of their fat distribution + working out (I assume) ughhhhh,False,False

Recovery has reorganized my fat so I now have this stupid belly that sticks out as far as my tits, but no ass (which I did have once upon a time). On my understanding this is pretty normal: allegedly the body recovering from starvation puts fat around the vital organs first. I've heard it's supposed to go back to normal after a while of consistent proper nourishment but I haven't seen it yet and it's been almost a year (minus, like, one week of restricting a month ago, but c'mon).",False,False

In some ways I think I looked at my best 10-15 pounds heavier. I know my husband found me more attractive than too. But the thought of gaining even a couple pounds terrifies me.
