Some part is purely logical. Every single person I know is in a relationship and same with all their partner's friends. I cannot network. My only option is online. I am simply too fat to have online dating be successful in finding a partner that is a) childless b) has a job and c) wants me d) mostly importantly, someone to whom I'm also attracted. People tell me all the time I can find someone. Ya, if i said okay to the homeless man who lives in my alley. I have 4 standards and I'm probably way too old to have the 1st standard if I also want the other ones.   My coworker was showing me her matches on tinder and she just signed up yesterday and already has a date. I'm such a failure as I'll never have that unless I lose 50lbs and work out compulsively. She even had a kid at 18 and can still find a date. But shes pretty. Average weight. Big boobs. Here I am old af, ugly, fat, and small boobs. Her showing off her success just made me feel like shit about myself.   I feel like I'm never gonna be thin and I will always have to live this embarrassing life of chronic singledom and ugliness. All my parent's friend's have grandkids. My family always asks if I'm dating someone. I swear they all think I'm a lesbian. I'd love more than anything to have a start a family and have regular life experiences. That is not an option for me unless I go to a sperm bank.   I feel like I have no choice in putting my life on hold now that I think about it. Men are repulsed by me. ",False,False

Especially when it comes to dating or going out with friends. It sucks because when I was at my GW, I was too stressed about maintaining it to go out. It's been a lose lose.",False,False

The only people who see me are coworkers, who may not notice gradual weight loss (they do but it‚Äôs not as ‚Äúdrastic‚Äù for them). My actual dream is to not go out for so long that people that I don‚Äôt see often will be like whoaaaa wtf she‚Äôs so skinny now!
