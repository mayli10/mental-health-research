Some individual places have scholarships through the clinic and sometimes they have a sliding scale based on income. It's not hopeless and you have options! As for telling your parents, if making sure they don't know or find out is your goal, then this is the point where you'd need to find an outpatient or more intensive way to approach your ED without residential. I'm not sure what that looks like for you, but I hope this helps a bit. Sending love &lt;3",False,False
