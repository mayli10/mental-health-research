Her weight was listed as 10lb below my GW and I immediately thought, NO my GW should be her weight bc she looks so pretty and happy. When in reality she's probably dead and I should be sad about that instead of agonizing over my GW. Like it matters that I choose now, when it will be 6 months at least until it is an issue.",False,False

I get odd looks from police and bouncers at nightclubs, but it is motivating.   Itâ€™s just a shame we have to get a new photo every 9 years here. Iâ€™ve got 4 more years of my fat face in wallet.   Heaven forbid if they ever use it on a missing person report though! Iâ€™ll never be found.",False,False

Sometimes it seems idealized, like a college students weight was based on the last time her mom knew her weight at like 16. Or like they estimated someoneâ€™s weight based on appearance. If I ever went missing they would prob base it on some form I had to complete in the last few years and I never write my real weight on those.",False,False
