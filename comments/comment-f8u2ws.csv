One of my patients is a manager for a Dominoes pizza and I asked her if the nutrition is accurate and if they have to weigh out everything before putting it on the pizza. She said her store only does it if they're being watched by corporate but if they're not, they just eyeball it and it could be any amount of calories. I think it depends on the store and how strict the owner/manager is. I do wish it was like Australia and other places where the nutritional info matters",False,True

One cup of soup? 30 cals per serving... 3 servings in the cup. What???? It's clearly a single serving wtf",False,False

I have to be careful how much icing I put on donuts when I'm decorating at work. Maybe look into it for the U.S.?,False,False

Like yeah, 50 grams of penne  might be what you claim, but Bobbo over in the kitchen uses two big handfuls and says ""yeah! that's great!""",False,False

It's more the kitchen staff's fault than the people who calculate the calories, though, because more often than not they're using more ingredients than they're supposed to. But it's also kinda tough to serve food quickly enough if you're weighing and adjusting stuff all the time.  I'd be a lot happier if they could list a range of possible calories on the menu instead of an exact number.",False,False

I had it last week and I was so excited to eat a low calorie pasta dish but when it arrived, I looked at the portion size and alarm bells started ringing lmao. Such a horrible practice by restaurants!",False,False
