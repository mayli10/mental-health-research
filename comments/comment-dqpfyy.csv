Sounds like ""control"" fits with the way your anxiety manifests.  I think it's similarly for myself. Over-eating for years was a form of control, too - compensating for years of being told what I could/couldn't eat, and rebelling against people who wanted me to starve because I was overweight. Now I just flipped the switch with just as much/as little control, but the same motivators, haha.  The main motivator for me right now is that I don't want to go back to being treated like I was when I was heavier. Even though I'm still overweight, I'm treated so much better now that it's alarming, and I hate it, and I don't think it's right, and I want to help attitudes change, but I also don't want to be there again. I can't.",False,False

I’m sure everyone does but I think I am just a bit more vain and have a bit of trauma to egg that on.
