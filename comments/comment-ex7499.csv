I'm not sure if you already know about  [r/safe\_food](https://www.reddit.com/r/safe_food) and [r/EDfood](https://www.reddit.com/r/EDfood), but try to take a look or even make the same post over theses subs, it may be more useful than my reply lmao",False,False

Has a ton of protein for the amount of calories and if you get the fortified stuff you won't have to worry as much about vitamins. I eat a lot of roasted veggies and beans for my meals, and I try to eat at least one thing per meal that's high in good fats so I'll be fuller for longer. Avocados are my fave.",False,False

If you buy it as a dry powder (I found it at Whole Foods) it’s 120 calories for like under 5g carbs, and 23g protein. I can’t give any tips on cooking it because I hate flavor/have no taste buds, but it’s used a lot for making meat replacement dishes.",False,False
