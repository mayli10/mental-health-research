I’ve been going on and off an EC stack for awhile and it actually benefits my focus (especially on school) a LOT, but I mainly first tried it for weight loss. Well first round worked like a charm, and I got to my LW. But lately, it’s sucked and by the second week I just start to get bingey again.   The most important thing really, is mindset and focus. When I’m in a binge mode I will be super bingey without the stack and just slightly bingey with it. Keeping VERY occupied and sort of retraining yourself not to associate the meds with binging has helped me in this case.",False,False

When i was diagnosed with PCOS at 16 my doctor gave me metformin and told me it would help with both problems. It didnt AT ALL. And the knowledge that I should be losing, and gaining instead tanked me into a terrible depression that I coped with by binging every day. I gained 80lbs in a year on that med and started losing when I got off.  I hope your adhd medicine helps your mental state, try not to focus on appetite or weight in that regard. I know its so so hard but if you can manage to separate ed thoughts from adhd management it will help both. Sending love 💕 im sorry you have to deal with this💖",False,False
