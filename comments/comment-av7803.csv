Or maybe he thought it was drugs or something else and when he realized it was an ED he didn’t know how to handle the issue.  Either way by the sounds of it you’re doing better now, you’re not better but you’re in and out of recovery which is better than where you were and that’s why I’d tell him. “I’m doing better now than I was back then”.

I actually experienced something remarkably similar with my own parents, and as an adult I've had to accept that there are just some things we can't openly discuss. It is too much for them.  I think it's best to do/say whatever you can that will reassure your dad and leave him at peace. The past cannot be changed. There is no point in stirring up powerful emotions — guilt, sadness, pain... now is not the time for either of you to revive or process those feelings.   I don't know your dad, but it sounds like your behavior back in high school made a lasting impression on him. Why do parents read their kids' diaries? Often because they're worried. Why would he bring it up now? Maybe because he still feels a twinge of pain over that memory.  I would ask yourself what you would hope to achieve by being honest with him. It might be a weight off your chest, but would you simply be passing the burden on to him? I can't tell you the right thing to do, but if it were me, I think I'd want to spare my dad any sense of guilt or pain and just do whatever I could to make him happy. Letting him feel bad now doesn't do anything for either of you, in your past or present selves.  I'm really sorry you're in this situation. ",False,False
