It was more melancholy than I expected, but really good (idk, usually I expect short stories to be really shocking but this one was just kind of sad). One of the most moving parts was when the narrator described how she felt herself becoming “fat” so that everything else seemed so small. I thought that was a really good insight into why the fat man might be how he is. It was also pretty poignant how her friend brushed off the narrators story because she didn’t really get it. Kind of how most people don’t understand EDs, and how they just act like it’s some weird choice that people make. I’d love to hear your thoughts on it and what you want to share it with people!   (Also, since I thought it’d be good to mention: TW for sexual assault. It’s not overly explicit, but just fair warning for anyone who’s looking to avoid those things in media)",False,False
