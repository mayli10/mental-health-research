I'm trying to do it now, I already started to mention that my stomach is sick so people won't question it lmfao. Eggs, fruit and vegetables, dairy. If you're constipated try epsom salt, I feel like I recommend it a lot here but it's great, it doesn't hurt and is cheap as fuck plus it's good for muscle aches if you use it in a bath. Good luck dude the holidays are getting to all of us, I've gained an inch+ on all my measurements and feel like a mushy pear.",False,False
