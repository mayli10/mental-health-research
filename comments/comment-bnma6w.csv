To walk up a flight of stairs without stopping? To run your fingers through your hair and feel softness, not coarse, limp string?  How does it feel for your heart to beat confidently? To exist with conviction and to work with the body that spends every second of every day keeping you alive? To have a brain able to work at its full capacity of thought and emotion?  How does it feel to not be shivering all the time? To be able to remember things clearly? To be awake and alert throughout the day and actually hold a conversation?  You have every right to do more than just exist- exist for joy and love and fulfilment and to gain something from your life, not just lose weight.  Think of what it is like for your body to be nourished and tended to and ask yourself, how does it feel to live?",False,False

The scales are a huge trigger for me too. I’m actually lifting weights at the gym so if I do gain I can tell myself it’s most likely muscle. Also I’m still controlling my eating, it’s just not as restrictive, which eases my anxiety a bit, but obviously the fear is still there.   You are doing really well do far, and you can continue to do well and get healthy. And if you do happen to relapse, there is nothing stopping you from recovering again, you can do it.   Some people with eating disorders do recover so it’s possible.  Think of your heart, it will get stronger and have the energy it needs to function properly. Your hair, skin, nails etc will look amazing and healthy. Dizziness when standing will soon go, you can have more energy to do things, you also may notice your mental health *in general* getting better because your body has the nutrients it needs.  Don’t give up!",False,False
