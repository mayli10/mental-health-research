Like why can’t I just be hungry and eat like a normal person. I did some cardio this week and I’m out of my diuretic pills (for my blood pressure) so I think the scale creeped up because of that. I know that eating a lean cuisine isn’t going to set me back.   So today I allowed myself to have breakfast which I never do and I don’t feel too guilty about it. It’s been a busy work week too so maybe I’m just stressed a little.   Thanks for listening. We can do it!,False,True
