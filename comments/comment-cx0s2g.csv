I didn't lose weight ever since my ED re-appeared in my life a few months ago. I even may have gained like 1-2 kg. But I've been stressing my body out with these binge/restict cycles quite heavily, so I assume that must be it.   Sometimes I feel like I am just about to get my period. The bloating, the cramps and everything... And instead of paying attention to eating right, I start restricting because ""the bloat is making me feel ugly and uncomfortable"". Like, the fuck is wrong with me?! I know what I am doing is terrible, I just can't seem to get back in control.",False,False

Not having your period can have long term consequences, as is a sign that your hormones and metabolism's pretty out of whack.  You don't have to be clinically underweight to be sick enough; your body's deprived right now and you deserve to get help. And I know that some people might restrict lower but 1200 calories is objectively already much *much* lower that what you need.   Take care :(",False,False
