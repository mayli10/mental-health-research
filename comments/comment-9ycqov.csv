But all the choices in the vending machine were basically the most unhealthy snack options, like poptarts and chips. It was weird",False,False

While nuts and avocado are HIGH AF in calories, they are healthy in the sense that I'm getting the micronutrients my body needs and not just energy (calories).  However, stickies like this talking about just calories irk me because yeah you can lose weight on just Twinkies but your body will still suffer unless you take a multivitamin.  On another note, every time I tell my bf how many calories something has, his eyes go super wide, he says wow (non sarcastically) and still eats it lmao ",False,False
