Heck yes.   But it doesn't render other intellectual accomplishments null. I am not any worse at my job because I put on 20 lbs since my ~skinny~ days. And I won't have suddenly raised my IQ by dropping that weight. (But Imma fuckin keep trying yo)  I think this is just one of those ED brain thoughts. It's supported by media portrayal.
