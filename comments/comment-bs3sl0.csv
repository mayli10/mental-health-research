I stopped seeing my psychiatrist cause I felt like my mental symptoms were ignored and it was all about physical side affects, 15 minute meeting, in and out",False,False

Itâ€™s helped me stop needing to obsessively document things (including my literally eight different spreadsheets related to weight, body measurements, food, calories, etc). I made it very clear to my psychiatrist that I would not take anything that had weight related side effects.",False,False

My eating disorder mostly stems from OCD and taking luvox has almost completely fixed my ED behaviors. I can also definitely tell when I miss a dose because I'll starve/purge without even really thinking about it.",False,False

I'm diagnosed with BPD and for me, meds at best give about a 20% boost, so overall it's been therapy (specifically DBT) that has been the biggest help.  &amp;#x200B;  Fwiw, I'm in the US and have had much better experiences seeing APRNs for psych meds versus seeing true psychiatrists. The APRNs have all the training around prescribing psych meds but they actually seem to take time to really listen to me.",False,False

I'm taking fluoxetine for depression and anxiety and it has made a huge difference. To address any skepticism, I was skeptical too. In fact, at the time my GP first recommended going on an anti-depressant I outright refused. I was adamant that I would not go on them and that if I did they wouldn't work. And funny enough the first anti-depressant I tried (GP prescribed a really uncommon one for some reason, mirtazapine) did not work for me. However I switched doctors and meds to fluoxetine and it has been a world of a difference. I'm not sure what specifically you would need or what it would be for but I think it is worth a try if you or your doctor believes that you could fall into the group of people that these meds are meant to help. Good luck to you :)",False,False
