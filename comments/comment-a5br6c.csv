Before my ED I didnt notice my best friend gained 50+ lbs until she mentioned it, and another friend had lost 30 and I was completely oblivious. Not that they didn't look different, it's just that in day-to-day we don't notice the little increments. Now. I can pinpoint when anyone in my life gains or loses 5lbs. It's horrible.  My weightloss has been drastic, so my family started making comments about 30 lbs in and still say something every 10 or so pounds. Classmates and coworkers didn't start making comments until I got under 200 lbs, and only really in 20 lb increments. ",False,False
