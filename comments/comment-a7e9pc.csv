BUT you definitely need to talk to a doctor. You can call your insurance and see if anyone around you is in your network and go to them or check out clinics around you. Maybe talk to your boyfriend and his mom see if they can help you out? I had to pay 100% of my visits for a while (I have shit insurance), and they never exceeded $200, including some tests. Your health is worth it.",False,False
