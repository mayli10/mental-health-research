I lost 30kg in 2017, but I never noticed any changes. I still se myself the same way. I have some pictures from that time, I look at them and see the same body I have now (which is not possible because I can't wear my old clothes anymore).  I have one picture a classmate took of me a few weeks ago and my legs look slim, and I can't stop looking at it.
