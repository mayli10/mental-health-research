The meds improve my ADHD symptoms (compared to when I don‚Äôt take them), but unfortunately that feeling of insecurity remains with me. Fear of always screwing up, wondering if anyone truly likes me, feeling smart on the inside but dumb in my actions, and trying to appear perfect to compensate for all the ways in which I actually have screwed up or not met exceptions over the years... ugh that stuff is all still with me, mostly manifesting now in the form of this eating disorder. But at least life in general is feeling somewhat easier. I‚Äôm struggling less than I was a few years ago to keep up with daily life, so it‚Äôs a start. I guess we just have to keep taking little steps and try not to be so hard on ourselves. It helps to know we‚Äôre not alone with this &lt;3 ",False,False

My first doctor literally gave my mom a pamphlet to fill out for my diagnosis, and it had questions like ""is your child unable to correctly hold scissors during arts and crafts?"" and ""Does your child color within the lines?""

I had the same problem with my diagnosis. Went from specialist to specialist until I found a neurologist that finally listened to me and derived me to someone who worked with adults.

I've always been overweight, which I recently discovered is because I have inattentive ADD. I sought a diagnosis for years but my previous doctor was under the impression that only ADHD existed, and that a fat adult could not have it, and especially not a fat woman (don't even get me started on the fact that the symptoms of ADD/ADHD were only studied in men and boys until recently). She honestly thought I was scamming for drugs.   My new doctor told me that I do have ADD, and I use binging to sort of focus on one thing (food, like you said). It makes me feel a lot better to know that it's not just a matter of willpower and that my mental hunger has a cause. Medication has been instrumental in curbing binges. However, I still have other parts of my eating disorder and I still binge depending on how my day is. So obviously it has its roots in other parts of my development, but ADD was sort of the catalyst for it. ",False,False

Forgetting things, losing things, talking too fast, not quite fitting in with the norm - I feel so much shame about the way I am.
