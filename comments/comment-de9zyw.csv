Mustard is zero calories you can't tell me otherwise if it's just regular mustard, not exactly sour? but it has flavor and sodium and sometimes that sodium is really useful if I feel woozy. Part of me wonders if it's one of those things that triggers fullness because I know like apple cider vinegar is said to help someone feel not as hungry because it can be a stomach irritant but I could be remembering what I read wrong.",False,False

So many of the things we consider meals are definitely looked at as ‚Äúmeals??‚Äù by others.   The deeper I get into a relapse, the more warped my perception gets. (Following stuff about fasting really doesn‚Äôt help with that either.)  (Also what is it with mustard being such a quintessential ed food? I‚Äôve eaten spoonfuls of it throughout the day before, it‚Äôs amazing. That and pickles and brine... mmmm)",False,False

Planning your meal all day and then having to wait for the kitchen. My only suggestions are maybe get a small slow cooker, sous vide or maybe do a meal prep with a couple days worth of food so you just have to re-heat it. I know those all suck compared to just having the kitchen but what can you do.",False,False
