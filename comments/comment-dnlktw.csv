Idk) and Ceonometer says I was 108 in late August too, but idk if I lost anything or not. I was staying with my dad for a couple weeks because I had a computer emergency while visiting for Thanksgiving and needed help fixing it. I had almost 0 fiber the whole time I was there though. Had a bunch the past two days and finally had a bm I was waiting for. But now I'm at home and can't weigh myself :( But same thing as you of course. Underweight and yet still get told I'm not unhealthy enough. That doctor literally just told me to consume more fiber. At the time I was eating mega fiber in my diet. It didn't help. Ended up being too sick to keep up that meal plan though. I'm thinking of getting a fiber supplement.  I don't even recall my regular doctor reacting when I told her I thought I had an eating disorder like 2 years ago. She just weighs me occasionally and sometimes mentions it if she thinks it's relevant. I don't feel like she thinks it's a big deal though. When I first told her I was only eating like a pack of instant noodles every day or a box of mac and cheese on days where I was too starved. So like 300 calories on an average day or around 850 on mac and cheese days. I lost 30 lbs so quickly and that didn't seem to be too concerning. I was hardly more than 130 to begin with. Idk why no one seems to really care about people with eating disorders.",False,False

This people who are supposed to help you end up being more triggering than anything else. I remember how the first psychology I ever went was all like ""YO, fruits, veggies, no fat, no cola, I'm healthy, go get your brocoli girl!"" like if it wasn't what I was doing in first place????  Oh!, she told me as well that I didn't looked that sick (I was 110 lbs at that time) so well guess I die amirite? :)  Ugh, I have that feeling too. That I might have fucked up something with my body and I CAN'T EAT ANYMORE. And it's not like I could go and tell someone.   Ah, this really made feel a little bit better. If you don't mind, whenever you feel like venting/talking you could talk to me, I'm always here to listen &lt;3",False,False

I can hardly eat now even when I want to because I end up in pain :( so I got it in my head that eating less is good. Then a doctor who was supposed to help me said that he wouldn't because I wasn't like 100 lbs so he wasn't concerned which made me associate losing weight with getting healthier. Butbthat's dumb because I'm the same BMI as a girl of average height would be at 100 lbs so I'm already exactly as underweight as he thinks I should be. Doesn't stop me from wanting to lose more weight though :(  Idk why people suck so much. I just want to be healthy and it seems people either want to shame me for being unhealthy or tell me I'm not unhealthy enough for my problems to matter. Well, either one of those or they just see being thin as good because ""*fat is bad*"" and they praise me for it. As if I have any control over my weight.",False,False

I know how comments like this can damage us a lot. It's so hard that someone who hasn't experienced disordered eating could understand a fraction of what we put ourselves through, of what this illness makes us do.   I hope you can get better.

I get kind of defensive about it. One time a girl replied to a post I made in a Discord server's fashion channel with just ""eat food"" and it just set me off. I did my best to respond rationally and explained that I actually did try gaining weight but ended up getting sick and spending a night in the hospital because of it and how it isn't cool to judge people for their weight. I think I lost like 10 lbs shortly after that night and I was kind of feeling bad about failing to recover even when I was okay mentally at the time. Now I kind of relapsed though and finding out I haven't lost any weight since then was not fun üôÉ",False,False
