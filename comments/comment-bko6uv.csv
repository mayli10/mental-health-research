But I DON‚ÄôT break eye contact and my voice gets deeper rather than higher pitched. And I get loud. I seriously PROJECT when I‚Äôm angrily enforcing a boundary. I personally think it‚Äôs okay if you start to cry. The other person may try to make fun of it. I ignore that attempt to get me distracted and repeat my boundary. And your post has helped ME. I just had to enforce a boundary and may even have to have a confrontation over it soon. I‚Äôm not gonna allow myself to be manipulated into backing down though. I know that‚Äôs what they want of me. I also remind myself ‚ÄúThey never liked me and weren‚Äôt gonna start just because I allowed them to make me a pushover today.‚Äù Even with family. I‚Äôve come to accept that some of them don‚Äôt like me and never fucking did. Some people are cruel to their own kin. Big hugs. And you didn‚Äôt ‚Äúchicken out.‚Äù You chose not to verbally engage. üíôüíôüíô,False,False

I had some anxiety issues developing around that time. I was on vacation visiting her house and... long story short it ended with her calling me a ""psycho"", saying I shouldn't be around my cousins (because yes, kids with anxiety are very dangerous /s) and it was like a switch had flipped. Constant negative comments and refusing to visit. My younger cousins are starting to be around that age and I'm terrified that she'll start to treat them the same way.",False,True

I'm probably a good 10 years older than most people on this subreddit, and the size 6 jeans I wore in middle school are smaller than some of the size 2 jeans I have in my closet. Vanity sizing means small sizes are WAY bigger than they used to be.

Your gma is hardcore projecting. Like... I don't remember the last time someone's insecurity oozed off the screen as much as it does with stories about her. She just seems like the most vindictive, calloused, paranoid asshole in the world. She wants to control you bc she doesn't have control over anything else.  I know that doesn't undo the damage she's caused but christ, she's a fucking loser. At least you know you'll never end up like her.
