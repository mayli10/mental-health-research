The entire episode was disgusting. It was the most classic narcissistic mother and only daughter situation ever. I don't think Dr Phil has any understanding of how insidious this dynamic is. Probably the worst kind of abuse because it is your MOTHER, they love you as you are growing up then stop caring about you when you become an inconvenience. No one else sees because that's how narcissistic parents work. You end up isolating yourself out of fear that no one will understand you and then they win. It's really sad actually because there is happy ending. The only way for a narcissistic mother to notice their child is if they're making her look bad. However they face even more backlash if they outshine her. I hope she has support enough to do the latter because although her mother may never be truly happy for her, at least she's not punishing herself.  I find it even more confusing that Dr Phil can't understand this because his single cross to bare is that, in his father's entire life, he never said ""I'm proud of you"". It's basically that but they tell others they're proud of you to look good.   Someone please find her social media.",False,False
