It’s risky and not super effective I don’t think. I also heard they don’t do much aftercare with the patients. Im not surprised that so few of them don’t succeed long term,False,False

But it bugs me that they seem to think of therapy as an afterthought to losing the weight when the weight seems to always be linked to some emotional trauma. Also, at the start when it’s says “only 5% of people succeed long term”. Like, maybe what you’re doing as “professionals” isn’t working then and you should rethink. ",False,False
