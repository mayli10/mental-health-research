I wouldn't be able to do that."" And it makes me feel so uncomfortable.  I have to wonder when people comment and compliment on other's bodies if they realise that they are making said person uncomfortable? Or if they aren't even aware of it? Especially older women, who tend to make these comments the most.",False,False

I think it is a bit shitty to compliment you, but then make bad comments about themselves, because they put in a weird situation - accept the compliment, but you have to give them a compliment back... maybe just say ''you look amazing too'' or something.",False,False
