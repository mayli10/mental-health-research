My brain just goes on fire seeing a big goal that seems so unattainable from where I currently am. But it's a goal and there's in between steps to take,False,True

You can work toward being able to eat a healthy meal without binging or purging. You don't have to be able to do it yet, that's why it's a goal, and you can start small, you know? It's just a positive, healthy direction to move towards.",False,False

I struggle with those goals hourly most days. It better than it was when I first started but I still have a long way to go and I relapsed hard over the holidays and I am still digging myself out of it still.

I guess reframing the way I see food would be important.   I guess possible goals here are scary af because they're really hard to imagine myself doing, thus pointless. I also see this part of recovering as the biggest threat to my ED, so it's just hard to accept wanting these things all the time.",False,True
