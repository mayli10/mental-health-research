I think it's more likely that EDs just mess with your relationship with food to the point where is either restriction or indulgence, and therefor recovery can lead to more weight gain that intended. However, if you gain a lot of weight during recovery, it is going to be possible to lose it in a way that doesn't require extreme restriction.",False,False

I was overweight, developed an eating disorder somewhere between AN and BN, got to a healthy weight and once I got into a relationship and tried to recovery developed BED badly. Went to the doctor about a week ago and she told me I'm at the highest bmi they've ever recorded me at and I'm at risk for a bajillion health problems. I relapsed and have barely eaten since she told me. It doesn't help that I have PCOS so even with heavy restricting they just think I'm on a normal diet since I lose weight so slowly",False,False

It makes no sense that starvation improves our ability to store fat cus then wouldnt it be evolutionarily beneficial to starve?,False,False

When I'm in recovery I gain like **9.1 kilograms**. And it does not look good at all, trust me. And I wish I could go back to restricting.

We fuck up our bodies and metabolisms to the point that when we finally do eat a consistently ""normal"" amount, our bodies hold onto it for dear life and so I think many recovered people end up at higher weights than if they had never engaged in eating disordered behavior at all.      Plus, I've read how many people who first have AN/BN develop BED during the recovery process and that also causes people to end up at higher weights than they would've otherwise.     Recovery is hard af and I might just be in an awful state of mind right now but real recovery (like not having any eating disordered symptoms/behaviors at all) just doesn't seem like it's a possibility for everyone.",False,False
