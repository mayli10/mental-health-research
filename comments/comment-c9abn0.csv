It just stung how he made lots of points about how big I had gotten and how 'gross' it was. Im finding a new crush tho lol",False,True

I'm so glad I met my SO when I was still overweight - he's said that even if I did gain all that weight back (God forbid tho), he'd still love me just the same. I feel like it would be a lot more difficult to find someone like that if I started dating now.  Also yeah, there seems to be a subset of guys who are upset at the fact overweight women exist. Just...don't date overweight women, then? No need to insult anyone because you're not attracted to them.",False,False

I've concluded that men who are vocally fussy about weight instead of just not dating people they aren't attracted to are assholes.  You deserve someone who loves you as you are.,False,False

I think it’s worse because he knows OP as a person. This wasn’t some tinder date. And in any case, totally unnecessary for him to reference to her body in any context, and it’s especially thoughtless in this one. Sounds to me like he ain’t shit.",False,False

But you said that if he bases his feelings on how the OP looks, he isn’t shit. That’s simply not true. Everyone’s allowed to have attraction preferences without being “not shit”.",False,False

If someone bases their feelings for you on how your body looks, they ain’t shit, and they want you for all the wrong reasons. You dodged a bullet because that dude sounds like a major douche. 😡😡😡 In fact, I’ll fight him for you.",False,False
