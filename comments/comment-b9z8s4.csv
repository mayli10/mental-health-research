Self criticism and possible dysmorphia makes it hard for me to be more specific as I’m really only familiar with my weight and measurements).   I can’t tell you for sure that your experience will be the same. In all likelihood, there will be a variety of bodytypes there though. Eating disorders affect people of all weights and don’t even affect everyone’s weight in the same way. People there should know that more than anyone and if they are ignorant, they’ll learn during the course of their treatment.  I know I don’t know you, but let me just say I’m proud of you taking this step for yourself! Eating disorder can destroy your body at any weight and you deserve better than what your ED causes you. Treatment can be scary especially if you don’t feel sick enough or you feel too big to be there, but it’s nothing compared to not trying recovery. (Also, neither sentiment is rare to feel, regardless of size).  I can’t really think of anything to write in terms of stories or advice, but I’m more than happy to answer any questions here or on dm!",False,False
