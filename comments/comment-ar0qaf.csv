Second of all, the pure vitriol that Iâ€™ve seen being directed toward the people doing their best to give us a FREE platform that they donâ€™t make money off of (no ads, no in-app purchases) is disgusting. They have ZERO obligation to take time out of their own lives to bring Peach back to life. Sure, it sucks not having Peach. I desperately want it back. In all honesty Iâ€™ve been less stable and less productive since itâ€™s gone down. But complaining and getting mad at the developers isnâ€™t going to make the work they have to do any easier or less time consuming, and honestly if I were in their shoes it would just piss me off and Iâ€™d take even longer or lose interest in resurrecting it entirely.  So fuck off with this entitled attitude (although this post in particular I understand is mostly personal frustration, and I donâ€™t begrudge you for that, this is just a rant on the general attitude Iâ€™ve seen surrounding this whole ordeal) - they donâ€™t owe us anything, and we should be grateful that theyâ€™re putting the work in to do this at all.",False,False

Honestly, as a professional software engineer, I suspect someone accidentally hosed their DB instance and they never tested their DR plan. It goes down often enough that I think the main app is some autoscaling group that has to be kicked over every few weeks (which is why emailing them works), but things got a bit trickier than that this time.",False,False
