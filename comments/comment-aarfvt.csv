ecvslzy,t3_aarfvt,t3_aarfvt,tigerchik,1,2018-12-30 11:15:34,/r/EDAnonymous/comments/aarfvt/one_month/ecvslzy/,can you say more about why you're ashamed of struggling? It's okay to struggle. Recovery is SO hard. It is the hardest.   Glad you are doing a bit better. That's awesome! And your'e MORE than passing your courses - I'm a college prof - those are great grades. So much better than just passing. ,False,False

Seriously a lot of ground was covered I. Such a short amount of time, especially coming from where you were. You ALREADY want to stay here, and that is H U G E! sending love. I'm proud of you.",False,False

For me, the hardest part was right after hospitalization because at first you have SO much support, everyone saying they are there for you...but once you are stable, it disappears. Just stay strong and keep working on you and towards your goals. The support might seem to wane but it‚Äôs still there and even if it‚Äôs not, you can count on you. ",False,False

It can in fact get better and if you are BPD which I suspect based on the DBT, it does in fact fade with age.  It does NOT happen over night but you can go into remission (normally it's 2 years of DBT). It's been about 2 years since I last attempted and my suicidal thoughts are only every 6 months or so and even then, it's not very severe. The ED has also started to ""fade"", but that'll probably be the last thing to go.  &amp;#x200B;  My point is just to say that right now, just one month out, you probably feel confused and alone and like not that much has changed or will change. You might feel very empty and that you're just going through the motions for your family. But if you keep going, you can get through it.  It's only been a few weeks. Give it 6 month of hard work and you'll be somewhere totally different. ",False,False

I'm really sorry your treatment team doesnt see it the same way, you have so obviously improved so much - your health data is a testament to that! Can I also say, rock on with those grades??? Because damn, that's an *amazing* gpa for a suicidal month.   I am so impressed and so amazed with everything you've accomplished this month, and you should be too! Don't look at how far you still have to go, look at how far you've come already. Being afraid to gain weight is normal and understandable for someone with an ED, please don't feel ashamed of that. It'll go away eventually, but you can't rush recovery. You're so right about small, gradual steps: you'll get there, and the more consistent you are, the less likely it'll be that you'll be back in that horrible dark place again for long.   You're doing so well, better than anyone could ever expect of you. We love you, keep fighting the good fight and enjoying life a little more every day. üíóüíóüíó",False,False
