That's fucking immoral as fuck I'm LIVID for you. Like how fucking dare they how the fuck can you even doctor shop for ANTI DEPRESSANTS it's not even a controlled substance THAT DOCTOR CAN FUCKING SUCK A TURD!

The staff from the EDNOS day program made it for me when I showed them the letter saying my dr was graduating and wasn't taking anymore appointments. This dr also refused to contact my previous dr to confirm she was leaving, the pharmacy I used to confirm my script needed rewritten, or my psychologist (whose office was one floor above and with whom I had a standing appointment with at 1pm that day.)  They filed paperwork with the county while I was speaking with a nurse and didn't even tell me what was happening. Suddenly I had like 5 people surrounding me, a security guard putting his hands on me and forcing me into a wheelchair. I still refer to it as a kidnapping. It took me nearly 8 months before I could even pass that clinic without having a panic attack and thinking people were going to jump out and take me down again. ",False,True
