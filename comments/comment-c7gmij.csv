But for real i completely understand why this makes you panic. I distanced myself completely from that type of content and i never read comments on them because i know it triggers me.   IMO they have no idea how it feels to struggle with one of the basic human functions and judge on others appearance while probably never exercising or eating vegetables and leading an equally unhealthy lifestyle.   In general try taking to heart comments from people who have their shit together not someone who spends their time spreading negativity and hate.,False,False

Any time I've visited them, so many mixed feelings.  ""Oh I'm not one of the people they're making fun of"", and ""F, these people are just straight up projecting or just mean people.  I haven't looked at the sub's for maybe a month, it's just not worth my time,nor my mental well-being.    I'm sorry you're upset, and hope you can try to avoid any cruelty on all websites.  Although I'm quite aware a person can be drawn to these sites, but encourage you to try to not engage.",False,False

There's this weird fetishism around restrictive eating disorders as well, like it's something to admire, rather than a crippling illness.  The fatlogic crowd need a way to feel superior to others.  Most of them admit to being overweight - but they're GOOD heavy people, trying to LOSE the weight and become WORTHY!  Not like those bad lazy heavy people that it's okay to make fun of.  The self-hatred, misogyny and mental gymnastics is pretty mindblowing, but mostly that sub just frustrates the hell out of me because of the smug and superior tone of most posts.  You are not alone.  You deserve to get better.  Fuck people ragging on people making a genuine effort to be okay with themselves. Honestly, this sub ironically has the healthiest and most supportive attitude to weight struggles anywhere on the internet, imo.  Go us.",False,False

Like someone else said, it's so important to not forget the role that misogyny plays in this—people don't really give a shit about health. It's about standards of beauty and social control.   The combination of super-available and super-advertised fast food and the diet industry is fucking nuts, and we're more sedentary than ever. I don't think humans have ever lived in an environment where it takes so much effort just to stay thin. I'm super a lot of people on this subreddit know what I'm talking about. Personally, I get sick of devoting so much of my life to thinness. Who gives a shit if you don't spend significant energy trying to be thin? Your appearance isn't your value, and that's time and energy you can use in other worthwhile ways. That's what drives me so crazy with the body posi haters: they overlook just how weird and demanding thinness is in this particular time we live in.",False,False

You know, that’s a really cool project idea. When I finish up today I’m going to scrape the flairs on fatlogic and try to extract SWs and CWs just to plot how the average user (who flakes themselves) changes their weight. Not even trying to make an argument out of it, I’m just mildly curious to profile the population",False,False

A lot of people are sexist assholes and calling a woman 'fat' (and being fake concerned for her health) is just them trying to put women in their place and praising underweight models as 'healthy' because they think they're entitled to model partners.   I'm trying to recover from bulimia too and one of my greatest fears is that people will think I looked better when I was underweight and comment on it. I've noticed that most of the time, the people who comment have never been underweight. They don't understand how much headspace it takes to count calories and plan meals to maintain an underweight body.   I also agree with the core message of body positivity and it doesn't matter if some people take it to the extremes- whatever is best for your recovery is the right choice.",False,False
