I was 23 with no prior pregnancies and a uterus on the smaller size (probably had something to do with it). It was $400 to have put in at Planned Parenthood, and was very painful, I had to call a ride after 2 hours in the waiting room because I couldn't drive myself home. After, I had 3 months of 24/7 heavy about-to-pass-tf-out cramping and spot bleeding, with my NP saying ""it's normal, you'll get used to it!"". I gave up and had it pulled after those 3 months, and the sheer relief I had coming out of the clinic was unimaginable.   Fast forward 3 years, I gave IUDs another shot with the Mirena, because I gained 15 lbs with oral contraceptives while low restricting.   It cost me about $100 at the local clinic. Nearly painless to have put in with the help of a Misoprostol pill a few hours before, and getting off the pill helped me lose that 15 lbs and then some with high restriction. I felt a little bloated for the first few months and sex was mildly painful, but the mood swings and cravings were reduced from the pill in a few weeks. I'm 4 years in with my Mirena, have had light/ no periods and feel more emotionally stable. Next year I need it replaced, and I'm definitely sticking with the same.   All of these stories are going to be anecdotal so take them with a grain of salt! Best of luck to you, hope you find what works for your body! ðŸ˜šðŸ’—",False,False

I love it because my periods used to be heavy as hale. But now, they are super light. Unlike my friends who got the arm implant, I didnâ€™t gain any weight. HOWEVER, I did bleed for almost three months straight and my Mirena definitely contributed to the development of my depression lmao. I also get painful cramps the week before my period. But they only happen for like 30 minutes and then disappear lmao. I would recommend starting with the lower dosage if you want to get a hormonal iud. ",False,False

I gained a lot of weight, but I also coincided with moving out and going to university. I'm definitely always hungry but I'm not sure if it's caused by that, I've had it for so long.  I'm very happy with the fact I don't get periods or mood swings, I think that helps with food and stuff. I don't get period cravings.",False,False

I'm curently on the pills and even though they're supposed to be the mildest version there is I'm suspecting the same thing as you (affects my mood, hunger etc).
