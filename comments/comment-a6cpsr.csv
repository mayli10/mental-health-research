I lost 15lbs, was feeling amazing, and was getting ready for an event. I tried on some strappy heels and asked her if they made my feet look like sausages. She didn't hear the 'feet' part and said ""yeah, all your clothes look too tight"". 💀☠️💀",False,False

I think it’s just too easy for your disordered thoughts to take over and make you think the comment means weight gain. ",False,False

Parents sometimes don’t like us to look too “good” because it freaks them out to see their babies looking attractive in a way that might draw attention from potential sex partners.   My parents have implied so many times in my life that I look bad in something that’s “too tight” “too short” “fits weird” “not flattering” etc. I took those things to heart but looking back, I looked fucking amazing in all those things. I looked TOO good, so good that it freaked my parents out and made them worry I would get attention that they didn’t approve of.    So maybe it’s that? Tight doesn’t always mean bad by the way;)",False,False
