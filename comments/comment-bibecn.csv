I know how to eat right and exercise a normal amount. I also know how to starve, ec stack, restrict, and c&amp;s. the only thing determining which habits i chose for the day is my weight and how i feel about it atm. Atm i dont like my weight but im not feeling well enough to truly lose, so im eating balanced meals and c&amp;sing my cravings in between. Its less of a binary and more of a gradient for me.",False,False

Like I went from ~74kg to ~61kg within a few months. It’s scary and dangerous but I don’t want to and probably never will give up that power. I’m back up to 64-65kg now and am mostly maintaining with a very slow increase but mark my words in like 8 months I’ll be back up to 70+kilos and freak out/relapse,False,True

I'm very orthorexic so I never really let myself get too big or too small out of a massive fear of being ""unhealthy."" But if I get close to my high weight, my body dysmorphia kicks into over drive and the negative thoughts and habits coming rushing back in until I'm a little too small, and then I get scared of dying.

I also had the weird idea that hey maybe I actually don't like my collarbones sticking out as much as they do rn but that's just my body type imo because I'm at a healthy normal weight.  BUT I'm also trying to train for a half marathon so that might definitely be where my focus is going.  And I could never be okay gaining a significant amount of weight - where I'm at now is as far as I'll push it,False,False

In general I’m not as active in my ED as I used to be, I still restrict, but my weight has been normal for over a year and I can deal with hating my body most of the time. But I find it incredibly comforting to know that if I can’t take it anymore I can resume my anorexic behaviors and go back to actually feeling comfortable and confident in my body. I don’t know if I believe in full recovery, at least not for me, and I don’t think I would want it even if it was an option.",False,False

Now I'm low to moderate restricting and exercising. I'm feeling pretty obsessed and I've been dropping uni subjects to give me more ability to restrict and exercise without affecting my grades.

I recovered and was doing great with intuitive eating for almost 3 years, actually lost some weight during that time because I was binging less and exercising more, life was good, until I had a health scare in February. I was told obesity was a risk factor for the stuff I was going through, so even though I was a healthy weight I decided losing 5-10 lbs might be a good idea. But logging into MFP was waaay more triggering than I anticipated. I thought I could use these behaviors temporarily as a tool, not an obsession, but three months later here we are.

There really is no normal for me. I'm either low restricting or I'm binging.

I dont count calories, but food is still very difficult. I eat the same thing for every meal and will adjust foods to be the lowest calorie possible at restaurants. I eat a lot of snacks but don't binge like I did years ago. I over exercise, but only on the weekends when I have time. I'm at a normal BMI and weight but food still controls my thoughts a lot of the times and I still have that constant worry of being fat, like it's the worst thing that could happen to me.
