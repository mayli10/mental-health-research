Also, it's possible that you are under estimating your calories. Last winter I thought I was eating maintenance but was actually in a 300 calorie deficit due to muscle/fat ratio. Other things can cause it too, like if you're cold a lot, or have a super active thyroid, etc. Monitor your weight closely to be sure you actually are maintaining.   In addition, try changing your macros up. Higher protein and fat will make you feel more full. ",False,False
