It was very upsetting to see the state they left my room in all torn apart and even more disgusting than it was before but nothing was ruined just very embarrassed.

If it makes you feel any better, I went through a citizens police academy and did a ride-along with a cop for their entire shift. Honestly, they see and deal with so much in one day (and some crazy things at that) that it probably didn‚Äôt even faze them.
