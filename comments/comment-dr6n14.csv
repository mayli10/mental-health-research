So I totally get it... and I also try to balance those (very real) feelings with the self-reminder that recovery is hard, people are trying, and if they're NOT walking the talk, that is about THEM and they will have hunched-over spines when they're older (and I won't). That sounds mean but that is my honest reaction.",False,False

I totally understand why.   But I see so much ""recovery"" that is just a different restrictive coping mechanism repackaged.   Like going from anorexia to strict raw veganism/fruitarian lifestyles, or to fitness.   One one hand, I think anything that keeps you alive is great. But, I know it isn't sustainable long term because you haven't sourced the route of the problem. You're still constantly restricting and controlling something.   It sucks to say and to watch people go through because it can feel like there is no way out.   But I think the process of recovery really needs to shift dramatically from ""eating food = recovered"" because we all know EDs are psychological.   If your mental state is not better I don't see how you can be better? You know? :(",False,False

f6h6w9a,t3_dr6n14,t3_dr6n14,hammerprice,11,2019-11-03 21:34:30,/r/EDAnonymous/comments/dr6n14/i_hate_recovery_posts_where_the_person_is_still/f6h6w9a/,"**TW: Numbers**  I'll admit I don't mess around with ""recovery"" social media very much. But from what I've seen, for every legitimate recovery account, there's one or two people who have just swapped how they do their eating disorder.  I think some of them do it intentionally because obviously-disordered eating has fallen out of fashion and is now becoming taboo again, when it used to be the unspoken secret of a lot of models in the 90s/early 2000s, and now as the public is becoming more aware of eating disorders, some influencers are trying to get ahead of any rumours by saying they're ""in recovery"" when they aren't, at all, and they know it. Others definitely THINK they're in recovery but even if their behaviours have changed, the outcome hasn't, so they're still disordered.  What I see a lot is, for the latter, they change HOW they manage their weight, or they change their goal, to something that feels healthier, but it's still disordered. Like, maybe they previously managed their weight by only eating one &gt;!900!&lt;cal omad, or they only ever ate junk food, or they purged. And NOW they manage their weight by eating three square meals... that are all &gt;!300!&lt;cals each, so they're still only eating &gt;!900!&lt;cals a day. Or they swap out the junk food they used to eat for higher volumes of ""healthy"" food, but because that healthy food is less nutritionally dense, they're still under-eating even if it looks better and bigger. Or they swap from purging to exercise purging for the exact same maintenance.  It ties in with people's preconceptions about eating disorders - that it only applies to people who are skeletally thin, who barely eat and only eat weird ""safe"" foods, and who don't/can't exercise. So they see someone who is no longer skeletal - even if that person is still maintaining an underweight BMI, especially if they replace fat with muscle - who appears to be eating three square meals of a much larger volume of food - even if their daily caloric intake is the same - and who appear to be exercising to pursue health and strength - even though they're now burning all the calories through exercise that they used to purge.  I think some of these people don't realise what they're doing. They genuinely think that they're swapping out unhealthy behaviours for healthier ones, so they must be recovered, even though their goals haven't changed - they're still maintaining an underweight BMI/appearance. Others I think knkow 100% that it's just a publicity stunt - they know that the public still favours skinny/underweight influencers, but that there's a performative push-back against eating disorders now, so they promote themselves as leading a healthy lifestyle while still sporting a body that is only attainable through disordered means.  It sucks, and I think both categories of people are still disordered and still need help. Even if the latter group does it ""intentionally"" for followers/promotions I don't think they're any more in control of their disorder than the former group, just more aware of it. But it sucks seeing people who are already used to seeing underweight BMI actresses presented as totally normal following these influencers and thinking ""see, this is totally healthy for me to strive towards, because she's got there by HEALTHY means!""",False,False

I see loads of posts about people on instagram lifting weights... building bone density is super super important. I also think that if thinking about weight gain as gaining muscle is the thing that lets people be OK with gaining, that's healthier (physically) than staying at a super low weight. And if that's an entry point to feeling better about oneself, that opens a lot of doors too. Finally, exercise is a great stress reliever and goodness knows so many of us are anxious/depressed... so I think for some people, it can be a critical part of recovery.
