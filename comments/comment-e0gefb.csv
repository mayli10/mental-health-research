I’ve lost alot of weight so that anyone (including myself) would think that it’s not a bad thing  The way I’ve been trying to get help with my GP and mental health teams just don’t work, if I want help I need to be smart about it - so annoying to say the least",False,True

I have a mixed experience. A few years ago I got really determined to get help for BED and pushed it hard with my GP at the time, who was pretty helpful but treated it more like anxiety. I somehow got a really quick referral to psychotherapy and saw a great woman for 6 sessions until her placement ended and I got transferred to another guy who I didn’t click with at all.  Last year I started with behaviours other than just BED, lost a lot of weight quickly and have continued along that track. I happened to be seeing my current GP quite regularly for another issue so I was honest from the start about ED behaviours. She was kind and considerate but I don’t think she took me that seriously (I’m overweight, so losing weight is always a good thing obviously). I’ve been on a waiting list for CBT for 12 months. I stopped needing to see GP for the other issue so haven’t been back for about 6 months now and I keep debating whether I should go/see someone else/forget about it. As much as I want to get help, I don’t want anything formally on medical records because we’re hoping to adopt soon.",False,False

The initial assessment was very in depth and I was taken seriously. I was referred to them originally by a therapist though.",False,False

But my GP has been relentless in trying to get them to help me, and has continued to see me regularly, at the very least once a month. I initially went for my depression, but only recently have I opened up about my ED. He hasn't once doubted me and has respected my wishes to not see the mental health team again unless necessary, gently pushing me in that direction rather than forcing me, because he can't do much for me.  I would recommend seeing a different doctor, you could ask the practice if there are any doctors with experience or an interest in mental health. Unfortunately there are some doctors who do more harm than good, but there are also those that are extremely helpful.  Idk if you have, but look at Beat's website and maybe consider talking your situation through with one of their advisors. They helped me work up the courage to tell my GP, and reached out to me after to make sure everything went okay.  The NHS is under funded and under staffed, which means too many people don't get the care they need and deserve. Don't let this one experience sour the entire service. Someone will take you seriously, you just have to find them.",False,False
