Doctors are more frequently seeing young, healthy people come in with advanced colon cancer. (I mean, it's very rarely people quite as young as you, but still.)   Point is, bloody stools are never something to take lightly. In all likelihood, of course, it's not cancer, but dark blood in the stool can be symptomatic of some really serious stuff.",False,False
