And have a lot of similar concerns. I definitely have gone through various stages of eating in my life and recently it's be c/s ing. It's like eating the foods you don't allow yourself to have. But I'm sure I'm absorbing some of the calories and ruining my teeth. Its usually late at night and when I'm alone at home that I go crazy with it. And it's like I know I'm doing it but I can't stop. I haven't been able to remedy it yet, seeing a therapist later in November and hopefully that helps",False,False

I‚Äôve discovered that I can‚Äôt actually make myself vomit (tried the toothbrush trick, gargling eggs, even chugging salt water - still nothing).

Like someone will send me home with leftovers I already forced myself to eat and don't want more of, or my husband will bring home junk that I didn't ask for, and I'll see it sitting there expiring. So I put a plastic bag in a mug and spit it into that. Easy cleanup. The way I see it is I'm ""enjoying the flavor and getting some use out of it rather than putting it straight into the trash.""  The taste of shitty fast food or somebody's overly salty meat/carb heavy dinner makes me happy sometimes, but digesting it is painful and throwing it up later just seems sillier than not swallowing in the first place. It's stupid but that's just the cards I was dealt I guess lol. I'm more ortho than anything so that must be how I justify it?",False,False
