Depending on what arbitrarily chosen calorie amount I can justify in my head it ends up being eighteen to thirty something calories. Nearly sixty-something calories if I was feeling naughty and creamer got involved.   But I definitely would of eaten 100-800 calories of shit that isn’t even healthy if I didn’t satisfy myself so,False,False
