The worst thing you can do as a binge eater is let yourself be hungry. Have you tried eating a lot of tiny portions throughout the day?   Also, I know this can be a super hard thing to do, but when you feel the urge to binge, take a second and think to yourself ‘why do I have this urge’? It doesn’t always help, but knowing why you’re doing it means you’re closer to finding a way to nip the cause of the problem in the bud.",False,False

I know this is a tried suggestion but meditating really helped me. I didn't notice until about a week in, you're training your body to get out of the fear response/aka anxious state that makes us binge. 20 min a day it's free and it's worth a shot",False,False

Many times when I start eating, I can’t stop until I’m in pain. What has worked best for me is going to one meal a day, and consuming a lot of caffeine.

I'm also BED and intermittent fasting has helped a lot, as well as reducing other areas of stress in my life. I know how overwhelming it feels.

It’s boring, and awkward, but if I’m thinking about it and only focused on the food I don’t binge as much. I also have to force myself to go to bed early (with melatonin usually) so that I can’t night binge.
