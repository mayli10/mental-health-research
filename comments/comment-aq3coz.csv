I mean more of on an individual basis though. Like I'll see people, and then a couple of weeks later they'll look larger than me even though we were the same size or they were smaller.   Like I swear this one girl was way smaller and then 4 days she was bigger than me.   Maybe it's just body dysmorphia messing with my head?",False,True

Like I am a total foodie and I am amazed at the kind of food that‚Äôs available there now.   Anyway every time I go home I notice that most of the people I know have put on some weight, and the average size of people on the street is going up as well. My SO and I have talked about it at length because we were so shocked, and the trend seems to be that teenage girls, older men, and older women are all getting bigger. Teenage boys, somehow (enviable metabolism, probably) are still whip-skinny.   My country suffered pretty badly during the 2008 recession and after, and things are picking up economically there now, which I think is contributing to the explosion of the food culture and that people feel more comfortable ‚Äútreating themselves‚Äù again.
