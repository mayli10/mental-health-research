I tend to associate the word ""brawny"" with a very ""bulky""/""blocky""-looking muscular person. I don't think you can be objectively brawny in that sense. Maybe objectively you have visible muscle, but I don't think being *large* and muscular is really that objective so it's probably affected by dysmorphia.",False,False

I *used* to see myself as thin but not anymore. Also I haven‚Äôt weighed myself in a month so my BMI could be 84 by now and I‚Äôd have no idea üòÇ   I think because I‚Äôm very isolated I have no external validation so I‚Äôm often very confused about how I look!",False,False

We are expected to effortlessly look thin. Super underweight images are totally normalized because of our fashion industry and entertainment industry and diet culture. Your family is a victim to society‚Äôs horrible standards and values of extreme thinness. And they‚Äôre imposing that belief system onto you. I had a similar problem. I was 100lbs at 5‚Äô8‚Äù and I still had a booty (recovered body is 135lbs and a bottoms size 8-10 lol), so everyone would just comment on my ass and imply that I could never be skinny since I was ‚Äúthicc‚Äù due to my huge butt. It was never enough. It never will be enough. Because it‚Äôs all a bullshit perception game.   I hope you look past your family‚Äôs comments... and realize they‚Äôre just brainwashed.",False,False

Comments such as ""but you don't look underweight"" don't have to mean ""you look fatter than your weight""‚Äîit could mean ""you don't look completely skeletal, like you're about to die."" I think many people associate the word ""underweight"" with ""bad health"" and therefore ""someone looking like they're on their deathbed"".
