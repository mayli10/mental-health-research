(except the most recent one, that one was positive but also planned lol.)  also, just for the info, don't assume a lost period means you can't get pregnant. you absolutely can.",False,False

I’ll be getting a pregnancy test soon, I think once I’m officially a day or two late for my period, if that happens. My first thought was to binge but every time I try to eat is like pulling teeth. I’m sorry you went through this as well, it’s a terrible feeling. I haven’t experienced nausea thankfully. I really appreciate you sharing your experience with this ♥️",False,True

I guess I mean I’ll  half heartedly intend to eat and keep pushing the actual meal back or justify coffee as a meal. Then I’ll look back at my caloric intake for the day like wow I really need to fix this and I haven’t done anything about it yet.",False,True

The only way I could convince myself otherwise was to get a blood pregnancy test. I was also exactly 19 when it happened  I lost my period for months due to restriction. My weight had dropped below a certain level and I knew it was bound to happen, but my ED brain went into denial and decided I wasn't thin enough to be at the point of losing my period. I convinced myself I must be pregnant and was shitting rings around myself in anxiety. What made matters worse is that my emotions were making me binge and the bit of weight I gained only made me believe I had something growing inside of me  I too had never spotted before this and it was lining up with implantation bleeding, I also used to get so nervous as soon as I woke up that I felt like I wanted to vomit (which I mistook for morning sickness)  If you need somebody to talk to don't hesitate to DM me",False,False

I won't eat for 4-5 days without even noticing.""  I'm sorry but that is 100% actively restricting. Unless you are on some kind of severe appetite suppressing medication or have some other medical issue, there is no physical way you are fully intending to eat and then accidentally go 4-5 days without eating anything.",False,False
