Once I get over the hunger pains, starving is almost some sort of euphoric thing. It’s weirdly addictive and satisfying. It’s like some evil fairy putting rose colored glasses on you but only to view your ed symptoms. Oh you just almost fell flat on your ass because you moved too fast? No honey, that’s good, it means you’re WiNnInG. Yet despite that, I rarely seem to get to the euphoric part because the hunger pains and cravings are so terrible. I never binge. But I eat more than I plan and then end up purging through exercise, vomiting or both. Not eating always seems easier but I always mess that up. I’m basically cursed to be preoccupied with food forever",False,False

Eating takes so much.",False,True

All I want to do is eat nothing forever. Literally at the point where I’m going to cancel all my future therapy appointments and just let this fucking demon kill me,False,False
