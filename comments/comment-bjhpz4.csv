Your anorexia wasted your year, not bingeing or eating. Your shame, self-loathing, and hatred of your body destroyed your year.   What would it take for you to seek help from a therapist specializing in eating disorders? There are probably ones on campus, or you could go through your family doctor.   You can't willpower your way out of an eating disorder. One used to consume my life, too. I thought, if only I could restrict more, I would be happy. It was the need to restrict that destroyed my happiness, not the other way around.",False,False

Prozac was so so good for me but my doctor took me off it and I miss it so bad- I think it really mellows out binge urges. So I hope it works out well for you! I am in my third year of uni, just about to leave, and I feel like I’ve wasted my chance at uni, b/ping and exercise purging, and I wish I could go back and try it all over again. So many regrets. I’m really sorry you’re in the same place.",False,False

I feel you on wanting to think of literally anything else. My thoughts are clouded with my ED. Try not to beat yourself up too much about it. Forgive me for being overly optimistic but life is a long ass journey and there will be so many amazing things for the future. Freshman year isn't the only year of your life to live it up and have fun. If you need to talk, feel free to contact me (:",False,False

I can only say that I really relate to a lot of what you wrote. My first two years in school were pretty close to what you described (even weirder is that our height and LWs are very similar lol)-- my life consisted pretty much consisted only of ED stuff and maintaining a good GPA. It all just felt so empty, so consuming, so pointless, so terribly lonely-- I just got so tired of it!  Since then, I've partially managed to pull myself out of it, at least to the extent that I do have a life outside of my eating disorder and academics and there are things and people I actually really care about and enjoy. There's another way of living, even if that's incredibly hard to believe sometimes. Try not to feel guilty about ""wasting"" your year-- you're going through enough as it is without that extra guilt :(   If you ever need someone to talk to / vent to that's been through something similar, feel free to DM me.",False,False
