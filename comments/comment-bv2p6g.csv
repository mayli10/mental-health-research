I’ll catch a glimpse in the mirror and think, “Ok, not terrible.” But then later in the day I’ll go for a walk and look down at my thighs and want to cry?  I had some co-occurring mental health issues that led to significant weight gain and at my highest weight I’d look back at old pics of me at think “Ok. Yeah, you felt fat at weight X but you *weren’t* and when you get back to that weight you’re gonna freakin remember that you’re not fat.” Well, guess who’s back down to weight X? Yeah. And my brain is just screaming about everything that’s still unsatisfactory. And how it doesn’t ‘count’ because my body fat percentage is probably higher this time so I need to lose Y more before I’m ok? Sigh.",False,False
