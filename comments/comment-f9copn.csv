You can do it :)  If there is anything you want to talk about, you can dm me!   A few tips, don't try to cut these things completly out of your life! Maybe include one or two days where you can eat what you want, but don't buy junk food in big containers. Two Monster or two twix bars per week should be enough lol these are just tips someone gave me years ago and they helped me a lot, you don't have to listen to me lol   Good luck! And please post updates!",False,False
