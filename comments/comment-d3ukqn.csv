Even with restriction. I have to keep my net carbs at 50 or below or I stay bloated and feel awful. I've added some carbs back in like oats, fruit, gluten free bread. I'm not adding sugar or pasta or rice back in though. It's not so much that they're demonizing carbs. Many people on keto will allow themselves a cheat meal or day and get back to it. Keto does make you feel fantastic though. Loads more energy and better focus when you're in ketosis. Everyone's body is different though. What works for one won't work for all.",False,False

I just don't jive with the whole demonization of carbs a lot of keto people tend to promote. Like, carbs are good. Fats and proteins are also good. I may be a malnourished anorexic but I do think in a healthy diet (which I'm not claiming to have lol) there's a place for carbs and fats etc.",False,False

I mean maybe if you live off of bacon and butter, but if you do it right it's a very healthy lifestyle. You're encouraged to get several cups of leafy greens a day. Healthy fats like nuts, avocados, etc. It helps you recognize the difference between real hunger and boredom. You stay full so you eat less. It only went wrong for me because it triggered my ED. All the numbers. I obsess over numbers in general. Now I'm fucked. My ED is the worst it's ever been. But the diet itself isn't bad. My brain just doesn't know how to be normal. ðŸ™„ðŸ˜‚",False,False

And yeah, healthy fats do help you feel full, but they only play a *role* in that. Starch also helps you feel full, and it's a lot lower in calories per gram. Like, a potato that's maybe 180cals will keep me full for longer than 180cals of almonds. And fiber is the ultimate fullness hack: I doubt I could even *finish* 180 cals of carrots or steamed broccoli. Fiber literally triggers the fullness chemical in your brain.",False,False

Your body needs to become fat adapted which takes about a month to 2 months. Then you pretty much never feel hungry. I was powering through 48h fasts like it was nothing. I wouldn't even start to get hungry until 40h in and that was easily cured with water. You can get plenty of healthy fats in and stay low cal. I hover around 800 for my daily intake. Sometimes a little more, sometimes a little less. Protein will also keep you full.",False,False
