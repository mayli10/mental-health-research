When I first stopped drinking I had drinking dreams (which is common). When I was eating keto I had eating-carbs dreams (which to judge by the keto sub, is common). If I play a lot of sudoku, Iâ€™ll have dreams related to numbers or patterns. On and on. And apparently in terms of brain activity thereâ€™s really no difference between happened-in-a-dream and happened-IRL, so itâ€™s understandable to have that wave of oh-no emotions upon awakening. I certainly have it. Sometimes it takes me awhile to realize it was only a dream. It didnâ€™t happen.",False,False
