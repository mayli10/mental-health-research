Theres an intense need to be thin, but you couple that with the distress that an ed, body dysmorphia, anxiety and or, depression can have on you. And along with the need to hide these problems and secrecy an ed brings. I think a lot of us have a need to be that sick girl from the movies to signify how unhappy we are. Obviously not everyone eds manifest in so many ways but i see so much of this in my experience.",False,False

Like yeah, I'm taking my emotions and pain out on my body because idk how to properly articulate what I'm feeling, but I don't necessarily want others to know. Idk.  I've always thought my reasoning for getting underweight is so that I'm less noticeable because I'll be physically smaller, though I know there's a point where you can be too skinny and start drawing more attention yourself.  Maybe I'm just in denial about this being a cry for help I want people to hear, and have convinced myself I want to become invisible.",False,False
