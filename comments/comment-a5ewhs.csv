I’d either not eat at all or get a fuck ton of extremely fattening food in the “all you can eat” dining hall in my dorm. Sometimes I made myself walk all the way to a different dorm so I could buy stuff individually hoping cost would affect my decision. But meal swipes work for a dollar amount and it took a ton of food to get there. I ended up trying to get a lot of non-food stuff like a two pack of ibuprofen and made sure to always get a propel (zero calorie flavored water). And it was STILL hard to not go over even a non-restricting calorie limit.,False,False
