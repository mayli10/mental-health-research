Mine will probably be a little different bc I think the root of my ED is my sexual abuse as a teen and the resultant PTSD. So I'm hoping that finally learning how to heal from that will help my ED. but thank you for sharing this, it's really inspiring and brave",False,False

Writing about my values was also one of my first homework assignment's with my therapist. It's been the backbone of my recovery. I return to my values daily. Here's a portion of what I wrote:  &gt;what traits do you admire?: kindness, resiliency, openness, being carefree, humility, wisdom. be kind, keep fighting for what you care about, enjoy listening to other people and trying new things, appreciate the small things -- the sunshine, music, the wind, recognize that you're no less special or more special than the people around you, enjoy the wonders of the world -- new foods, new places and people, explore, dance, open your heart to new experiences, stay present, keep dreaming.   &gt;   &gt;traits you don't value: wealth, perfection, callousness, uniformity and stillness   &gt;   &gt;why you don't feel ""good enough"": you're not successful monetarily (wealth), you don't have excellent grades (perfection, your not classically beautiful (perfection), you're still figuring things out (stillness), you're overly emotional (callousness), you're different than your peers and not following a traditional path (uniformity)  &amp;#x200B;",False,False

Write up the things you value about yourself, and what others value about you on a big piece of paper and stick it to your pinboard/wall. It can help to remind yourself every day that there are other things people value about you.",False,False

I struggled to name *anything* at first but as I wrote things down, I thought of more and more things. I don't remember what we did with the list after I made it, but I remember it was good for me mentally to write it.  I didn't really think that was worth its own post, but since you wanted some other examples, there's that one. c:",False,False
