You're not alone  I recently got rejected from one of the places I applied to for grad school and I just feel useless. I always have an appetite (restrict binge restrict binge and repeat) but I don't have one anymore. I've lost a lot of weight in the past week and although I know I should eat something of substance I just want nothing.  My body feeling as empty as my heart feels is somewhat comforting.,False,False
