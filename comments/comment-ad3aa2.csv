Or at the very least say you used to struggle. Openness is always good, and if they for some reason give some sort of incorrect information you could discuss it with them after the class.  Idk, maybe it could even be healing in a way. I hope the professor tells everyone that judgement isnt acceptable.  Best of luck to you",False,False

I hadn't eaten in 3 days and someone is trying to convince me that you'll starve if you don't eat for a day???

My husband took a psych course at a local community college shortly after I was diagnosed. When the professor got to the BPD section of the course, she said something like, 'if you ever encounter someone with BPD - run in the opposite direction '  I wasn't there, but I am filled with rage that an educated professional would speak dismissively about such a painful condition.

They talked about so much fucking bullshit - it stunned me how ignorant this head of department was. He was a middle aged white male, sure, but dude... This is your department. You can't go around talking about starvation modes and how eating less actually makes you gain weight in a professional capacity, much less advocate to teach that to girls with EDs (they had pamphlets and everything). I've heard other unis has almost identical courses run by hospitals/their universities. They almost expect a percentage of their student population to have EDs so they try to 'minimise harm' to reduce liability instead of just sticking to the science of it all.   Don't do it. It's going to be a LOT less like what you imagined it to be. It'll drive you insane. I walked out of there everyday fuming at the sham ED education was. ",False,False
