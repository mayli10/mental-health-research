It sounds like this is a great fit and you're going to get the help you need.   I totally understand that feeling about someone getting it. Sometimes my therapist asks a question and I'm just like... damn. You know about this shit. I am SEEN.   I hope it goes really well.,False,False

We had to plan an extra appointment because i have so much to tell and she has so much to ask. It's really nice to have someone understand on a professional level what I'm talking about. I was completely honest and open and... I didn't feel fake for once? She was assuring me a lot, indirectly, by saying ""exactly"" a lot after I explained something. As if it fits my diagnosis perfectly. I have faith in this one.",False,True

No one ever thinks they're ill enough. I promise that you are.   No one's going to judge you. They'll just want to help. You can tell them how you feel (ashamed, fake, unworthy) and they'll help with that too.   Let me know how it goes tomorrow.",False,False

Go along, have a chat to people, see how you feel after. Doing that (even having an appointment in the first place) is a huge step. You can totally manage it because you have a fuck tonne of inner strength - you must have, just to be where you’re at right now.   I’m doing it too right now. Asking for help from everyone around me. It’s really scary and exposing and confronting. But I know it’s what I need, and so do you.",False,False
