He doesn't understand that I have a text book eating disorder that causes me to either starve to the point of malnutrition or binge to the point that I spend too much money and make huge messes cause I'm a depressed slob when I eat. Instead of helping me, asking me WHY I feel like this, being understanding, etc. He just gets mad at me and makes me feel like a bad person. It's quite shocking, really. I don't expect him to sympathize with me or treat me like I'm some fragile little bird who deserves respect and admiration for having mental problems, but it would be nice for him not to make me feel worse when I'm at my lowest. He ends up making me feel fat no matter what I do, and I tell him, and he gets mad. I'm contemplating on whether I should be in a relationship at all because now he knows my weaknesses and I feel like he does and says triggering things as a power play because he has no idea how to react to this vane yet mentally straining problem I have.  &amp;#x200B;  None of his exes have had an eating disorder to his knowledge and it seems like they've always been ""popular cool girls"" despite it. He isn't used to being close to someone like me and that angers me like nothing else because I need him to be a support not an obstacle.",False,False

Honestly, it takes WAY too much mental effort to keep up appearences at all time. Sure, I can try my best for my loved ones, since I don't want them to worry over things they have no power to change.

Most people dont want to get involved esp in something as delicate as mental health so usually even when a stranger “reaches out” its very weak willed bc it took a bit to even say anything.

What would you suggest they do? If the other posts here are anything to go by, we don't typically like being confronted about ed behaviors, even by people we know well (parents, close friends).
