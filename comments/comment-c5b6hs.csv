Children‚Äôs and juniors clothes are too always short in the arms/legs/torso.   Some of J Crew‚Äôs stuff in a 00 or XXS fits, J Crew Factory as well- but a lot of it is too short, especially their jeans. They don‚Äôt make long lengths til 25‚Äù üôÑ  Some of H&amp;M‚Äôs 0‚Äôs fit, blazers usually. But the hips in their pants are mostly too big.   Express dress pants in a 00 are usually great and long enough- but you have to try them on because some colors/ fabrics are cut bigger. Almost none of their tops or blazers work for me, even the XXS online- boxy and wide shoulders.   Lululemon 0‚Äôs online are TINY. I wear these tops under H&amp;M blazers with Express pants almost exclusively.   Ted Baker‚Äôs 0 is also quite small, especially in the waist but still slightly longer waisted than most brands. Little $$$, but the only place I can find dresses.   Oh, and BCBG in the XXS, though they only offer it in certain styles.   And end list. Everywhere else is too vanity sized.",False,False

ASOS has some clothing in size 2. for reference that‚Äôs about a size or two sizes lower than what you‚Äôll find by going to high street shops!! most of this is from their asos petite range, but a small portion isn‚Äôt.  hope that helps x",False,False
