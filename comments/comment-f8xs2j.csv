When you're eating in a situation where you might purge, choose foods that are easier to purge. Bread products, especially breads with a hard crust/bagels, kind of bind with the fluids in your stomach and are really difficult to purge. I've had the most intense straining after binging bagel bites. Much easier go after eating something like rice or chocolate. 2. Drink more fluids when you're eating. Be careful with this one because flushing (drinking a lot of water before purging to flush out what's in your stomach) drops electrolytes more significantly than just purging. Make sure you hydrate and maybe supplement electrolytes after doing this 3. Chew food more finely.   Unfortunately, the amount of strain has more to do with the contents of your stomach rather than the purge method, so it can be a difficult hurdle. Please try to stay safe though.",False,False
