We need to see things like this in the community.

And I immediately realize, no, I don’t really mean that. If I really knew death was imminent, I’d be eating all my favorite foods and not give a fuck about weight.  But it’s so easy to get fixated on weight loss goals and ignore warning signs that your health is suffering.  So I definitely appreciate the reminder. I didn’t realize that a resting heart rate under 60 was considered bradycardic. The lower my hr, the better my Fitbit cardiac fitness score... which lets me fool myself into thinking I’m healthy.",False,False

It's not something a lot of us like to think about, but weighing the risks is a huge part of recovery for me. I'm terrified of heart disease, it runs strongly in my family and 20 lbs ago I had dangerously high blood pressure. But the opposite can kill you too, and it kills much, much faster.  \*Hugs\*",False,False
