It sucks so much but I know it will pass for both of us. Keep going, you're gonna be okay! Imagine the life we can enjoy without this, the things we can do and the thoughts we can think and the people we can love.   Can you try to think one positive thought abour yourself today? I've been trying to do that every time I have a negative thought and it's helping a little bit. I haven't managed to think anything nice about my body but other things like, ""I try to be kind and I like that about myself"" or ""I just did a hard thing that took resilience and I appreciate that about myself"" etc. My goal is 3 good thoughts for every bad thought but I'm not close to there yet haha. One for now is helping a little bit.   And if you need it: here's permission to do everything you want to do but feel like you can't. You're allowed to enjoy life, have sex, go out, eat. You're allowed to live and have fun doing it. Lots of people do it all the time, and you're no different. You absolutely deserve to have as good of a life as anyone else, but that can't happen until you can get better. You need to be strong and stubborn and kind and self compassionate, and I know you can be. I know we can be!  Sending you good vibes because I totally feel you and it's such a bad place to be. I hope this lifted you up a little bit.",False,False
