That must be exhausting. All that walking and at work too. Yeah I got my revised schedule today and I have 22 shifts. So pretty much my free time will be showering, running errands, and studying for school. Why do we do this?",False,True

My ED's recently gotten bad again. I can't drive, so getting to and from work takes about 3 hours total. I work food service. Told my manager to schedule me as much as possible (I can only work from about 10AM til 4 or 5PM, though, bc I need to be able to get the bus, and that's our ""morning"" shift). Been walking about 3 hours a day while on the way to work or back home. By the time I get home, I'm exhausted and can barely even make myself eat my OMAD. My days off are consumed by walking miles and miles for errands.   Lots of love your way. This shit is exhausting.",False,False

So those days I only have an hour to myself will probably go towards showering, hair, and skin. Being busy I’ll probably only wear my scrubs to work and leggings to class. I planned my school schedule like that. My morning class is from 9:30-10:50 my next class starts at 11-1:50 then 2-5:20 then 6-9:15 pm",False,True

I hope you'll try and squeeze in time for self-care, whether that's cooking something really healthy for an OMAD or even just doing really good skin/hair care or whatever works for you.",False,False
