I participated in a psych study for bulimia at a major institution that supposedly specialized in eating disorders. Yet I felt like they were SO off base on what having an eating disorder is like. And I'm like 99% sure I was in the control group (CBT) so it wasn't like it was some experimental stuff.   There's definitely a paternalistic vibe to it. I get needing to force food if the patient is acutely in danger but otherwise I see very little being addressed for long term management of EDs which is why they are still known to be very chronic. My treatment consisted of a lot of ""education"" on why eating disorders are bad (ya don't say???) and it felt really insulting to look at little powerpoints about macronutrients when I'm literally halfway through med school and already consider myself a fucking expert on nutrition cause I've wasted 14 years of my life obsessing over this shit. Meanwhile my therapist had no idea what an EC stack was, lol. The rest of my treatment was basically ""eat every 3 hours and don't b/p"" and ""oh darn you b/p'd again, stop doing that"".   And don't even get me started on how reductionist ED education in med school is. We get all these trick questions about remembering 18.5 as the ""cutoff"" for anorexia as if that's really a meaningful distinction to make and not some harmful DSM bs that fuels ED behavior because clinicians can't view us as individuals on a spectrum of disordered behavior. I am planning to become a psychiatrist and I hope I can make influences in the field if I ever become sane enough to go into eating disorders. ",False,False

Both of those disorders are treated with respect and dealt with civility. They're considered respectable fields to research and you see an even number of men and women working in those fields. EDs, on the other hand, are mainly seen as a female disorder, are hardly given the time of day, and is a predominantly female field.   Then there's the issue of LGBT people who also have EDs. There needs to be a lot more support for those who suffer from EDs and are also LGBT, but you'd be hard-pressed to find any of that research.

I want people to be able to come to terms with their disorder instead of shoving it under the rug, and then maybe by coming to terms with it, the disorder can be minimized to far less harmful levels or gotten rid of completely. From what I understand about treatment for depression, a lot of those treatments (cognitive behavior therapy mainly) has to do with facing certain aspects of the disorder and learning how to cope with them.

I want more research on the causes and more research on the possible treatments. I think we can know a great deal from just those two aspects alone. What's in between can be considered a progression of the disorder over time, but I don't think that's research we need currently or that we need more than cause and treatment research studies.  * It's closer to 30 or 40, isn't it? I thought that research and concern over EDs started in the 70s and 80s. Regardless, this is correct and I do appreciate this point being brought up. EDs have nowhere near the research base that other disorders, like depression, currently have. It's certainly an issue that can be solved with time and by taking eating disorders seriously. * I don't think that you'd need to have a bunch of subclasses even if you found a bunch of variety in the majority. If anything, having said subclasses would make diagnosing that much more difficult. A person who becomes depressed because school has driven them into the ground has the same classification of depression as someone who is depressed because they have no support group around them.    * Rereading your comment, I'm a little confused? Are you saying that someone with an ED probably just has another mental illness, or are you saying that you can't break down EDs into separate disorders like depression (seasonal, major, manic, etc)? * I feel like you could say this for any disorder, really, not just EDs. I think that people with PTSD and depression and so on also have a very hard time explaining what they're feeling. I haven't mentioned this before, but I do think that people with disordered eating should seek treatment with a counselor or a psychologist. All of the alternatives to having an ED that you mentioned are still serious issues. If someone shows up and claims to have a difficult relationship with food, a good therapist would try and help that relationship be less difficult.    * Also the job of clinical research psychologists is literally this??? Their job, should they choose to focus on EDs specifically, is to further define our understanding of disorders. One thing they can do to fulfill that role is to define at what point someone has a disorder. So saying ""but it's hard,"" isn't an excuse in my mind. Yes it is hard, but that's part of the role they undertook. Their job was to make the boundaries that separate disorders into categories. It is also their job to define those boundaries.",False,True

We spent a day or less on EDs in my clinical psych class and they were attributed to societal pressure only. No mention of trauma or anything. I think it's very apt to say that others think it's a choice. You can see that attitude in how treatment is designed. If you just force people to eat, they'll get over it, right? If you haven't starved until you're underweight, you're not ""really"" anorexic, right?  There needs to be so much more of a focus on treating the underlying causes of EDs, such as feeling a lack of control or prior trauma, rather than ripping people from their comfort zones and shoving them into a program that doesn't work well.

There are multiple reasons to that:   - most psych studies are done with a focus on either the cause or the treatment. They won't focus on the events that happen in between as much and hence can't know as much.   - EDs are fairly recent (in terms of proper psych subject). Just like hoarding, they became an actual concern only 20 years ago or so, and there are a lot of things that are still under study.   - a psych program or study is always oriented towards the majority. Just like hoarding again, being against such a vast complex community doesn't make it easy to find a majority. The few behaviours that you can find in a majority are usually not enough to classify an ED as a defined mental illness rather than a sub-group of an existing mental illness.   - the fact that a lot of people with ED struggle to express how they feel, the proper thinking mechanism behind the actions they take and the evolutive character of the ED make it difficult to understand at which step it's an actual ED, versus disordered eating as you mentioned or depression or PTSD, etc. ",False,False
