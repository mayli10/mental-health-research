My freshman year my fitness professor constantly reminded me and the other fat kids in class that being overweight is correlated with depression. None of us ever mentioned being depressed. She wouldn't shut the fuck up about it. Then I had to weigh myself and excercise in front of her and she kept telling me how bad I was at it and it would have been easier for me if I lost weight. I never asked. I did lose 40 pounds after.",False,False

I'm sure if you asked your schools counseling services they could maybe find someone to help you like that (so the request for an alternate assignment or something goes through the counselor and not just you, which I think helps the prof take it more seriously). And I would definitely ask if you could have an alternate assignment instead of being excused from it altogether so that way it doesn't come off to the prof like you are trying to make excuses. Best of luck!",False,False

Even if the university doesn’t acknowledge it, doesn’t mean your prof won’t. It’s always been worth it in my experience to send that email.",False,False

There’s another lab later on that we’re supposed to track our intake for but I can just make some shit up for that one. UNC is so fucking stupid.,False,True

I was feeling homesick and my ed was just unfolding then so during that week I didn’t eat much but I tracked it anyway. When she gives back the assignment she wrote “this can’t be an accurate measure of what you eat for you height and weight” I was considered a normal healthy weight at that time but her note triggered me and I lost 30 pounds over the next month and a half. One day she asked to talk after class and asked me about the weight loss. I dropped the class.",False,False

Idk I’m from the US but it’s possible your college counseling department sucks idk :/ I would give it a try though,False,False

Or if you don’t feel comfortable talking to the professor and have enough time you could go to the counseling center to be medically excused. Not wanting to be weighed while still struggling with an ED is completely valid and you should absolutely protect your progress.,False,False
