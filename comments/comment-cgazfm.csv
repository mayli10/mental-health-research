I’ve recently started walking the dog late at night to help tire me out (and get my steps in lol) and it seems to be helping. I also do a full wind down routine at night (shower, skincare etc) and a cup of chamomile tea to help me sleep; I’ve got adhd so sleep is always difficult with or without restriction.",False,False

To the point that sometimes on fasting days/low restriction days I can't go to sleep at all and just stay up the whole night. I've tried melatonin in the past, but it just wasn't strong enough. I've just accepted it at this point and realize that once the school year starts I won't be able to do it, or at least only on weekends",False,False

I usually fast during the day and only eat at night now so that I am not trying to sleep on an empty stomach. Once I did a 40hr fast and didn’t sleep at all for two days straight. 0/10 would not recommend.  As other posters have mentioned, OTC melatonin can be a godsend. They sell it in really small doses (like 3mg), so you can start small and see what works for you. Check with your doctor first if you have any other issues that it might mess with though.",False,False

I would always read before I went to bed and it seemed to tire out my mind. Purging and Sleeping. I would stay awake for hours staring at the ceiling.
