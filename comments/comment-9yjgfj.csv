Isn't it crazy that other families have parents that don't pick on their childrens' appearances? Like actually mind blowing?

She’s given herself a lot of questionable illnesses diagnoses and food intolerances so that she “can’t” eat more than a handful of her own specific safe foods which she totes around everywhere.

I know my mom would comment on my sisters weight a lot because she  was the chubbier one of us. And she lost a lot of weight in part because of that. My moms comments were a source for me feeling self conscious about my body as well. I hate that people feel bad about their weight and self esteem based on others comments, especially when it comes from family :(",False,False
