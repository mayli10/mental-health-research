I loveeeee Harry Potter! My dad read it to me when I was very young and I am 100% convinced it’s what made me “smart” and got me into advanced education. I can only imagine what the illustrations add to the story!  Infinity war is fun! I remember watching it with my friends right before seeing the new one back in the spring. We had a really good time. I don’t really watch movies, but most recently I watched home alone with my little brother. It was really fun to forget about the world and just laugh for a moment.   I’m so happy for you!! I’m sending good vibes your way and I hope your day is excellent 💕",False,True

Folk pop, movie scores, post-rock, classical. Lately Yo Yo Ma’s recordings of the Bach Cello Suites are a fave. I love that he’s recorded them three times now (1983, 1997, 2018). He’s been the most famous and celebrated cellist in the world for decades, yet in every interview and recording he’s completely unpretentious, and just conveys this amazing desire to share his joy in music. Hands down he’s my pick for the “If you could have coffee with any living person” question.   **Books** I’m re (re re re re) reading Harry Potter Book 1 today because my christmas present was the illustrated edition. It is GORGEOUS. Seriously. He made the world even better than it was in my head which I totally did not expect.   **Movies** We’re going to have our traditional Christmas viewing of *Love Actually* later tonight. I also gifted my SO *Avengers: Endgame* so that might be on the docket. (I’m not hugely keen to watch it but such is the nature of give-and-take of relationships. He *did* put up with me watching *Decoy Bride* quite literally multiple times a day for months during the worst of my depression, so he’s got a lot of leeway ;) I’m so lucky to have him in my life. My brain’s crazy self-destructive outputs frustrate him at times but we’re finding our way.   Thanks for an excellent distraction and a chance to refocus my attention on some things that feel nice. I’d love to hear your answers too &lt;3",False,False
