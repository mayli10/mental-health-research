Few things are quite as quite as terrifying as the feeling of a hairy spider crawling onto the skin of an arachnophobic. I wouldn't even be able to go back into that kitchen for *hours* without spraying every nook and cranny with Raid if I knew it mysteriously disappeared. I don't even know how you'll sleep tonight. It can just roam whenever it wants to at any given time. God, I literally feel so much empathy for you right now.",False,False

A fridge is usually close to 0-4Â°C and most spiders don't last more than a few hours (sometimes minutes) at such low temperatures. This doesn't apply if you live in a place that generally sustain freezing temperature for a long time but a gradual change is required for them to adapt anyway. Since your home is generally much warmer than the inside of your fridge, it's unlikely the spider was there for the entire night and it must have been hanging around somewhere and fell.
