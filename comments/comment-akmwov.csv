The tiniest bloat at a BMI of 16 is absolutely awful. I can't even eat at this weight without my stomach sticking out because there's food in it.",False,False

No bloat and stomach flat as a board when I didn't eat. Took a LONG LONG time during recovery for it to start to subside, too. Talking literally 5+ months.",False,False

(Even at a healthy weight, if you're really lean, you'll notice bloat more than you otherwise would). Even just having a full stomach can be more noticeable if you're really underweight.

I’ll eat a tiny black bean slider and my stomach is very noticeably (to me, anyway) bigger afterwards. I freak out and point my stomach out to my boyfriend and say “SEE THIS? THIS WAS NOT HERE FIVE MINUTES AGO, RIGHT? THAT’S FOOD I JUST ATE. NOT A SUDDEN FIVE POUND GAIN. RIGHT?” I’ve been assured it’s just the food and not fat. ",False,False
