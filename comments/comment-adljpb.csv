I maintained for months but wanted to get over the obsession then tried intuitive eating/binged myself in a 18 LB weight gain. Still obsessed so ,False,False

I'm using my ability to neurotically control my diet to gain weight in a healthy way and stay lean- lest I burn out entirely and binge my way back to being overweight. I still feel disordered as fuck, and I suppose I am, but quitting the behaviors cold turkey/entirely won't make me less so.  &gt;Even though I’ve been maintaining, I’m scared  It gets less scary, I promise. You learn to trust yourself, and the laws of thermodynamics. But it takes time.  &gt;Small things so that I feel less controlled by my illness, even though it’s still very much still present.  Because both those things are true. Improvement happens slowly. Small steps are the only sustainable way.  &gt;I’m still not entirely used to it. I feel like I’m treated like a person for the first time in my life.  Mood. And yeah, the harsh truth is that slimmer people often are treated better. But you don't have to be underweight for this to apply- just fit looking. And think of it this way- even if being dangerously thin had people treating you, say, 2% better than if you were a safe level of thin (I doubt this, but let's just say for arguments sake); wouldn't lack of health complications be worth that tiny reduction, especially since you'd still be considered attractive?  &amp;#x200B;",False,False
