I just make sure I untick ""add on"" boxes.  New browsers open, but I just shut them down.  Never once had a virus.  The last audiobook I downloaded was pretty good - the Rose McGowan autobiog.  She talks about her own ED and how her boyfriend at the time encouraged it.    If you don't download it, I hope you can get a copy from your library.  Anything's worth a shot even if only a couple of things in the book are helpful x",False,True
