It just sounds like a bad idea. I don't fast *(I tried it a few years ago but it just causes misery and then binge-ing and finally binge-ing misery)*. The closest I got to that would've been a few months ago, a day where I had 500-ish calories by 4pm and then went on a 35 mile bike ride. Needless to say, it was not a good ride. I had a head ache and just felt slow/awful in general. I usually pack a clif bar to eat at the 10-mile mark and get a yogurt from the shop at the half-way point.

I bring this up to iterate that it couldn't be from outdoor bicycling since I haven't done that since early October. *(I've been riding an indoor bike but rarely dip above 160 on that)* I took a quick look at when my heart-rate was supposedly 197. It actually only gets that high every Wednesday cause I finish my 40-minute workout with jump rope. The jump rope is what is consistently making my heart rate so high. Specifically, I've been doing around 280-ish consecutive jumps typically at the tempo of whatever song is playing. I listen to a lot of heavy metal while working out, namely Slipknot lately.

But Iâ€™m looking at the 197 when biking. A casual to semi intense bike ride should not get you to 197. Assuming youâ€™re in your 20s, 200 could be the max, but thatâ€™s 100% and reached with really intense exercise or if youâ€™re unhealthy and your heart has to work harder. My heart rate is only 170 max when running and biking tends to be a lot more gentle than that. ",False,False

I thought I was badass for having a resting heart rate consistently in the 40's (lowest it got was 40). It was calorie restriction. Now long as I'm eating well, depending on the day, my stress levels, etc, it ranges from 50 to 58. Eating more in and of itself, especially eating a lot of protein, raises your heartrate noticeably.  &amp;#x200B;  When I'm restricting, I find it almost impossible to get my heartrate high at all no matter how much willpower I put into sprinting. My perceived effort, speed/grade equated, will be higher. OTOH, when I'm eating a lot, I can sustain high heart rates for long periods of time with no issue and get a significantly more potent endorphin rush.  &amp;#x200B;  Probably gained 25 lbs from my lowest weight at this point. I'm substantially stronger and faster and was smashing PR's every time I went out on my Strava segments until recently when it got cold AF. My average speed is 1-2 MPH faster. I'm particularly faster on the shorter segments, anything involving hill climbing or sprinting, than I could have dreamed of being while I was in the eating disorder. We're talking 30-40 seconds faster on a 2 minute segment.  &amp;#x200B;  You can continue doing what you're doing and your body will continue to adapt, for a long time. Your metabolism will stay depressed to compensate. Your arms, chest, back, core muscles, digestive system, and any unnecessary musculature will atrophy and be used as fuel. At some point your pituitary gland will stop secreting any significant TSH which will stop your thyroid from producing T3. Your body temperature will drop (about 2 degrees usually), increasing your efficiency further. None of this will prevent you from continuing to exercise and the dropoff in performance will generally be pretty slow as long as you stay at the upper end of the calorie range you mentioned above. You may even gain performance for a time until your body gets down to very low levels of body fat (below 7.0% or so for me measured with calipers is where things went south). However the gains will be solely from metabolic and aerobic efficiency. If you are losing weight and are an experienced cyclist near the upper limits of your genetic potential (in terms of muscle development), you will be, by definition, in a catabolic state and breaking down muscle.  &amp;#x200B;  I used to fast all day and then go out for bike rides, and it never affected my performance all that much, because the biggest limitation to my performance wasn't my metabolism. Your body can switch into a state during exercise where it can oxidize fatty acids very, very quickly compared to when you are resting (you are also oxidizing amino acids from your muscles obviously). My performance was limited by my consistently low leptin levels, low muscle mass, and low muscle glycogen. My best days were never ""great"". I rarely felt ""great"" after a ride the way I do now. It was just something I did, and occasionally enjoyed.",False,False

HR can be genetic.  The real measure you should be caring about is heart rate variability because the healthier you are and the more youâ€™re taking care of you body the more consistent (higher number) it will be. If youâ€™re dehydrated, over-restricting (or over eating) or really just stressing your body too much, the time between beats will vary more which is a sign of too much stress (lower HRV).   source: endurance athlete/coach who sometimes races in the pro category and notices poor performance and low HRV when I restrict too much or donâ€™t get enough sleep/self care ",False,False
