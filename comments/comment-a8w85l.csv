I'm 105 pounds and very short, so I kind of have the opposite problem. Even when I do hit my GW of being consistently 101 (which is not too far away), I'm not going to ever look as thin as someone who's tall and svelte even though they may be 10-20 pounds heavier. I've realized as I've gotten so close to being underweight that I'm going to have to be suuper underweight to look underweight since the lord blessed me with the \~stubby chic\~ look lol",False,False
