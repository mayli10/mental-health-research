There's this way you can clip your hair to give you faux bangs by putting your hair in a high ponytail and pulling it forward so I'm going to try that out to see.   Have you thought about pinning your bangs back with bobby pins or clips? I don't really wear hair extensions so I don't know if this is true or not but you may even be able to get some added in for length until they grow out. That way you won't have to deal with that style anymore. ",False,True

Anyway on that note, if you go to a hairstylist they can usually kinda help you find a style that will best suit your face. There are so many styles of bangs out there! And they all kinda do different things to different face shapes. I know that's a copout answer, but most answers you'll get based on description alone will *mostly* be anecdotal. My absolute best haircuts and colors have been when I go in and say ""here are generals on what I want, and here are my hard limits on what I dont like and what I am not comfortable with. Other than that... just do what you think will look good on me.""   But in order to do this, it has to be someone decent. Not necessarily crazy expensive but...Chances are you probablg can't successfully do this at a place that charges $5 for a haircut. ",False,False

Particularly if the hair falls like a curtain of hair with no glimpses of forehead between.  Side bangs or layered front bangs that have a cascading look (short in centre of face and longer closer to the ears) can make the face look longer. I find that bangs that end near cheekbone level can be slimming, but it depends on your face shape.
