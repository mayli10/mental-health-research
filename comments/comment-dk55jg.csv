I've been through a lot of incredibly fucked up shit in life that's objectively worse but breakups hurt the most to me. ED or no ED they can kill appetite for awhile so don't force yourself to eat right away if you can't. If you see a therapist or have the means to find one that's probably a good idea right now. Take care of yourself- you deserve all the happiness and love in the world.,False,False
