Ugh I know it must have been a blunder because the last time I went my post examination sheet literally had my weight redacted. I guess maybe he typed it in then printed the sheet. He apologized a lot but I don’t think he understood that just because it’s “standard policy” to put the weight in doesn’t invalidate the FACT that my weight hasn’t been listed for very important reasons on the sheet in the past. The clinic made great strides by blindly weighing each patient but they really need to double check the patients records before they fill out the post examination sheet.,False,True

I don't know if this helps, but there's a huge issue right now with medical offices being inundated with paperwork. Most docs are overwhelmed, overworked, and both quality of care + professional mental health nosedives.  It doesn't make the blunder okay. They absolutely should've known bettet. But if you have any suspicions that it was done on purpose or meant personally, I'd be floored if it weren't just a symptom of a harried office.",False,False
