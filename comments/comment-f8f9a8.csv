There's some local brands here and not a lot of import of protein bars and similar food items but I find that 200 cals give or take 20 is about standard for a bar that tastes OK enough i don't regret having tried it (and I'm not picky at all when it comes to sweets and snack food!),False,False

This is probably a useless recommendation given that the sub is heavily dominated by Americans and that's an European product which is probably not available in the US, but whatever, it's amazing and I wanted to put that fact out there. Seriously, it's like a Snickers or a Mars bar, it doesn't have any of the telltale protein bar taste or texture. I feel sorry for all the people who haven't had a chance to try it and think bars like Quest are actually good.",False,False

Tho where I live they aren't hlf as popular as in the US so I've never had the opportunity to try stuff that's well liked eg quest bars,False,False
