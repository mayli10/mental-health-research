I think I'm handling it pretty good but I haven't really actually left my house in 3 months and I'm horrified every time I have to.

I've never spoken or admitted to any kind of eating disorder to anyone and I never would.

People deal with death and trauma and loss by talking about it, and I just never would. It never even occurred to me before, I just wouldn't. That's really inspiring honestly.",False,False
