But because I have to track carbs to know how much insulin to dose, and seeing how the carbs/fat/protein affect my BG is really important, idk that I'll be able to stop that. But not **feeling bad** about what I see when I track has been fantastic so far.  At least apps make it super easy now, back in the day it was pencil and paper!",False,True

Given that, even when supplemented (I have no confidence that the supplements actually are doing anything for most people who use them), a vegan diet is almost definitionally deficient in multiple essential and conditionally essential nutrients, including bioavailable iron, zinc, calcium, cholecalciferol, cobalamin (possibly? No idea what's going on there, but anecdotally people are symptomatically deficient even having high blood levels), docosahexaenoic acid (which the human body cannot derive much of from Œ±-linolenic acid, and some people can't derive ANY, making this nutrient essential), carnitine (not essential, but a friend of mine hypothesises that the ""instant brain tingling energy"" recent ex-vegans experience on eating red meat is the correction of a mild carnitine deficiency), creatine, and taurine (retinol could also be a concern because not every human body can derive retinol from Œ≤-carotene), you are also clowning yourself on your chances of truly recovering from any eating disorder, because a nutrient deficient brain can get stuck in disordered eating.  This is already orthorexia, not a mere slippery slope thereto.  I've disabled replies. Downvote me to oblivion if you like. Do not even dare PM me to ask about this or to evangelise for your thinly veiled anorexia programme known as veganism.",False,False

That's a good point though, I have been looking into vegan nutrition and I'm making my shopping list for tomorrow. Brazil nuts and chia seeds are on the list! üòÄ",False,True

It also meant all my safe foods were no longer possible and I was forced to face all of my fear foods. And now I can eat potatoes, beans and sweets! It's different for everyone. For some people while having disordered eating adding in a food restriction can be detrimental but if it's going well and you find yourself eating more variety, enough and feeling better then I say carry on. A lot of people say it's another form of disordered eating but if you are truly doing it for the animals then I don't see the problem as long as you eat healthy ish and enough. I'd urge you to look up nutrition with veganisn cause some nutrients are harder to get while others easier on a vegan lifestyle by comparison to an omni one. Also make sure you definitely supplement B12. I hope this is a positive step for you as it was for me üòä",False,False

You know this lol you watched cowspiracy. For me I‚Äôd say if you‚Äôre eating ‚Äúintuitively‚Äù (eat when hungry stop when full &amp; doing things like having an Oreo if you want one) it is perfectly healthy! If it gets to the point where having an Oreo or two or three or four makes you stress out &amp; over compensate with restriction or exercise etc.  then you‚Äôre heading down the orthorexia path.  Being able to eat whatever you want whenever you want without tracking calories and weight is the long term goal.",False,False
