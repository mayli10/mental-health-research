But on occasion I down those electrolyte drinks like nobody‚Äôs business lol you should be good.

Gatorade zero and rum is def a solid option, and one of my go-tos when I need to stay hydrated. But make sure you start hydrating early and drink plenty of water day of too! Have a great time üòÅ",False,False

Or a classic vodka lemonade with sugar free lemonade. You could add mio too for more flavor. Whatever you do don‚Äôt forget to drink water!!,False,False

Jugs of mixed drinks at day drinking events are risky AF on so many levels... so please don‚Äôt forget that. I honestly think a low cal option doesn‚Äôt exist. Gatorade and rum tastes awful, jungle juice recipes can‚Äôt really be low cal...   Oh! Maybe you could do a smaller bowl with a ladle.. a very *classy* option lol with cranberry, pineapple, club soda and vodka.   Don‚Äôt mean to be preachy. I binge drank all through college, witnessed date rape situations, made sloppy drunken mistakes, which could‚Äôve all been prevented, or at least less detrimental, by literally NOT chugging from huge vessels of booze (aka bubba jug) and drinking reasonably instead (aka a can of beer)",False,False
