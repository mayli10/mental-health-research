Here's what I've personally tried so far.   [Sunergetic Brand](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01BMQRQ3E/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_apa_i_zliODbHWK5FVK). I've purchased this brand the most and it's what sold me on the supplement in the first place. Though, $20 might be steep for some people for only 240 capsules. (At four capsules a day, that's a 2-month supply.)  [NOW Foods](NOW Supplements, Psyllium Husk 700 mg, 180 Capsules https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000MGR2T4/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_apa_i_mriODbHPW9MF7). This is a well known brand and a good ""try and see"" option, imo. If you don't see the desired results, then you're only out $10 for 180 capsules, with Prime. The dosage is slightly lower, as well. They also offer a loose powder version that's excellent for keto baking recipes.   When I'm running low again, I think I'll see what's available outside of Amazon. I haven't checked GNC or Vitamin Shoppe, but I'm hoping they might offer something that's more .mg-per-pill at a reasonable price. I should warn you that these capsules are *not* small, and four of them in one sitting can be un-fun if you're less than a stellar pill-swallower.   Most of the bottle instructions will tell you: Always chase with an entire glass of water!",False,False

It's a really strong laxative though, if you can do something weaker do that instead.  When I was inpatient, we were pretty much all on Miralax and Colase.

That and the magnesium citrate will help with the current predicament.  For the future, I'd recommend investing in a bottle of psyllium husk capsules.
