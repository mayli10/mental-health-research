At this point im starting to think im addicted to it. If i eat ANYTHING that i don't know the calories of, i freak out. I would rather eat a chocolate bar that i knew the calories in than something healthier but i didn't know the count.  It makes me feel in control. It feels good to know exactly how much food is going into my body and knowing if i will lose, gain or maintain.",False,False

I've been less strict since I'm trying to gain weight, but it's still difficult whenever I eat really calorie dense foods and have to think about how much I just put inside of me.",False,False

I stopped counting calories as well because it was just so time consuming and stressful. But I still do it mentally. It feels a bit better but I still get anxious around food I can’t calculate the calories for lol. They still unfortunately matter so much even if I’m not recording them. ,False,False

I still binge and mentally calculate my food, but it's been surprisingly relieving to not feel like I HAVE to track everything. It's just one less thing to think about.  Obviously, your mileage may vary. For me, though, I think it was a step in the right direction.",False,False
