I used to know someone who estimated that I was a totally different size, like she would buy me clothes that she looked at and thought they would fit me and then she would totally get her estimation wrong. Some people just innocently assume... also if that lady shops at brands that have inconsistant sizing she may be basting estimations off of wacky info. IDK",False,False
