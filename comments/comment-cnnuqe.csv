I was underweight until I was maybe a sophomore in high school but by the time I was a freshman I had stretch marks on my ass and thighs- also where I carry most of my weight. Obviously they are hard to deal with if you didnt have them before, but try to remind yourself that stretch marks are not a sign of ""no longer skinny""  Even the skinniest people have them, and people just loooove to edit them out of photos. But they have them. I'm sorry if that doesnt help at all, but that's really the only advice I have. I struggle with mine too",False,False

I tried everything from stretch mark creams to exfoliating to mitigate them. But I’ve hit the point of accepting they’re not going anywhere.   I’ve *mostly* come to terms with them. It’s kind of like “battle scars”.   For me I cope by redirecting my focus. I plan on getting tattoos to cover them, so until then everytime I see my stretch marks I force myself to think of tattoo ideas rather than focusing on how much I don’t like them.",False,False
