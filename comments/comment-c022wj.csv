So I feel like I need to be really really skinny to make my torso look small, which is my greatest desire. I have a boxier body so I’m hoping I can really drag my curves out when I lose this final 15lbs",False,False

Which makes me want to lose a bunch of weight, but I’m worried once it’s all gone that I’ll look like a stretched out garbage bag.",False,False

I think sometimes I just want to be skinny to not have a /different/ body type. Idk for some reason all skinny people look the same?  But your way of putting weight on also makes you very unique! And a silhouette like yours often looks longer/leaner which is cool!! Rock that body guuurrrl,False,False

Most of my weight is carried on my stomach and its awful.  sorry that was so incoherent but i just want to let you know that i understand completely.",False,False

I actually have an amazing body type. Tiny waist, skinny arms, big boobs and butt and all that. I kind of look okish. But what is destroying me is that I just know that I would look like all those perfect thinspo/Instagram models if my fat fucking ass would just loose some God damn weight",False,False

For me I have a really flat tummy at a normal weight but I hold fat at my hips so I have to wear high waisted everything . When I think about how much I would have to weigh to feel good about my face compared to other ppl it makes me pretty sad and hopeless lol. But on the bright side I do think strength training based recomposition helps to an extent if you’re willing to research into it a bit !!,False,False
