It just didn't use to effect me this way because I didn't realize the whole calories in calories out business, but I don't think I ever really ate normally, just either too much or too little.",False,False

How I have no gd idea how to eat normally today but Iâ€™ve been not eating lunch at school since 5th grade because I didnâ€™t want others to see me eat. Went all through high school and college, I had this insane fear of eating in front of others. So I guess the moral of this story is this bitch never ate normally ",False,False

I was about 11 years old the last time I ate normal - 28 now :( I had a very good stretch of recovery for about 8 years prior to this, but it was still nowhere near the way I ate as a kid - eating when I was hungry, eating when I wanted, stopping when I was full.
