""Special"" low Cal foods cost a lot more than my ortho days (whole foods are so darn cheap), BED is hundreds of dollars a month down the drain, but nothing, nothing will ever compare to bulimia costs. It's basically BED times 3 because I've spent $30+ on a binge just to throw everything up, be famished again, and go buy more binge food, rinse and repeat.",False,False

A huge part of my disordered eating comes from my inability to waste food. This usually results in not buying anything ever until my house is completely empty, or this occasionally results in bingeing *thanks mom*. But seriously, I'll meticulously figure out exactly how long I have to eat everything in my house before it goes *too* bad. I'll eat the rationed portions for days.  As for clothes, my bones structure and height make the smallest thing I can ever wear a medium shirt or 30/32 pants (guy sizes). I've been wearing the same old shirts since high school.",False,False

I spend a lot on salad - leaf, broccoli, cucumber, tomatoes, etc and that gets pricey.  Especially in winter.  Everything in general's really expensive but it's possible to find some decent low cal foods if you find a good place or two.  It seems the only ED people who can afford Quest Bars and Ben &amp; Jerry's for pint parties (if that's still a thing) are those who live with their parents and have their food bought for them.
