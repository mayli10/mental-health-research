One day I just had a huge breakdown, walked out and never ever came back. Proud of you for getting out of a toxic environment and hope that you can give yourself a break if you can afford to. I'm lucky enough to be living back with my parents for the time being, but I get having a family being a huge stress for money. Take care of yourself.",False,False

The way it was worded was so nonchalant that it really does look like he says that kind of thing to me all the time, and that we could have had some sort sexual relationship. But we never have, and I've been turning down all of his advances adamantly. Men can be so fucking stupid when it comes to sex. It was a small fight that was rationally dealt with and ended fast, and I cant really blame him because how it looked was really fishy. This isnt something that normally happens and I actually have a lot of freedom and control over myself in this relationship.",False,True
