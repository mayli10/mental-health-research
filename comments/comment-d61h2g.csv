This probably sounds super weird, but I made my own ""heating pad"" which is just one of those long fuzzy socks filled with dried rice (make sure u tie TIGHT knot where the hole is) and the day after, I warm it up in the microwave for about a minute and put it on the same swollen areas.   The rice-sock-heating-pad also really helps when I get period cramps!!",False,False
