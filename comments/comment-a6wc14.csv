We were both blowing up just from weekend calories.  Luckily he put us on a fastfood ban, which has at least helped me maintain my weight loss from the week.

It's scary for sure though--definitely requires a leap of faith. ",False,False

I can stick to a strict restrictive keto diet during the week, but come to the weekend, I seem to blow a gasket and binge, binge and binge some more blowing all of my progress during the week. I've actually managed to screw myself up so badly that I'm super constipated. It's horrid.
