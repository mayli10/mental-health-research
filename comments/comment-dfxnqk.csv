That sucks, I know I had a long plateau based on weekly averages but once I started weighing in daily and cutting my sodium intake back (actually tracking it with a calorie counter app) I started moving down. Hormones and water weight really do make you seem to get stuck so I’ve seen people recommend taking measurements since those are less volatile if you’re doing those without having consumed anything in the mornings. Scale can be a tricky beast",False,False

I did the Google spreedsheet but since I've been eating 1200-1350 calories (with strict calorie counting) for four-six months now and have literally maintained on it despite the fact I should be losing about 2 pounds a month so I can't really trust it.

I'm trying to lose again now, started a few days ago but the last few months I have been maintaining at up to 2000 calories a day, with doing weight lifting and light cardio four days a week. Some days I ate only 1500 and some days I ate 2500 but I would say it averaged out to 2000. I felt a lot like I was gaining and sometimes the scale would go up and I would panic but it always went back down and I have steadily maintained since may.",False,False

Your weight is gonna fluctuate depending on a lot of factors regardless if you're eating at maintenance or below so it's recommended to try and pick a 5 lb range or so for maintenance. I know you said you've used all the calculators but have you heard of Google Doc spreadsheets and the like designed to get you a better idea of what your tdee is based off the data you give it? The one I use I believe is the 3 suns one mentioned in the subreddit R/Loseit (Takes a couple weeks work of entries I think for best results though),False,False
