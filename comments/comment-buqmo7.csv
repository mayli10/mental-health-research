Dropping under 90 lbs makes me feel uncomfortable, because being 80 or under just seems scary health wise and so risky if other people find out, but I can't stand how I look at 90 lbs because I want to be a cute skinny goth girl : /",False,False

Tape measurements can help too, but I can sort of manipulate those as well depending on sucking in or sucking out. At least with the scale, aside from water and clothes (which is why I weigh myself naked and empty in the morning), I really can't manipulate it.  If I had a reliable way of testing body fat percentage though, I'd probably rely on that too.  Also, wearing old clothing that no longer fit",False,False

I know even quite a bit lower than I am right now my thighs are still pretty big and no thigh gap. But my ribs are so prominent that laying my arm on my side while I sleep leaves bruises.
