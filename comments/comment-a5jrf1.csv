TW for recovering purgers  The worst feelinv ever is when i cannot seem to get anything out but then it's always followed by the most amazing feelong ever when all of it suddenly comes out smoothly. ,False,False

Even when I'm eating safe food, planning for the food in my calorie limit, I still think about what'll be like coming up and chew well, lol. Or if I want to purge, I eat more so it's more satisfying coming up? Even though I guess that risks keeping more calories in.   I think the heavier/ chunkier stuff is more satisfying, too! I think I worry super liquid stuff is just water/ stomach acid coming back up, so if it's chunky, I know it's food. Sounds great lol.",False,False
