It is just weird, if our bodies needed IF we would be driven to eat in that way. Tried it for a short time to see if it helped muscular growth... spoiler it didn't.",False,False

It’s completely disordered. When I was in the worst part of ED, I was eating pretty much like this and my treatment team said it was disordered. So why the hell is it ok if you’re fat? Not fair.",False,False

I am quite sceptical. I only bought this book for the recipes because they might help me make food that I like better. I don't care for his ""just have a weight loss shake if you get stuck"" advice. I'll have an actual protein shake if I need it after a workout, but I try to eat real food during my eating window.",False,True

He started out okay--developing the 5:2 diet after some studies showed an improvement in lab markers and weight following the diet. But now everything he talks about in regards to health, medicine, or weight loss *always* goes back one of his many fasting diets. So you have to wonder how truthful or transparent he's being with many of his claims. He's nearing Dr Oz territory for me",False,False
