That's not weird or excessive, that's how friendships fucking work.  I don't know if there's anyone else you could reach out to, but maybe it'd be worth reaching to someone you don't know well who's offered before and seems like a kind person. I ended up with a really special relationship that way on the worst night of my life - after my then-best-friend turned out to be a POS who just cared about herself.  I'm sorry he just doesn't fucking get it.",False,False
