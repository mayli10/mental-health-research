Where you don’t lose or gain you just lift and tone. Takes a lot longer but you won’t have to see that scale creep. Depends on your current weight though. If you’re underweight I totally encourage you to gain and lift :) ",False,False

I don't know your age, but I checked a few ages and it didn't change the number. It gives you 1590 calories to maintain your weight. If I put 20% body fat (still on the low end of normal for women, by the way!) it gives you 1440 calories.   You can definitely increase slowly to 1450-1550 without gaining any fat. Depending on how much or little you eat now, you will probably gain a little weight, but this will be all food and water weight. It absolutely won't be fat.",False,False

Often I stop purging for a while after being shocked at how sick my upper body looks like, eat like a normal person, gain a pound or two of mostly water weight and suddenly look much healthier. The cycle restarts and I drop some more weight by purging, get shocked at how sick I look, eat normally, look better, go back to purging etc.  Eating maintenance for a while and gaining water weight balances out the flabbiness well for me. My ribs and upper arms fill out significantly even if I gain just 2 pounds of water weight, making flabby parts like my stomach and love handles stick out less compared to everything else. It doesn't bother me only because I'm always fixated on my problem areas and only weigh myself occasionally out of curiosity. Weight gain only bothers me if it affects the areas I fixate on, it's welcome if it makes problem areas less apparent.  My biggest fantasy is getting down to like BMI 16 (from my current 17.2) and steadily maintaining that long-term without any disordered behaviors. Having people think anyone can't be that skinny naturally, but then being completely relaxed around food and eating intuitively. You can always dream I guess.",False,False

You can also try to find a TDEE calculator which allows you to put in a body fat percentage. If you put it on the high end you at least have a ballpark to aim at.   By slowly increasing, you avoid that sudden weight gain because of the extra food and water retention. If you enter it into a weight app like Happyscale or Libra, it calculates a trendline for you so it's easier to see if you're losing, maintaining or gaining.",False,False
