Imagine being willing to use your girlfriend's illness to hurt them even more. Can't relate.  If he's older than 17, run. If he's under 17, he's not the pick of the litter + not mature enough for a serious relationship yet.  Yes, it's the same shit constantly - just imagine how much that sucks for the person *actually experiencing it!*  Did he think he could just """"""cure"""""" you by saying the obvious rational thing to your face? He doesn't know the slightest bit about any of this, and he sounds more cruel and self-centered than interested in adapting.  For perspective, my wife and I regularly talk openly about this stuff. She absolutely doesn't get it either, but she tries: she offers to listen anyways, and she asks if there's any way she can help. Even when she says something unintentionally bad, it's always meant to be comforting, not controlling.  ""It's okay, I like you thicc!"", versus ""my basic respect for you is conditional on you bootstrapping yourself out of a notoriously insidious problem that I don't understand and will never have to solve"".  I don't like him. You should be able to seek support from your boyfriend without having to mommy his feelings about *your* struggling not being resolved yet. If he doesn't want to deal with it, cool, none of us do, so he can grow the fuck up.  Your mental health should be better with a partner than it would be when single + free to mingle.",False,False

But really, I’m so sorry you’re going through this. Everything you described is pretty much exactly what’s happening within my relationship right now, and I feel very misunderstood and like an utter burden. If you need someone to talk to, you’re more than welcome to reach out to me &lt;3",False,False

I get that it's hard for those around you when you have an ED but ultimately your partner should be there to support you. Making you feel like you can't talk about it is not a great strategy with something as destructively secretive as an ED tbh (and generally speaking I think everyone deserves to feel like they can share things they're struggling with with their partner without judgement). Nobody's perfect so of course he might not deal with things the best way all the time but really he should be educating himself on how to support you better if he wants you to recover - plenty resources etc online, I know my partners found them helpful for dealing with me. Have you told him how all this is making you feel?  I hope things get better for you.",False,False
