I was doing personal trainer sessions at my gym and counting macros and now I haven’t had a proper workout in weeks. I’m so scared that my limited progress might be being undone by my restriction, but I’m afraid of aiming for goals when I’m uncertain about the process to achieve them. and it will take so long too. I can’t get back into it because I have so little energy and I will need to eat more, and the idea of water retention terrifies me. I don’t know how to get to where I want. I keep thinking “I’m going to eat my macros and go to the gym tomorrow!” And then I’m too scared to so I barely eat instead. This standstill means I’m not going to make any progress at all, I imagine, and it terrifies me.",False,False

It's e mbarassing how small the dumbbells and weights I usr are. Gotta start somewhere though :/ it's also hard to keep my 15 min cardio warm up from turning into an hour long session and skipping the weights altogether..,False,True

I just started ""strength training"" (at this point it's more like physical therapy because of how weak I am) and the water weight gets on my last nerve so I'm just taking it slow. But yeah, no results for months is not exactly encouraging.",False,False
