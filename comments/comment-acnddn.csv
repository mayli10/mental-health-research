Also, I've used a few of those, setting the stats to 5'10 and 130lbs (BMI of about 18.5) and I didn't think anyone looked skinny. Then I looked closer and almost everyone was 5'9 and 140-150 lbs so the search algorithm was whack I guess? I've stopped checking those out.",False,False

I never got that cliché feeling of seeing myself get fatter as I lost weight. It's just that my standards for thinness keep getting more intense.   Some of the thinspo that looked crazy skinny to me a couple years before looks average to me now. Back then I would probably have been shocked by what I actually consider skinny now.,False,False

I'm 5'2"" and 99lbs and I look incredibly average. At first I thought that it was just my ""fat shape"" but I realized that I actually look the same as the girls on mybodygallery who are 5'2"" and around 100 lbs, my perspective has just changed. Lol. I used to think that 100-110 looked ""ideal"" for 5'2"". I can't find anyone on the body gallery that looks thin to me anymore and most people I know irl look huge, now all I wanna see is like Bella Hadid thinness.   I was watching youtube videos of a model talking about getting to her LW and it was 109 at 5'9, which equates to being like 80-something pounds for a 5'2"" lady. Smells like a new UGW! \*cries\*",False,False

They just make me feel extra hopeless and down on myself.  Because I have a quasi-obsession with BMI, I punched in 5’-2” and 105 pounds. By the old BMI equation it comes out at 19.2 and by the new one (supposedly improved accuracy for shorter/taller people) it’s 19.9. Both numbers are toward the lower end of the ‘healthy’ range, acknowledging of course that BMI is sort of a shotgun measurement of health. These people probably *are* slender, but from a medical standpoint at least they aren’t underweight.",False,False
