I began to recover with a BMI of 18.5. At the time, I wanted to be underweight first too, but my body couldn't take any more. Like you're saying, I was visibly unhealthy even if my BMI said otherwise.  You have to remember, once you're healthy again, you'll look back on this moment and thank yourself for choosing recovery and not letting yourself get sicker. You'll have a totally different point of view. You'll realize how truly sick you are in this moment.   You'll thank yourself for choosing to heal, because nothing good comes from remaining sick.",False,False

(Yes. You absolutely deserve recovery. Were you to lose more weight you would not somehow become more deserving of recovery. Because you already 100% deserve to live a life unfettered by an ED.),False,False
