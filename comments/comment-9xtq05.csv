I did an experiment recently where I posted a few of my body pics in one of the rating subs. I'm medically very underweight, and one of the questions I explicitly asked was, ""Do I look like I'm at a healthy weight?"". There were only a handful that said I looked underweight; everyone else was saying how sexy and \~healthy\~ I look. L M A O, I fucking wish.",False,False

One of my ex-boyfriends had an eating disorder (which we didn't realise at the time) and he'd cite ""facts"" from those subs all the time, which just made both of our disorders worse. That's the summer I hit my lowest weight ever and ended up inpatient.",False,False
