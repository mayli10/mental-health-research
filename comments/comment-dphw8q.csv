And even if they don't, I can guarantee that it doesn't come ""without a second thought"". Even if you have a good relationship with food, you don't stay slim in the fucked up food environment that is the modern world without being at least a little bit strategic.",False,False

Lower though I start hitting “unhealthy” levels of intake, so my only choices feel like restrict/eat very little to maintain/lose or try to stay within maintenance and pray I don’t gain too much.",False,False

My body gains on what should not even be a maintain intake level and the only time I can lose is when I go into a very, very low intake range. For me, I’m pretty sure it’s because I’ve damaged my metabolism from doing this for over 15 years in addition to having obesity run in my family.",False,False
