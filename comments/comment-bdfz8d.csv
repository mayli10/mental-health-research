Those of us here understand that EDs affect males too, but many people out in the world have honestly no idea. You've helped spread awareness, and maybe even helped save a life.

There's such a stigma around eating disorders in men that very few of them seek treatment when they need it because EDs are ""a girl thing."" If that's all you said, he may not have garnered that you were talking about yourself and just assumed you were standing up for men with EDs as a whole. Either way, you presented him with info he might think about the next time he tries to body shame his son in a way that very realistically could lead to an ED.",False,False
