I agree that Abbey has a lot of things I disagree with, but she gives interesting facts sometimes. Stephanie talks about her journey better, but we have to keep in mind she exercises a lot too so the fact she eats 5000 calories a day doesn't have the same impact as someone recovering when having a desk job and a family to actually care for.",False,True

But she's no supporter of eating disorder recovery. Just DIETS BAD üò¨ ohnooooo.",False,False

I don't read her blog, but I've seen some of her other What I Eat takedowns. Even when someone makes good choices, she trips over herself to shame them for their reasoning or thought process.   Then in her own What I Eat video, she made and pushed the same ""clean"" choices she always calls out as diet culture when she's reviewing someone else's day.   She calls herself a ""busy working mom"" but she has a Nanny and an Assistant for her at-home job? Okay. Sure. Whatever.   I guess her food guidelines review was good. ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è There. I said something nice too.",False,False
