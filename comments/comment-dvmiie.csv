Maybe I do have a bit of a god complex, maybe I am projecting my own issues on you in a way which is not helpful to either of us.

I guess what I want to say- is while I know that you're comments have a good intent, I feel a little bit talked down to. Sometimes people in recovery get a bit of a god complex over those who are not, and while that may not be you, it's sort of reading that way. I clearly stated that being aware of the food and how healthy it is, and also having the self restraint to not binge on it makes me happy. I don't want to have to feel bad about something that makes me happy, and your comments sort of made me feel like what i'm doing is obsessive and damaging, which it is not. It is a side thought, not an all consuming habit. I debated on responding but I think it's worthwhile... Even people who are not in recovery deserve things that make them happy, even if those things aren't strictly 'pro-recovery', like imagining meals and not eating them.   That being said, I appreciate that it seems you want the best for me, a stranger on the internet, and I wish you all the best. &lt;3",False,True

You mentioned restriction, fasting, **being cold all the time**, and you are posting on an eating disorder subreddit. These are also signs your body needs more food, and that you are not allowing yourself to have it. You talk about being surrounded by readily available and abundant food (and potentially eating it) as a threat to you. (And when you have an eating disorder, food very much does feel like a threat.) Yet you also feel drawn to food, - handling food while fantasising about eating it, and fantasising about the meals your customers make, as long as there is no threat of you eating it, that is.   You deserve to go to work and look forward to meeting regular customers, having conversations with your coworkers, feel accomplished with a good day's worth of work, and look forward to your paycheck. Not look forward to babying and pretending to eat packets of your favourite foods, playing guess-the-calories, or fantasising about the meals your customers all day. I may be wrong, and it may very well be that these things genuinely give you joy and a sense of purpose. It may very well be that these things genuinely help you with your diatary habits in positive ways. But to me, it all just seems like an expression of an abnormal relationship with food and restrictive behaviours. All this doing food stuff while not actually eating is something I can very much relate to doing. I knew it was not healthy for me. But it may be completely different for you.   I hope you are not feeling that I am calling you out unjustfully. I can not tell you what to do. In the end you are to decide whether or not anything I am saying is true to you or is helpful in any way.",False,False

My body isn't in starvation mode. I'm an average height naturally skinny guy, so I'm not eating on a massive deficit, maybe just a little less than I should. I always eat a big bowl of oatmeal before work so I feel nice and energized. And usually something midway through shift as well.

For some reason it feels really cozy for me being surrounded by healthy foods, even if I can't eat them because they're calorie dense, like fancy cheese, fruit, nuts, etc. Most of the people that shop here are a good 15-60 years older than me, which helps with the whole weigh triggering thing... but it still happens.",False,True

I don't think it is weird at all that you choose to work at a grocery store. I don't know how it is to you. But being around food without actually eating, although immensely stressful, would give me a sense of comfort.  At my most disordered, I would go to grocery stores to just look. I would be hyper aware of what others put in their carts, and spend hours reading labels on food I would never allow myself, only to end up buying one or two safe foods, just to go do the same the day after... and the day after... and the day after... I felt guilty doing this, and I was worried people would think I was trying to steal stuff, the way i was circling the grocery aisles, and never really buying anything, so I would rotate between 4 different stores in my town as an attempt not to raise suspicion. At a point I thought to myself that maybe I should apply for a job at a grocery store, so I could get away with reading labels, sorting and being around  food items all day and doing food stuff without actually eating. Which was basically what I was doing anyway.  As I am recovering, and responding to my hunger- be it mental or physical, my brain is just starting to let me think of other things than food. The food obsession and hyper awareness of food was/is just my brain trying to tell me that I desperately needed to eat. As I was not responding to physical hunger cues, I guess my brain figured I was not doing a well enough job of foraging and looking for food, so it made me hyper aware of food, and hyper interested in food. Fear would still keep me from eating it, though.  I hope you are not taking this the wrong way, but your interest in food, what others are buying, reading labels, probably is just a product of your body and mind being very very hungry. And it has all right to be so, and you have all the right to eat. I really hope you will be ready to recover one day, so that food will just be food. That you will be able to eat all the food you would like without guilt or shame, without restriction. Food should not hold this power over you. You as a human being deserve better. Take care, and all the best! &lt;3",False,False
