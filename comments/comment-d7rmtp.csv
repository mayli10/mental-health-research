It sounds lovely üíï   Sometimes when I‚Äôm scared of drinking hot cocoa, which I love!, or if I know I wanna have more than one cup, this is what I drink:  1/4 cup almond milk 3 tsp of cocoa powder 2 no cal sugar substitutes  Little bit of vanilla extract  And then top it up with hot water (or have the whole cup of almond milk!)   It‚Äôs super comforting, and it‚Äôs a way I can indulge without feeling bad afterwards. And well, you‚Äôre getting some almond milk in you and I think it‚Äôs a good little step to get rid of the ‚Äúliquid calorie‚Äù fear.",False,False
