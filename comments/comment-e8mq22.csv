Maybe it will start gradual, though not eating for 5 days sounds past gradual, but that‚Äôs how it sneaks up. You‚Äôre going to be in a medical field and as hard as this will be for you, you need to set an example for your patients. Imagine someone came to you with these thought would you tell them it‚Äôs okay if it‚Äôs only on paper (though you know they‚Äôre been doing some behaviors)? Treat yourself with kindness and don‚Äôt let yourself fall into this never-ending hope. If you feel you can walk away, do it now and start eating a healthy amount each day, you will not get overweight if you eat balanced and according to your stats.",False,False

It‚Äôs best to talk to someone in the beginning so you can stop it before it gets worse. Plus you‚Äôre tall so you should be able to eat more than the average person and you should be taking advantage of that üò≠,False,False

It sucks that a lot of the time people give genuine compliments that perpetuate disordered thinking. You have nice facial features, that is not entirely dependent on weight. And speak to somebody about it soon, in person, sometimes being secretive makes it worse, like a dirty little secret that somehow feels good to have. Your true friends and family will love you and think you‚Äôre amazing as you are.",False,False

Feeling kind of out of it and numb. Looking at the clock and counting the hours since you last ate. Looking at the scale and seeing the number go down. Hearing people ask if you‚Äôve lost weight. Your clothes getting too big. Going down sizes. How could you not fall in love with it?,False,False
