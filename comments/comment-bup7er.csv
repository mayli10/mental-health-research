I started dating a few months ago a really wonderful guy, but he's so good looking, tall and thin. I jokingly started calling him Mr Spaghetti.  But I feel so frustrated, because I want to be a Mrs Spaghetti too, and not a Mrs Cantaloupe.   I've been ED free for 5 years, and now I can feel it coming back with a vengeance.   I have no idea how to deal with it.",False,False

I try to remind myself that it’s 1. An arbitrary standard and 2. A disordered one. Competitiveness in ED is really tough, I literally compare myself to everyone, even my children, argh. You’re not alone!",False,False
