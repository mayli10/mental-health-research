Eating just below maintenance with some gentle exercise would be the way to go.",False,False

If that is not an alternative, a relatively safe and not too unhealthy way to shed a couple of pounds would be to cut out carbs and salt starting a few days before the wedding.    The water weight I lose when I cut out carbs and salt always makes a huuuuge difference in my case.",False,False
