Unlike parents who never had an ED, it's good that she'll have some understanding and she'll have a clue what being eating disordered is all about.  My own mum still doesn't get it after all these years (but she's supportive anyway :) )  Really I'd want you to tell your therapist because even if you don't think b/p is a big deal and that it's not severe right now, it can get that way.  The longer you leave it, the more ingrained the patterns become so it's best to get help asap.  It's really, really hellish to be suffering in silence with all the thoughts about food, what you should do, what your friends think about you, etc.  Getting it out in the open is the best bet (in my experience).   It's like depression.  If you don't talk about it, it festers and grows.  Your therapist can give you help about how to talk to other people about it for a start which is good.  You have an eating disorder and I get the thing about making it more real.  Even after a long time I don't like to talk about mine with people I don't know very well (acquaintances, even friends).  My problem is I hate fuss and making other people concerned.  It's only natural that people who care are going to worry about you, or they'd be shitty friends.  I hope you can talk to your therapist and your mum about it.  I don't like to think that you're keeping it all inside because I know how bad that feels. x",False,False
