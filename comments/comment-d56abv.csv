That’s scary, bc I had super low potassium levels after an OD (didn’t eat or sleep for way too long and my heart was messed up) and I still struggle to get enough.   I’m going to be a lot more conscious of that going forward. Thanks :)",False,False

I read somewhere that the #1 cause of death in anorexics is potassium deficiency (bc the heart gives out due to that) so make sure you are getting enough of all your electrolytes to stay safe,False,False
