Seriously, I could have written this. Livejournal was everything. For years I spent so much time on there, constantly comparing, reading entries of other people etc. It was so distracting. So I second this. It is not too late. It is okay that you are ranting, it's okay that you want to share your feelings. But if you can, reach out to your friends and loved ones. You aren't alone.",False,False

Back in my day there was a thing called ""livejournal.com"". I was doing the exact same thing and I missed out on an entire summer of friendships because i compared myself to all my fit friends. I completely regret it.   Be a teenager. Hang out with friends. Be comfortable with *you*. Anorexia will be your friend for a short while, but eventually it will turn on you. Keep your friendships so you will have someone to turn to when you need help.  I literally left *all* my friends because they ""didn't understand"" and my life went downhill fast. So if you need any help, don't be afraid to ask. You're not alone.",False,False
