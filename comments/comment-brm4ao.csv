I'm also in the 20+year club, and I realize how bad it sucks.  Try to think of even just one non-ED thing that you want to be alive for.  It doesn't have to be a big thing.  Something like a TV show you want to watch the next season of.  Just an excuse to put off the decision a little while longer.  Or a visit to/from a loved one that you don't want to miss.  Your negative feelings are completely valid and I wouldn't dare to suggest that you shouldn't have them, but the good things in life are also part of reality, and that's easy to gloss over in the face of your pain.",False,False
