Sometimes even three times!  &amp;#x200B;  I'm not even sure if the broccoli's the reason, but it fits the pattern.  It's worth a shot if you like the stuff, plus it's good for iron.  There doesn't seem to be any other food that helps but I realised a long time ago laxatives aren't worth it.  I kinda just let nature take it's course, hate what seems like a gain, then air punch when it's all out and the number's lower.    &amp;#x200B;  &amp;#x200B;",False,False

It's like taking Vitamin C or any other vitamin.  Laxative mess with your kidney function because they disrupt electrolyte balance (and kidneys' main function is to regulate those, so it gets all kinds of confused).  Magnesium comes from food usually, so it's like eating a lot of magnesium-rich food, and your body extretes the excess.   AFAIK it isn't a diuretic, so it won't affect sodium channels (which is how the laxatives affect everything.)",False,False
