That def doesn't sound easy and I'm so proud of u.  I know how stressful it must be to look at photos of yourself, but for other people who see you all the time irl, their image of you wouldn't change because of any particularities in your photo. Because, well, they're used to seeing you as you are.   Think about how you feel when you see photos of other people, e.g. your friends and family! Even badly taken photos, or shots from ""bad"" angles, or those where they are wearing ""unflattering"" clothes. You'd know that any """"weird"""" bits are resultant of the clothes/poor phototaking/etc, and you likely wouldn't fixate on any flawed specificities of their appearance.  Stay strong &lt;3",False,False
