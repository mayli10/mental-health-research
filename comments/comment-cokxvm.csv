Let her have control of her diet without judgment. Be supportive even if it doesn’t make sense as long as she’s not purging. Go to couples therapy, with a therapist who understands eating issues, to figure out coping mechanisms for the two of you to try. If you judge or take control away.. that is most likely a trigger. Eating disorders are very often not even about the food. They are most commonly about control, shame, punishment/self harm, depression.. and there is even a whole host of stuff that’s not common but triggering just the same. Every person is different and every ED is different.. some times it’s how a person’s OCD presents.. you never know until you wait.. and observe without judgement and hit the therapy.",False,False

My comment probably sounds mean but I'm not trying to be. Although I'd suggest apologizing to your gf and say ""I didnt know how my comments may have been affecting you, I'm sorry"" or however you want to do that",False,False

If she's not bulimic, it wont harm her to eat more. When you say she feels sick after eating, what do you mean.   Also, if she asks for food and you say ""but we just ate"" she will automatically assume that you think she's fat and gross for eating and wanting to eat more. And also, it's not your place to say if she should be able to eat now. You are not in her body and you cannot know if she needs food or not. If she has a restrictive ED it is guaranteed she has a large deficit from a long time and that her body needs more food than a different, non ED person",False,False

When you say helping is usually the worst way to go, are you meaning that I should get her food when she asks for it, even if we've just eaten recently?",False,True

I understand that you are worried. I understand that you feel helpless.. but if you try to “help” before you seriously dive into the whole physiological cluster fuck that is the world of ED’s then you will only hurt her, and your relationship.  You have to understand that this is not something that will ever go away. This is you dating and being committed to someone who will struggle for this her whole life. The best you can aim for is trigger reduction and management... and that doesn’t happen unless she is ready.   Honestly the best thing you can do is give her as much emotional support as you can, ask her to go to couples therapy with you, and wait till she asks for help. Then she will be willing to work towards improving.  You have to think of an ED like it’s a  lifetime illness or a “chronic cold”. You can manage the symptoms, but there will be flair ups... and you need to establish coping mechanisms for when there are flair ups and a different set for when she’s “doing pretty good”.  I’m sorry man, them’s the breaks, good luck.",False,False
