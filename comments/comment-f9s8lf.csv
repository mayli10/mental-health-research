I didn‚Äôt eat for a long time and it‚Äôs all a bit hazy, but I stopped drinking water too so I was sent there. They just tried to talk me into drinking water or eating and I wouldn‚Äôt. Then the psychologist just noted it on my chart and didn‚Äôt even tell me. I didn‚Äôt even know I‚Äôd been diagnosed until the next day when an intern asked me if thats what I was there for because it was noted in my chartü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è  I was pretty underweight at the time though so I think it was really rather sloppily done. Not that they weren‚Äôt right, but I still feel like I should‚Äôve been informed of what was going on",False,False

It was a long time ago but I think I just turned up one day looking for help but I didn't feel I could ask for help for my ED so I mentioned I was concerned my periods had stopped (lol, I can't think why...) then got weighed and diagnosed then and there after a few questions - but I had a low BMI and it was pretty cut and dry). Got put on a waiting list for psychiatric help and weekly medical checks with the GP.  No useful help, but at least I got a swift diagnosis.  ETA: Good luck navigating the system. I'd certainly consider seeing the specialist, if you're not in a position where they can force you into treatment. Maybe get an initial appointment with no commitment if that's possible.",False,False

I only saw him a couple of times, and honestly it wasn‚Äôt even really the focus of our conversations but he threw it in the mix apparently. Then my psychiatrist changed it I think to bulimia when I saw her, and that‚Äôs how it remains on my medical records.",False,False
