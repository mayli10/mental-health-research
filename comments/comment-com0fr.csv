Not all are so shitty. You're hurting now, but in time you will find someone worthy of your affection.",False,False

I’ll just cry it out and hopefully feel better. You’re right about him being an asshole, and I’ll eventually come to accept that completely, with any luck. I’ve doted on him for years, though. In a twisted way it’s motivation, you know? Plus there’s denial, like would he want me if I was skinny? Would he care if I starved myself to death? This is so messed up",False,True

All I can say is that it says more about him, not you. He's a liar and a cheat. You deserve better. You shouldn't hate yourself because he's an asshole.   He wasn't a bad bf overall. We just happen to be better friends than a couple and I'm okay with that. Especially since spiraling into my ED which he has no idea about. I think that'd be too much for him. When we got together he was already dealing with the aftermath of my almost suicide attempt and struggle with self harm. He's not the best when it comes to dealing with serious shit, especially mental shit.",False,False

He said I was beautiful and stuff, and I talked to him a little about my ED. I can’t tell if I’m more angry or upset, and I honestly have never hated myself more. Makes me want to starve :/  I’m glad he’s your ex, that shit really kills your confidence. Thank you for commenting, this sub is my only hope now haha &lt;3",False,True

My ex, when we were together and still even now (we're still friends) would mention girls he thought were hot. Surprise surprise they were all much thinner than me and way more beautiful. He did this just yesterday.. showed me a pic of a guy with 2 girls that had hardly any clothing on and mentioned how hot they were. I'm like ... :l and in my head: wtf did you see in me if that's what you're into?   It often made me think when we were together.. how could he like me, but also like them when we're completely opposite?",False,False
