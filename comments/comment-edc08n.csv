Cabbage is one of the best natural lax.   Also really filling and one of my only safe foods lol",False,False

People who are smaller probably don't need as much. If tea has caffeine it won't hydrate as much because caffeine is a diuretic, but tea doesn't tend to have much caffeine so that shouldn't be a big issue. Lots of teas are also naturally caffeine free.",False,False

I’ve been getting around 6- 8 cups of either water or tea in a day but it’s really hot where I am so I’ll need to up my intake for sure. I’ve been naturally eating a lot of fiber as fruit, I thought that would be enough but alas :(",False,True

Or any fluid really as long as it isn't a diuretic. Getting enough water could help soften stools and promote good BMs. Fiber helps too, but I find that taking fiber supplements just makes my stomach hurt more. I only take them if I had abnormally low fiber from my diet for the day. Like, under 50% RDA. The RDA is based on a 2000 calorie diet anyway, so I can't imagine I need all of that.",False,False
