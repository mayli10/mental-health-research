It's okay if you don't always feel ready to recover, your motivation isn't always gonna stay at 100%. One thing I personally find helpful is keeping a note on my phone that listed WHY I want to recover and WHY it outweighs the pros of my eating disorder. So when I'm feeling like I want to run back to my ED, I can remind myself why I'm trying recovery instead.",False,False

I accepted help about four - three years ago. Sometimes I relapse into old habits and restrict but the person I am now is not in that cold, tired, constantly hungry, miserable and tension filled place.   Support Groups for me were a big help during my treatment.   It was scary looking for help at 31-32 years of age &amp; looking back at it now. It was always going to be scary. If I am honest. To talk about how I had been living my life. Honestly I was terrified and hurt to open up about my EDâ€™s. Looking back now in hindsight it has definitely given me a better quality of life. I am not a 100% and some days I am not even 35%. I am working to recovery and trying to be a better me for me. I will still bounce back into bad habits (like this week) but I am aware of it and can learn from it and manager the consequences, high and lows.  Just keep posting, keep talking, keep trying even if you canâ€™t see the results and you feel like youâ€™re getting nowhere and writing a journal helps.",False,False
