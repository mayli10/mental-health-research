Maybe dropped? Literally don't even know, when I stood up. it is possible that your blood pressure is higher as a result of your behaviors, but it's also possible that it's a result of what is going on in your body right now (like you need to get some sleep or fluids). keep in mind that none of this is permanent and that if you are having health consequences that you can heal",False,False

It's also possible for things like caffeine, water loading, and recent sodium intake to affect your blood pressure. Try not to sweat it too much and maybe try measuring your BP again at a time where you are feeling more relaxed and fluid-balanced.",False,False
