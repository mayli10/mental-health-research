It sounds like you had a really nutritious and actually yummy day of eating. I would suggest, if you have insurance and money for it, finding an ED therapist. At the risk of sounding rude, since you are obese you maybe (I dont want to be too presumtuous) have an issue with emotional eating or maybe boredom eating, etc., and a therapist who is trained in ED and intuitive eating would be very helpful to address what causes you to overeat/ binge. If that isnt the case for you please ignore that part of the comment.  Either way, congrats! What a great day! I hope you keep working to have more like it!",False,False

I usually try to count everything even if it's safe food tho  Also happy cake day!,False,True

You've got this ðŸ’• I hope I can learn to follow my hunger cues and intuitively eat too. Do you think the types of food you ate helped? Like the fact it's healthy food?,False,False
