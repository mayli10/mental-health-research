Like, way worse than any constipation I've ever gotten outside of restricting. And you can feel it. Like you have the feeling of needing to go number two but you won't actually be able to go for a few days. That pressure will just sit in my lower intestine no matter how long I sit in the restroom. Plus, since your food waste isn't going anywhere, the number on the scale can go up even though you're actually loosing. It's super triggering! So, imagine needing to go badly (and trying to fall asleep with that feeling!) and feeling depressed cause the number on the scale isn't going down. That's why we get excited about actually being able to use the toilet. It's also contributes to why laxative abuse is so common in the community. Tho sometimes even that doesn't help! I use miralax and it sometimes lets me go twice a week instead of only once :c .   I think it may also be because talking about bathroom stuff is usually considered inappropriate, especially in girl-dominated spaces. Sometimes it's nice to talk about stuff you can't talk about with polite company ðŸ˜‰.",False,False
