Oh ya u think I look great? Awesome then I’ll take it up 10 notches. Imo talking about someone’s body changes is irresponsible if you’re not their doctor or dietician or whatever,False,False

Big women enjoy their bodies in spite of everybody, loving your curves has always felt to me like “cause nobody else will” it’s advice to compensate with confidence what you lack in actual value.   Also, I don’t think skinny women ever got to have fun either. I remember the early 2000’s, when fashion was skeletons and all movies and TV made bulimia jokes and praised women who looked like Cameron Diaz but “aren’t afraid to eat a cheeseburger” so if they weren’t just magically perfect, they were vain, dumb sluts.   Culture just thinks it’s ok to keep everyone in a constant state of feeling flawed.",False,False

For a public person, she's pretty private, even about her weight loss—I think that should be respected.¯\_(ツ)_/¯  Modern positivity isn’t perfect, but I think it’s a step up. Maybe I’ve had a better experience with it.",False,False

I remember back when J. Lo was arriving on the music scene and she was a regular sized for woman and everyone back then was into the super skinny look and they thought JLo as too big and that her butt was too fat. It seemed to always be looked at negatively that she was not slim in every aspect.   Now it’s all about shaming the smaller sizes and praising the “thicc” body types. It’s like leave us alone society and let us be whatever size we want. We ourselves put enough pressure on what we look like we don’t need the added amount of pressure from society.,False,False
