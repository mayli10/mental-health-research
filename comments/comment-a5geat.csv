That will definitely be difficult but I'm sure you can do it. Another trick I do when I'm forced to eat fear foods is take insanely small bites and chew really slowly, and pause between bites. It got me through tortellini last night! It's easier if you approach it from the angle of ""this is the only one I get so I better enjoy it for as long as possible.""",False,False

I felt much better once I packaged the cookies up and put them in the dining room away from me. I’m dreading baking cookies next week at my moms house. Her house alone is a trigger for binge eating and now I’m gonna in a kitchen filled with cookies. I plan on loading up with unsweetened tea, gum and chicken broth while I bake and getting the hell out of there when I’m done. ",False,True

There are a few things in my house I know I can't touch because when I do I'll be out of control. Usually I try to just distract myself, starting with some kind of immediate gratification, like tv/youtube, or even obsessively on EDsubs/tumblr. Sometimes I research diets that I never pick up, go on my treadmill (while watching something entertaining), or have some coffee. I have zero calorie sweetener I sometimes use in it if I need a sweet fix.",False,False
