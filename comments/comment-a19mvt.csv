I know for me intuitive eating and trying to eat consistently without overdoing it doesn't work as well as just being able to fast then eat. I feel like my body runs better and I have more energy and focus on IF. I don't necessarily think IF needs to be synonymous with an eating disorder. I think you can still recover from the ED part without having to give up IF. Many people on r/loseit use IF healthily and it's been proven by many studies how beneficial it is. You can say to people, ""Look, I know I had an eating disorder and I was doing things that weren't healthy for me. However I have learned a lot about myself, my body, and things through my recovery. I know that before I was using IF alongside the other parts of my disorder. But I am in a different place now, and I've been able to recognize and work on the parts that were not healthy. So yes, I am choosing to do IF, because it is a system that works for me and is proven to be beneficial and I know I am making better choices so I know my overall health is better. I would hope that you can understand and respect the way I now choose to handle my body and diet knowing I am committed to being truly healthy and that it is not putting me in danger.""   I'm so happy you are working on overcoming this, and you are strong for it. But you still have every right to be in control of your body and diet, and you know what works for you better. Your recovery is your journey, you are yourself, and it is good you have a support system that can help you become a better you, but that does not mean that every way they are is exactly how you should be. You are implementing things that work for you, you are not trying to live to appease them or be them. You have to do your recovery and your life for yourself because doing things solely for others is not going to lead to any consistency or happiness for you. ",False,False

""B/R in a way that doesn't make a mess of me"" ...yessssss exactly.  in a way that actually has legit physiological benefits.  really my social life is the only thing that suffered from IF (and only when I started doing the more extreme kinds of IF like ADF or multiple-day fasts).   OMAD is generally pretty socially OK for me because most days I hurry off to work while my partner is still asleep.  so no one cares if I skip breakfast and no one cares if I don't eat at work.
