I’m trying to cut back on my “sugar free/low carb/low cal” stuff around friends because I noticed my disordered habits effecting the way they viewed their own diets. I want to bring something sugary and full fat and fun! I think I will be able to allow myself to have one at the party with them. I just didn’t want to binge on the ingredients!,False,True

It must look so strange to non ED people to bring food you’ve cooked and then proceed to watch them all eat it and then refuse to try it yourself.,False,False
