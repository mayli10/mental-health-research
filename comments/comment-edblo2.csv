Both answers are no.   An eating disorder is by nature a mental/psychological problem, it doesn't matter if you're overweight, thin, obese, or average. I've been obese most of my life until the last year, when my disordered thoughts started due to a very bad relationship.   Before, my thoughts werent consumed by food or my self image or feelings of worthlessness. I was obese because I didn't know/care about nutrition or fitness, and neither did my friends or family, I was comfortable in my situation. I wasn't ""binging"" because it wasn't a mental compulsion to stuff myself, I just ate because I liked to eat.  I'm a normal weight now, but now all I think about is food. All I think about is calories. All I think about is losing weight. It encompasses every part of my life and mental state.   I dont know if that answers your question, but unless the mental aspect is attached,  the behaviors that seem ""disordered"" don't automatically mean someone has an ED, no matter what they weigh",False,False

I think a lot of people are just woefully ignorant about food/nutrition.   I’ve had to teach/correct various family members about serving sizes and the fact that healthy is not synonymous with low calorie (“but I only use good quality olive oil” yes but I am horrified by how liberally you pour that shit all over everything you eat; “I don’t eat junk food, if I get hungry I’ll snack on nuts and fruit” mmhmm I’m familiar with your 500+ calorie snacks; “I always have salad with dinner and don’t use dressing” no just more olive oil, also your pasta dinner might be whole wheat with vegetables mixed in but pesto is not a diet food and this is why you’re gaining weight).",False,False
