It pisses me off immensely. I didnt know this about him until long after we were married I'm going to start with that before I continue with what I have to say. We've been together 10 years. I'm bipolar depressive, OCD, anxiety, ADHD and ED. IM on multiple medications to treat these. I've never once told him about anything i dealwith other than anxiety and OCD that are blatantly obvious and drive him nuts because of the way he talks about mental disorders. I take, wellbutrin, strattera, topomax. He says it's made up and that people need attention and are cry babies. I personally believe knowing what i deal with personally that he has mental issues as well but he'd never admit to it. It burns me to my core.",False,False

Maybe as a way to invalidate himself, like if he doesn’t recognize it, then he doesn’t have to deal with it. Which might be why he’s better at not invalidating you for yours. Idk I don’t really have advice other than to be wary. Your brain probably isn’t super kind to you if my experience of this disorder is anything similar to yours, so surround yourself with people who are kind to you and your suffering ❤️",False,False
