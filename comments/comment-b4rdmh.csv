Seeing the horrible person he became after we broke up helped me let go of that feeling. But everyone heals at their own pace, it’s good that you’re waiting until you feel comfortable again! that’s the best thing you can do ",False,False

I think it’s still too soon for me to put myself out there (which makes the fact that he’s on Tinder already hurt even more lol). Even just talking to other guys in my life platonically makes me feel like I’m cheating on him... I know it’ll get better with time. This isn’t my first breakup rodeo. But this shit fucking sucks in the moment...  Here’s to hoping we both make it through this. 💪,False,True

I downloaded tinder because I didn’t have anyone activity in my life and I knew he had several girls he would be hanging out with. I still think it was a good decision for my mental health and anxiety to meet new people. And to remind myself that there are others out there, and my ex is not the only one.",False,False
