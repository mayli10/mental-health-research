What are the short and long term effects? How will I benefit or not benefit from this from an outsider's perspective?)  It's really important to honestly and with some vulnerability ask yourself, ""What can I do right now that will improve this situation"", and I absolutely know you already know the answer to that question.   If none of this really resonated, please excuse me. I'm wishing for your happiness today and I hope you're able to make it through this bad mental health day and find some peace.",False,False
