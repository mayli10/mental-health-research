Starved of something.  Pretty sure some brainy PhD people have written stacks about it, but that's more or less what I think.  Even though I don't want to look emaciated any more, I'm still hanging on to be thin because I want the professionals to know they still haven't ""fixed"" my issues.

Now I think of the damage it does internally and I don't want to get to a really knackered state.",False,False
