He CAN pick me up and carry me but like the dude is 6 feet and 135 lbs soaking wet which is only like 20lbs more than me so I mean he's strong but I'll never be light enough to be thrown around.,False,False

So there is still hope! I also have a partner who's like 6'3"" and I loooove getting picked up by him bc it's fun to be up that high.

I totally understand why you would take those comments to heart but you have to remember if he‚Äôs into you, he‚Äôs into you. Not everyone is into the wild stuff and getting thrown around in the first place. The path to recovery is super hard and comments like that are gonna happen and they‚Äôre gonna sting even if it‚Äôs not necessarily even about you.   It‚Äôs okay to feel that way, you just have to remember that he digs you and finds you sexy in your current state, that‚Äôs all that matters. (PM me if you ever need to talk !!)",False,True

I knew that the moment he said it. He doesn't like skinny at the best of times and certainly didn't like me being really sick. He prefers softer, rounder, women. Like even much bigger than me. He compliments my chubby recovery body way more enthusiastically than he ever did my skinny one, and it definitely seems to please him more. He was purely talking about his own strength. I do KNOW this.   But fuck it fucking destroyed me tbh when he said it. I'm already struggling with accepting popping my head into overweight BMI range and that just hit me like a tonne of bricks. I did tell him I was 'a bit upset' about it and he reassured me, but I'm more than just a bit upset ofc. I hate that I hurt so much over a totally innocent (and actually quite loving in tone/context) comment... I felt crazy... glad to read this today for the reminder that I'm not the only one whose brain does this shit.  I want to be light enough for him to be able to pick up like he wishes he could :'( I love him so much, he deserves the best. I fucking hate that I'm not, and that I am not what he wants in that way. I can get over not being what other people want/prefer, but I do want to be what HE wants and now I'm just so sad. I know he blamed his own lack of strength but I don't think he is weak at all, so all I can do is blame myself. He's also like a foot taller than me so I should be light enough for him to pick up.  Idk I shouldn't even be participating in this subreddit because I am steadfastly in recovery and at a a stable weight and need to stay in total recovery-minded spaces but fuck today is just really hard and I have no one else to vent to about this  I'll feel better after I can see him again and he can give me a cuddle and I can tell these thoughts to fuck off but thats not for a few days and fuck.  Rant over lol",False,False
