Now I feel huge, unattractive and massively overweight at a BMI of 19.  It's a moving goalpost that won't be reached for me. If/when I get closer to the next low goal weight I'll just continue to hate myself and drop lower. It comes with the territory.   I felt WAY more happy/beautiful at a higher weight before my restriction got  compulsive. It's normal and I recommend mindfulness exercises if you're concerned.  Meditation, exercise and stretching release significant endorphins and help with my stuff. Also reading, video games and distractions help with coping in general for me.   But if you're looking for someone to acknowledge what you're going through, üñêÔ∏è  You're not alone",False,False

I also think a large part is that body composition can change with rebound weight gain. For instance, I‚Äôm currently back to the same number I was at before low restricting, but my body looks way worse than before. Through my ED I lost muscle, and then the regained weight was almost all fat that distributed unforgivingly.   That being said, everyone‚Äôs body is different, but the dissatisfaction you described so well ‚Äî feeling that shadow of your previous ‚Äúbest‚Äù ‚Äî leaves a lot of us chasing for a lower number in hopes we can hit that ‚Äúhigh‚Äù again.

Only, I wasn't. I reached the number again but my body felt really different. It's as if every time I gained I had to lose more than I did before in order to feel similarly satisfied (though this satisfaction also did not last long). I'm not sure if this is the same as what you are feeling, but it could just be a result of the nature of EDs. ",False,False
