Take this time to feel what you're feeling and I assure you, it sucks today, maybe even more tomorrow, but it will suck less the next day and even less the next day after that. Be gentle with yourself. Be good to yourself. ",False,False

It seems the best advice would be to talk more with him about it, listen to exactly how he feels and share with him how you truly feel (in depth). All you can do at this point is accept it for what it is and find comfort in knowing that it's not you at all, he just needs to work through his own stuff. Who knows, there may be something greater awaiting for you. ❤️",False,False
