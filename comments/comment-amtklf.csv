My understanding is that higher concentrations ~could~ be dangerous to pack into a single little pill that sits in your stomach, so they don't make em that way.  Some good whole foods suggestions in here, but you could also try juicing or making smoothies out of spinach and other leafy greens. If you throw in some apple or a few pineapple chunks it tastes like fruit more than anything. üòä  You could also add some electrolyte water, or zero calorie Gatorade to your day. Check out the nutrition info on protein bars if you're into those, I think they usually have added potassium?",False,False
