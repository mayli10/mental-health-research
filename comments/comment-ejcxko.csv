Personally, I think of it more as a guideline for the ""normal"" people.  My bf has a BMI of 28 and is not the slightest bit overweight, but really muscular. BMI doesn't include if your weight is more fat or more muscle.  Also: You probably look ""chubby"" because you gained water weight. Through starvation you also lose a lot of muscle and those are hard to get back, especially as a female.",False,False

It‚Äôs a super simple (ie. crude) calculation developed by some polymath dude in the 1800s iirc and I don‚Äôt think he ever intended it to be used the way it is today. It‚Äôs so crude it‚Äôs practically a qualitative measure, but because numbers are technically involved I think people perhaps give it undeserved credence. I also have no idea where those thresholds came from - they sound completely arbitrary to me. And since it doesn‚Äôt account for gender or body composition, people with similar BMIs can appear quite different. I do trust that being UW comes with health consequences (and I‚Äôve absolutely experienced that)...it‚Äôs just, ya know, where the threshold is for a particular person can vary.   My ED brain still can get totally fixated on the various thresholds and what my current number is and what weight correlates with a bunch of 0.5 increments. But I think for me that partly arose out of the medical profession‚Äôs own reliance on BMI in the diagnostic process (at least in the old DSM). And partly it‚Äôs just another number for my brain to obsess over. Moaar numbarrss.",False,False
