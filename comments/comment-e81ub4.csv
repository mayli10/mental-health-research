People don't like to be confronted with that awful reality. They'd prefer it to come from a 50 year old so we can say ""oh, that was 30 years ago, look how much better the industry and we as a society are now!""  I have a sort-of friend who is a model (in LA, nothing super high fashion but on billboards and shit) and I'm only just realizing that she definitely has an eating disorder.  Or maybe it's just my relapsing making me think everyone is disordered hah.  I thought she was just an awful cook, but nope, it's the ED stopping her from just cooking regular food lol.  She doesn't really care about the model ""lifestyle"" and is married and fairly settled down, but that shit still affects her.  She will barely eat the day before a shoot...because that's just what you have to do.  It's practically demanded, but no one wants to talk about it.",False,False

I of course don’t have anything wrong w/ people at different points in the process but a lot of people won’t disclose the reality of their situation or if they do, they do so in a graphic manner that simply stroke their ego and trivializes the illness and invalidates others &gt;:( urgh",False,False
