I mean, sometimes when people are taking certain medications it lowers their appetite and it isn’t like they’re consciously restricting.",False,False

Some people are stable at low BMIs but I'd say that below 15/16 is where the body struggles to function and actual effort has to be made to maintain a low weight.",False,False

I'm not handling my weight gain in a healthy way at all but if I had to choose that kind of depression with all the side effects or where I'm at now most of the time I'd choose now   Unless I'm currently on a scale then I'd choose then but what can ya do,False,False

Nothing tasted good and I had no appetite and when I got treatment and started to regain an appetite, I gained a ton fast and was like wait jk I'm not naturally skinny. So I guess I'm trying to say that someone may *think* that they're naturally really thin (BMI 16-17 ish) but there might still be an underlying cause",False,False
