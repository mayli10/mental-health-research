(not a tip - i recognize that isn’t healthy and don’t condone using for weight loss),False,False

Weight-neutral I think is just more of a statical assessment of a med (so, low likelihood of effecting weight based on the collected data).   My understanding is many meds have such shockingly long side effect lists partly because of the reporting requirements from the trials. Sometimes it showed up in only a small percentage of people or was mild - but they still gotta list it. Which is why I like to know the overall statistical assessment if possible rather than the Y/N of a side effect being listed.   Best of luck! I hope it’s a positive experience.",False,False

Do you think I should ""weight-neutral"" med instead of ""something that won't make me gain weight""?",False,True

I think the gain was because they created this insane endless mind-hunger for me and I ate more than I ever normally would. (Versus some unavoidable ballooning like say with steroids). Latuda was the antipsychotic that was weight neutral for me, but my current insurance won’t cover it and it’s $$$.   I like lamictal myself. There’s no apparent impact on my appetite or weight. My understanding is the rash is a pretty small risk if the titration protocol is followed. (And you stick with good med compliance.) I thought I heard lithium is pretty weight neutral too, though it comes with the annoyance of periodic blood tests to check levels.   Absolutely advocate for what you feel will be helpful! A “weight-neutral” med is what I ask for, and I explain my experiences/feelings along with how sticking with these meds safeguards my med compliance.",False,False
