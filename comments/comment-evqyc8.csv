Five lbs is an entire size difference in the top of a normal weight range. 130 lbs = size 6, 124 lbs = size 4. Iâ€™m straddling OW and obese rn and i drop a size every 8-10 lbs which is definitely not the case for a tall obese person. Itâ€™s like Iâ€™m always a month away from totally ruining my wardrobe",False,False

I remember us talking about weights in school for maths when I was like 9 and hearing all the other (much shorter) girls say how much they weighed made me feel horrifyingly  L A R G E cause I was 9 and had no concept of BMI or weight being proportionate to height. Still is kinda triggering to see people saying a weight like its big when it would be UW for me, I have a weird fixation on being the same weight as an ""average height"" person.  Maybs tall people and short people should unite in our trauma and take down the average heighters..... ðŸ™ƒðŸ™ƒðŸ™ƒ",False,False
