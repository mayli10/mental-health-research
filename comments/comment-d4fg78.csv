I know my ""binges"" usually mean me hitting maintenance calories at the most, wheras other people's can be well in the thousands of calories. But 95% of the time I usually eat far less than maintenance, so I definitely feel incredibly guilty, shameful and have to restrict to 'make up for it' when I eat more than I'm comfortable with. It gets even worse if I haven't pre-planned/logged cals to eat that much, or if I eat a bigger serving size than I had planned to. I also can't really eat past the point of feeling full like other people describe with their binges. It's often just one or sometimes a few different fear foods - snack/junk foods and most carbs are major fear foods for me.   Eating past the point of fullness (where I might've had a bigger serving size, or more servings of, junk food) has made me feel so uncomfortable and distressed at the calories that I have purged. This has only happened a few times, however - anxiety over cals usually sets in, and I stop well before I eat enough to feel physically uncomfortably full.  It's probably also important to note that often these ""binges"" take the form of me snacking on junk/fear food around other people esp at events and parties. This is usually planned in advance for me, in the hope of concealing my restrictive habits from friends &amp; family. Even if I don't eat more than I had logged cals for, I still freak out the whole time and for days after because of the ""binge"". (However, eating snack foods alone also causes the same anxiety.)  I've been wondering if it really 'counts' as a binge at all. I definitely feel that way, but objectively, me either a) planning to eat junk, pre-logging cals, eating it and then regretting it or b) snacking on junk I hadn't planned for and then regretting it to the point where it sends me into serious depression and anxiety for the following days....  doesn't really sound like the behaviour that usually meet criteria for a binge. is that just what non-ed people would call snacking?? since it's never even over maintenance?? is it even a binge??   I really want to know just so I can set it straight in my head. I haven't been diagnosed but I suspect I'm suffering from AN - but my ""binges"" make me feel like I couldn't be a ""real"" anorexic. However, my ""binge"" behaviour doesn't sound like a valid bulimia/BED - related binge either.  Thanks for sharing OP, it's comforting to hear someone else understands!   Sorry for huge vent, it's been on my mind a lot lately! If anyone has any advice, it'd be very welcome.",False,False
