I will definitely check out NEDA &amp; see what I can find there. I really appreciate you sharing your experiences with me. I have a feeling my insurance will be a similar process.. but good to know it can be appealed!,False,True

My therapist ""broke up with me"" but in a MUCH more professional manner because she had no experience with EDs and recommended I find a specialized person. I'm now with a program so I have a treatment team for IOP.  NEDA has a chat option and you can ask them for providers or treatment options in your area and then from those see which takes your insurance. You may have to appeal your claim (I did) because insurance might give a denial just to try and weasel out of it, but one call and now I'm in IOP.",False,False

I’ve been in therapy before but my therapist literally ghosted me &amp; one day just stopped answering my calls/emails/even wrote her a letter :(   I’m worried if I seek out a treatment facility they won’t let me keep my vegan diet (I’m an ethical vegan so no way in hell am I ever giving that up..),False,True

It's very scary and I'm sorry you're going through this.  What I'd say is that your behaviors around food and weight are symptoms of the ED - you cant get rid of them without treating the actual ED. That takes therapy or an ED specific recovery environment. Food is such a tiny part of how fucked up this disorder makes us.  NEDA has some online resources if youd like to read more on recovering on your own or look into other recovery options.  DM any time if you need it,False,False
