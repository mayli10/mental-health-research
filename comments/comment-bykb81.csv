However, water weight is a real thing and something many people need to shed. Reduce your sodium and drink more water. When eating low calorie you should also keep your water intake up since youre likely not getting a lot of hydration from what you're eating. Eat more fibre, low sodium and work out lightly and that should fix the water weight issue. You'll likely feel better too since a hydrated body is a happy body. Keep a water bottle with you at all times and read nutrition labels, there is a lot of sodium in pre-packaged food! Take care and stay healthy. 700 is very low and will damage you in the long term, take your vitamins and watch out for your potassium levels. This is the only body you get, treat it wisely.
