In my experience cravings are typically caused by my diet lacking in certain areas. Like if I'm lacking in a bunch of minerals I'll typically crave salty foods like Doritos. When I eat a perfect diet I don't get cravings. However, cravings can also be the result of addiction. Anything can be addictive to the right person, even if it doesn't contain any chemicals that alter the brain's function to cause addiction such as nicotine. For example, sugar is commonly addictive because it's linked to a release of ""feel good"" chemicals in the brain and it's so widely available. Cutting added sugar from your diet is very difficult unless you eat mostly homemade foods and avoid processed foods. This occurance can be caused by just about anything you enjoy, though it's less likely with most substances or behaviours. Things like exercise are also known to release chemicals that make you feel good, but most people don't get addicted to exercise. There are however some people who do.  So my point is, do you think this is a needs craving or an addiction craving? If you think it's a needs craving than I say go ahead and eat all the stuff you want because your body can probably use it. I know that a lot of people tend to view carbs and fats as bad, but your body actually needs them for proper function. If you think it's an addiction craving you're better off avoiding those foods and trying to find some other way to satisfy the craving. For example, when I cut sugar out of my diet I largely did so by switching from sugary soda to diet soda and by sucking on a mint whenever I had a sudden craving. I know that a lot of people are concerned about diet soda possibly being unhealthy, but I was just reading that aspartame is one of the most thoroughly studied food items ever and that there is no scientific evidence supporting any claims that people have made stating that the substance is unsafe for consumption. I also need the caffeine and hate warm drinks. They make my stomach feel weird and the steam makes my nose run sometimes. Regarding mints, they do tend to have a small amount of sugar in them, but because it's such a small amount and it takes you so long to finish sucking on a mint you typically beat the craving with as little sugar consumption as possible.",False,False

I find that when I Let myself have something fun it sort of opens the floodgates to unreasonable hunger and food cravings. If I have a fun dinner I wake up in the morning ready to eat a full English breakfast. My body is hungrier and my brain starts to go haywire. I find that for me (still utilizing unhealthy eating) that if I have a low cal version of ‘the thing’ and then go back to restriction I feel a lot better. Like if I’m craving eggs and toast like mad I might make some egg whites and a piece of bacon or low cal sausage. If I eat 300 cals of the thing I want it’s better for my mental health than if I were to eat 500 cals of the real thing and question if it was all worth it/feel kinda sick after (or start purging).   I dunno if this will help, but I just wanted to let you know that I’m at a normal BMI but I restrict heavily and when I start eating normally my hunger levels go insane. I have to take walks, drink water, start a project, etc to see if I can control my insane shift in hunger and will power.",False,False
