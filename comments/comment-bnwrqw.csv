But if you don't stop purging, your mantle will keep getting destroyed. I'm thinking using honey as a face mask on those areas would help counteract any irritation caused by the purging but it's not going to do much in terms on pH (do not use baking soda, it will fuck your skin up, it's way too basic)",False,False

Once your acid mantle is compromised, it's really easy to get acne",False,False
