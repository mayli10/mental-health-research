Unless you‚Äôre using like a quarter cup it‚Äôs almost no calories. I don‚Äôt put sugar in my coffee so I figure the tiny couple drips won‚Äôt kill me. I have used coconut milk before but it‚Äôs def less - creamy- so if you‚Äôre trying plant based I‚Äôd say almond milk. Soy was too gritty for me lol. ,False,False
