When I had similar symptoms I went to my doctor because I was worried it was a UTI. Turned out not to be thankfully. My doctor hypothesized my bladder was irritated (she thought maybe from too much diet soda and not enough water). I cut back on soda, upped water, and took a medicine she recommended that basically numbs the bladder a bit so the constant “I need to peeeeee” wouldn’t be so bad. It got better over a few days. But I think the needing-to-pee-but-shy-bladder really *can* indicate a UTI, and those things can be nasty so consulting a doctor might be something to consider.",False,False
