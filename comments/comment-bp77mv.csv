Elevated heart rate, racing thoughts, shaky, short shallow breaths. Like a drug addict trying to get their fix. So I don’t measure it by calories but I also never binge on low calorie foods. It’s always comfort food high in sugar, fat, or salt. Usually once I get going it’s foods that are each of those things.  So yeah I’d say it’s by feelings rather than amount.",False,False

I've had low cal binges before, but it was rather that I was eating emotionally and rapidly without enjoying the food or even really tasting it.  I feel like its not the food I need to stop but the binging and the urges. Even when it's a low cal binge it doesnt feel good, I still hate myself and have a lot of negative emotions around it.",False,False
