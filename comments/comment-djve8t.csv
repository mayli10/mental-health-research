I don't think I got that bad until freshman year of high school when I started cross country, but I was an excessive exerciser since then to try and manage the shitty food I ate in the food desert we had moved to. Running and biking were all I ever had to do in the middle of nowhere and it let me get away from my family and the family-sized bags of potato chips. I found food diaries from high school the other day and realized I had absolutely no awareness of ED back then, just knew I hated myself and how I looked.  In college I cooled off, started drinking a lot, went on an antidepressant, ended up gaining a lot more than freshman fifteen. By junior year I had reached an overweight BMI after being low end of normal almost my whole life, and that just shattered me and my excessive exercise came back. I stopped drinking and going out to eat with friends, spent all my free time exercising or watching america's next top model, and totally isolated myself.

I was always a weird outsider. The two popular girls were sooo fucking skinny.

I clumsily tried to keep up while the school year wrapped up. Then we went to different schools. Middle/high school was a new start for me, and I got very critical of myself. Puberty started and I was disgusted with my body. I was short with bmi 20.5 or so?   I'm gonna try to not make this too long.  So I discovered pro ana and queue some miserable years filled with starving and binging on chocolate, and not losing anything. I was self harming, depressed, anxious and took more and more leave from school. I became the problem kid there, because I didn't look well and I never came to school. I got into a fucked up FWB relationship with a 20 something yr old and got pregnant. Had an abortion, and my mental health got even worse. I've never gone to get help, because I was forced to in the past and now I was stubborn. Dropped out, went to a different school, meanwhile the one last friend I had left for University. This is when I actually lost the weight. My life is a complete mess now, and I feel completely trapped.

But I still had a really nice body because I just ate less, to compensate for only eating junk and never exercising.   At 19, I started a relationship with a really, really great guy, it was my first and really only emotional bond I really formed with anyone as an adult. Anyway, about a year into our relationship I conceived (unplanned, we were both in school) and ended up being part of the .04% failure rate for IUDs. I was already having a really unhappy year, failing classes, losing my scholarship, was an ass and ended up ostracized from my only circle of friends, and falling pregnant was the final, painful blow. I already was a low-functioning depressed/anxious person from the start - and I already had a lifelong history of emotional eating, with a particular love for carb-y sugary foods. Add to that the hormonal, emotional storm from falling pregnant and having to terminate despite very, very badly not wanting to.  I don't think this is discussed often, but the hormonal effect of being pregnant even for 12 weeks was very, very strong. My hair changed, my body changed, and my appetite was completely out of control. I terminated about a week after finding out, but the hormonal effects of a pregnancy continue even after that, which is not very well known I think. Losing the child doesn't just automatically ""reset"" your body's hormonal production to pre-conception. A failed pregnancy in itself is something that effects your body.   I don't know if this was amplified by the hormones, but I also felt a very strong emotional, maternal connection to my baby. Maybe because we were both so in love, and at the time  I knew I wanted to spend my life with this man and have his children. He was similarly very emotionally committed to me and we implicitly knew we would spend our futures together. Having to terminate, despite feeling such a strong emotional pull and idk what other word to use but yearning... it felt like such a violation against myself, against our relationship, and against nature. I was so disgusted and ashamed of what I'd done. For the record, my bf was amazing and supporting and also very upset by this, but it was something I had to do because he had such a promising future and so many goals that I didn't want to be an obstacle for.   Anyway, this was a pretty RIPE situation for a complete mental breakdown: friendless, failing out, hormones in disarray, and having just gone through the most emotionally heart breaking decision of my life.   So that's when my shitty junk food diet morphed into a full on binge eating disorder/food addiction. All I wanted to do was eat, and the only thing I cared about was eating. If I wasn't eating, I was planning what I was going to eat and counting down to when I could do it. Years later, I understood (thanks, therapist) that I leaned into food so strongly because it was the most potent, pleasurable thing on hand since I didn't have much else to make me feel good.   So yeah, there's the origin story lol  Poor eating habits from childhood + unfortunate buildup of lots of stressful changes in life + failure to use healthier coping strategies = BED/Food Addiction",False,False
