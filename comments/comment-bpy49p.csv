When I recovered I continued having them for many many months and there was nothing physically wrong with me. My doctor said it was from extreme stress and that having an eating disorder is actually considered traumatic and can really, really exacerbate your anxiety disorder if you have one. I do strongly recommend going to the doctor just to make sure. Stay safe.",False,False

But it could be something as simple as dehydration or too much caffeine. Maybe try drinking more water and cutting your caffeine intake for a few days and see if it improves.,False,False

They hooked me up to an EKG (?) or something and  long story short I was having lung spasms most likely from purging. The told me take an antihistamine and chill out.   Not saying that’s what you’re experiencing but giving some anecdotal info. Go to the Dr to be sure ❤️,False,False
