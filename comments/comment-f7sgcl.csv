Marilyn Monroe was one of the biggest sex symbols for her time to the point where even people nowadays can't deny that it makes sense why. She was goregous. While beauty is in the eye of the beholder, this is one of those cases where most people can agree that it's at least understandable why she was seen as being so attractive.   To be honest, I'm not trying to make assumptions, but this sounds like something a guy would say out of spite. Maybe to make you more insecure in yourself to lessen his own potential insecurities within him, maybe from jealousy of other men looking at you and the fear of you leaving him for them, maybe to down you just to down you. But I don't like making assumptions like this because you never really know 100% what someone's relationship dynamic is like and things get very easily misunderstood, so it's also possible that he may have said what he said in a weird joking way. I had a similar situation about a week ago and, while it hurt me horribly, my boyfriend is the type of guy that says things without thinking them through first so I knew that his comment wasn't ill intended, mean as it sounded. If your boyfriend is the type that speaks off the top of his head like that too then it's possible that's what happened. It's hard sometimes trying detach ourselves from our ED way of thinking into the neurotypical way of thinking.",False,False
