I also want to work in a clinic or public health or just somewhere lower stress than a hospital. I also use to stress eat after clinicals. I‚Äôve also had my fair share of horrible instructors. Just take each clinical day by day, it‚Äôll be over before you know it.",False,False

Single mom, 2 kids. No child support. No emotional support. No time to work out for sure. Work is very competitive, but doesnt pay the bills.   What I do actually carries a lot of responsibility.. so when my boss asks of me an especially impossible task, I chew my way through it. When its 2am, and youngest decides ready to go downstairs and face the day, I eat instead of sleep. When my abusive ex wiggles his way into my life and says some seriously sadistic fucked up shit. I eat to gain my sanity back. Most days I can stick to the plan. Im 5'2"" and work a sedentary desk job. Needs to have a plan   But its always 2 steps forward, one step back. I figure the only way to fail.. is to give up completely. Get back on that horse and try again.",False,False
