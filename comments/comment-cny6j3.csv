I really want to try them out systematically and compile them somewhere but I'm also scared of encouraging disordered behaviour in younger people.  I mean I know there's nothing inherently disordered about this anyway, and I'm not even doing it to suggest that you can only eat 300 calories for a meal, I'm doing it for when you want a light lunch because you're saving your calories for something later or for people who prefer to have 4-5 smaller meals throughout the day rather than 3 larger ones etc... but I'm still afraid of the information falling into impressionable hands and making people spiral into disordered eating.  But then on the OTHER hand, these resources are literally life savers for people who already HAVE disordered eating, because if you can't find any nutritious recipes that you aren't scared to try then you'll just end up eating crap, or nothing...  So far I'm thinking if I do it, I'll make it a password-protected Tumblr or something so the posts can't be reblogged, and not use any of the tracked tags. Then I'll only share the link from places like here and Peach.  I still don't know though.

We all have, at one point been overwhelmed by the shuttle nuances and experiences which make up the patch work blanket of our experiences with EDs.  If I can share. I will tell you about the time I started my first real professional job. This was my first professional job straight from college and I had been hired to be an electrical draught man.   At this stage of my life. I was well into my anorexic cycle. The Firm was a small one with big clients and a very old school way of doing things. During my first week I had been given a very prestigious project. Looking back at it now it was too overwhelming and advanced for my skill set and emotional being at that time.   Unluckily for me the completion of the project coincided with Christmas. A trigger point for me. Well as the project reached completion. I was spiraling due to the stress of the project and the looming work Christmas Dinner (in Ireland we try to have a dinner rather than drinks due to our tendency for alcoholism.)   That night at the dinner as a thank you. My boss, unknown to me. Had ordered a massive steak. When it arrived. I turned pale and remember just crashing down inside. Internally I thought. How will I eat this? How will I eat this in front of other people? How do I get out of this?  I think I ate half the stake none of the vegetables or the garnish. I just welled up inside. As the night went on I switched from beer to whiskey (for the lower KCAL content.) Anyway to make a long story short. While waiting for a taxi with my colleagues I caught my reflection in the window of the cab and don’t know why to this day. I just began to cry. In front of the Directors, Associate Directors and Senior Engineers.   To make matters worse. That was the last time we would see each other for 6 days. I agonized over that moment all over Christmas. Finally I decided when I went back to work I would take control of the narrative. I walked into our office. Apologized for my drinking and got on with my work.  At first people were stand offish but in time it became a source of strength and opportunity to build some solid relationships with colleagues who became friends.  I am sorry for the long post. I just wanted to share and explain how this event didn’t come to define me but in another way helped provide a little insight into my very complex human condition.  I look at it now as just another piece of patch work that makes up the blanket of my life.  Sorry if I went on too long. Just wanted to share and help. Hope it helped.",False,False
