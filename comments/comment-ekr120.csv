It calculated a panic attack as a workout one time when I was driving home in the snow. It also calculated thousands of steps when I'm just sitting and crocheting. Although I think the cals are pretty accurate when you actually do a workout - you can look at that separately.   Best advice is to use the FitBit as a general guide and focus more on how you feel.",False,False

At least, my TDEE for sedentary days is calculated to be around 1600cal, and that‚Äôs what my Fitbit shows as total calories burned for my lazy days where I literally lay in bed until I need to use the bathroom or go to the kitchen. So I typically trust it when it says I burn 2,000-3,000+ calories on my active exercise days. I‚Äôm not saying it‚Äôs 100% accurate, bc nothing ever is.
