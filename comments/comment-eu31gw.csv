Yeah, that's exactly how I feel. Like I did something wrong and am a terrible person? I'm glad he lives in a different country and like I can just ignore his messages because seeing him again and again would hurt a lot.  thank you so much ily xx",False,True

This all happened at a time I am really questioning my faith and just started to start praying again and everything so it was just not the greatest. It's just left me feeling like I was wrong and am a dirty, horrible person.  thanks for the response tho x",False,True

We had the same friends in the dorm so we were always hanging out. It often lead to us making out and then he would say that I was tempting him, that I was a test. But then it happened again and again.  I felt like a horrible person, dirty even; and like I was a bad influence on my friends.   But I promise you, you are your own person, you have worth. It’s ok that he wants to step back but it’s not because you’re some kind of bad influence. ❤️",False,False

He was just speaking from a religious pov. Sending love xx",False,False
