If they are pretty selfish or lazy, they may just not want to feel obligated to actually *do* something to help, so they decide it's not a problem. If they're really selfish, they may just legit not care if it doesn't affect them.   Point is, there are more reasons than not giving a shit for people to fail us, or react in disappointing ways to information like this. Certainly, I'm still hurt about how some people reacted to my suicidality. (protip: laughing nervously and starting to talk about something random may stop YOU from freaking out, but it fuckin made me MORE suicidal because I thought no one cared.) But ultimately, I know those people were well intentioned. They honestly seemed to think that ""distraction"" or ""ignoring it"" was a legitimate response to a suicidal person, like we're magpies that just need something shiny, or toddlers who don't really *mean* the screaming and will stop if ignored.  However, it's also possible there are a lot of really selfish or ignorant people in your life. In which case, that fucking sucks, and maybe it's time to reevaluate some relationships. Your husband is the person who worries me most. That is a really unacceptable response, even if he was anxious/deflecting and blurted something dumb. That is just...no. He's supposed to be your partner. He needs to know that's not okay and that you need support or a kind ear, NOT comments about the very body you're so anxious about.",False,False
