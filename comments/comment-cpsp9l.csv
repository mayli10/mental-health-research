We can be the “lying to ourselves about Good Choices when realistically letting absolutely everything else go to shit and pretending like the house isn’t on fire Vape Squad” (realtalk I quit smoking and started extended fasting in the same day so I’m quite possibly just delirious now) on the subject of vape juice tho idk if it’s unique to my country but Ohm Brew is the absolute best brand I’ve been able to find and their flavour “mr. White” is the shit,False,False

Only managed to kick the cigs again from Sunday because I noticed my enamel turning to shit. I’m high key concerned about the impact of vaping bc I feel like there’s not enough science yet but I’m lying to myself and saying it’s an improvement,False,False

I go through an obscene amount of e-liquid because I am glued to my vape at this point, and it helps me save a lot of money and try a bunch of new flavors every month. They’ve sent me some of my all-time favorites: Heliomilk by Space Jam (like vaping straight up honey), The Voyage by Coastal Clouds (berry Rice Krispie) and Toucan by Cali Steam (fruit loops).",False,False

While we’re here considering the name of this sub does anyone else consider that vape juices might have a calorific value or am I actually crazy? Like there’s no way I can inhale something that sweet and not be consuming sugar?,False,False

Its DELICIOUS, its pretty fruity tasting and has a great filling effect if that makes sense.    (This suggestion is based on if you're using 3mg, I never really buy 6mg+ but if you need a suggestion for a higher nic juice Magnetic Worm is so fuckin good and worth trying out)",False,False
