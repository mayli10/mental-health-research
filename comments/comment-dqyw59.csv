I saw the long and beautiful legs of the sailor scouts in the manga and anime. Their short skirts and their beautiful colorful transformations. I thought I would transform when I became a teenager and I did not grow up that way. I did not get any taller past fourth grade. I also developed an obsession with big breasts from anime, and wishing I had them. I still carry that today too. At the same time weirdly enough anime helped me appreciate being small and looking very young for my age, and I do cosplay. So anime has definitely impacted my body image.",False,False

It's the only way I can reasonably rationalize why almost every female character with large breasts is &gt;!45kg!&lt; and has a fuckin' &gt;!23-inch!&lt; waist.,False,False

Like, those costumes are deceptively simple but they reveal so many insecurities! Bare arms? Bare butt/legs? Skin-tight white bodysuit? I may as well be naked ðŸ¤¢  I'm really glad your group changed their plan!!

Like they just pull it out of their butts, and then the male readership reads it like ""oh hot, guess that's what a normal hot girl is"" and the girls reading it are like ""!!?? UH OH"".   Generalisation of course, but it seems like the only reason to give measurements like that in the first place is because that's what gravure idols do, and that's only for dudes to compare and be impressed by, so...  Like, it'd be one thing if they used stats that were on the lower end of realistic; that'd still be sending crappy messages, but at least it'd be attainable. But these ecchi authors take the lowest/most ""impressive"" stats from gravure idols (which are probably already exaggerated by their labels) and then exaggerate them even further by making the boobs/hips wider and the waist narrower, and making them taller but keeping the weight the same, without any thought for what that would mean for a real woman. It's mental lol!!",False,True

I think everyone looking the same reinforces the way I feel about myself, because it's not that I think I can look like some impossibly-thin anime girl, but the fact that all of those girls look the same as each other makes me feel bad if I look different to my friends/peers, even if it's not possible bc our bodies are fundamentally different shapes. Like it's the very ""cookie cutter"" nature of it that's so triggering and not just the fact that they're thin.  Also yes, I love the lore that Usagi is chubby, it's very reassuring sometimes LOL. But you're right that it's not reflected in the style though. I remember thinking the manga looked different last time I read it though and I checked and it turned out she redrew parts of it for the reprints and she definitely looks more like a real 14-yo than she did when I first read it LOL. It's cute to see her with a slightly chubbier middle and legs, like most kids her age.  At the end of the day I'mma try and focus less on looking like Usagi and more on acting like her (in the good ways LOL - kind and selfless â™¥)",False,True

Like idk what's so triggering about 2D not-real girls who essentially look like cookie cutter people but DAMN it's distressing I don't get to have an anime thigh gap lol  also, Usagi is canonically kind of chubby, so even she wouldn't be anime-girl thin if she were real! It's totally not reflected in the art style though. I think the Sailor Moon mangaka made everyone look the same to make them easier to draw.",False,False
