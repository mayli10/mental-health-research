I have a friend who leans on me a lot during her hardest times with another mental illness. I understand that sometimes she can‚Äôt be a ‚Äúgood‚Äù friend back all the time, especially at the times when she needs me the most and I‚Äôm there for her the most. But whenever she is finally in a good place again, she tells me how much she cares about me as a friend and it makes it all worth it that she notices the effort that I make and the support that I give even when she can‚Äôt return it at the time! So maybe a handwritten card? That to me would be so incredibly thoughtful. Just let her know the things you notice and appreciate!",False,False

I think if you put in the effort to make her something she will really appreciate the effort regardless of what it is. I say go for it.,False,False
