The anxious buzz in my head quiets down as I keep eating. Then, it turns into disgust/self hatred and I continue eating because I figure I’m disgusting anyways so it doesn’t matter. Eventually, I feel so horribly sick that I go lay down and sleep. If I’m sneak eating, it’s a lot of shame and desperation as I try to shovel food without being noticed.   It’s my top way to soothe my anxiety...which fucking sucks.",False,False

I’ll plan a binge the night before &amp; wake up not even wanting to binge but it’s so engrained in my mind that it’s something I HAVE to do &amp; then I end up gathering all the food I wanted and just mindlessly consume everything. Not even tasting or enjoying the food I’m eating either.",False,False

It feels like a survival instinct to me because all I can think about is eating. Sometimes I try to stop myself by saying no, but I usually cave because the urge doesn't go away and I can't find my self control like at other times.",False,False
