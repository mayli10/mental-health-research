I have some muscles built up in strange places and I would do anything to get rid of them (Â´;Ï‰;ï½€) I am genetically disposed to build muscle easily so I only do cardio as to not build muscle or strength.  BMI being 23 is on the high side. And I have a very high body fat percentage (37%)  for my height. The Inbody Fitness Check I took when I started gym lists me as 'slightly obese' when considering those factors. I don't aim to be healthy and would not consider recovery as no matter how much I lose I don't see the difference. I just want to be a small and petite Asian girl and with how stubby I look I just look like a fat 12 year old. ",False,True

It can probably stimulate you while youre growing (dont know your age) but dont forget, the muslim countries drink Coffee daily and they are on average pudgy and have big breasts. Beside your organs detox enough. What exactly do you hope it will change? If tea could make people lose faster everybody would use them.    And be safe, too much coffeine at once after never drinking Coffee could give you headaches and blood pressure problems.   And of course it does affect him. He is your SO, you guys are in a relationship? So, he will live with your consequenses of your actions.   Try talking to him more. How hard this is for you. Communication is always the key to a healthy relationship. ",False,False
