That said, you can't control what other people make of your weight or your behavior. I sometimes obsess about this stuff pretty badly, and I'm trying to learn not to. I'm not at all suggesting you have OCD, but I was recently diagnosed, and part of dealing with my behaviors means accepting that I'm not responsible for (and can't guilt trip myself over) what other people make of my personal presentation.   Like, if your appearance or quiet behaviors are enough to trigger someone, they already have significant issues for which you can't shoulder the blame. I try to redirect my fears about this issue into taking a moment to feel compassion for both myself, and the person I'm worried about. It can be good to acknowledge that we're both experiencing pain, *without* taking on outsize responsibility for the other person's suffering.  Feel free to ignore if you don't feel distress over your behaviors, but just thought I'd share!",False,False
