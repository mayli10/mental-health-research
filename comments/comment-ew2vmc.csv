It gives you a detailed breakdown of what vitamin, mineral, amino acids, etc. you’re getting in your diet so you can supplement accordingly.    Regardless, you can’t really go wrong with a multivitamin.",False,False

It has a good distribution of necessary vitamins (it’s a multivitamin) but I like that it includes B vitamins, iron, and a bit of magnesium. It also has a variety of things it claims are “thermogenic ingredients that may support calorie burning and mental sharpness” including 100mg of caffeine (which personally I’m very into but not everyone might be). I really couldn’t tell ya if the “thermogenic ingredients” are doing anything but I do like the idea of them lol",False,False

I really recommend the potassium (get powder form) and the b-complex (I get the super b-complex from nature’s bound), great for immune health. If you have the opportunity, I recommend getting a complete blood count test to evaluate your white blood cell counts. Apparently, almost 50% of people who restrict their diet (anorexics specifically) have diminished white blood cells. When I first got mine checked I wasn’t even underweight and mine were complete shit.",False,False
