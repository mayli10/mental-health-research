He doesn't care  You didn't think he was going to do these.  Do you really want to have to keep wondering what else he's lying to you about that he hasn't been caught doing yet?  Almost every single relationship starts out great. Then you get to know the person they are, not the person they were being when they were on their best behavior to win you over.  You'll only getting live these years once. I'd spend them with somebody who has the slightest ounce of respect and honesty towards you.",False,False

From what you’ve said it appears that you are discontent with your situation, especially your bf, try find something that brings you joy! Maybe it’s your cats, working out, drawing or watching Netflix. Also drugs are mind altering substances, if you still have any love for your boyfriend’s personality now, he won’t be like that soon if he keeps taking these drugs.  Most importantly, look after yourself the best you can and remember myself and others support you!( ◠‿◠ )",False,False

He will only bring you down with him and you deserve so much better then that!!!  If you ever need someone to talk to or vent to please feel free to DM me. I was in a similar situation and I know how trying it can be!",False,False
