I actually HATE buffets, and refuse to eat at them because I dont like the pressure which gives me actual anxiety, and I can not binge in front of other people, or watch people binge. Its like watching my worst nightmare come to life. Maybe I think I at least have the decency to be ashamed, and do it in private? So maybe thats where you're coming from.",False,False

I feel like ordering food and having it handed to me makes it easier for me to make the next step. But make me also have to go get it???  Terror???,False,False
