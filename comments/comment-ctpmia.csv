Like, I designed meal plans a lot and they always end up being way more food than I could actually eat, but they still end up being lower in calories than what an average girl my height would eat and I often include foods that people wouldn't consider ""healthy foods"". My latest meal plan has sweet potato fries cooked in oil and mac and cheese. I based it off of another meal plan I recently made (*switched some stuff to remove foods I might have to avoid*) which literally required me to eat ice cream every day. Even stuff like soda can be used effectively in a meal plan. A can of Coke Zero for example has 10% of your daily required copper as well as small amounts of calcium, iron, magnesium, manganese, potassium, and sodium. Considering how often I end up low on iron and sodium I say every little bit counts. Sometimes I've ended up with exactly the required amount of iron in a meal plan because I added in Coke Zero. Copper is really the only one where there's enough to make a significant difference, but that can still be useful if somehow you have a diet low in copper. Food is nourishment and I think people should think about that before anything else. The only time to avoid certain foods is if you have a medical condition like hyperkalemia or a dietary intolerance.",False,False

One tablespoon provides you with necessary fat in a tasty form. Please continue to enjoy your food!   I try my best not to push my food fears on others since I know how awful it is for a safe food to be snatched from you. I recommended a protein snack to someone once and they freaked out because it was over 100 Cal. And it was like byyyyeee safe snacks over 100 Cal. Clawing back now,False,False

Second of all, if you’re anything like me (not saying you are but just in case!) if you still feel weird about it tomorrow, maybe try substituting the Nutella for something else/easier? I’m putting myself in your shoes but if I felt weird about it, I’d do maybe some almond or peanut butter with a bit of cocoa powder and some stevia mixed up into it. Not /nearly/ as good as Nutella is, but something easier to handle when thrown like that.   You eat what you know is right for you, though.
