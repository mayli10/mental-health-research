(This person then turned around when I began dating my current and amazing boyfriend saying he actually loved me.) I wish I would've broken up with him for good, have future me come and say bitch this is stupid.  &amp;#x200B;  And with the way that this guy treated you, using like that to make someone jealous, that isn't alright. In no way would any decent person think that is acceptable behaviour. I hope you are doing better today. I hope you find someone who appreciates and likes you for you, especially with how sweet you sound. :)",False,False

He's going for you now because the other girl didn't work out and he thinks you're desperate enough to take whatever shit he gives you. Prove to him that that is not the case.
