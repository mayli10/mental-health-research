It isn't bioavailable without some fat.  I always eat a piece of bread and butter, or some other small fatty snack, maybe an hour before I pop an edible! Whether it's avocado or buttered toast or even salad with some olive oil, you NEED to have some fat in your tummy for edibles to work!   I know snacks can be scary at times, and if that's the case for you, try eating your edibles after a meal ( with at least a little bit of fat source, hummus, guac, etc ). 40 mins to an hour before you take your edible is preferable because the food is starting to disgest, making the THC bind to the fat easier.    I hope this helps!!!;",False,False
