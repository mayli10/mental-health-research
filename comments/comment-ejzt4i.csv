I’ve been waiting to get my DECAYING wisdom tooth pulled for 6 weeks and my dentist didn’t think it was an issue at the time.   Well, it’s impacted and decided four weeks ago to shove my teeth out of the way and come in more. I went to the ER after passing out from pain. Dentist couldn’t set an earlier appointment.
