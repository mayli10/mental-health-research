MFP drive me nuts because I had a hard time distinguishing usda official entries from the crazy wrong entries of random users. And I like their recipe calculator and ability to save favorites since I basically eat the same thing every day. ,False,False

I'm just used to it now. I like that it lets you eat however many calories you want, without complaining that you need to eat more. It's also pretty accurate at calculating your deficit (many apps overestimate exercise) and it shows you the average intake and average deficit for the month. ",False,False

It's also easier to keep track of more data than weight and body fat alone, it has options to enter weight circumference, blood pressure etc., so there's no need to juggle several apps.   The app connects with Garmin, too, which I use as my step- and activity tracker, which is a big bonus, especially as MFP stopped working with my relatively old phone after their security update in summer. I'm not buying a new phone for MFP!",False,False
