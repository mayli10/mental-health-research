It sounds like you’re ok with maintenance which is better than not even wanting to consider that :)   This is my 4th recovery and the first one I’ve actually wanted to do for myself, and going at my own pace, and so far it’s been the most successful for a well mind (the others while my body got healthy my ed brain actually got worse).
