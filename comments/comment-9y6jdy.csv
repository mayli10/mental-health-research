My TDEE is 1600, so I should eat 1100 to happily loose a lb a week. 1600-1100 = 500 cal deficit a day. 500 a day X 7 days a week = 3,500 calories. One lb of fat is 3,500 calories so I should lose 1lb a week eating 1100 calories a day.   If I eat 300 calories (or whatever) more than what I like to in a day your body might retain water or have difficulty pooping. When you step on the scale for a few days you may have â€˜gained weightâ€™ because you ate, but itâ€™s just taking a while to flush out. ",False,False

If you eat at your TDEE, youâ€™ll maintain weight. If you eat over your TDEE, youâ€™ll gain weight. So for you, anything under 1,800 would be a deficit and would cause weight loss.
