I have a kitchen in my dorm and my meal plan basically goes to waste. My plan allowed 75 meals last semester and I maybe had 15? I'm trying to work up the courage to go next week... My advice is to go either as soon as they open or right before they close. When there's the least amount of people possible and sit somewhere in a back corner with your back to other people. If your dining hall has a menu available online pick out exactly what you want and only go to that area. I can't deal with choices either. Hope that helps a bit maybe?,False,False
