Zoloft made me hornier and lose my appetite and maybe slightly less anxious. I'm thinking about getting put on something else too.b,False,True

Libido is fucked on it, and I've gained 22 pounds in 2+ years (5'1, so I'm not hiding it well). Not worth it.",False,False

I'm glad you found the right thing for your depression and I hope you get something for anxiety soon and/or feel even okay-er/better!,False,True

Wellbutrin only helps my depression and Iâ€™m slacking on getting something for anxiety, but I feel relatively okay with just this right now. If Zoloft doesnâ€™t work, there are other SSRIs you can ask for.",False,False

I'm only on my 4th day and this is my first time on meds so I'll just wait it out and experiment if I have to.  I have depression and anxiety and I don't know what else so I might need a specific cocktail.,False,True

The one thatâ€™s helped my depression the most is Wellbutrin.,False,False

There's no clear evidence that the drug itself causes weight gain but because I wasn't sound of mind during that time I definitely convinced myself that I had gained which likely didn't aid my mental state and the effect of the sertraline. I'm not on any SSRIs currently, not until my next appointment is due anyway :/ Good job on eating breakfast, hope my experience didn't scare you, stay safe",False,False
