Always have. I don’t want trigger anyone with numbers, but I was morbidly obese. I still am obese, but a lot less so. But it’s like I went from one extreme to the other overnight. So weird.",False,True

I don't know what makes technically qualifies as a binge but I don't think you need to beat yourself up over 7 chicken cubes OR 1200 calories in a day,False,False

I think I did prior to June (I was almost 400 lbs and am still obese, just way less so now), but since then I have flipped to the complete other side. But I feel like such a failure when I have these mini controlled ""binges"" (sorry don't know a better word).   Sorry will add a TW",False,True

I'm not at all trying to invalidate you at all, you know yourself better than an internet stranger who read a paragraph about you. But it's worth thinking about.",False,False

Usually in a very short period of time.   But yeah, I do something similar to you, but to a higher calorie threshold. It’s more like I’ll just eat whatever it’s been that I’ve craved and stop when I want to stop. Essentially eating like a normal person, lol. I’ll do it as a reward for hitting a certain weight. And only if I’ve been “good” so far that week and/or fast the next day. Generally I end up around 2k calories, personally. Which isn’t *terrible* but I will feel a bit guilty about. Hence the fasting.   It’s actually handy to keep me from actually binging. It kind of takes my mind off of what I’ve been craving so hard. Like I *will* have it. Just only when I get to x weight. Sometimes it does backfire, though, and I end up eating a lot the next few days because it’ll kickstart my hunger cues again.   It’s pretty funny because this is literally what normal people do. It’s just so much more of a big deal to me LOL it’s like oooohhh the biggest treat I could ever ask for",False,False
