I know it doesn't sound that way right now - the leap from 80 to 100 is not that big - but trust me when I say that you're gonna be okay, this isn't gonna wreck you.   Let's play with the numbers a little right now: say you round 80 up to 100. That's a difference of 20, which is a quarter of 80. Repeat: that's **25%**. Okay. So now it's 100 calories. Let's assume your tdee is 1500, which will be high for some and too low for most. To gain a pound of fat, you need to take in 3500 calories *on top of that*. 1500 + 3500 is 5,000. You wanna know what the percentage of that 100 is? It's **0.02**. A hundredth. And we rounded the Gatorade cals up by a quarter, and probably underestimated your tdee by a good deal.   For perspective, 0.02 of 10 feet is 2.4 inches. You're gonna be okay. Panic attacks are the worst, and I know there's very little that can help you through one. If you haven't already had it, try to breathe. Think of 2 and a half inches. Think of how little that is compared to your height, then to 10 feet. That's where you are right now. You're 10 feet tall and that Gatorade can't touch you.",False,False
