Probably the most upsetting posts to me (and I feel like they’re getting more frequent) is people claiming to have an ED and either making posts or commenting to agree with all the other people making fun of/berating fat people basically. idk I also have tons of problems with HAES and I hate the ways in which a lot of recovery rhetoric has been co-opted by the movement, but for some reason seeing other ED people engage with what at this point is just a malicious echo-chamber makes me sad :( and on top of that, who are we even to judge? let she is who without disordering eating habits throw the first stone lmao",False,False
