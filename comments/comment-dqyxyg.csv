I was smart. I was strong. I worked hard. And this Just Isn‚Äôt how things turn out for smart, strong, hardworking people. I can get really sad thinking about what that younger girl would think of me. (On the other hand, I do have four pets and a living room painted bright green, so five-year-old me is pretty pleased with certain aspects of things.)   The idea I can hold on to for now is from a book title...*Someday This Pain Will Be Useful to You*. I also love a line from *Lirael*: ‚ÄúDoes the walker choose the path or the path choose the walker?‚Äù I don‚Äôt know why this was my path. Sometimes I‚Äôm angry at myself for it, sometimes I shake my fist at the universe or scream into a pillow. But looking back I can see that I was struggling with life wayyyy before any obvious issues with food started. I didn‚Äôt have language like ‚Äúanxiety‚Äù or ‚Äúdepression‚Äù or ‚Äúintrusive thoughts‚Äù to explain my experience, but that‚Äôs totally what it was. So 14 year old me was managing as best she could, managing in ways that sometimes looked impressive on a resume, but also in ways that were ultimately ineffective and unsustainable. I was a high-rise building with nice cladding but a shitty foundation. It was gonna collapse under stress eventually. In my early 20s my life looked great externally but I was a cauldron of anguish on the inside. Then there was a lovely period of looking really bad *both* outside and inside. I gave up. Then gave up even harder. Eventually I tried again. Tried differently. I‚Äôm in my early 30s now and only just learning how to live. (*She says X hours into an XX hour ill-advised fast*......  I really do feel like I‚Äôm getting somewhere better though. The change is messy but happening.)   (Soooo, now having typed out that novel I‚Äôm like, mmm...that might not even be related to OP‚Äôs thoughts. Imma blame insomnia and still hit ‚Äòsend‚Äô ... Wishing you the best &lt;3 )",False,False
