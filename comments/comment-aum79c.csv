If you've ever wondered, ""but where does the fat *go*?"" it leaves your body through respiration and urination, essentially. You're obviously not pissing out whole fat cells, I don't have time to find relevant sources, but in my understanding you never just lose or gain weight (on the scale) that consists of ""pure"" fat.  Case in point: I did the math to work out my recent weight gain, and calorie-wise, I should have gained 2.8 lbs... OF PURE FAT. But this week, the scale is showing at least a 3-4 lb gain (and this is after being back on track long enough that I'm not bloated or constipated or anything). I could freak out and assume my metabolism is fucked because the scale's not showing an exact 2.8 lb increase, or I could remember that the extra half a pound is most likely just normal water weight since my body is legitimately a few pounds heavier and needs more water to support itself.  Weight is only really meaningful in terms of ranges and trends. One single scale reading doesn't really tell you anything.",False,False
