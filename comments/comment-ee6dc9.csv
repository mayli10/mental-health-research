I was following the DASH diet (blood pressure diet) because of a family medical history. Literally eating vegetables and grilled lean meats. Hiking, mountain biking, kayaking. I gained up to 286 at my highest weight I recorded but I know I just walked away from the scale at that point because I also felt worthless. I couldn't figure it out- eating pretty healthy products and 3 meals per day while being active. Gaining weight. I felt broken.   I didn't start losing weight until I started to practice running. I did the couch to 5k app. Something about being in that heart rate zone, at my own pace but structured... idk. It helped me. Seeing my improvements helped me. I have only made the running focus bc when doing my normal activities, I didnt drop anything. It's like I had to remind my metabolism what to do and that only happened when trying to run. I went from basically jogging 30 secs at a time to now jogging a 5k with few breaks. Literally, never thought that could happen in my whole life.   Now- my other lifestyle recommendations are not healthy but we all are here because we are overcoming struggles with food. If you can find a balance and relationship with food then it will be perfect. But for me, I was able to see the weight drop just with the couch to 5k app and it really switched around my brain chemistry to make everything else fall into place.   I also have bad knees and have had complete reconstructive surgery on both feet. Was advised to never run. I got good shoes - and took it slowly. That may have had something to do with my elevation in mood. I was probably producing less weight gaining hormones too.   I'm not sure if anything in my story can help, resonate or support your journey. You are worth it. Life can be beautiful it's just not always easy to see it when things are in the way. Life is also hard - and I think you're really strong for reaching out and sharing this vulnerability you are experiencing.  Sending you lots of love. You've got this. If you can turn this around before next year - just imagine what you could spend that money on instead of the surgery!   (Always follow medical advice for underlying factors. I realize my story may have no symmetry to your experience. Sorry if anything may have been projected in my comment.)",False,False

I wish I could say no to food for even a little while. I eat until I’m sick. I’ve gained 30 pounds since July.   This weeks method is eating a salad for lunch every day. A whole bag of salad. The ones that are the whole kit.   I hope you keep trying stuff until it works. Don’t stop trying.,False,False

Would you be comfortable beginning the search to finding a therapist?  It is intimidating, but in my experience, I think having someone reliable to talk to about this, someone reliable to provide healthy feedback, is helpful.  Edit to add:  I feel ridiculous providing advice, only because I don’t know you or anything about your life, but it seems like recovery would be an option and recovery in the terms of healing your mind, your relationship with food and body image.  Again, your size doesn’t invalidate your eating disorder.",False,False
