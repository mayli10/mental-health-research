Not sure how safe it is, but I started using them because of exhaustion eye pain. That being said, I've noticed that they right away, of course make my eyes less red, more white, and brighter, and of course that makes them look less tired. The cooling sensation also wakes me up a bit. Dry eyes are a huge problem of mine because of lack of Calories and restriction insomnia (and probably too much screen time, especially because I don't have much energy to do much else), and the extra moisture honestly overall makes me feel better and less tired, and in turn, I'm sure it affects the way I act/am perceived. Less eye rubbing too",False,False
