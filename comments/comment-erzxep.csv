Just had a bunch of dentist appointment these days because of my inflammed gums and it's all so loose to, also I clench and especially, I chew on my lips and cheeks ALL day, everything is sore all the time and this makes my head hurt even more. Didn't really associate it with my ED though, just with general bad habits that I've built :(",False,False

I'm also gonna cut down on the chewing gum as it's actually encouraging the clenching/grinding more, and cut down on caffeine/alcohol. Apparently a magnesium deficiency is linked to clenching of teeth etc too from what I read on a similar thread on here before?",False,True

Dry mouth and grinding from Adderall and caffeine broke one of my caps. The depression filled in the gaps. I'm two weeks shy of 23 and have awful teeth. I will have bouts of inflammation that make it hard to talk, cavities so bad that it hurts to drink cold water. Sweets are agonizing. To anyone reading this, if you do anything please take care of your teeth.",False,False
