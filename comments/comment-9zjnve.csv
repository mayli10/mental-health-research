If these particular women were satisfied and happy with their own beauty they wouldn't demand other women to follow suit.  I have friends who are happy fat. They know how to lose weight but they don't want to. They still congratulate other people on intentional weight loss. They support other people's goals and choices. Because they're actually comfortable and happy with themselves. Go figure. ,False,False

They don't even stop to think about the possibility that you could have a legitimate problem with food. You know why? Because they're self centred. They are trying to protect their very fragile world view. It has nothing to do with you.  The fact that they don't consider 800 calories to be a decent to large sized meal is just showing their own poor relationships with food. For many healthy weight sedentary women an 800 calorie meal is nearly half a days calories or more depending on height and body weight. Not saying your meal hit 800,or that it matters if it did, just showing how crazy that is. Besides, what about desert? An 800 calorie meal plus dessert is perfectly normal for a holiday meal.   We have fucked up relationships with food but at least we damn well know that we're the ones with the problem. We also generally try to keep that ish to ourselves.  Those people are rude. Ignore them. Don't let assholes take up valuable space in your head. ",False,False

That is not ok!   &amp;#x200B;  I don't have any advice OP, just to say that what happened to you was shitty :( your cousin should have never posted something without your consent, especially since she knew what the outcome would be. I'm surprised at the responses you got, no matter how well intended, they should understand that it is never ok to comment on someone else's body especially if they think that they're having some sort of body image issue.",False,False
