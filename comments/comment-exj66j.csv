After not restricting anymore, my body just literally wouldn't want to stop eating for like 3 straight weeks and I ate like 3000+ calories every day and hated myself for it. I wasn't even ever underweight. Sometimes I would cry and eat at the same time because my brain was so hungry, but my stomach felt so bloated. I finally told someone about it and it's really calming to let it all out. I'm finally a week free from bingeing and my goal is to not binge in February so far. It will take time because your body is scared it won't ever get food again, but it will definitely calm down after a while. If you happen to want any food like a cookie or something, let yourself have it because it seems you still need more calories. The body will be using the functions to kick start heart rate, digestion, etc, and its last choice should be storing it as fat. I have gotten way better at not bingeing because I just don't want that much food anymore. It's okay to occasionally overeat so don't feel guilty about it! What I learned is that everything takes time and you will have all the time you need to recover. I am so sorry this is happening to you and it really sucks, but I and many others will be here to talk about it with you if you need help or have questions :)",False,False
