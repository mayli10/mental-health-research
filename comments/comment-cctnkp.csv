Going to uni terrifies me mainly because i kinda know that i’m gonna isolate myself even more once i’ll be on my own. But i’ll try to take your advice (even tho i live in England and the weather’s been kinda shit lately :’)))  ). I definitely will pm you sometime, it’s so much easier to talk to someone that understands what you’re going through, thanks ♥️",False,True

I feel the same way 90% of the time. I don't know how old you are, but I'm 20 and I've always dreaded summers since it's when I can't bundle up and I always feel too exposed. My advice is to try and get outside if it's sunny where you are, even if you're just in the shade somewhere on your phone or reading a book. Just getting outside and being able to watch the world go by feels loads better than shutting yourself indoors and not going anywhere--I'd know, I've done this for a lot of summers. PM me if you need to talk to someone &lt;3",False,False
