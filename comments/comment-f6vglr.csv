But it's a losing battle thanks to the hormones, and 10% of my body weight is almost 20 pounds. Not gonna stop me though!",False,False

I found out when I tried to get pregnant, and was put on a low dose of metformin right away. It helps some, but it really just keeps my weight from ballooning.   I'm heavy now, and dealing with doctors telling me to lose weight is so hard. Especially since restricting as a teenager is what brought me here.",False,True

Devastating news. But everything makes a lot more sense. Women with PCOS lose weight at 1/3 the rate of women without. Look into inositol and Metformin.,False,False

I wish there was some cure for these conditions...   Its really depressing to think that Ill never be able to eat 'normally'.,False,False

I recently read an article stating that hypo- can lower bmr by up to 40%, which would put me at about 900 bmr. Which makes sense because I don't lose until I go lower than 800. Its so frustrating when people preach the ""1200 is minimum"" shit because not all bodies work like that...",False,False

I'll just spiral. I've agreed to do a 5k with my sister in a few months, so that's getting me moving again! I'm doing just a 30 min jog every morning.",False,True
