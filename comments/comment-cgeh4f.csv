Like I’m not trying to be funny or ironic I really want to know. I have been up and down ever since I quit purging as a young adult. I’m very up right now about 70lbs over my goal and I’m attempting to get back down. I weigh probably like two times a day and I panic over 500 calories even though I work out. I try to stay under 1000 every day. I’m not perfect I go well over 1000 every day I feel like but I always track around 1300. I have been losing weight but still is this really a problem if so god I need help.,False,False
