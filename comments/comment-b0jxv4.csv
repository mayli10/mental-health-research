On a cognitive level, we do something called configural face processing. We see something and automatically apply stereotypes to what we perceive. So we do this with faces. We have an internal stereotype of what is attractive, what is too large/small, stereotypes about personality characteristics the face implies, and so on. But when we turn a face upside down, studies show that this interrupts our ability to apply stereotypes to that face. I am sure this applies to the rest of the body - so it's like you're seeing your body without your preconceived stereotypes, to some extent. :)",False,False
