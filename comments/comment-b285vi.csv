As much as the workload has been stressing me out, when I went back to uni this year I realised I actually felt way better about other stuff. I also recently achieved \~appearance goals\~ like OP (hair finally a reasonable length, good weight, nice skin) but it honestly hasn't made me happy - working on all the other stuff is satisfying, and by accomplishing stuff there it actually makes me appreciate the physical stuff I achieved more as well (because it's not the only thing I'm focused on, so I'm not obsessing over improving my physical appearance even more).",False,False

Depression doesn't listen to logic. You're an amazing and capable and resilient person. Can you see a therapist or counselor? A psychiatrist? There's nothing wrong with leading a happy life while taking antidepressants. ",False,False

This is deeper than it seems.  A good therapist might help you find the root of it all. Or at least help you understand how your brain works and why some things are harder than others. ,False,False

I think if you get to your goal by starving yourself, it’s more difficult to appreciate it. I want to love myself the way I am and work on getting slim because it’s what I want, not because I feel like I need to to be happy. ",False,False

Life is suffering is pretty much my catch phrase. You look forward to things thinking that because of how much work you put into them there will be a reward. Unfortunately it doesn't always turn out that way. ,False,False

It's hard to work really hard for something, reach the end goal, and then not have it feel as great as you thought it would. Maybe try working for different goals (non-body related) like work or education or art or fitness, etc. It might give you something else to 'get good at' or 'perfect'. I am a huge perfectionist and over achiever, I always need a new 'project' to obsess over. I know there isnt a 'bam you're cured' solution but this may take you're mind off of it for awhile. Hope this helps ❤ ",False,False
