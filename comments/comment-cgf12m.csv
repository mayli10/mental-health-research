I didn't lose the weight where I thought I would. My upper body is starting to show bones but my legs still rub and jiggle and I still wear aaaaaallll the same pants. Cool. So now it's just an ever-lowering GW until I lose a couple pant sizes which is cool. ðŸ‘Ž,False,False

I have so many outfit inspo boards on Pinterest tho for when I finally hit my goal weight,False,False

I canâ€™t tell you how much time I spend looking online at clothes Iâ€™m gonna buy once I get there   Mentally itâ€™s frustrating cause I know Iâ€™m kinda wasting my time since Iâ€™m not ready to buy them yet but it keeps me motivated so itâ€™s hard,False,False
