I started at 110 lbs last June, and stayed there for awhile, and started CICO in November, fell off the wagon in December because of exams, then got back into it when school started again.  I was 105 lbs last Tuesday, but it's not like I've been gradually losing weight.  It's more like, become plant-based and work out for an hour consistently, wonder why you aren't losing weight, learn about calorie counting and get a better fitness watch, then start losing ~2 pounds a month.",False,False
