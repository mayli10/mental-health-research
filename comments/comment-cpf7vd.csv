I lost 20 lbs since last time I was at the doctors.  Last time I was there, I had lost 15 lbs in a year without me doing anything, kind of just a puberty/hormonal thing, and she was a little concerned.  I hope next time I go she doesnâ€™t think I have an ED or anything. While I post in this community and have some disordered habits, I donâ€™t have an ED.
