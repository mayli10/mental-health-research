I’m sorry either way❤️ my mom used to blow up at me ALL the time when I still lived at home for nothing and I never understood why. Now I get stressed just getting through the day and get annoyed by the tiniest little things, especially when I’m restricting, so I totally get it. It’s just a question of knowing an appropriate way to release your stress, and your mom needs a better one. ",False,False
