Maybe it's a sign I need to try recovery.   I'm donating blood next week (oh the irony) for the first time. So with this + lack of period in mind, I'm reeaally trying to make myself eat more. I already thought 1300 was too many calories but I really don't want to be turned down from donating (last time it was my small veins) so gonna try and make myself eat 1600...hoping my body will appreciate this struggle! I'm trying to tell myself that this is nourishing my body and hopefully it will help me realise that eating a 'normal' amount won't make me fat.  Good luck! I hope both our bodies can  heal and all strength and energy is restored. üíï",False,False

I've lost 4 kg in two months, so mine wasn't a ""dramatic"" weight loss either. I do have a very low body fat percentage, but it has been this way since I was 15, before becoming disordered.  My boyfriend thinks that my body is just too tired of the shit I've been putting it through. Why should my body waste blood to line my uterus when there's not enough food to sustain it, let alone to fuel all of my running and lifting? This morning he told me: ""You know, maybe your body thinks that you're living somewhere where food is scarce and you're running from lions every day. Having a period is just not a priority right now"".  I really hope that my boyfriend is right. Maybe we're both just really tired. Maybe we should just treat our bodies with a little bit more kindness and compassion, and rest every once in a while. ‚ù§Ô∏è",False,True

March is the first time ever in the history of me having periods that I've ever skipped one. I'm really scared it won't come back.   For info, my bmi is currently around 18.9-19.3 atm. Since Dec, I've lost around 2-3kg. It's not fast weight loss especially since my restriction is pretty high anywhere between 1200-1600 cals a day. For lent I've cut out most junk food and processed sugars. I'm exercising 5 times a week consistently (which is not much more than usual).   I'm not underweight so I'm really not sure why it's gone - maybe the combination of overexercising and restriction. üò©",False,False

In my mind, that should've prevented me from losing my period, but I guess it didn't work hahaha.  But anyway, do you think that eating at maintenance will be enough? This week I've averaged between 2000 and 2200 calories a day (I work out a lot and walk everywhere, apparently you need a fuckton of food to do that), and while my weight has been stable, I still feel super guilty after I eat. I don't know if I'd be able to eat even more.",False,True
