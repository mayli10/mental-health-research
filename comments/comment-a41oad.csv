We all talk about how we hate being judged for what we eat, why is it okay here? It's not like the woman in the story was being hypocritical. She wasn't judging other people for their weight or diets and then eating unhealthily themselves. All they did was say they didn't eat their overnight oats and ate some junk instead.
