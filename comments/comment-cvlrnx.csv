I‚Äôve had periods of remission and several relapses over the 25 years since then, and the most recent relapse could perhaps be diagnosed today as atypical. I‚Äôm pretty UW, have body dysmorphia and have a fear of weight gain, but my behaviors are not typically anorexic.   I don‚Äôt calorie count, I eat calorie dense and high fat foods, and I‚Äôm not obsessed with food at all, I‚Äôm more like one of those ‚Äúnaturally skinny‚Äù people from supersize vs superskinny who thinks they eat ok and can‚Äôt gain weight but it turns out they don‚Äôt realise how much they‚Äôre under-eating.   Idk, I put it down to classical conditioning as I‚Äôve had the ED a long time now and I think it has always been present even during remission periods in its latent form.   Sometimes I have doubts when I can‚Äôt relate to all the people obsessing over calories etc but then I start wondering how much my ED could have warped my own perception of how bad it is, maybe it‚Äôs progressed to an autonomic form, and it becomes a bit of a mindfuck ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è",False,False
