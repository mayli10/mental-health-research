People pick up on “hanger” pretty easily, so I make an extra effort to be amiable even when I’m hungry. Reading this post made me realize that I think my negative emotions present themselves more strongly when I’m mad at myself for eating (what I perceive as) too much. Great insight to have and be aware of.",False,False

Poor fiancé was probably like “yeah this sucks but why are you so angry and upset?!” I’m just grateful that I can try to keep it in mind and do my best to be more level headed in communicating when it inevitably happens again.",False,True

Now this changes my outlook on so many things I've gotten upset about in the past, and will hopefully help me frame things appropriately in the future.",False,True

She picked up on my mindset and problem from just my fiance and I mentioning the gym and past weight loss. She pegged me so quickly about this and other things I thought were deeply buried.,False,True

I noticed this after I found myself getting unreasonably upset when family members wanted to alter plans. When I finally asked myself why I was becoming so distressed about these types of things, I realized so much of it had to with the fact that I had already arranged my own eating/exercise plans around them. I’m glad you had this realization as well. Eating disorders are absolutely insidious! ",False,False
