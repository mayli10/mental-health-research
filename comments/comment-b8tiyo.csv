Unfortunately I had a really terrible therapist, on the first appointment she wanted me to go see a psych so I could get on medications, and i hadn't even told her anything about myself yet! (I was 13 so medications weren't even a good option.) That kind of put me off of therapy, but if you find the right therapist I think it can help loads. ",False,False

I know this from personal experience. After a session with my psycologist where it was just me and her, she went and told some things to my dad that i had said during the session. ",False,False

It’s scary at first. Talking is hard, but your therapist will work with you on opening up. Their job is to be patient and listen to you and help you. Whatever you tell them stays between you and them. It’s a safe space that really can help. I think the key is finding a therapist you really can trust. If you go to your first appointment and you really don’t like who you got at all (which probably won’t be too likely) don’t be afraid to speak up and ask for someone else. Don’t be afraid to do this multiple times until you find someone that works. It’s a process but it’s better in the long run. Therapists can’t prescribe medication. They’ll help you find coping mechanisms that you can apply to your every day life. Also find a therapist that works on a sliding scale or maybe one that is covered by your insurance. I think it’s worth paying for.   My favorite way to think about therapy is “you go to a doctor for your body, a dentist for your teeth, an eye doctor for your vision etc etc, so why not see one for your brain too?” ",False,False

The most important thing is to find a therapist who you click with. Some people will just give off vibes you don't like - maybe they're too serious, maybe they're too spiritual, maybe they just piss you off. You don't have to stick with someone who you don't feel comfortable with! For years I saw female therapists because I'm female and thought your therapist was supposed to be the same gender, but I've actual found I prefer talking to men. I went through four therapists before finding the one I'm with now, who I've been with since 2016. Part of therapy is building up that relationship - talking gets easier over time.  With regards to medication, only a psychiatrist is licensed to give out medication. Some psychiatrists do do talk therapy, but most of the time the person you think of as a therapist is actually a counselor, psychologist, or licensed clinical social worker. They might suggest putting you in touch with a psychiatrist if they think it would help you, but they cannot prescribe medication and will never medicate you against your will.  Finally, its definitely possible to find therapists who work on a sliding scale or would be willing to make accommodations. I had a therapist I loved who stopped taking my insurance and he kept me as an out-of-network patient at a reduced rate.   Therapy is always worth it!! I really recommend you look into it.",False,False
