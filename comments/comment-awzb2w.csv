Of the atypical antipsychotics, seroquel has the least amount of weight gain associated with it. And often, the ‚Äúweight gain‚Äù is caused when super depressed or manic patients who haven‚Äôt been eating or taking care of themselves get better and start eating again. It may increase appetite but I personally did not notice any change in appetite. Also, if you stop it suddenly you can get unpleasant side effects like insomnia. ",False,False
