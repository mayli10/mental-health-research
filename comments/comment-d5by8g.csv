Right? Instead, you stop or turn and turn back onto the right road again. Small detour, nothing major.  I try to think about this when I am constantly going over my limit and on the verge of bingeing...",False,False

This past weekend I kept going over but today I finally stayed at 625. I brewed I think 8 quarts of green tea and drank 4 of them with a salad and then a can of soup bulked up with some extra broth and steamed veggies. Now that I was able to restrict today I think I’ll be okay this week. Maybe you just have to power through one day and then you will be back on track. I had to literally put my pbfit in my car because it was causing me to binge almost every night.,False,False
