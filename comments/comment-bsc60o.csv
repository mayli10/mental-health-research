I didn't want to patronise you and tell you that life is sunshine and rainbows, because I know what it's like to go through what you're going through. But I also know that people who are suffering usually don't want to suffer MORE. And it can be easy to see that something is potentially fatal and think, sweet, that's what I want, but being dead and dying are very very different things. I understand what it's like to want to be dead but nobody wants to be dying, not for years as your body struggles to pump blood painfully to your organs. Nobody deserves that, specially not you. ‚ô•  I can't promise I can offer any good advice but if you wanna talk you can DM me, okay? I'm also on Peach under the same u/n if you use it.",False,False

I know that our reaction to comments like ""YOU'LL DIE!"" is ""fuckin sweet, where do I sign up,"" but ipecac is not like cyanide. It's like a fucked up heart. It doesn't kill you for sure. It just makes you feel like you're dying without ever being guaranteed death. It just makes your suffering worse without ever actually ending it. And it won't even help you purge if you keep abusing it.  It's not two-birds-with-one-stone throw-uppy death-faster liquid. It's ""great, now I'm even unhappier than I was before, and there's no fucking end in sight"" liquid. Like cutting off your arm and hoping you get gangrene.  also i know you feel like your circumstances are irreversible right now but can you imagine if you did get the will to live someday and then got denied a heart transplant bc of ipecac abuse. lmao",False,False

Like 6 at this point and it just has sucked everything out of me. It's like, no matter what happens, good or bad, I just feel blank.  But money is tight for me. I'll probably experiment with homemade emetics first so if those do work I dont need to buy the straight up posion   But I really appreciate your comment, it did brighten my day a bit",False,True

Really think about it (which I'm sure you have) but don't take the chance, even if you do feel like it's okay that this could harm you.  If you can, talk to someone, a professional, friend, hotline, or feel free to pm me any time.  Just imagine the possibility of one day not feeling this way, and looking back and seeing that your struggles have made you stronger.  I can tell that you are a caring, intelligent, helpful person from your post history, and you have a lot to offer the world. So much love ‚ù§Ô∏è",False,False

I literally just dont care about life anymore. Like I just dont have words to express how badly I hate myself and how badly I hate life. And food is the only thing besides exercise that brings me but my brain just will not let me try to gain weight or not care about how much i ate. And if I binge at least I'll die with an empty stomach for the autopsy ü§™ü§™ü§™,False,True

It's not just a herbal remedy with a ""funny quirk"" to make you vomit. Please don't try to get your hands on some. Maybe look into getting something safer and softer to use other than fingers to avoid damaging your esophagus more if you must purge.   Please please don't do ipecac.",False,False
