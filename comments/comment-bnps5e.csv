Get to know what my body feels like and dance around in my underwear. I also know that having more muscle let’s me do so much and I’m so grateful for my body to have these abilities like doing chores with ease and not getting tired walking up my campus’ hills. But honestly I am still trying to lose weight, although in healthier ways than in the past. I feel fine with restricting at the moment, but sometimes it feels defeatist because I’m not seeing big results right away. It’s hard and honestly I feel better seeing myself with less muscle but I do believe that maintaining a super lean yet toned physique is really hard. Probably not healthy long-term but do-able. It just seems like on a biological level or at least with my body that gaining muscle while still being super skinny are contradicting one another.",False,False
