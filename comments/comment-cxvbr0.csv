Check out some YouTubers, Ik you‚Äôre female, but the male Ed community on YT has way better methods of dealing with Ed stuff in my opinion (it seems like a lot of F YTs are either hypocritical or ‚Äúyou must binge 4evar! }=]‚Äù)   Well gtg, and have a great day, as best as you can at least!",False,False
