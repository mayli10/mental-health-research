BUT THEY KNOW somehow... like they casually mentioned how I sneak food into my room to eat myself without sharing and I‚Äôm just like üò±. But it‚Äôs prob cuz of the trash or the smell from the car ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è. Sometimes you just want eat all the food yourself without sharing ya know.

Problem is I live alone now which makes it EVEN EASIER urgh, but the shop I live next to at least has healthy options.   Where I used to live I lived with a super healthy boy who used to hang out the whole time in the front room. I used to sneak to wait until he was in the shower then sneak to the shop, buy all the shit I could find then fast pace it back home again to lock myself in my room before he had chance to realise that I had been gone. I'd put on a movie to muffle the sound and open packets under my duvet to hide the noise.   It's too much really considering he probably didn't notice a thing.
