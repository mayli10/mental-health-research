What youâ€™re insecure with in yourself is what you notice in others, so just know the bitches who said stuff to you probably are suffering in their own way. But good! Fuck them and their opinions! I hope theyâ€™re unhappy with themselves, they should be.  I hope you feel better soon, know that you did nothing wrong and you canâ€™t control the fact that people have little to no brain cells left. ",False,False

As much as possible, try not to let their awfulness affect your self-love. Meanness most often comes from a place of insecurity, and young boys are often full of both.   In five years, when youâ€™re crushing life and theyâ€™re wallowing, none of it will matter.   I was picked on all throughout elementary and high school. The people who bullied me never left our small town, and either got pregnant right away or became addicted to drugs (or both). None of them are successful and most of them hate their lives.   I wish I was mentally strong enough when I was your age to not let them affect me, but words hurt. All you can do is hold on to and nurture your self love because in the end, that is exponentially more important and more real than their passing taunts. ",False,False
