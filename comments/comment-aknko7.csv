Anything can throw off your hormones, but if your diet and weight are the only things that you have changed in the last few months, it is likely tied to that. If you are at all worried that it may be something else though, definitely go see your doctor.",False,False

It kinda freaked me out, but as I recover and slowly put a couple pounds back on it 'fixed' itself. Last cycle was a little late but much closer to normal. If we didn't have plans to get pregnant later this year I wouldn't have cared about this, but I need my hormones functioning properly for ovulation purposes. ",False,False
