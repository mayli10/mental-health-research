For me the worst is when I'm the only/one of the only people in the room eating- I just feel like everyone is watching me and it makes me so uncomfortable. Over the summer I had to share an office with the other intern and I couldn't bring myself to eat anything when he was in the room, so sometimes I would just go the entire day without eating",False,False

When I was obese I didnâ€™t eat in front of others because I felt like they were judging everything I eat. Now I donâ€™t eat in front of others because either a) I donâ€™t eat or b) I still feel like they might judge what Iâ€™m eating.,False,False
