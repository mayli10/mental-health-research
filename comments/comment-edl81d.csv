I just think it’d be interesting to see some academic research vs. my uneducated speculation. Also tho if I has to smack myself every time i used something to inappropriately justify my ED i’d probably have several concussions",False,True

If our ancestors didn't eat much it's because they didn't have much and they actually had to work extremely hard to get their food. They were fighting for their survival. We don't have to do this. We are in a place in time were some of us can afford healthy eating. And healthy also means eating enough. My ed says shit like ""our ancestors didn't eat much too, usually lmao"" and then have to smack myself for it because that's not something to laugh about and not something you should validate your disorder with.",False,False

I think a lot of disorders and illnesses are born out of or couldn't exist without civilization/modern society and ED is not an exception. The whole spectrum, not just restrictive. Being surrounded by excess easily available food is one thing. Foods designed to be addictive. The pressures of modern or ""first world"" society. They are excessive and unnatural. Many people are helplessly trapped in a system that only seeks to extract their time, labor, and money with no return.   Its not just about gather/hunting but much time was spent rearing children, bonding with a relatively small community and doing labor that directly aides the community. Nowadays everything is set up to pull you away from those core pieces of humanity. Its a good thing we can sit around to think and innovate and learn but we are still catching up to making this sort of lifestyle healthy and fulfilling. There's more to it and I have more thoughts but here's some of my perspective.",False,False

Like people throughout histort were going thru constantly going through periods where they probably didn’t eat much or at all. I peruse the fasting sub sometimes and people are always aaying that lol. At the very least bodies can handle it.,False,True

I mean, throughout history it’s fairly common to see most societies did not overindulge when it came to eating, and they all were eating extremely clean in terms of fruits/veggies/proteins. It makes me wish I was living a thousand years ago even more, fuck processed food",False,False
