I needed this for my soul but tomorrow I will try again. I'm not harsh on myself anymore. I just accept what I did and try to do better next day. There's usually a reason why I binge, may it be that I restricted too hard or have a problem that stresses me out, so I try not to punish myself. We're just humans. Today is not the only day were everything can be ""perfect"" and you could be at your goal weight. You have so many years to live and have so much time to change yourself. One day of binging won't do nothing. Just continue to eat normally the next day. It will be okay.",False,False
