I get how your bone structure can make that feel like it's not true, but is looks like you have a narrow waist. That's probably what the person you were talking to meant. If I'm not mistaken the average size of an adult woman's ribcage at a healthy weight is 30""-36"" and the average height of women is 5'4"", so judging by the pictures and your flair I would assume your rib size is average rather than big.",False,False

My ribs are visible at a BMI of 22. I absolutely hate that fact that I will never be thin. I'll always have a hulking barrel of a torso making me so top heavy.",False,False

But... it's bmi 22 without any muscle in a body that used to be bmi 42. Not even remotely skinny.,False,True

Maybe they're honest and you're smaller than you think but body dysmorphia just makes you think you look big.",False,False
