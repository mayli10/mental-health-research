You can get a lot of meals on there that are low calorie or like other said, eat less of it.  You can also get it and adjust the meals accordingly.  For example, some meals call for cooking in oil, and I use cooking spray or some meals call for sour cream on top which can easily be omitted.  If you want to try it out, feel free to use my referral code for $30 off which makes the cost more reasonable:  [https://www.homechef.com/invite/Mp7lYwFoJjEpg](https://www.homechef.com/invite/Mp7lYwFoJjEpg)",False,False

You could also just split each meal between the two of you and save half of your portion for another day. I used HelloFresh for a little while and really liked the meals - I mostly stopped because it was too expensive for me personally (and after that was when my eating issues got bad lol).",False,False
