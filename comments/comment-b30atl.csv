I have many reasons for it that I wont get into right now (unless asked). I don’t think my body and mind could handle being pregnant whether I have an ED or not. *With* an ED though, it makes me worried about how my body would be destroyed, and I wouldn’t wanna end up secretly resenting my innocent daughter due to it.      If you want/choose to have kids, theres still options that don’t require you to destroy your body with birth. Its your body, so if you don’t want to be pregnant, then you have every right to avoid pregnancy. I think adopting is a smarter option than giving birth anyways. ",False,False
