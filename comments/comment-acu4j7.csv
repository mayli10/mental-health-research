You can even double this to make it fit your needs, this is what I follow, I restrict so heavy even tho i burn a lot, i usually eat 300 or so if Iâ€™m resting. I know I need to eat more, but it makes me physically ill ðŸ˜·ðŸ˜©ðŸ˜‚",False,False

I don't think such a meal plan will work for me because I do burn quite a bit from running and I don't think I would be able to function at work, and I'm trying to avoid anything too extreme so I am less likely to binge. I'll aim for 800-ish per day at the beginning.  Thank you!",False,True

I can help you through it, itâ€™s going to take some time, and probably eating a little more than you might be used too, but donâ€™t let that deter you!!! Please, focus on feeling good in your body, even if you feel likes itâ€™s betrayed you, mentality is a big proponent.... once you feel a little better slowly start to eat less and drink more water. Sometimes I donâ€™t eat food but drink a kombucha, which is very good for your health, and I donâ€™t eat meat because it causes inflammation. Skip the rice cakes and other low calorie diet foods, eat real foods and satiating ones too! This is normally my breakfast and lunch, but if I have time I grab a rx bar or a Julian bakery pegan thin protein bar. Then I find I can get some nutrients in and feel fuller. If I donâ€™t have either of those I eat a large salad with lots of veggies and add apple cider vinegar on top with a tbsp of hemp hearts. Usually I put some tempeh on top. For dinner, I love to have one large sweet potato (lower in carbs and high in fiber and other nutrients and decently low calories) I usually eat this towards dinner time because it might cause a little bloat. If you can bring yourself to do it, add a tsp of olive oil so you can extract nutrients and properly break down the food. All of these options are interchangeable and can be changed for your preference. But I feel so much better with this meal plan and itâ€™s approx 500 calories   Kombucha (70cal for 16oz) Rx Bar/pegan bar (200calâ€”varies on flavor) Salad with 1 serving of tempeh (170calâ€”lots of greens to keep you full) 1tbsp hemp hearts (60calâ€”and lots of protein and some fats to help with digestion) Apple cider vinegar (usually 0 calories but I always log as 5) Large sweet potato (100 caloriesâ€” well it seems large to me but this varies on the size of your potato)  1tsp olive oil (40 cal)  Salad lunch option: 465 calories Protein bar lunch option: 410 calories  This also can give you some room for a little treat like a chocolate square or something you enjoy thatâ€™s low in cal like a small apple. To reduce bloat try drinking ginger teaâ€” u can use fresh cut ginger and add to a cup and pour boiling water over the top. The calorie count has the oil and hemp hearts added in, which I donâ€™t suggest taking out because your body needs fats in order to function and will cause lots of bloat and inflammation if you donâ€™t have them. Drink lots of water too! This helps sooo much, and pick one day a week to not eat fill it up with activities and things to do so that you donâ€™t feel hungry and can get your hunger in check. Hope this helps and that you start to feel better!",False,False
