And this time last year I was low restricting. And before that binging. And before that restricting and b/p. It never ends.",False,False

I've gone through phases of strict low carb and no sugar with moderate calorie intake for the sake of ""healthiness,"" pure restriction, purging on a weekly basis, and now I'm on to exercising 6 days a week, and I feel like an anxious, guilty dumpster fire of a human being if I miss a day. The icing on the cake is that I suck at everything and lack willpower so I fluctuate between bmi of like 18.6 and 20.",False,False

How do you get your brain to NOT automatically count all the calories when you know them by heart. I feel like that’s impossible to just “stop” calorie counting ,False,True

I think orthorexia is the best option for ED sufferers and I definitely have one foot through the door to that world myself - I work out for hours every day, eat “clean” outside of binges (and sometimes within them), etc. But I just don’t think “recovery” is a real thing? It’s like a unicorn or fairy dust. How do you completely rewrite your brain to not think about food and have a healthy relationship with it and eat “normally”? Like that sounds to me like when children tell me they want to be wizards when they grow up. ",False,False
