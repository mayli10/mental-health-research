I feel ya. This isn’t as bad but my fiancé is always trying to get me to gain weight. I’m like 20 lbs lighter than when we first started dating and even then I was like 2 lbs underweight. He wants me to get back to that weight &amp; recently said “I didn’t even think you were that skinny before. All of my friends said you were so skinny but I really didn’t think so”  Like.... I want to be skinny. You want me to gain weight. &amp; you’re going to tell me you didn’t think I was skinny at that *underweight* weight  Smh,False,False
