I also have very fine hair, but I had a lot. It sucked so badly. At my LW it would come out when I ran my hand through it just as you said and clogged up the sink. My eyelashes were falling out and that is what really freaked me out the most :(  Even after I was weight restored, my hair was still super thin and falling out for about 2-3 years. It has finally grown back to the thickness it was before. I take biotin and  B-vitamins, switched to sulfate free shampoo + conditioner, and did castor oil hair masks which made my hair look so much healthier.",False,False

I'm pretty lucky to have naturally thick hair, but it destroys me that my hair isn't a beautiful as it could be if I never had this problem. Unfortunately I think the damage is already done so hair will continue breaking and I'll need to wait another 3 years for it to all grow back to full thickness at the length it's at now, but it's at least something I want to get started on fixing as soon as possible.",False,False

Now it's thinning quickly and very coarse. Last time I was as the hairdresser they lady mentioned the balding spots and I haven't been back since. That was about 1 1/2 years ago. I've grown my hair out and always wear it in a ponytail so you can't see it. Friends and family have told me to try a biotin supplement that has added vitamins a, c and d. I found one at my local chemist, but I still can't justify spending around $50 for hair supplements. So for now I'll just stay balding. Hopefully when I reach my GW I'll look good with a shaved head ðŸ˜‚",False,False
