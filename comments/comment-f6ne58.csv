Controlling what you eat, in a healthy way, with a healthy amount of calories. Working out helps too but honestly to just simply lose weight you don't need it, but it can help you be able to eat more and stay in a healthy deficit  My bf also has gained quite a bit of weight and I have lost quite a bit of weight since we met almost two years ago. He also became unemployed.   When I give him nutrition advice, I feel like it kinda goes through one ear and out the other because he doesn't think I know how it works bc I ""starve myself"".  I know how this works, but I have a hormonal syndrome that makes me gain weight easier and harder to let go of, combined with whatever other b*llshit concotion I have going on with my brain makes me have a weird relationship with food. So I do it in a f*cked up way because my body is f*cked up. I know the basic science of weightloss, and just because what I do to my body doesn't mean I'd wish this on anyone else ever, especially my boyfriend who I love to bits.",False,False

I try to focus on the reasons I'm with them; I love his sense of humor, how he tells me he loves me at least 5 times every day, and honestly, would the situation (as in, your life together) be any different if they were more in shape or eating better? Nobody can force someone to change their habits, unfortunately; the best you can do is focus on your recovery and continue to love him.",False,False

I think even a non-ED person would think ""stop snacking and work out"" if a person expressed wanting to lose weight.   Does he know about your ED? Are you wanting him to not talk about it around you? Do you express these thoughts to him?",False,False
