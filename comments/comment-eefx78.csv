A few days ago just isolated myself from my friends because my ED convinces me I don't deserve to talk to anyone until I'm thin enough. I feel terrible about doing it to them but at the same time I can't help it.,False,False

Idk. I cut myself off from the world 2012-2018. I was in an abusive  relationship 2011-2012 and that made everything so much worse. I deleted my social media in the middle of 2014. I started distancing myself in 2011, when I began treatment. I never talked  to anyone in college and kept to myself. Never made any friends there. I've been coming out of my shell this past year and got back on Facebook. My old friends did seem happy that I came back and we messaged back and forth a bit. I have not been invited to a single outing since New Year's 2014. Not even weddings (two of my best friends got married). It's just painful to see my close friends posting pics of themselves together online without me. I mean I can't really blame them, as they didn't have any means of contacting me anyway from 2014 onward. I just feel kind of awkward trying to reach out now, you know? Like, do they really want to see me or am I just being down on myself?  I'm 28 btw.",False,True

Now I'm too ashamed to get back in contact with any of them, and I don't think they'd want me around anymore. They've all moved on with their lives.  I guess we'll have to try to make new friends (that somehow don't require anything social to involve food of course)?!?   I hope things get better for you.",False,False
