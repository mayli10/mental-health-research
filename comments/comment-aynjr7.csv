I guess my takeaway point is that I hated my body throughout the model experience, and the hate was the biggest downside. Love yourself plz.",False,False

Good money but those lights get hot ya know? Finished uni at 26 so DON'T stress youngling &lt;3  Ed chases me in every career (BUT WILL I FIT AN XXS LABCOAT?)  All I care about these days is reconciling with my mental and physical  health. Please take care Xx  What do you do? Embrace the positives of a lowcal lifestyle, and be honest with those around you, it's so liberating to be like ""I haven't eaten in 3 days for this gig"". Be nice, be sassy.  Embrace the highlights, enjoy the food you can have, keep the photos.  Pps Japan has a superlow calorie alcohol drink called strongzero and it's literally the best, enjoy.",False,False

I still really really wanna break into modelling but this really helped me gain a better perspective on the harshness everyone in the industry is facing.  That being said, you are so young and you have so much time to do anything you want: college, exploring things. Maybe even try and break into acting: same aspect of getting to 'perform' and be creative but wayy less harsh since stories require real people to tell them. You are so smart and aware of how your situation could become really negative, I know you'll make a good choice",False,False

I started college at 21, and I know its going to take a while, but being here has led to me learning what field I want to go into and get my Masters degree. If you want to break away for this industry for a better chance to improve your health, you can. It's never too late. ‚ù§ I don't know if you want to go back to college, but since you mentioned it I think you can always save as much as you can so you can have a good amount in the bank, and then enroll and get a side job. Usually (I don't know where you're from or if this is true in Japana) there are lots of job opportunities on and off campus for college students. But the point is you're worth more than your body and your ED, and if modeling is making it worse, please don't think its the only thing you're good at. ",False,False

Also work environment tends to put the company first and nothing second.    Whatever people tell you watch out for yourself and put yourself first because no one else can. ,False,False
