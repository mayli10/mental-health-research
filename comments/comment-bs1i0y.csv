My first goal weight was like 10 pounds ago but then I kept going and going.  The last couple of months I had to deal with my mental health, and I would seek comfort in food... Binge-fast cycle, now I'm back to restricting but it's only a matter of time before I snap and binge again, it happens on a weekly basis. Every time.  I know I need to ask for help but I'm so afraid.  My mind says no no, I'm scared to even eat 100 calories more than I'm supposed to.  This is hell.",False,True

You don’t. You never reach your goal weight. There’s always lower, more weight to lose, a more unattainable goal, a harder challenge, a new all-encompassing focus.   It sounds like this is all pretty new for you and I would encourage you to talk to somebody and seek help. There’s still hope for you to recover before this disease consumes you. Do it.",False,False
