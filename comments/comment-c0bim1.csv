I‚Äôm so sorry you‚Äôre struggling right now love. I deal with the same thing and know exactly how you feel.   I think, in theory, although much easier said than done, the key is to form a different relationship with food all together - as in, identify what factor(s) bond(s) us to food emotionally, and then work from there. I also think  that the driving factor behind that needs to be a desire to want to get better (aka happier) that outweighs any urges to binge or restrict. Like, letting the prospect of long term happiness be the motivator. Like I said, soo much easier said than done, but it gives me hope to feel like that is possible and achievable.   Also, something that has helped me get through particularly rough patches, is catching myself in either urge and thinking, ‚ÄúWhat can I do in this moment that tomorrow ‚Äòme‚Äô will thank me for/feel healthier/happier because of it?‚Äù Maybe that means making myself a nutritious, non-triggering meal. Maybe that means realizing that I‚Äôm not actually hungry and doing something productive (non food/body related) instead of raiding the pantry, etc., etc. This is another thing that might be really hard to actually apply in the moment, but all it takes is ONE time to do it successfully to feel the deep reward of it. So, maybe try using that as your starting point? Do something tomorrow ‚Äòyou‚Äô will thank you for, even if it‚Äôs just for ONE time.   I hope that helps a little! Stay strong! You got this!! ‚ù§Ô∏è",False,False

We're obsessed with it, we think about it all the time.  We starve because we want to free ourselves from it and deny its power over us, or we binge because we weaken in the face of that power, or we purge in our guilt over giving in.",False,False
