I just wanted you to realise the gravity of your underlying thoughts because it's not pretty. I lost a friendship before because of a similar situation, and it truly breaks my heart. It's like she secretly wanted me to put on weight or be 'uglier'. I couldn't understand why she couldn't be happy for me like I was for her. That thought devasted me.  I saw her as a sister and best friend but insecurity and jealously on her part ultimately ended 8 years of what I thought was an unbreakable bond.  Just letting you know because a small thought like that can snowball into something more deep-seated and ugly. It's better to be more self aware now than later.   I am sure you're a sweet person who's fun to be around and wish you nothing but the best :)",False,False

She does need to be encouraged to eat, it‚Äôs just some of my motives are fucked. I see her as the sister I never had. We talk about food probably 5% of the time. I don‚Äôt text her mid day and say make sure you eat 5000 calories. It‚Äôs more like if she says she wants to have a cheat day, I‚Äôll say ‚Äúwell why not?‚Äù Knowing I would never wanna have a cheat day. This is the only thing I‚Äôve ever lied about or been weird about. I want her to be loved, I want her to have money, I want her to be happy, I just compare myself and I let that get the best of me when it comes to our bodies and food. Anywhere else I can see that our journeys are our own and there no competition but talking about food, and weight, and insecurities with her just makes me weird. Hopefully that makes sense to you and answers the question. I guess I get anxious and insecure when we talk about those things and I act like an ass.",False,True

I know that you realise that you're being extremely toxic, but telling a friend to eat because you wanna be the 'smaller' one is wrong on *so many levels*.  That's a selfish mindset to have. Again, I know you're self aware you're being self centered, but I just feel really sad for your friend. :(  Do you even see her as a friend?",False,False

I always remind myself that rdlationships are not a competition. Really she is your friend and it wont serve you well down the line if you treat relationships as competitions and not teamwork. When you need support you want a true friend and teammate to support you not an enemy. You can see what your doing and are aware so now it's up to you to change your behavior.,False,False
