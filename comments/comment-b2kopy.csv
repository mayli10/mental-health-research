I see so many people comment that they only eat out at chain restaurants because there's nutrition info, but I only eat out at non-chain restaurants because the food is better quality (see: not frozen, processed, pre-packaged everything), so it feels more worth it - like I'd rather guesstimate calories for good food than know for sure how shoddy rubbish food is.

You get dragged somewhere and the food is bad and high cal. That said, I do hope FIL enjoyed it. I am weird AF about food but I love seeing other people enjoy their food and be happy.  I am the opposite, if I eat out it has to be a chain. I need to look up the calorie counts on the menu or online. A lot of local places (near me) don't do that or are WAY too generous with portions. I low key love it when a restaurant is stingy with portions. Of course I rarely eat out anymore but I pretend it's for frugality's sake.
