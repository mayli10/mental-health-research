That is your TDEE for eating at maintenance if you ate “intuitively” and your activity levels don’t change from now. That is the only accurate way to calculate TDEE imo because a lot of metabolism is genetics atop the fact that everyone’s body is different for various reasons. The online calculators are more accurate for people with “average” metabolisms imo.,False,False

The rest depends on how active you are, how much exercise you do, whether your job involves being on your feet or sitting at a desk, etc. Most calculators have a pretty wide margin of error for that though, if you really want to know you should get an Apple Watch or a FitBit or something. Just do your research and get the most accurate one you can afford. Apple Watches are the best for accuracy.",False,False
