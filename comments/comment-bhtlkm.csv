I gained 40 lbs from a way too long binge phase that I haven‚Äôt been able to snap out of. My big mantra has been ‚Äúyou can eat like a normal human the day you get back to your low weight ü§¨‚Äù I hope we‚Äôre all able to find peace someday...or scientists figure out how to decrease the calories of my favorite binge food...whatever comes first. üòÇ,False,False

Like logically, I know that bite would do absolutely nothing, but I always get so guilty feeling when i eat anything at all. Even when I eat my safe foods after 2-3 day fasts, or drink pickle juice (which has less than 0 calories). I wasn't always this bad though, it just got horrible when I gained an insane amount of weight (55 pounds on a 5ft frame fml). I'm down 37 pounds, but I just have this unhealthy mentality where I feel like I don't ""deserve"" food until I'm within my goal range :/ ED brains are wild man.",False,True

I think 90 for the whole thing. Ironic that I know this because the other day someone posted about it on a certain ""dieting"" subreddit.",False,False
