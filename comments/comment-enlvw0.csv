Those would be the ones I’d get. Or even if there’s another flavor you’ve tried and liked, I’d be curious to know.   Also it kind of weirds me out that, according to the Skinny Mixes website, they’re only found in stores like T.J. Maxx and Marshall’s yet they’re not found in grocery stores. Aren’t T.J Maxx and Marshall’s both mainly clothing/home decor stores?",False,False
