It helped to get a sense of who people were. I also think our flairs should say our peach names.

Maybe post a peach on your post so we know you are one of us? IDK!  I think we should have BODY CHECKS here. Not call them progress pics. And not try to glorify them but we can say you look happy or I like your outfit or you're really pretty, etc. ",False,False
