I haven’t eaten in front of my parents (or anyone) in two years. I don’t even let my family  see me make food or grab anything from the kitchen. I wait until they’re asleep, at work, or out of the house.  The only person I’ll eat in front of is my GF, but that only started because I was in a binge phase when I first began dating her, and I would just binge 24/7 and she was unfortunately a witness to it. However, now that I’m restricting again, I REALLY don’t like eating in front of her. She is a huge talker, and I like it to be silent when I eat. Today I was eating one of my fav foods (peanut butter + oatmeal, which was also my highest cal meal of the day), and she kept talking and asking questions about random things. Like, let me enjoy my food in peace :( I get few calories as is.",False,False
