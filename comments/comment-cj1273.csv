Believe me, I get not wanting people to suspect, and I get the fear of being forced into medical care. I'm also really sorry you got triggered into heavy restriction. But your family is doing the right thing; they've noticed you shave a problem, and so they're thinking of taking you to a doctor. It sounds like they care about you very much, and want you to be safe. (How I wish someone had looked out for me that way!)   Just remember your family is concerned for you - scared, even. And tough as this all must be, you're at a critical age in terms of recovery....after which things are going to get way tougher, as the ED becomes more entrenched. In light of that, I hope you'll keep an open mind about medical help &lt;3",False,False
