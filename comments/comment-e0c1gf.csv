Lots of people become weary of you when you tell them about stuff like eating disorders and if you are progressing into a relation ship this might stop it. Also this can be used against. if he doesn‚Äôt realllly care about you he may tell others as your problems don‚Äôt effect him.  Just take it slow, enjoy your time with him anyways boys are pretty clueless",False,False
