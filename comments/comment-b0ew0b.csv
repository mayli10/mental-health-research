Iâ€™m sorry itâ€™s been a rough set of days for you. If it helps, I have stretch marks too. They fade out to almost nothingâ€”mine pretty closely match my skin tone now, but it took me until I went to college and started talking to other classmates to realize theyâ€™re incredibly common (even Chrissy Teigen has them) and itâ€™s not always tied to weight gain or loss. Some medications and family history can also have an affect on skin elasticity. They do fade to almost nothing eventually, but if they are bothering you now, Retin-A or self-tanner might help minimize them faster. Sending hugs and hope the rest of your week gets better. ðŸ’•",False,False
