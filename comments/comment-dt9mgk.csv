I was very close to getting surgery and Iâ€™m pretty sure if I had just lied for the psych eval part I wouldâ€™ve been fine. In my experience itâ€™s not like theyâ€™re requesting your records from any therapist youâ€™ve gone to you just need one letter of clearance and it can be a psych you havenâ€™t even met before that eval. I think they are looking to see that youâ€™ve tried other methods and had no success so like oh I tried weight watchers and blah blah blah and also that youâ€™re mentally ready for the surgery and the aftercare. I may have turned into a blubbering mess as it was the first time I ever saw a psychologist lol ðŸ¤¡,False,False
