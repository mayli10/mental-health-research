I do not think you should blame yourself at all, not that I can tell you how to feel. I personally think everyone should go vegan, but I‚Äôm well aware that it‚Äôs just not in the realm of possibility for others.   As for my experience with this, I tried to put it into perspective. My poor diet choices were due to my laziness, so I‚Äôd think ‚Äúfive, twenty..minutes cooking or an animal‚Äôs life‚Äù. That really helped me stick with this.   It comes down to time management food prepping is one of the best solutions I can offer you if you want to stay vegan. Take multivitamins, vegetarian ones are good if you can‚Äôt find or afford certified vegan ones (it‚Äôs ridiculous to pay that much tbh). Tofu is my ultimate lazy food. I cut it however I feel like that day and bake it. It‚Äôs plain but delicious if you toss it in sauce halfway through the bake time, or just dipped in ketchup!  If you do really want to be vegan, wait until you are in a better place mentally and you‚Äôre relationship with food had improved. And be very careful because for so many people it leads them right back down the road of disordered eating.   I know you will make the decision that is best for you right now. It‚Äôs hard, I understand. I‚Äôm sending you the best wishes, and good luck on your finals!üíïüíïüíö",False,False

I started out ‚Äúclean‚Äù and eating healthy, organic ingredients, but they were all still contributing to my weight gain because I wasn‚Äôt calorie counting and basically eating intuitively (lots of carbs, nut butters, avocados, all the fatty delicious stuff).   Then I moved onto junk food vegan when I started dating my boyfriend which meant lots of greasy vegan foods.   I struggled giving it up too because I went vegan for environmental reasons (plus I‚Äôm an anti-capitalist and I feel like you can‚Äôt be one without realizing the faults of the meat/dairy industry) but I realized 2 things.   1. it was literally mentally exhausting being vegan. I was constantly consumed with what I would be eating next, where I would be able to find food, reading different comments about veganism, etc. It was messing with my head and contributed to my disordered eating and purging habit.   2, while I can‚Äôt 100% justify it, there is no ethical consumption under capitalism and the reality is that we do a very small bit being vegan as individuals, especially when there are other aspects of consumption that contribute to even more cruelty.   So, I gave it up. I still feel guilty sometimes but I‚Äôm overall a lot happier. I‚Äôve transferred my environmentalist/anti-consumption views to exclusively shopping at thrift stores, upping my recycling, reusable bags, etc etc. This is just my $0.02 and experiences may vary. I hope things turn around for you soon ‚ù§Ô∏è",False,False

I work from home so I used to feel really guilty about it, kept telling myself that I should find the time for it and that I was a lazy piece of dirt. I put on a lot of weight at the start of the year because of it.  So I decided to really give myself a break and allow myself to buy ready-made soups (refrigerated or canned), so I always have an easy, relatively healthy vegan meal that I just need to heat up. For bread cravings, I started buying rice cakes.  It's not ideal but it stops me from spiralling down. I hope that helps!",False,False

Now I am just doing whatever I need to, to survive.. just eat healthier stuff. I stay away from carbs for the most part.. but I have safe foods too. I would love to go vegan again someday when I am in a better spot.. a lot of meat and dairy makes me sick as well.. I just stay away from it for the most part but try and be as healthy as I can.. at work for lunch I just bring a big salad and apples! It‚Äôs tasty and filling also healthy. Fruits and veggies are bffs! Idk if I helped much but feel free to message me! I‚Äôm a good listener, hope I wasn‚Äôt triggering or anything.. also that‚Äôs very amazing to have lost all that from healthy eating and exercise!
