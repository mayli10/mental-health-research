I canâ€™t remember if the minimum dosage was a half teaspoon or one teaspoon, but I started with the minimum and it did nothing for me. Then I was an idiot and took the max dose and it was too much. 1.5 teaspoons is my sweet spot. So donâ€™t be discouraged if it doesnâ€™t work at first until you find your perfect dosage.",False,True

Since I was little i've struggled with chronic constipation, leading to anxiety around going to the toilet..Laxatives were part of my weekly life and even encouraged by doctors/family.. and so I think part of my ED developed when I was a teenager out of fear of eating and then having trouble going to the toilet, and then abusing laxatives further.. which then ironically only made things worse. I'm 26 and still struggle with this, miralax/metamucil haven't seemed to work for me, and I've never heard of Calm before so thank you, going to try it out.",False,False
