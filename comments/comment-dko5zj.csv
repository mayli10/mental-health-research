It gets hard to socialize without food coming in eventually. That’s part of what I love about coffee shops though, it’s a good food-location  alternative because you can always opt for tea or black coffee.",False,True

You'll probably find you lose weight on those days from compensating for the calories. Restaurants are delicious. Can't live without em myself.,False,False
