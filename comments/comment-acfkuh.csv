But even just basic things like referring to it as a health issue, not a mental health issue; talking about symptoms I experience and how I manage them/what help I need (maybe itâ€™s just me, but I donâ€™t think of an ED behaviour as being a symptom). It seems so silly writing it down, but I honestly just donâ€™t think of whatâ€™s going on as a health issue and so itâ€™s completely bizarre for it to be spoken about in this way. ",False,True

It makes me so angry that thereâ€™s this culture of â€˜not Iâ€™ll enoughâ€™ and Iâ€™m really grateful I donâ€™t have that to contend with right now.

I struggled for a long time to be taken seriously by my doctor and most people in my life. It honestly triggered me so much, like am I not skinny/sick enough to be taken seriously? I knew I had a big problem and that I needed more help to stop it. It was only when I became severely underweight that people suddenly became extremely concerned and I had to go IP. And that was so difficult and strange, because I was so used to not being fully believed or listened to. And suddenly everyone was afraid I was gonna die. It actually made it difficult to accept help. I'm angry that I had to become so ill before I received the help I had been asking for all along.   Your work place sounds amazing. I'm really glad they're being so supportive. &lt;3 ",False,False
