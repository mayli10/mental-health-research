I had just donated all the smaller clothes except a few sentimental pieces that I thought would fit if I healthily lost a bit of weight. Relapsed and now even those are too big most of the time. I’ve had to buy a few pieces to get through the work week. I’m not donating shit again for a while because these fluctuations suck.   I’m almost like, can I try recovery again in another month or two when I’m down another 30lbs to give me more of a buffer for recovery weight gain?",False,False

I recently just discovered they go all the way down to a UK size 2 (which I guess would be the one below a US double zero?), and they also have loads of petite stuff too. Obviously not as cheap as goodwill because it’s not second hand but it was really nice to wear stuff that I didn’t have to spend hours tailoring first, and still pretty cheap at that.",False,False
