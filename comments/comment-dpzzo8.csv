I've never recovered from my ED but i have from suicidal thoughts that lasted a solid 5 yrs. n just like a healthy person, u will have bad days n u will have good days. recovery is time to find a new healthy hobby to make u forget abt what ur going thru. always remember that the way u see urself is mostly in ur head n ur body is beautiful no matter what the number on the scale is. but even when it's hard to believe that, small steps r valid too. whether that is challenging fear of a certain food, or eating a healthy number of calories, even if u breakdown afterwards, that's a valid step and ur doing so good. when i see ed recovery videos, the pattern is that it usually takes abt a yr or two to get recovered, but guess what? not everyone is the same!! it might take u longer or u might have a life changing experience that will help u n make it shorter. just b patient n always remember to work on small little steps. good luck in ur journey ❤️ we're all very very proud of u",False,False
