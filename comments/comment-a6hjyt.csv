They bring fresh fruit out after the ceremony and one time I ate a mango... omg best food experience of my life! Fresh fruits are the best thing ever on psychs (not during the peak though, wait at least 4 hours!) now I’ve incorporated fruit into the end of shroom experiences and there’s just no going back ;) ",False,False

There’s negligible fat or sugar in them and they taste horrible that’s for sure, and their calories will be offset by them completely killing your appetite for a good few hours!

I said earlier that my trips have morphed into fuelling my Ed and telling me I can do it and commit to losing weight this time. But I also felt a lot more peace with that. ,False,True

When I’m on mushrooms I can truly see how skinny I am, and beautiful (not just my face but my soul through my eyes).   When sober I see myself as normal weight, quite plain looking and a person with more character flaws than anything, I’m highly critical. I take shrooms and like in the mirror, oh wow, you’re so pretty, and you have a beautiful soul... but look at the state of your body, what have you done to it? You’re skin and bones.   And then I feel sad about it that I’ve treated this lovely person like this, I feel maternal over my own reflection, and I resolve to look after her better.   Shrooms and aya really help me to love myself and realize that I deserve better than treating my body the way I do.   They’ve been very powerful and helpful for me in recovery as well as a bunch of other problems. I’m terrified of them though lol.",False,False

On my last acid trip I really committed to recovery. I can really see the truth then. I went to use the bathroom and when I looked in the mirror, an emaciated version of myself said ""you can be happy,"" then waved goodbye and walked away. Then I came back to my friends watching the new ""A Wrinkle in Time"" movie and there was this scene where Oprah is talking about people's personal ""darkness"" and they show a young girl weighing herself and making notes with a list of rules on her mirror like ""no carbs, no sugar, 1 hr exercise a day, etc."" and I was with my friend who has helped me recover for over a year but I relapsed. And when tears started flowing at that scene he just put him arm around me. Shrooms are really good for acceptance and peace with things. Acid is good for showing you reality and the path to a better life. Both are wonderful tools of insight :)",False,False
