If you do bring it up. Just say you'd love to have a pic posted of the two of you and were disappointed that you weren't in a single one.   If you have a shaky relationship just chalk it up to her being a bitch and it likely has nothing to do with your weight.,False,False

Yeah that,False,True

Just a minor thing to consider here: I was at a friends wedding last year and there weren't too many pictures of me but I also didnt strut out on the dance floor early (drank too much and had to hurl) and I didnt go out of my way to pose for pictures. Were you feeling insecure and not posing for as many pictures as you were uncomfortable? It could be that more people were just more camera hungry than you were.   I'm not saying that's definitely the case just a possibility.,False,False
