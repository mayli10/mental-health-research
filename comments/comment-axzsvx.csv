(I have been considered obese my whole life until this so I know that that factors into this whole thing and increases my fear of telling him). I’m scared in the back of my mind and thinking how embarrassing it would be to say: “Hey. I’ve lost 125 pounds and am scared to stop for some reason, I think this is an issue and it affects my everyday life.” And then have him look at me and say I’m not thin enough to have a problem like this.",False,True

If that is how it came across. ❤️ I absolutely think anyone can have a problem at any weight and deserve to get help but I just can’t apply the same logic to me. This is very personal to ask and you don’t have to respond but were you that same BMI when you were IP? Because I don’t know the rules on who gets accepted and who wouldn’t but I am curious to know if it’s based solely on BMI or if health concerns are taken into consideration as well.,False,True

I’m like there’s tons of people far worse than me, so I should just get over it. People around me have expressed concerns but it just doesn’t click.  But I will say this, I’ve been IP twice and PHP once at a few different weights the people there were a variety of weights and all struggled and got the help and attention of the staff. There’s this stigma that to have an ED you have to look severely emaciated. When in reality EDs and their health problems can manifest at a variety of BMIs. (TW numbers) like for example I became anemic and had bad blood pressure at a BMI of like 19-20.  You and your struggle is valid at whatever weight you are and you are worthy of helping yourself.
