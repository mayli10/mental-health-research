During the semi-starvation, one man infamously had cut off several of his fingers by accident, and afterwards another retained his obsession with food and became a chef. In the twelve week refeeding period and afterwords all men experienced the need and biological desire to eat over 4000 calories per day.   Conclusions from this study: Many features of EDs are symptoms of starvation which reinforce the ED; the body hates losing weight and also hates gaining weight; an inability to diet long term is not about will power but about the biological and psychological built in need to maintain a stable body weight.  My therapists like to bring it up to show: the calories they restricted to wasn’t that intense (compared to a lot people with restrictive EDs) but still Fucked Them Up(tm); overeating in refeeding and recovery is Normal(tm); eating nutritionally and often and enough will make the ED less powerful.",False,False
