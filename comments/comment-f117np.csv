Sometimes I don't list the foods, and sometimes I am able to say the approximate calories of the binge too. But mostly I can't. And that's ok. It's a start, a big first step. The shame is intense, and it needs time to overcome. You're allowed to start with small steps and work upwards. I think it's better to be a bit vague and explain to your therapist why you can't be detailed about it, rather than lie - they will understand! No step forwards is too small to be celebrated, and you're working on it and doing what you can and going to therapy and you should be really fucking proud of yourself.",False,False
