If you’re a healthy weight, you’re bulimic. Underweight? Suddenly anorexic. It’s so weird.",False,False

But I think it was probably that when they asked if I felt out of control or full while eating I said ""always"" and they figured it was binges because I'm so fat (not overweight, but not thin enough to have a legitimate restrictive ED anymore)",False,True

The diagnosis criteria for BED are very specific, it can only be diagnosed if the person has had uncontrollable binge-eating episodes at least once a week for three months straight without purging. The binges also have to happen from reasons other than real hunger, which is why people recovering from restrictive eating disorders can't be diagnosed with BED.  If you don't actively binge to the point of being uncomfortably full, BED as a diagnosis would be completely wrong. If you've recently relapsed with restricting with a past of anorexia but aren't yet underweight, a fitting diagnosis would be atypical anorexia.",False,False
