It's your eating disorder that's making you feel like you binged. You just ate something that in one way or another that made your eating disorder very very uncomfortable. Rather than letting you enjoy it, it's trying to convince you that your choice was wrong and gluttonous. Which it was NOT.   Do you have any hobbies you like partaking in? Music? Drawing? Reading? Maybe a nice casual walk around the block?   Talking to people you trust?   Sometimes the feelings of self hatred just get so much worse because we're isolating ourselves.   I hope I was able to be of help in some way. And I also hope the rest of your day goes smoothly, you DESERVE that Reese's mini cup.",False,False
