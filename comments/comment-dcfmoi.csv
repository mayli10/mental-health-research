That combined with feeling like I can't do anything unless I'm immediately perfect at it means I basically end up sitting doing nothing and letting my thoughts spiral until I have a panic attack or use ED behaviours. I'm trying to move away from this now though, letting myself watch TV shows I like or draw or try new things.

You took the words right out of my therapist’s mouth! I never buy myself clothes or nice things, even when I can afford it. I drive a shitty car with a dying transmission even though I have more than enough money saved for a car that’s more reliable. However, I’m more than willing to spoil the people I love with thoughtful gifts and a LOT of homemade desserts. I think it’s a self-worth problem.  My therapist gave the example of one of her other restrictive-type ED patients whom she described as having that “death smell,” like when you can tell that someone is horribly malnourished and their body is begging for help. She said that this patient spends at least the first 5 minutes of every session complaining about the cost of the gas needed to get there (it’s only a 20 minute drive for her—it’s 50 minutes for me), despite the fact that she has a substantial income and no money woes. My therapist said that it’s very common for her restrictive-type patients to restrict MANY things and to be incapable of seeing the bigger picture.",False,False
