I remember that‚Äôs what happened when I got found out by my parentals. And lots of ‚ÄúWhat could she possibly have to be depressed about?!‚Äù raging at me. What‚Äôs funny is now that I‚Äôm feeling emotionally validated by the person in my life I felt most invisible to, starving no longer feels like a mighty sword. It feels like brittle twig in my hands.

I didn‚Äôt say it because I always worry what people will think of such a feeling. It‚Äôs not to be skinner like skinny is of such greater value, but it‚Äôs that the more different you appear from the next person walking down the bread aisle the greater the rubbernecking effect, and perhaps greater the chance that you won‚Äôt have to keep being invisible to the people in your life you so desperately want to see you.

I couldn‚Äôt imagine how triggering it would feel to want your parents‚Äô understanding and be denied not because they don‚Äôt have it but because it‚Äôs reserved for someone else.

I‚Äôm a victim of childhood abuse. I was taught, ruthlessly, that I *had* to be invisible. It was my purpose: don‚Äôt make a fuss.   Starvation felt like a tiny rebellion against that purpose. Like I was telling my abusers: See how unhappy you‚Äôve made me, see how broken you‚Äôve left me.   Joke‚Äôs on me though, because when I was finally noticed for how ill I had become?

But when they were born, the already bad situation at home got worse. I wasn‚Äôt supposed to make a fuss, make a scene, be a kid anymore, because my sibling needed all the attention, all the sympathy, all the accommodation. I was punished, not for doing normal kid stuff, but for daring to be *visible*. It was my job to fade into the walls, to take care of myself, to *not make it all worse*.   So I starved. And starved.

My ed is almost a distraction from my life,  and gives it meaning. I'm of course mainly fueled by the desire to be thin, but I notice when life gets hard I really cling to it to keep me sane, like an old friend who helps me forget my troubles and gives me something else to focus on. It's taken on a life of it's own. And sometimes I think subconsciously I don't want to get to my goal weight because then what do I have to live for and work towards. So I think I self sabotage without even really realizing it. Late last year I was at the lowest weight of my adult life and what did I do, binged for several months and gained 15lbs. What a mess. Life is getting me down again so now I'm back to heavy restriction. I'm on this forum rn to distract myself from real life. My ed is almost like my safe space. Ok I'll shut up now.",False,False

I used to think there were specific, conscious reasons, and in a lot of ways, I really did and still do enjoy the 'benefits' of being this way, but I think those were just stories. The difference between me with an ED and me at any other time - eating less and losing weight - is the amount of weight I lost, and it's as though there's a specific amount that needs to be lost for it to trigger the obsession and neurotic habits.

I've spent the last few months wondering why I have these feelings, which is weird for me because I'm typically a really introspective person who can sort out my thoughts and feelings.

But that last half definitely struck a nerve with me.   I want to look sick.

I'm pretty anti-consumption with the rest of my life, I live very minimally, mostly zero waste, am vegetarian etc. I see the act of eating as very selfish, especially the way a standard American diet encourages consumption.

Now let‚Äôs get to ____lbs and chisel off just a little more of that face fat.‚Äù I love the feeling of washing my face and the pads of my fingertips rubbing bones, not cheeks. It makes me smile. Even now. Yeah, I guess we‚Äôre all sick, right?   And then there‚Äôs the other stuff that I don‚Äôt say. The ‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt ignore me anymore if I look very ill.
