He basically said she was following the protocol for recovery that's seem in ED literature, so I guess he kind of outed her?",False,False

What they don't see is me starving myself for the next 3 days while spending 16 hours in the gym in a fasted 48 hour period",False,False

She's known in part for her impressive cheat days and it would look pretty bad to her audience if she admitted she did have food issues directly to her viewers. At the same time her indirect approach leaves people to assume the worst of her intentions putting up those cheat days (eg. Exploting her ED for views). Poor girl can't win, and I think she's aware of that to an extent",False,False

And because of this I think there are a few ""honest"" youtubers who do these without very extreme behaviors (and accompanying extreme mindsets). In theory it is possible to have a massive cheat meals and then return to your maintenance without disordered mindset. Is it realistic for the average person to live this way? No. But its not inherently disordered to overeat and then eat less- if you eat more than usual one day, its normal to have very reduced appetite the next day. I know a few very thin, non disordered people and this is essentially how they maintain their weight after eating heavy/calorific meals.   I don't mean to defend these youtubers, personally I dislike the genre. But if people have decided to make their bodies/eating habits their income its not my business I guess.",False,False

I really wish she could be more transparent with why she's going all-in and the full effects of being stage-ready long term. I find that she dances around the subject a lot and she never really admits she has an issue with food. I understand that's her prerogative and I'm not saying she has/had an ED but with someone with such a huge audience (with a LOT of the comments from people recovering from an ED) I think she could have done a lot of good using her platform to start that discussion.,False,False

That means there mustâ€™ve been disordered eating before,False,False
