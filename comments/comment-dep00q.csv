If your scale isn't broken, it probably is mostly water weight. The weight will come off fast as long as you start eating semi-normally again. Fasting may help you lose the water weight but in my case I always end up binging and gaining even more weight in the end. I'm sorry if this sounds kind of preachy, but I really hope you don't end up hurting yourself.",False,False

I'm just going to be eating my feelings in the meantime until I get the mental strength to fast again later this week. Diet's already ruined today might as well just keep eating.",False,False

I feel like all the science has gone out the window and sickness is the real player here.,False,True

I went on vacation a long time ago and had just fruit for breakfast and maybe 300 calories for lunch and dinner total, walked up and down stairs every day to my hotel room, walked everywhere around the city, came back exactly the same weight. CICO is a load of bs if you ask me. It works for ""healthy"" people, not us.",False,False

Like usually I go on vacation eat like a fucking cow eating cake and chocolates and ice cream and gain maybe 6lbs so this just seems so disproportionately ridiculous. Like I ate breakfast every day and skipped lunch and dinner every day except 2 dinners and had one fucking gelato over the whole week. So realistically I had like 9 meals out of a potential 24 and gained practically 15 fucking lbs.   I actually wanna sob my heart out like I’ve undone 2 weeks of good work.,False,True

That's infuriating. I wish I could report your body to the police for injustice",False,False
