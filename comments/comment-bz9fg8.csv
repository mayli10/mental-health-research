People can at least acknowledge that heavy restriction is disordered behavior. Binge eating has yet to be accepted societally as disordered.   As someone who leans towards BED, but has also experienced bouts of heavy restriction until becoming underweight, it disturbs me that even in my own mind, I still view the restrictive periods as significantly more legitimate and deserving of more sympathy than my binging behavior. I don’t think people mean to make the judgment, but restriction simply draws more sympathy from people than binge eating.",False,False

Despite what people say, binging is still seen as an intrinsic lack of control by people with out EDd, and that it can just be overcome by...not doing it.

I think my problem is when the person suffering from binging tries to communicate that it’s a problem and is constantly dismissed—which I feel like happens to nearly every person who struggles with binging episodes.

I don't want to sound vain but I looked good and when I wasn't hiding in trash bags or in my baggy work uniform I would always get compliments on my style or those quick once overs. I know self worth isn't supposed to come from other people but dang did It feel good.  My partner supported me because at that time I was very health contentious and felts physically completely fine.    &amp;#x200B;  The fucked up thing is now I'm sitting at 115 and look fairly average but my eating habits are far unhealthier and my mental health is utter trash. but because I'm at a upper-normal weight and keep my emotional problems very private 99% of the time. Most people think I'm just doing swell or if they know about my ED that I'm in a happy place since i'm clearly """"""""""not struggling"""""""".   &amp;#x200B;   It's wild though because I used to be able to talk to my partner about fasting, how much exercise I did, protein and supplements, my anxieties around food or weight and she would listen completely fine and non judgmentally. It felt like she trusted me  and I didn't abuse it. Now? I can't even mention what I had for lunch at work without it becoming a huge issue. It's wild y'all I'll say something like ""Oh I wouldn't have had such a big lunch at work if I known we where going out for dinner "" or "" oh no I've got a stomach ache "" and she decides I'm upset when I'm just sitting there having a normal ass conversation. She doesn't believe me when I say I eat at work. Which I never lie about- I now send pictures most of the time. Its just so tiring.   &amp;#x200B;  The worst is she'll say ""you've lost weight"" you've gotten skinnier lately""  In most of these blow outs. When In reality My weight has been sitting at 115-120 for like 4 months or so? maybe longer. So it's not like shes actually paying attention to anything that's going on.  &amp;#x200B;  I'm sorry also love.
