I’ve been curious about this myself so I’m glad you posted.  I’ve been with my long term bf on and off for about 4 years now, and I’ll put it like this:  When we’re in our ‘off’ phases or arguing, it’s either hardcore binge or hardcore restrict. The times that we’ve broken up I’ve been at my lowest weight. I’m EDNOS so I basically cycle regardless, but when I’m really comfy I find myself more prone to binge, so I’m trying to work on weening myself out of that mindset. ",False,False
