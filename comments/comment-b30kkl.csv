I'm currently at 36, and I've been lower. He's loved me and been attracted to me regardless of my weight. ( Initially I was worried he was attracted to me because of my weight, but I found out he had dated girls skinny, average, and even bigger girls before me, so I don't think it was that) He is my best friend. You can find someone who loves you for you, who can be your best friend and partner, it is possible. Try to keep your heart open but guarded. I know it's hard, but if you are confident, you will attract friends and dates. I just want to note, I dated plenty of other guys before him too, so this it's not like he was a one in a million. Plenty of people will be able to see YOU, not just your body.",False,False

I cant stand being in my body but I'm sure as gell not acting like someone who so desperately wants to be thin. I've wasted so much time this last year trying not to purge instead of losing weight. I need to refocus. ,False,False
