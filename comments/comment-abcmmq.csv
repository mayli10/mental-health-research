(Well, aside from Christmas day...)  Thus far, I look the damn same. But I've been adding to my lifts again like it's newb gains all over again! I'm also mentally clearer, warmer, hornier, and in a better mood. Cardio is fun again. I'm sleeping better.   In addition, here are some long term benefits I'm looking forward to:   \-Having veins and abs all the time, not just when I'm super dry (will take some fat cutting too, ofc)  \-Not getting osteoporosis when I'm 40  \-Being more jacked = looking good even if some suboptimal fat gain happens by accident  \-Liking snowsports again  \-Getting to be more chill about food (higher weight and more muscle = higher TDEE before exercise...  plus, see above)  \-Having the body I've wanted since I was a kid ",False,False
