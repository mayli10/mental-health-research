It’s not a healthy behavior. I don’t think there are a lot of negative health consequences physically but you just feel like shit. It’s just not conducive to a happy life and for me it always led to purging or long periods of starving. It was always kind of a medium I did before going to another extreme. It’s also just not very sustainable.  This is just from my experience. I just think you should be aware that it’s still a serious matter even if there aren’t a ton of blatant health consequences. If you need to talk I’m here :),False,False

But the same thing should happen if you chew gum so idk,False,False
