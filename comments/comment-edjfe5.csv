Like Iâ€™m fucking 30 ðŸ˜‚ you would think that mentality would go away...nope.  I almost cried because my GPA was 3.96 after this quarter.  Logical brain is like bro.  Thatâ€™s great! But broken side of me is like see.  You canâ€™t even get a 4.0...  You are amazing and your GPA is great.  It doesnâ€™t define you.  All the hugs ðŸ–¤ðŸ–¤ðŸ–¤ you got this!,False,False
