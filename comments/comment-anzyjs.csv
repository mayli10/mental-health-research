No one to catch her throwing away food or walking through every aisle in the grocery store only to leave with nothing. Just montages of her opening her fridge 19734 times per day seeing nothing but water, zero cal powerade, and mustard while feeling simultaneously happy to have no temptation and yet still wishing a damn cake would appear.   No one to catch her getting dressed and freak about her body. Instead, she's alone and can be neurotic in peace while she decides to either cover every mirror in the house or do a body-check in anything that makes a reflection.  Then is shows her buying laxatives, enemas, makeup, shampoo, and midol at 11pm at Walmart. She scans the face of every person on the off-chance someone recognizes her. When she gets home, she takes benedryl and laxatives (she found the right combo after some bad experiences of almost shitting the bed) so that she can try to fall asleep without thinking.   She plugs in an audiobook so that she can focus on that and not cinnamon rolls or donuts. Oh, donuts. If she wakes up early Saturday morning, she can buy one. Maybe 3. Or 6. If she buys 6, the store-owner won't think they're all for her. 3 is too suspicious. Better make a fake list of donuts so it looks like you took requests. But then she decides to sleep until noon on her day off so that she donut store is closed by the time she wakes up.  Now that would be a boring-ass movie. No plot twists, no friends, no love interests, no one to notice the downward spiral or the fact you hit rock-bottom long ago and simply stay there. ",False,False

Such a tired, tired trope and doesn't even begin to touch most triggers. Especially the ones dealing with control, assault, not wanting to grow up, etc. Not everything is about the damn models...

But when I got to college I ended up bulimic so that’s neat too. I think my life can be divided into before I started purging and after tbh,False,False
