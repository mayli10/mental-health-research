Honestly it’s taken me 5 months to get myself to eat 3 meals per day, for a while I wasn’t eating anything all day then right before midnight I felt like I turned into this out-of-control monster and ate anything I could get my hands on while watching tv. Then I’d be up super late feeling sick and disgusted with myself and wake up feeling horrible the next day and rinse and repeat. And every time I’d actually start doing well if I messed up even a bit I’d think, “fuck it I already ate one bad thing, might as well binge 5000 calories!” Thats why I’ve been trying really hard not to restrict so I get more used to the idea that it’s normal not to eat perfectly.. I’m still not fully there yet but it’s helped quiet the horrible ED voice and given me a bit more control.",False,False

I'm like, ""No I can't eat all day, I ate too much yesterday"", then at night I'm like, ""yeah I can have a sleeve of oreos I haven't eaten all day!"" I'll have to make myself eat during the day then, but I get so into my head about it it's hard to even think about eating.",False,True

I have the same problem of restricting the day after a binge but it always bites me in the ass that night when I’m starving from barely eating all day and my brain tells me it’s okay to eat 20 candy bars because I barely ate all day :’(",False,False
