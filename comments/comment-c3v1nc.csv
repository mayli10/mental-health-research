Like in my mind, having kids was somewhere on that mile-long list of things I would do when I was better. Then I fell pregnant by accident and chose to keep the baby. My life changed in a million billion ways, some of it good and some of it kinda sad, but my relationship with my body was actually only improved by the whole experience. I couldn't hate my body anymore once it was housing a tiny baby. I just couldn't. My body was a vessel for something pure and innocent and I quite simply was not capable of hating it and mistreating it the way I did before. During pregnancy I loved and nourished my body every step of the way. Growing a baby really drove home the fact that bodies are not for decoration. The pure functionality of my body during that time amazed and awed me. After I had the baby, I struggled a little because belly pooch and baby weight lingered even months after. However, through breastfeeding and intuitive eating, within a year my weight was down to 15lbs LESS than I weighed when I fell pregnant! Oddly enough, breastfeeding and the level of activity required to raise a child has helped me lose much more weight than I was able to lose when I was making a concerted effort with diet and exercise. So I guess what I'm trying to say is that having a baby does not necessarily spell doom in terms of your ED or the size of your body. Also, having kids is by far the most meaningful and fulfilling thing I've ever done with my life, so please, if that's something you want, don't give up on it. Conquer your ED, get help, do what you need to do, but don't just give up on something so significant! And lastly, this is an area where youth works in your favor. For the most part, the younger you have babies, the more quickly and easily your body will bounce back. I wish you the best and I hope you can figure out what you truly want from life and achieve it.",False,False

Plain and simple.  Kids are *really* tough to raise and you have to love the idea of being a mother to plan on having one.    I got baby fever almost immediately after getting married at 25, started trying at 26 and couldn’t stay pregnant for years due to my ED.  It took seeing a specialist to find out major nutritional deficiencies that were likely causing miscarriages.  I know some people get pregnant in a second, but if you’ve had an ED for a long time you’re right that you’d probably have to address it to get pregnant.  Again, it has to be something you absolutely want to do.  Now that my kid is a toddler I’m 2 sizes bigger than before I get pregnant.  It doesn’t have to be like that though.  Acquaintances go to the YMCA and work out and they have a little daycare area where you can drop off your baby/kid up to 2 hours everyday.  Other people pop their kid in a jogging stroller and run.  Lucky people have enough money to have nannies or daycare money and just go to the gym or running when someone else watches their kids.    I live in an affluent town and most SAHMs here are super thin and pretty, always wearing athleisure clothing.  Stretch marks are totally dependent on genetics and I didn’t get any while pregnant, so there’s that. As long as you eat right (or very little) and exercise after having a baby, the body usually snaps back so it’s not much to worry about.  Worrying about your child for the rest of your life, and being the parent to someone who needs your full support and love literally forever—even when they’re adults and have their own kids, is something to consider if you don’t want children.",False,False

I’ve been dealing with an ED for a long time. I got pregnant at 18 (20 now.) Although my body is back to normal weight and people always say I don’t look like I had a baby, it crushed the small remaining confidence I had left. On top of my now-ex calling me fat, cheating on me several times, and physically abusing me for years, I’m a fucking mess lol. Add taking care of a child full time on top of that.   the moral of my story is DO NOT HAVE KIDS IF YOURE NOT 100% READY INSIDE OR OUT. I’ve never felt more awful about myself and I have stretch marks. My belly stretched to give birth to an 8 pound baby. I feel ruined. People aren’t very nice to single moms. Everyday gets worse it seems like. If you’re half as worried about your body as I am with mine, consider adoption. seriously. I couldn’t do it personally so it’s just me and my kid now and at times I have no idea what the fuck I’m doing. I feel worthless, how am I supposed to teach loving yourself to a tiny human?   I went off on a tangent there, and pregnancy for sure doesn’t necessarily “ruin” your body as everyone is different! but I’d be lying if I said I feel like I look like complete shit. healing from the things I was told and the image of myself in the mirror daily is enough to go in a depressive episode.
