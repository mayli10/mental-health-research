I went on vacation at the end of October and since then have gained 18 pounds. Tried to restrict starting the day after thanksgiving. I actually did a 48 hour fast starting thanksgiving night and ending on that Saturday. I told myself I had to get back to a new LW before Christmas. Fml. I lost six pounds this week and am looking forward to being on a  business trip this week so I can restrict alone.,False,False

Every year the holidays fuck me up and I give up for a while. I feel like every day is a battle, I'm clawing my way grimly through each day trying to keep on track. I'm very susceptible to the ""but it's the holidays, everyone indulges, it's ok, have fun"" though I know it's just an excuse. But every day I stop that impulse is a win in my book. I'm going to enjoy some treats but the *intent* is the important part for me (genuinely enjoying a once-a-year treat vs bingeing just because I can).  It's a battle for sure!",False,False

Yes, I actually started binging about mid October tho until about last week with a few fast/restriction days but essentially I gained about 24lbs going from uw to normal bmi. I freaked out (still am sometimes tbh) but have stopped binging, feeling so much better not waking up sick and full everyday and am down 14lbs so far, only 10 to go to get back to where I was! Seems like a lot but I know it will fall off quickly and Iâ€™ve almostttt made it a fun game with myself to at least get back to where I was before Xmas lol. Super annoying, felt like dying for a while but I managed to change my mindset slightly and honestly even after the first day of not binging I felt so refreshed, Iâ€™m constantly reminding myself how much better I will feel the next day. Just wanted to let you know youâ€™re not alone at all and I promise breaking the cycle will have you feeling so much better:)",False,False

The next day I couldnâ€™t stop eating. Then the next day... then yesterday Iâ€™m just finally staying around 1200 cals but still not enough to lose the water weight Iâ€™ve gained smh.
