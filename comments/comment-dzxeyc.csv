I want to not let eating and calories get int he way of fun with my friends. Thing is, my friend is also cooking me dinner beforehand. Again, I don't want to sacrifice things like this, I'm trying to keep a balance (lol, I know thats like a pipe dream).  I'm just really anxious about this because I've had such a good, controlled week with restricting after such a long, long time of my eating being all over the place. I feel empowered by finding my self control again but I want to have it all. I want to keep that feeling and still be able to indulge when it comes to my social life. I always tell other people that a day here and there doesn't make a difference but now I'm freaking out about it myself. I guess because it still all feels so precarious, like I'm only newly back in track, I haven't lost enough to allow myself this. I'm so conflicted. I just need to know that it'll be okay and it won't undo all of my good work.  Sorry, this ended up being much longer than I'd expected.",False,False
