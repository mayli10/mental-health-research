Never felt beautiful, always felt ugly and disgusting. That started it all.  I hold on to my ED for control. I have control to not gain weight, and I have control of my beauty by being thinner.

A way to numb or distract from autism related sensory issues? An attempt to blunt the intensity of depression, anxiety, and mood swings? A desire to feel more control over my life? A way to indulge self harm impulses? A general hatred of my flesh prison and a weird Case of the GendersTM?

Ever since I was a child my family would remind me of how big I was and how I was unhealthy (aka fat) so I began to workout and diet at age 11. It didn't get bad until I was 14 and I didn't even realize how sick I was until I turned 15 and realized I probably (not diagnosed cause I'm good at avoiding diagnosis) have an ED. For me it was always for some form of weight loss and subconsciously a form of control. I noticed that when things went bad I'd either eat little to nothing or start binging. Rn im doing it to lose weight quickly rather than doing it at a stable pace because why not??  -The women in my family also have suffered from some form of disordered eating, so perhaps this was a factor as well but I doubt it-",False,False
