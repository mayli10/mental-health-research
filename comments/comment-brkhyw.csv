I‚Äôm also the thinnest in my family, including extended, by quite a margin, so I was always told that I was ‚Äúso tiny‚Äù in an endearing way and people commented every time I ate so I just stopped eating because it ruined the image of me being ‚Äúpicky‚Äù.  I think the moment I really realized that my eating disorder was real and deep in my brain and not ‚Äújust a habit‚Äù was when I was at my post-puberty LW at like 16 years old, 5‚Äô5‚Äù at 90 lbs and like a 20.5 inch waist. I was getting measured for a dance uniform in my bra and underwear with all the other girls in my group standing there watching and the lady measuring me told me I had the tiniest waist measurement she‚Äôd ever seen in 20 years and that we‚Äôd need to order a new costume (we usually reused the same costumes year to year). I heard some girls whisper ‚Äúshe must be anorexic‚Äù and I felt proud? And validated?",False,False
