Try not to see this as a ""mistake"" or a ""lapse of judgement"", because that way of thinking treats the simple act of eating into something negative when it is inherently neutral.",False,False

I had an actual panic attack because I ate yogurt and frozen fruit after my dinner and that used to be a safe food. Guess it's not anymore... Shame,False,False

Guess I'll be fine in a few days yeah. Why tf do i have a near panic attack for enjoying a few krokets,False,True

U will still most likely have the shits, which will be cos you haven't been able to absorb it all. Also at the end of the day it's still only one slip up, it happens. If you eat however much you feel comfortable with for the next few days, you'll be fine. These things happen, the guilt and the anxiety fucking suck and although it feels like a massive deal right now , you'll feel calmer in two days after eating comfortable amounts.",False,False

So when u eat large amounts of unusual foods it's doesn't really know how to handle it and so kind of freaks out and pushes it through your system quicker, so you'll probably get diarrhoea. Basically you're digestive system is most likely bad at absorbing nutrients if you don't eat very much for a very long time. Learnt about this in biology at uni btw but haven't actually researched it particularly.",False,False

Especially when it's been so long since you've eaten normally. Your body probably needed it and will also struggle to digest it so your most likely going to poop out 80% of that. Don't worry you'll be fine. It's completely okay!!,False,False
