All the female characters look seriously underweight. When you combine that with the trends of time (all midriffs bare and plunging necklines to get a good look at them bones) you’re practically bombarded with thinspo every episode.,False,False

I’ve wondered about Nina’s eating before too. I’m sure as an actress she watches what she eats and works out but sometimes I wonder if she’s disordered too.   Watching Originals and Legacies isn’t much better. Haley and Josie are majorly triggering to me.   I just want to be tiny too.,False,False
