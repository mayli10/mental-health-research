I’d just like to add:  *Please* be careful lifting weights. Start with bodyweight exercises or some of the safer machines before you even attempt something like a barbell squat. It’s bad enough to feel weak or pass out while on a jog, but if you faint or your muscles give out with a 40 lb barbell above you, that’s a one way ticket to the hospital.",False,False

Today is the next best time, so go with that one.  Being in a caloric deficit puts you in a catabolic state where your body has to consume its own tissue to provide energy. Ideally, it will consume adipose tissues (fat). But if you're not eating protein, your body will also consume muscle tissue to provide essential amino acids.  So how much of this catabolized tissue is fat, and how much is muscle?  **That depends on whether you're lifting weights.**   Weight training is proven to preserve muscle mass despite a caloric/energy deficit. Your body knows that its muscles are being used, and it assumes that means that you need them.",False,False
