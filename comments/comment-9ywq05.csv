This part is the hardest. But you did it ! You made the choice to go, to let the appointment happen at least ; to take active steps to make it happen, at best. Either way, incredibly difficult, because of what you are doing and feeling right now. But Brave Warrior, this is a battle you will win.  Take a deep breath. Really. In slow ... one-two-three-four-five. Now hold it. one-two-three-four. Now release everything. Controlled, but deep. one-two-three-four-five-six-seven.  Whatever happens tomorrow, happens. And it will all be okay, and *I* know this for sure, even if you don't yet, because *you are clearly strong enough to be honest.* And that is all you need. If you start crying as soon as the door closes, that's okay. If you tell them you're not sure you're strong enough to do this, that's okay. Just tell them the truth, your truth. Whatever that is. This takes courage and I know you can do it.   No matter what, be gentle with yourself. On our old r/ProED community I think there was something on the sidebar ""You're never 'not sick enough' to get help."" You deserve help. And relief from 6 years of hurt. And peace. And gentleness. From yourself, and from others. I hope the person and people you talk to you are gentle. I hope you will be gentle with yourself until then. I know you will find some peace. Because I know you will just be honest. The hard part of the unknown is almost over. I am so proud of you. So so so proud. ðŸ’žðŸ’•ðŸ’žðŸ’•ðŸ’ž",False,False
