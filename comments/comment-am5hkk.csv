I got just a pathetically measley amount left until my goal weight and I've been durdling like an idiot. Now is the hour.

So that's gonna mean bulking to grow one, but I am terrified of bulking so ofc have to get below my safe weight so I can bulk back up to my safe weight and...  Like tbh I just wanna get my head enough in order to start lifting and eating enough to put on some muscle. I wanna quit the stupid mental cycle of ""when I'm thin enough"" before starting something I wanna do. So i guess like... recover? A little?   I also feel like bulking and cutting will allow me to channel my ED obsession into something not-horrible for me so yeah. Idk maybe not 110% healthy but it's a start. ",False,False
