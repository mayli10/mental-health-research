So when you start to lose weight, fat leaves the fat cells and is temporarily replaced by water. This makes the cells squishy. It's not necessarily full fat anymore, but fluid filled fat cells. So then, that beautiful ""woosh"" people talk about where you suddenly drop 2lbs overnight? That's your body realizing it doesn't need that water anymore and it lets it go. Then the fat cells shrink down and you start seeing results.  So yeah, it feels gross. But it means the process is working!",False,False
