I just weight myself and have apparently gained 5lbs since my work out earlier on so large chance that vindaloo actually had 1000000000000 calories in it. (Except yes I recognise this is going to be water weight bc I ate spicy food and have drank 3 litres since my workout),False,True

My folks just went out of town so I‚Äôm alone with my sister and Indian food was a compromise that basically was ‚Äúif you ignore the fact I‚Äôm in the garage for 3hrs stomping on a treadmill I‚Äôll eat and we can not talk about this‚Äù   I‚Äôm in love with stir fries atm. I‚Äôve been doing veggie stir fries with those low cal 0 carb noodles. Did that twice last week between 2 52 hour fasts.   I find weekends are just too damn hard? Like my working week is sweet bc I go unchecked for 12 hours a day but then the spotlights light up over the weekend. Couple the fact that my ‚Äòformal‚Äô weigh day is on a Monday even though I weigh myself 3-5 times a day so all the sins from my weekend of being forced to consume show up twice as bad and I‚Äôm ready to die,False,True

I do a 48 hour fast twice a week. Got totally fucked up this week though. Thursday, a friend was here and stayed for dinner. üôÑ Didn't want to have to explain why I wasn't eating. So I made a tofu and veggie stir fry for myself. High vol, low cal. Friday, had to do yard work. Can't do that if I've passed out. So I just did a regular restricted day. I'm over here like, fuck is it Monday yet so I can get back to my fasting? I feel huge and disgusting.",False,False

I'm expecting my limit will be exceeded by a fuckload. So tomorrow will end up being heavily restricted to make up for it.,False,False

I‚Äôd only allowed myself the take out with the bargain I had to work off 1200 calories first so it was just a shock that I couldn‚Äôt suddenly do the math after.   Yeah I figured to swap out 200 as well. I kind of wrote this while chain smoking cigarettes and panicking but I‚Äôve since sat down and just been idly talking to my cat since then and everything is much better.   Thank you for trying to help me! Good luck with dinner üñ§,False,True

I'd say 600s would be a safe estimation. Seeing as veggies lack the fat content that chicken would have. I'd say it'd bring the calories down considerably. I tried Googling, but not much comes up. Try not to worry too much. You're not going to suddenly gain 5lbs from just 800 calories. I know it's hard not knowing exactly how many calories you're consuming. I'm freaking out about having to go out to dinner in a couple hours.. but I promise it'll be okay.",False,False
