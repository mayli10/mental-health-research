It's a very real, very scary thing, and certainly something that you can die from. It's a well known problem commonly associated with repeated b/p. If something like this happens to you, please seek medical attention. The risk of catastrophic tears worsens each time. I know so much of this is not a choice, but please look out for yourself.",False,False

I’m in my early 20s now and I b/p at least once a day and have been for like 3 years now and I was anorexic for like 5 years before that. I’m so worried about my health and my teeth too but like nothing stops from doing it. I have no clue how to stop other than being around people constantly which I can’t do in my current situation. I spend half my day thinking I need to never eat again and the other half shoving my face so I can puke. I hate it :(,False,False

You have a really good writers voice i felt like i could hear you speak this even though we’ve never met.  But god. Do i feel this something like this happened to me last week! I had purged a ton of ramen i just kept making it and purging. And suddenly a ton of blood came up and i told myself to stop cause is overdid it. But i kept bleeding and coughing up blood it was like a mouth period. And got a horrible stomach ache and started shitting blood too and was terrified. I already have low blood pressure and a fucking up heart rate from getting to such a bad place my heart was damaged so i felt horrible and like i was going to faint. And my friend came over and took me to the hospital. Apparently i tore my esophagus and it bleed into my stomach and i really fucked up my whole digestive tract.   Purging will fuck up more than just your teeth enamel kids be careful.,False,False

I'm lucky I didn't die right in that boggy stand of trees.  I'm also *glad* I didn't die right in that boggy stand of trees.  At the time, though, I was thinking of suicide pretty regularly, so I have some compassion for younger me and how tired she was.",False,True
