I've got so good at long multiplication and division in my head over the past years all from counting exact calories. down to the 0.1 calories. it's so much about control and numbers for me by now and less about appearance although it's a big bother too.,False,False

I think my ED is rooted in OCD like behaviors, and the OCD issues can manifest in many other aspects of my life.

I'm studying chemistry and my favourite subject is analytical chemistry. So everything about finding out the calories, macronutrients and micronutrients profile of food is extremely satisfying to me. I get the biggest dopamine rush when I can calculate statistics about my intake. I actually believe that my orthorexia stems from the fact that I have lots of knowledge about food on a molecular level. When I eat I can't help but think about the chemical structure of the molecules that make up my food, and the processes that they will go through in my body during digestion. It's fucking wild.",False,False
