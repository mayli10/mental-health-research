Sounds like you did binge, but please don't beat yourself up (I know it's not that easy).   One of the main causes of binging is (ya guessed it) not enough calories throughout the day. The best thing I've found that helps after I binge is to write down all my feelings, avoid the scale for a few days, take a super chill walk that isn't too vigorous then send myself to sleep and start over tomorrow. You won't gain much, if any real fat from 2000 calories. It takes 3500 PLUS your maintenance calories to gain just one pound of fat. Any gain you do see will all be water, and it can be upsetting to see the number go up. But I PROMISE your progress will hardly even be impacted by just one binge.  If you need to vent my inbox is open, nobody here will judge you for having a bad day",False,False
