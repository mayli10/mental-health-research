When i'm fasting i swear i go open the fridge every 20 minutes just to stare longingly into it's delicious contents.,False,False

That‚Äôs a good term for summing up how I feel. I was definitely stuck with anorexic tendencies a couple months ago, but now I have a healthier mindset to losing weight by alternating between eating at maintenance and in a 400 calories deficit, long term in the next few months I want to make it down to 1800 calories. That‚Äôs probably not much for a lot of people but honestly, it is for me because I‚Äôm quite active. Anyways, lately I‚Äôve been eating at maintenance after eating in a 400 calorie deficit for 2 weeks and I felt disgusting, physically. It was hard scarfing down that much food because I felt like I was overeating by the end of the day. However, mentally it did feel satisfying not restricting myself. Weird trade-off idk.",False,False

The last time a medical professional asked me what I ate/my eating habits generally, I realized I'm so detached from what ""normal"" is that I struggled to even come up with a fake intake to seem normal. It's been over a decade of either super strict, regimented eating or completely out-of-control.",False,False

But I honestly just ate whatever I wanted, whenever I wanted. I ate when I was hungry or bored, and stopped when I was satisfied that I was full (not just physically but mentally too).   I had no concept of calories or calorie limits. I'd eat probably nearer to 2000-2500cals daily but weirdly my weight never went above 55kg. I'd say my weight was naturally stabilised at around 54kg despite just eating literally to my heart's content.  I miss those days of pure ignorance and unawareness.",False,False

The only way I could restrict was through... not buying food. Going to the grocery store daily and only buying what I would eat for the specific day. Next day, fasting till I went again. Not allowing myself any options to binge.  Sometimes my mad mind would let me run to the gas station at 2am though.  I‚Äòm recovering now, mainly through literally just buying more food, lol.
