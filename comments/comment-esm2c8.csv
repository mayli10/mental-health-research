I’m afraid to buy new clothes, afraid this won’t last, but it has to.  I’ve been into running for many years. Would average around 20 miles/week and it was a great stress reliever, great for my mental health. I no longer have the endurance to run. A concerned friend told me I need my runs, they’re so good for my mental clarity, to destress. I do miss them, I miss getting in “the zone,” but as I told my friend, if   be skinny all day every day than get a runner’s high a few hours every week. T’II poop hp",False,False

Nobody can tell me that being skinny doesn’t improve shit around you. It does. People are nicer to you. People don’t stare when you eat. Men treat you like a person (to an extent).
