Is there any way to get into it? Can someone invite me (is that a thing)?,False,False

Sometimes I'll just take a premade tuna salad in a can (mexican or mediterranean) and put it in a whole bowl of salad, it's quick and healthy.  My snack's are usually rice cakes with cottage cheese and turkey deli meat, quark or skyr with low calorie jam if I'm craving something sweet, sometimes I'll eat a protein bar or a shake.  So far I've seen great results, even when I was eating more calories than 1200, hope this helps :)",False,False

But my calories need to be under 1200... That's the goal, I read a study that said you should eat 1.6g of protein for every kg of bodyweight, there is no use eating more because your body won't use it for muscle recovery/building. And I don't want to lose muscle, only fat.",False,False

My go to breakfasts are oatmeal topped with fruit, yogurt, chia seeds, and nuts. Or two good vanilla yogurt topped with fruit, chia seeds, and granola. (I make my own. 10g whole grain quick oats + 10g sliced almonds. Toast in a dry pan then add in 1/2tsp sugar free maple)   Dinner is usually a protein and a bunch of veggies. I love tofu stir fry. That is a big go to for me.   Snacks hm I love quest bars. I bake them into cookies and I'll snack on a couple. Sliced apple with a little almond butter is good. Recently I've been making frozen yogurt which is basically just two good vanilla, what ever frozen fruit you want, some vanilla extract, some lemon juice, and a splash of water to help it blend. (I've posted this as well)   I keep pretty active on the subs, posting my creations. I try to be as healthy as i can within my limit.",False,False
