I do not want to look 'okay', I want to look skinny. I always wish there was less of me.  A reminder that my ED is a chronic disorder.    But I am thriving with an 'okay' body.  Or maybe not thriving, but I am living.  I have energy every day.  I can think clearly.  I'm not in that mild aching pain that comes from being malnourished/ underfed.  I am not scared I will faint or harm my organs due to my ED behavior.    And yet I struggle each day to prioritize my health over my aesthetic.  It's hard.",False,False
