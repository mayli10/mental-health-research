It seems to be a purely American thing for food to be so over the top that it becomes too much?? Even pre-ED, the food in the videos (that I now see becoming more common) on IG or YouTube just seemed so excessive and unnecessarily large that it became actually gross to look at, let alone consider eating.  I think America, as a country &amp; a (general) culture, really just loves the idea of excess. Excess food, excess cars, excess wealth, and so on. Itâ€™s less about the quality of what we have and more so about how much of it we can accumulate. We never seem to be satisfied with having enough.",False,False

I did mean France and surrounding countries haha.   I have never been to Poland and really want to go! If someone were visiting Poland for the first time, what would you recommend? Places to see, food to eat?",False,False

That said I live in Poland and when I stayed in France for a bit the store brand food was better than name brand available back home! So it's not always to the same great standard, sadly. But in the US it feels like the variance in quality is bigger and sadly due to the sheer scale of the various social and economic issues the US has, there is almost a need for extremely cheap low quality food that doesn't seem to exist in Europe as much. Sorry if this is babble btw I started dissociating halfway thru so I can't tell how much sense I'm making rn ðŸ˜¶",False,False

I love watching those videos but just from interest. Like ""what are they gonna do next!"" But I don't want to eat that, even on a binge.",False,False

Like, just the base ingredients, not cooking style. It always blows my mind. Like the cheapest kind of cheese from a regular grocery store is so yum.   Btw, I've always found it hilarious that Americans call processed cheese ""American cheese"".   Like don't you want to claim a better cheese? There are better cheeses invented and made in the US. But okay, claim that gross shit that's barely cheese I guess.",False,False

As if the logic behind it is the more tasty things you add to it at once the better it must be when, well, not really. Otoh I find things that I would consider rich not that common in the US? Maybe it's a stereotype but it seems to me you guys prefer  eg oil to butter which to me is a huge difference, or eg comparing ice cream it might be thickened with xanthan gum or flour instead of egg. It's funny to think about if somewhat off topic lol sorry",False,False
