Even then, the main focus shouldn’t be losing weight, it should be recovering mentally. Even if you’re in this situation but your main goal is simply to lose weight rather than actually recover from your disorder, then it’s still not possible. I think a focus on weight loss is ALWAYS going to be contradictory to real recovery.",False,False

Even if you just want to maintain your weight it can be a problem. Ideally you would simply want to stay within a healthy range without worrying if it's a high or low weight in that range.",False,False
