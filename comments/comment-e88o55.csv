So say your breakfast was a bowl of cereal and two pieces of toast, divide that into two or three ""meals"" (half a bowl and one toast x2, or half a bowl x2 and two toast x1). Rather than trying to eat it all in one go, you give your body chance to adjust to the incoming food, but can also still meet your calorie requirements.  I do suggest talking to your treatment team about how physically difficult it is and let them know your fears. I would advise against changing what you eat before speaking with them. No food is inherintly bad, your body won't breakdown from a few unhealthier snacks. Try to stick to your meal plan as best as you can.",False,False
