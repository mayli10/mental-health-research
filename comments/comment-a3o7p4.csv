So damn more-ish.  &amp;#x200B;  It's not weird to write that letter.  I had to write a letter to anorexia in therapy and some other letters I found a bit odd to abstract things.

Why do they have to be so good? I even love the unsalted kind.   Maybe writing a letter to them will be cathartic. If it helps you stop eating them, there's no reason not to write them a letter.
