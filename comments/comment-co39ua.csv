'real' potatoes are lower) are calorific as hell and mostly simple carbs and really not all that filling. they just don't make me panic as much. same for cheap top ramen and saltines and vegetarian fake chicken. not really low cal at all but my brain says they're not as scary as some others so it's ok :"""")",False,False
