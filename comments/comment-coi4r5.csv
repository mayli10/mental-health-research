Sometimes the school would have special meals for a day though like pasta or whatever. They sold wraps too but the wraps were kinda huge. I wasn't in residence for long after my ED started so it wasn't a big deal.,False,False

I believe a smaller potato has around 150 cals. Add some S+P and a side salad and you got a decent meal!,False,False

You give solid advice solid to my own experiences. I love routine so it would work for me; my biggest struggle was trying to increase my protein intake without stressing about how the protein was cooked (oils are my enemy). Whole foods helped me eat more without as much guilt.,False,False

Iâ€™d buy cans of beans for protein, and used lemon wedges for salad dressing. I compared my hand to sizes and would guesstimate portions using my palm, thumb, or fist. I always loaded my plate with breads that were easy to transport and would tell everyone that I was taking up to my dorm for later.. then would put it in my mini fridge and toss it out the next day. I also had a water bottle and would fill it with soda water from the dispenser constantly. Good luck!",False,False
