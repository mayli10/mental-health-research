He offered to make me breakfast this morning and I wouldn’t let him bc I knew he was going to cook it in a ton of butter &amp; would refuse to cook me just egg whites.   He even made a comment that I never let him cook for me &amp; I told him it’s bc he won’t make it the way I want &amp; he said I was being ridiculous. If I can control what I’m eating, I’m going to. I knew I was baking today.. I didn’t need his unhealthy ass breakfast on top of it when I don’t even eat breakfast during the week when he’s at work. I made myself 2 egg whites just to look like I was eating something",False,False
