Honestly I don’t think the majority of people care, but if you’re self conscious about something you may be projecting those thoughts. I am super guilty of doing this all the time.   We are all our own worst critics. Please stay safe and eat ❤️",False,False

And I know it's mentally harmful because I go through cycles of 'it's not an eating disorder, it's just disordered eating that I'm in control of' and ignore the fact that I cut-off all socialization, eat in my room, keep track of my roommates so I can purge when they're all out, etcetc  I hate it so much. I just want to buy into body acceptance, but existing in public can be so exhausting sometimes that I inevitably just put my life on hold for the 'one day when I'm skinny'",False,False

As a person who is in the exact same situation, I wanna say: I’m so proud of you. Making good, healthy choices day after day is fucking hard. Screw what people think, we are fighting for something far greater than their acceptance.",False,False
