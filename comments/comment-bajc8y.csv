Yes, yes, and yes. I used to and still often get curious about the weights of my favorite k-pop idols. Sometimes the managing companies share this - albeit usually fabricated - information. Fans speculate and build up profiles about them. I think the fans are usually wrong, but that doesn't stop me from feeling fat when their speculative weight is as low as mine while the idol is larger than me. ",False,False

I'm a 30F and my boobs are definitely really big, but another girl at work said she recently got sized properly to a 30F as well but her boobs physically appear way smaller than mine - she's four inches taller than me and proportioned differently though, so even though her boobs are smaller than mine and less 'voluminous' she wears the same bra size as me.   I know you said you are the same height as Rachel Bloom but there could be other things going on with the way her breasts are proportioned that means her boobs are bigger than yours despite having the same bra size (if her bra size is even correct and properly fitted). The other weight stuff - well, it's hard to tell with celebrities, honestly the ones I've seen in real life look heaps different to how they appear in photos.",False,False

I mean if (HYPOTHETICALLY. you don't need to do it if you don't want to) you sent me a photo of yourself and I looked at it and looked at a photo of Rachel Bloom I'm betting that I'd think there's a bigger difference between you and her than I would predict from the weights.,False,False

Something like 90% of women are walking around in the wrong size. A cup or DD cup, it means nothing without context. Anyone looking at me would guess I'm an A cup because my boobs are small but actually I'm a C/D because my ribcage is narrow. People see a pair of boobs with cleavage and immediately jump to DD but the reality is so much more nuanced. The only way to truly compare boob size is if you know exact bust and under bust measurements. Some people know the right way to measure and fit their bust but the vast majority are simply ignorant. Anyone shopping at VS is being lied to. Always take self-reported bra sizes with a grain of salt!",False,False
