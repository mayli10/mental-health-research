I recently (like a month and a half ago) had a terrible nosebleed unrelated to purging. I’ve never told a doctor about it bc I honestly just hate going to the doctor and haven’t had a physical in about 7 years.   I’ve never been concerned and never able to notice a difference from seasonal allergies, having the heat turned on, or my nose rings colliding. I usually only blow out blood after a purge if my nose had already done so that day.",False,False
