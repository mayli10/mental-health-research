Then picking a size 8, only for the bottom to cover your feet.    Then giving up and realizing even vanity sizing makes you happier than a message that inadvertently frustrates people.  One size really doesn't fit all.  And what if the one sized fits all is too small for you?  Then you wouldn't be happy and you'd be out of options because it was one size.",False,False
