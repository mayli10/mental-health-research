NOTE: there is a difference between *disordered eating* and an *eating disorder*. At this point, it sounds more like you have the first one rather than the second. However, getting help for it NOW will not only help you to stop emotionally eating and help you lose weight, it can also prevent it from becoming a full-on disorder.   I would HIGHLY recommend talking to an adult you trust (a parent, a teacher, a tutor, etc.) about how you're emotionally eating and gaining weight. Trust me, kid, you do not want this to get any worse. Opening up is hands-down the BEST way to prevent it from getting any worse.",False,False
