I'm extremely picky so I will just outright refuse food if I don't like it and that tends to get me yelled at, but I also don't give a damn.",False,True

It's just weird. I don't actively think about calories if my parents put a plate in front of me. I'll eat it.   Now that I'm living alone again.. oh boy.. without IOP and my therapist, I wouldn't bother with eating. ",False,False

Even if I know that we'll be getting something high calorie, I prefer to know. It helps me plan (before I could plan how much I restricted, now I'm in recovery and watched too closely, it helps me plan a mindset that will help me not breakdown) and just makes me much more comfortable.   Actually getting a big whiteboard so I can have the whole day written out! I'm more excited for it than I was for Christmas lmao. ",False,False
