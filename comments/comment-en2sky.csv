I almost immediately gained like 30 pounds in less than six months (I had been a healthy weight it was a seriously noticeable difference). I’ve since lost the weight again thank fucking god.  I realized later that on a subconscious level I was doing it as self sabotage. I was scared of the exact same thing you were. I was so sure that eventually I’d get fat and he’d leave that I wanted to just get it over with as little sense as that makes.  He didn’t leave me though. We fucked less, but he didn’t leave me.  Not every guy will leave you if you gain weight.",False,False

My bf has told me time and time again as I recover that he’s here for me, not my body. I’ll always be attractive to him because I’m me. That’s how it ought to be and boys who care about your weight need to fix their own shit.",False,False

My boyfriend admitted to me early last year that he wasn’t quite as attracted to me as he used to be - I gained quite a bit of weight, and have not lost any until the last week or so.   It was truly crushing, and while I love him, something about hearing that really broke part of me.   Unfortunately, that is the risk taken when entering any relationship. People do change, and sometimes the other person may lose some attraction as a result. That’s totally fair and okay, but you should never be made to feel less than nor humiliated if that is the case.   The chance of being hurt is worth the risk if you find somebody who deserves you, and will treat you with dignity and respect regardless of how you look. We’re all going to age and relationships based solely on physics attraction rarely workout in the long run (in my opinion).",False,False
