Luckily some of the food - ceviche etc isn’t too guilty feeling. And I’ll break any fast any time for sangria. Half the part of travel culture is the food so make sure to atleast try things even if you only eat some! I did like 20k+ steps a day atleast and managed to not gain. Have SO MUCH FUN!!!,False,False
