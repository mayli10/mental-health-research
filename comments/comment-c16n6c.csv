Yesterday was my designated “eat whatever you want day” and I was getting full, instead of that voice saying “you have to finish it all” I just said “nah, I had enough” and threw it away.   Little wins like that really help me",False,False

It barely happens to me but when it does, I’m grateful. I never want to let go.  Please take care and be well. We can get through this together💗",False,False
