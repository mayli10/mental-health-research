I used to (who am I kidding, I did it an hour ago) do the exact same thing.  I'm trying structured meal times but only drinking a low cal protein shake, I also add fruit to it (meal replacement). I just need some normalcy with nutrition. Im so jealous of people who don't freak out about eating.  I feel so ashamed when I do it, that leads to more stress and BOOM I'm sitting in the car with **a whole chocolate cake chewing it and spitting into a bag.**   **If you're like me, you're worried to death about weight gain**. Being more active and focussing on strength and vitality has helped me gain back some control.   That and lookswise /feeling wise,  nutritious and regular intakes ensures you'll **LOOK** healthier. There are threads and ig pages dedicated to showing the same person, at the same weight, but looking v v different.   Your body deserves to be **NOURISHED.** Your mind deserves to be **NOURISHED.** Food impacts mood. Nutrition isn't anything to be scared of (easier to say than live am I right).  &amp;#x200B;  I think getting to the root of the problem will help a lot. Which for me is control and self worth.  Maybe start a tracker, see if you can go a whole day without doing it. Focus on nutrition etc. I wish I could say it works but I don't know yet. I'm still trying to shake the habit. Good luck",False,False
