I'm convinced I can't win at my current weight. I know it's not a weight competition but I hate the idea of all those people watching me and thinking about how chubby I am... Especially since I'm 30 lbs heavier than the last time I completed (when I was anorexic).,False,False

Like people are going to die if my grades aren't good and the world will end if my vegetables aren't eaten in the right order.,False,False

I don't think they're intrusive, I can control them and I like having them around. I am in control of these thoughts, but I also believe they are true. I still can't wrap my head around the fact that I'm not responsible for things such as my exam results (outside of studying).  Sorry, but is there a term for extreme perfectionism? eg if my oats aren't perfect I'm going to throw them across the room",False,True

(And EDs and OCD are common comorbidities.)  The feelings of being responsible for things one can't actually be responsible for I've seen termed 'magical thinking'. A more general term for the thoughts you don't really want to have continually popping in and circling is 'intrusive thoughts'. Maybe gives some google search terms to start from? The good news is more and more is being learned about what's happening in the brain with OCD symptoms and about what treatment approaches are most effective.,False,False
