It is hypothesized that this genetic feature was adapted to give hunter/gatherer tribes a ""sacrifice"" who would essentially be unbothered by famines and continue to work hard while others rested and saved energy. This addiction is usually triggered the first time one experiences a caloric deficit, IE usually why EDs occur in one's teen years when you first try to diet. However, if you are born at a low weight as a baby, it can leave that addiction switch on for you later in life. This is also why recovered anorexics who loose weight due to illness or other causes can be prone to relapses no matter how long they've been recovered.",False,False
