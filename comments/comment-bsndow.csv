I recently moved back home with my family and I can't be seen using a food scale or measuring cups because my parents will be like ðŸ‘€. So instead of the cheaper big tubs of Greek yoghurt I have to buy the more expensive individual cups, and instead of the big bags of Skinny Pop I have to buy the single-serve packs (which don't even taste as good).",False,False

The cheap/mainstream diet stuff is never vegan, and the low cal vegan stuff is WICKED expensive. There are lots of cheaper alternatives here to Halo Top, for example, but none of them are dairy free. And I got so excited when I found a new vegan ready-meal lasagne that was under 300kcal for the entire packet, but then I remembered it's seven freakin dollars so I'm still never going to get it lol.  At least instant coffee is cheap, right...",False,False

They got rid of that and have $2 large fries instead, and the small fries are now more than $2. I feel ridiculous paying more for fewer fries, and if I try and ask for them the clerks push really hard for me to get the bigger size and I totally understand why, because from their perspective it seems like a no-brainer, but I don't want the bigger fries. Which ends up with me just not getting any fries. Which I guess I should count as a bonus, but not when I'm in the middle of a downward spiral and just want some freakin fries, lmao.",False,False
