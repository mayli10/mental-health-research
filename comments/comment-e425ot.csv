My mom had disordered tendencies all through my childhood. “I’m 110 lbs. mommy is getting fat.” &amp; that scares me as a mother. I never want my daughter to suffer.,False,True

She never made food a big deal.  If we weren't hungry, we didn't have to eat much.  If we were hungry, healthy snacks were offered.  We ate healthy, but the occasional snack was not associated with guilt.  She discouraged dieting, never commented on body size, and genuinely did an impressive job not letting us know/ see her disordered thoughts.  She recognized my ed/ disordered thoughts before I think anyone else would have and was able to help/ make sure I didn't get worse than I did.    I truly think I was just genetically prone to an ed and if anything my dad made it worse/ passed his thoughts about food onto me more than she did lol",False,False

The one day she asked me “what are you having for lunch mommy?” is when I broke and decided to recover. For real this time.,False,False
f96ij81,t3_e425ot,t3_e425ot,fragmentsofmyself,1,2019-11-30 14:27:01,/r/EDAnonymous/comments/e425ot/restrictingmotherhood/f96ij81/,"Yes!  My son is 3!  I make sure to split my calories for the day between lunch and supper because eating together as a family is really important to me.  I definitely wish I could OMAD again but my son having a healthy relationship with food is something that is always on my mind.  I do worry about my morning routine of “mommy has coffee and reads the news” but he’s usually distracted eating his breakfast and watching some cartoons, the rest of our meals we eat at the kitchen table.  Throughout the day he offers me some of his snacks and I try to make a point of accepting sometimes and just explaining that I’m not hungry at the moment other times.  BUT I am also worried about my common use of the kitchen scale which my son clearly sees because he loves to help me prep and cook.  I do all the cooking in our family and make most of our meals from scratch.  Everything I make has its own recipe weighed and saved into myfitnesspal because I am a crazy person, but I guess the upside is that a lot of the food I make is safe because I know all the ingredients and exact nutritional info so I am able to eat the same meals as my family just in smaller quantities.  I feel such an intense guilt about this whole eating disorder and motherhood thing but apparently not enough to change anything :(  Ugh",False,False

They have a clue that I’m not doing super well at the moment but they have no concept of how poorly. Hiding the struggle, while struggling- is so much more exhausting honestly.",False,False
