But it works. The beauty of CBT is that you can test it out on your lowest priority issues and see that it works. That’s what’s given me the confidence to work on resisting anxiety responses for more distressing triggers. So maybe that approach might help you test the waters of CBT?  I hope you figure out what’s right for you, all the best!",False,False

Rationally I think I know CBT works, therapy works, and that it isn’t easy, but I think I’m just now realizing how hard this is gonna be to fix, and how flippin stubborn my distortions are. I’ve always been terrible at following through with things that don’t come naturally, so this is going to be a big challenge.   Thank you for taking some time to talk to me about this, your responses have been really thorough, thoughtful and kind. You’ve given me a lot to think about and I seriously appreciate it. ❤️ ",False,True

But you could easily run into the same problem over and over so it’s worth thinking more about what you want out of therapy and what getting to the root of the problem looks like for you.  I do think part of why my therapist respects my boundaries about the ED stuff is because I have enough Other Shit to work on. I do CBT and a lot of exposure and response prevention activities that ramp up my anxiety so she gets that I’m prioritizing. Upon reflection I’m not certain she’d be as understanding if I just wanted to talk about why I do the anxiety-driven things I do (which would be my interpretation of getting to the root of my problems) rather than committing to behavioral changes to improve my response to problems.  I say this, not to suggest that getting to the root of the problem isn’t a good goal, but just to suggest that it might not be the right goal to match for all therapists depending on what it means to you.  Sorry if that didn’t make sense. All I really know is that if therapy wasn’t hard as shit, we probably wouldn’t need it anymore.",False,False

I think you’re right - I need to set some boundaries with it, because I would like to focus on other areas for treatment right now. I think I’m just getting frustrated because it seems like she keeps making all of our sessions revolve around my disordered eating, and I personally feel like I want to focus on where the root of my garbage feelings are coming from. Maybe they are linked intrinsically, but I’d like to try and avoid dealing with the eating issues directly at this point, you know?   If she’s not down, I’ll switch. I’m lucky to have that as an easy option. ",False,True

Or consider switching to a new therapist if that’s an option?  I also see my therapist for Other Shit, but she respects my boundaries when I say I don’t want to talk about stuff like my disordered diet and body dysmorphia. She’s made it clear that she’s rather me say ‘I don’t want to talk about it’ than lie to cover up a problem. And I get that. They’re trying to help so it’s good for them to know they might be missing part of the picture in that area while also giving space.",False,False
