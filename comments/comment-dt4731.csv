Genetics really could be screwing you over.   For stomach/chest, you may find that replacing the fast with muscle may help the overall look and tone of the area. You could start doing low intensity lifting, where the motion is relaxed and the focus is on full extension. You could then shift to a higher intensity of strength training when you feel comfortable with your form. I would suggest eating something light about 45 mins prior to the workout and within at least 20 mins after; high protein and drink lotsa water.   The only bad part? Replacing muscle w fat doesn't make the scale move. It may actually go up before you get the woosh down.   I'm sure more ppl can chime in on a plan for your body. The good thing is that with the addition of your mental health care team, working out should get a little more rewarding and allow for you to take setbacks easier.",False,False
