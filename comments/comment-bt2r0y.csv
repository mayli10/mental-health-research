I also smoked a lot, which also made me hungry and, of course, thirsty. Lol it was a horrible cycle. My solution was quitting all that cold turkey. I just got tired of it all. I wanted sanity and sobriety. I know this is a hard thing to do, but I got results after I went sober and started actually upping my calories while only really doing strength exercises. Cardio works out nothing more than your cardiovascular system. Strength training will physically slim you. I dropped so much weight eating protein, low carb, and 1500kcal a day. I'm also 4'11"". It wasn't as quick as when my ED was at it's worst, but it was actually much more permanent and I felt better. I was over my ED for a while, then recently I relapsed with a more aggressive binge-purge ED. I'm trying to go back to the method I mentioned because it worked. Sometimes increasing your calories actually makes you lose more weight even if you're already in a normal range.",False,False
