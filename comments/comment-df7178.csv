It sounds like you experienced lots of bumps in the road. I’m sorry for you feeling this way, hug! Second, please seek help with a therapist or counselor. You deserve a healthy life that you enjoy to the fullest with your kids!! I’m not here to judge, since I’m in your boat, but seeing a therapist does help! Again thanks for sharing, lots of love!",False,False
