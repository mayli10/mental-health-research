I wish I had that kind of will power.  I usually end up throwing things in a public trash just so I don't eat them. Hang in there. You are not pathetic.,False,False

The first part of fixing a problem in life is recognising the problem and it‚Äôs patterns, so you are already on the right track.  I‚Äôm proud of you because it‚Äôs the gradual little changes that help stop. You didn‚Äôt develop an ed overnight, so while it won‚Äôt go away overnight, you can undo the negative thought patterns with time and self love.

That felt like a little victory at least since those last few months I was more into wallowing in my own misery after binging!!   And thank you for the support!

I know they're addictive and sadly I feel the same as you do. Impossible to stop when I start. But I was kind of proud when I resisted. I think I'm too hard on myself (the all or nothing mentality) which caused me to binge afterwards. ""If I can't resist a few chocolates then might as well eat everything.""

But I thought about how it made me feel afterward and tried to find out what caused the overeating. For me, such foods are comforting and delicious and trigger insatiability, we are literally made to seek out these items, it's reasonable to happen with increased availability!  I don't know what the solution is as I'm obviously dealing with similar shit, but you aren't alone. You could always throw them away in a moment of sanity or give them to someone else, if you feel the alternative is consuming something that will make you feel horrible. Good job for not eating them for an hour at least, it's a PRACTICE, so every little bit contributes to success. You did do something right, maybe just not in the amount you expect from yourself...so frame it as a mini success and build off of it. :)",False,False
