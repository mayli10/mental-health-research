Mine have stayed a consistent D ever since puberty, no matter how many weight fluctuations I‚Äôve been through. The smallest I‚Äôve ever gotten is a 34D, and the biggest a 40D. I think I flirted with a DD size at one point, but I‚Äôm not sure.  It‚Äôs not that big but as a short person who doesn‚Äôt like boobs on themselves anyway, they feel enormous to me. I‚Äôm so envious of people who lose weight and go down to a B or A cup. My chest has been so fucking triggering to me ever since I got it. I feel like it‚Äôs one of the main reasons my body dysmorphia is so bad; I can‚Äôt see beyond the two giant bags of fat on my chest.",False,False

I certainly didn't have this small of a waist at this weight as a teen.  They definitely worsen my dysmorphia as a huge part of my ED was fear of going through puberty and not being able to control the changes and also desexualizing myself after being sexually abused and raped. Sexual attention has never been my goal but I am an hourglass with cartoonish fucking proportions.  I wish I was just flat, everywhere. Like a board.  ETA: I am a little perturbed at the people saying they are jealous. This obviously is a sensitive issue to OP and causing distress, let's not minimize her suffering.",False,False
