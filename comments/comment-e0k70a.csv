I work as a tech at a Alzheimer dementia center and one of my ladies whenever I’m helping to feed her or doing an activity with her will usually comment on how “she sure has pretty/beautiful hands.” (referring to me) . Side note while changing her sometimes she yells at me that I have an ass face among other insults😭,False,False
