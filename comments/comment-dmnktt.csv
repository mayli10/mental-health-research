I was also in denial when I was forced inpatient as a minor. I was convinced that there was nothing wrong with me and the doctors were all wrong.  It was sort of a different reason for me, though. I think it was the stigma of mental illness. I was worried about being considered crazy and a freak so I didn't want any mental problems. I thought that since I considered myself ""mentally sane""—I never tried to actively commit suicide before, nor did I self-harm—there was nothing wrong with my mental state.  Of course, this is wrong. You can be passively suicidal and not actively suicidal. Also people with mental illnesses can still ""feel sane"".",False,False

The OT that leads it said something like; It’s takes a lot to get to this point, if you didn’t have an eating disorder you wouldn’t be here, and that does happen, sometimes people are sent to a different program after assessment, but you’re here which means you have an eating disorder, no matter how invalid you feel",False,False
