When I was in middle school I would be just fine going a day or 2 without eating, and more recently I would be fine with only eating around dinnertime, but now I have to eat atleast something at the begining of the day and every few hours afterwards or I start to feel like I'm about to keel over. And if I'm sleep deprived I become a horrible little bingeing goblin.",False,False

In middle school and high school I used to be able to go all day without eating, even with after school activities and sports and I was just fine. Now in college I can barely make it through the day if I don't have at least SOMETHING to eat. It's so unfair",False,False

In college (I live in the states) I'd wake up at 5:30 am, go to the gym, study so long all day with maybe a meal in my stomach and a lot of coffee, then basically go to parties 6 pm to 2 am, sleep and repeat.

So your body just shrugs it off and allows you to fast or strictly restrict without intervening with extreme hunger or nagging food thoughts.  But after restricting has been going on for months or years, your body has gotten used to constant famines and starts fighting back whenever a new one happens. A very smart survival mechanism in nature, an annoyance in our modern word.",False,False

I have read _a lot_ of the literature published on EDs (just 11 years of IntJ.ED backissues left!) and it's common that people develop AN-R in their teens, get down to very low weights, and then see their behaviour shift as the years go on and start B/P'ing or maintain at a slightly higher weight.  I have no physiology / human development worth talking about, but could some M2 chime in about how puberty might contribute here? Is it just more energy from the chemical shitstorm happening? Neurological development?",False,False

I used to wait as long as I could to begin eating for the day which was usually at least after 1:00. I pack food to take to campus for a lunch/dinner but lately Iâ€™ve been eating it all by 12:00 and then being miserable.   I can manage if I donâ€™t pack anything at all and end up having a lower intake for the day but then my ability to focus is in the gutter because Iâ€™m starving. Thereâ€™s no winning ,False,False
