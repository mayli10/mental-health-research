I’m too shy to give them resources, I guess I’m scared of them?   I could say that it’s not that disordered but my mom does have binge days? Like an “Oscar party” where she just eats and eats? I’ve heard my dad vomiting but i can’t assume that he has issues. She does diet sometimes but she gained 2 pounds this week and she always goes back to eating and eating and eating. So she can sometimes control herself but no really disordered relationship with food.   I’m bingeing now, I barely purge but will go back it’s so awful like she was defending my bingeing by saying i was hungry? Like no normal person eats that muccccch so she really doesn’t get it.  I also do know and I use baking soda but that ain’t gonna do anything, probably.  I can’t quit it’s all i have, i have no personality, almost all my friends are gone, I barely get by but purging is the only thing I’ve used to and the only thing i want to do. It’s hard to have withdraw with support? Like if someone took away your drugs and just said to quit because it’s bad for you? ",False,True

Your feelings and emotions are just as worthy as anyone else's.  &amp;#x200B;  Your parents sound like they have their own eating issues going on. That doesn't make things easier, but I wonder if letting them know what's up would help. I don't know how long you've been using behaviors, but (as I'm sure you know) purging IS really bad for you. I'm 22 and have been bulimic for eight years. I'm not going to list the physical consequences of bulimia, but know that they're very real.  &amp;#x200B;  I hope that your first friend can help you feel seen. It sounds like your parents don't have the knowledge to help you now, but I wonder if they'd be willing to read up on it? People who chronically overeat/undereat but don't have a disordered relationship with food often don't understand the mentality behind it.",False,False

It’s like they’re taking me to b/p to bingeing which is just as bad.  My mom is medically obese with a bmi of 34, eats a lot of food but i don’t think she has BED.  My dad used to be super morbidly obese (6”4 440 pounds), overweight now.  My friends know so 2 people i can reach out to.  One I’ll call Room, she is kinda narcissistic and can be really problematic but is quiet and a good friend. Room kinda is the most understanding saying that eating too much is a problem but also said this girl is a “twig” who to my knowledge has AN which is kinda yucky.  She has limited understanding but I’ll definitely talk to her if and when i go to school.  My other who I’ll call “Egg” is super innocent but pretends I don’t. A direct quote from Egg is that she doesn’t want me to die which is understandable but it’s not like you can ignore it and it’ll go away. I also don’t have the balls to tell my parents actually what i want and what I interpreted from it.  So online is the best way, i have created an account to the Canadian site listed so at least there’s that.  Thanks for the concern, im sorry about the novel i am about to send i just need to get it off my chest. ",False,True

It sounds like your parents really care about you, but don’t know how to help. My dad used to encourage me to eat all the time even when I was b/p’ing, because he just saw the purging and thought that meant I wasn’t getting food/nutrition. (Obviously, the food pushing made things worse!)  Do you have any friends you can reach out to? Just having ONE person in your life who knows can be really freeing. You might have to do some explaining, but you will likely feel a lot better. ",False,False
