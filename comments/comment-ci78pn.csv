I still have binges, but they've been getting smaller; I still get really anxious about food, but I've been incorporating more fear foods into my diet in moderation. progress is slow and relapses are inevitable but I already feel more like me again and it's so so worth it. some days I don't even hate my body as much as I expect to.    sorry this was kind of long and messy, just know I'm sending all the good vibes. I hope you can begin to find your way out, too ❤️",False,False

It's so disheartening to see them apprehensive around me or be hurt by my tone. I wish I had a solution for you. The more I take care of myself and am kind to myself, the more the anger dissipates, but I know that being kind to yourself can be difficult with an ED. I think that if they are showing they care about you then they understand, at least to an extent, that your anger is a manifestation of your struggling.",False,False
