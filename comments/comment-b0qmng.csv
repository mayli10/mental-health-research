It does come up if you purge soon and hard enough. I think my gums are eroding a bit so I'm determined to stop. Please be safe, purging has too many consequences for it to be crutch.",False,False

It all just depends on how effective of a purger you are. I've had purges where I've lost weight and others where I could barely get anything out and ended up gaining several pounds. 0/10 do not recommend. Purging is so awful",False,False

If not I would be 400 pounds over weight lol. This isn’t me recommending purging AT ALL though it fucks you up in a lot of different ways!!!!",False,False
