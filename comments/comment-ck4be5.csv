To me I feel euphoric and accomplished, and that can sometimes feel like strength and happiness. But it's actually more like you're rewarding yourself for something that isn't really an accomplishment, rather destruction. But your brain makes it seem as if you have just done something amazing and you get that rush of feelings, almost like a high.  But that's just me though. I relate to what you're describing though. When my life has fallen apart completely, I depend wholly on my ED to make me feel better.",False,False

I’ve had several plastic surgery procedures and while I’m happy with my alterations, they don’t give me a sense of pride, because they’re fake... and sure, there’s lipo, but you can’t really buy a thin physique. When I feel thin enough, I do take pride that my body is a testament to my discipline.",False,False
