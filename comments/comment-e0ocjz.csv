""oh leave some of those cookies for \[our brother\] later"" or ""did you eat already?"". id sometimes also make her eat things because i get this weird sense of satisfaction and accomplishment when others around me eat when i dont. our mum likes to compare us and sometimes, though rarely, calls my sister big and gluttonous.  last time we talked about eating she threatened to ""hospitalize me"" because i ""looked like a child with a body like that"" (i wasnt underweight, i never was) even though she couldnt do that as im already 18. either way, the fact that she was so aware of my behaviour was really distressing and made me fall into a binge cycle i yet have to come out of.  ive been steadily gaining weight and shes since shut her mouth about me eating.",False,False
