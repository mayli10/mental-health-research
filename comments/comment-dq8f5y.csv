If you go for a walk or a run you can tell yourself you did your best to prepare. But really the walk or run should be about soothing your mind not purging calories, and that’s why I think a relaxing bath could help too.   You have a lovely date for all of us on this sub! I truly hope it goes well! It’s okay if you eat on it, view it as a one time treat if your brain allows that. Sometimes it helps me to remind myself that even if I went over by say, 1,000 calories, I am only one day further from my goal. Just one little day :) good luck!",False,False
