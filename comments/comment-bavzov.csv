(Not sure about your exact reason for having to do this, so I don’t want to assume anything.)  But when it came to drinking liquid calories, I decided I’d rather have it in “normal” food form. My gastroparesis still gets to me, but if I’m going to consume the calories, I’d rather do it on my own terms.",False,False

The other day I binged but I ended up calculating everything and it was still under 1400 calories which would be a healthy deficit for me to lose weight at. Eating “normally” is now a binge for me.,False,False

I just ordered a Jimmy John's regular sub and it's 600 calories and I wanted to have a cookie so that's another 370 and to be 970 is way too much for my one meal of the day,False,True
