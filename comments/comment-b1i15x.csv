I remember purging in first grade at school for the first time and maybe even before that in kindergarten so I wouldn't have to go to school. Its been an interesting life. Switching between restricting and purging. ,False,False

My grandfather was babysitting while my mum was out of the country, and I **really** didn't want to go to school, for various reasons.  I knew that if I just said, ""I'm sick,"" he'd call bullshit, so I chowed down on Life Cereal until I was already a bit nauseous from fullness, then went into the bathroom determined to make myself barf so I could stay home.    It took around 15 minutes of gagging noises and false starts, and I didn't end up puking up that much of what I'd eaten, but I did manage to barf convincingly enough to stay home from school.

I always had crazy body issues since I was young. I had this thought ‘I can eat my pastina and then make myself throw up and I won’t be fat!’ So I made myself throw up all of my food and was very pleased with myself. Big surprise, I got hungry because my stomach was empty and realized the flaws in my logic. I must have been around 10.   Uhg, now I’m sad. ",False,False

I attempted to purge then as well, but I wasn't able to until about 14, maybe. I honestly think it has something to do with exposure to purging.
