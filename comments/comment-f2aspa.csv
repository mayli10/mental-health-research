This time it’s dark chocolate covered strawberries! It’s nice, cause then I can indulge a little and usually not be as freaked out anddddd people don’t harass me about not wanting to eat what they think I should usually cause they think I just really wanted that thing instead. If you want to eat normally or have a cheat day you totally should! One day doesn’t hurt.",False,False
