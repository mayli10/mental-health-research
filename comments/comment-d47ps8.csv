I definitely do feel better that this has happened to others too. The feeling went away for me as well a little after I drank the coke. Although I still have no idea what it was exactly Iâ€™m thinking low sugar? But idk Iâ€™m just self diagnosing at this point lmao Either way, I think Iâ€™m just not going to drink alcohol while restricting anymore just to be safe.  I really hope that never happens to you again friend, thanks for sharing and please stay safe ðŸ’•ðŸ’•",False,True

I was restricting for a few days before, woke up one day sweating bullets, could barely walk or think, and it felt hard to breathe. Nobody was home, and I was sure I was dying. Needless to say, I was scared shitless (keep in mind this never happened to me before). I don't know why my first instinct was to stumble downstairs and have some leftover pizza my family had the night before, but I did. When I ate it left as suddenly as it came. I wasn't drinking before it happened, though, and it's never happened again, so I have no idea what it was or why it happened. Sorry for being of no help in terms of an explanation, but I hope it's brought you some amount of comfort to know that it's not just you.",False,False
