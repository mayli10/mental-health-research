When I vape constantly I don’t get hunger cues at all and most of my food cravings go away. Obviously nicotine is bad for you blah blah blah but it’s the only thing that’s seemed to keep me from overeating. If i’m vaping I don’t have interest in food and basically forget I need to eat. Keep in mind that’s if I’m doing it constantly all day.",False,False

It's all about the special k now. Lol but seriously, smoking tobacco was actually introduced to women as an appetite suppressant, which is why you'll see old adverts of slender women with slender cigarettes. Usually she will be portrayed as successful, happy, beautiful, mysterious, independent, etc on said advert. I'm not exaggerating, either. It will literally say these things in words. I think I even remember ones saying, ""I maintain/keep my figure with [brand] slim cigarettes.""",False,False

I started and at first, it really worked as an apetite suppressant, but after i got addicted, it slowly became a stimulant. Now when I fasted last time, i also quit smoking and did over 100h fast.

Nicotine is an appetite suppressant.   I would really not recommend taking it up as a habit. Like I said, it can be impossible to convince your ED brain to stop once you've started, as quitting starts looking like a ticket to weight gain. If you must engage in it, at least vape instead of smoking cigarettes. Or consider parking Nicorette. Anything but actual smoking!",False,False
