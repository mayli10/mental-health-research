I have absolutely hated them my whole life. Now that I’ve lost weight again they look the same (probably worse) but my body overall looks better.

They were still big for my body though and honestly because they’ve always been so saggy I didn’t feel like I had anything to lose   At my HW of gaining 70lbs from my LW, they were just huge lol but still saggy and awful   I have 60lbs to lose, I’m hoping that by August I can lose 50lbs and save up enough money to get a breast lift. I’ve found the surgeon I want to go to and the money side is definitely possible, it’s actually a lot more affordable than I thought (I would be going to Prague for it). The weight will be really difficult because my abuser was arrested recently and I have no idea when the actual trial will be, it could be 6 months to who even knows how long, and the uncertainty triggers my bingeing like nothing else.
