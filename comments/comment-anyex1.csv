For weekly outpatient it wasn't prohibited but discouraged and I got the impression they would kick you out if they decided it was ED fueled and you refused to change.,False,False

You're encouraged to see if the reason you have those restrictions is because of your ED and if it is then you're encouraged to tackle it just so that fear and anxiety leave before you see if that's an ideology you actually believe in,False,False

It terrified me. She said if there was a glass of milk in front of me I’d have to drink it. If cheese was in something I’d have to eat it. And I haven’t been able to drink a glass of milk since I was 5 without throwing it up so?????? Idk. The lady was really mean about it too, and my doctor and counselor said that it wasn’t appropriate of them either. Agh. Short rant there sorry. Long story short this one place didn’t let you.

My treatment centers also allowed for us to have three dislikes (specific veggies or dishes) and we could sub them for something else. If you are allergic to anything they also made accommodations depending on the severity. (One girl I went to treatment with still had to red meat even tho she would have a minor allergic reaction.) I know that not all facilities are as accommodating but I wouldn’t let that be the reason you don’t seek out help!!!",False,False
