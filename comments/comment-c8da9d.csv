Finally I can relate to someone. I just see myself as fatter and fatter everyday and my brother and friend said I look *anorexic* now.. like I’m super bony or whatever. PSHH. I can barely look at myself in a full body mirror without being triggered to hell. When I’m waking up to a door that’s glass I stare at the ground to avoid my reflection. Ugh. Why can’t we see what everyone else does? I don’t understand.,False,False

Talked myself into thinking my clothes were tight on me. Turns out I lost more than double that I thought I’d gained. It was all in my head. I feel like I can’t trust my judgement anymore. Which terrifies me personally.,False,False
