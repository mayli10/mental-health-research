Just to be certain what letter does ur friendâ€™s name start with haha? I binged yesterday and the only thing he had all day was a small hotdog.

I just recently told my best friend about my ED and heâ€™s been listening to my asinine rants for like 2 weeks now and making sure Iâ€™m okay and that he understands my issues. BUT heâ€™s also trying to gain weight (heâ€™s underweight and is around my ideal BMI) and has been asking me for advice. Problem is is that he refuses to eat anything other than a tiny dinner each day. He was actually texting me for motivation to not eat for another hour cause he had a hunger headache but didnâ€™t want to eat yet. And he was telling me this as I was eating my fourth slice of pizzaðŸ™ƒ Ever since I told him Iâ€™ve been binging even worse than before and I feel like im bad at this disorder and I was lying when I told him (even though I know thatâ€™s not how any of this works). God it just sucks that Iâ€™m the one with the disorder and I canâ€™t even beat some otherwise healthy person,False,False
