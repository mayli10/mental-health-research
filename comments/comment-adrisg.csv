I'm not even underweight but I'm cold all the time. I freak out over the calories in half a potato but then go binge an entire pack of cookies??? Nothing glamourous about it.,False,False

I don't find it at all surprising that people see EDs (or really just anorexia) as the most glamorous and romantic way to be broken.",False,False

It just baffles me how ANYONE could admire this cycle ,False,True

I've seen more than one person wishing they ""could be anorexic for a little while"" so they could lose weight. They don't understand that it's not about willpower (if you want to *recover*, however, then you need a fuckton of willpower), and how it's not really about being skinny after all. At least not ""attractive"" skinny. Like these people see a photo of a naturally thin/fit person and imagine that's how they'd look like with anorexia. Yeah, they can dream.",False,False

My mum even said to me “I wish I had your willpower because I’d be thin then”. People don’t realise it’s nothing to do with willpower it’s about being in control. If it was about willpower I wouldn’t binge lmao ,False,False

I remember as a teen reading gossip girl and thinking Blaire Waldorf was so glamorous with her ED (bulimia), and I can honestly say reading those books may have had something to do with me trying to throw up the first time.   I know there were a lot of factors at play, but a small teeny part of me may have been thinking, “Blaire does it. Why not try it?”",False,False
