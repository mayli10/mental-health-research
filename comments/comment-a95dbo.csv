Don’t brush right away. And you can ask your dentist for special toothpaste that helps protect your enamel more than the regular stuff.  Be honest with your doctor about your ED. If they’re any good they’ll know what to look for. I’ve had a couple of complete morons along the way, but for the most part my doctors have known what to be on the lookout for (at least the ones who knew about the ED). They should give you more comprehensive blood tests but I couldn’t tell you everything they should be checking for. I just know that my lab results were way more detailed from the doctors who knew about it than they are from the doctors who don’t.  If you’ve lost your period you can request a bone density scan (I’m sure you can still request it if you haven’t, I was just always told that it’s not much of a concern if you’re still getting your period). If you’re having heart issues (palpitations, low heart rate, etc) you can request an EKG. I’m sure there are other tests but that’s all I can think of off the top of my head.",False,False
