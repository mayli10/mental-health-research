Exercise pretty much almost makes you lose weight, but people feel more secure in knowing/thinking you‚Äôre doing it to improve your body‚Äôs fitness. Don‚Äôt mention weight loss, mention muscle gain. If you lose weight, let them know that it‚Äôs part of getting in shape and toning your body.  I don‚Äôt encourage ED behaviour at all, I‚Äôm simple aware of how it works. It‚Äôs not your choice, and things won‚Äôt get better just because someone told you so, or just because other people ‚Äúcare.‚Äù The more they push, the more you pull away. That‚Äôs just how it happens.  I try to encourage approaching things in the ‚Äúhealthiest‚Äù way possible. No one chooses this disease. Would you tell someone with cancer that they should have done more about, that all they need to do is eat healthy and they‚Äôll be ok? No. However, you can do as much as possible to help yourself.  Also, it‚Äôs disgusting how people want to criticize you no matter what. Gained weight? You‚Äôre bad! Lost weight? You‚Äôre bad! You‚Äôll learn to brush these things aside, because, as emo as it sounds, other people do NOT know you or what you‚Äôre going through.  As regards those specific food options, I understand. It‚Äôs not really feasible to order the salad or the soup on the menu, because it will always ring alarm bells for people, even when not justified. You‚Äôll start getting better at ‚Äúsmart‚Äù ordering though, as you become more knowledgeable about the nutritional content of food. For instance, you‚Äôll know that two slices of bread actually has more cals than a burger bun (perhaps you already know that). Thing is, not everyone is aware that things that look smaller are often not necessarily ‚Äúbetter.‚Äù For instance, a tortilla has more cals than sliced bread. It‚Äôs dense, and therefore getting a wrap can end up more calorific than something seemingly low in calories. Similarly, a salad with dressing can often be more than even a sandwich.  Don‚Äôt beat yourself up about not eating something that ‚Äúseems unhealthy‚Äù or high in calories. Often this is not the case, and you just have to be smart about how and what you order.  You‚Äôre not getting ‚Äúenough‚Äù calories and fat as it stands. Well, let‚Äôs start working on something else then! Let‚Äôs work on the intake of healthy, nutritional, and vitamin-rich foods. Then we can move from there. =)",False,False

For a while I was only eating at places with published calorie amounts. But apparently that‚Äôs not realistic for most people because you don‚Äôt only want to eat at chains all the time. So now when I go out to a real restaurant I have a small serving because of the ambiguity in the calorie amount. ,False,False

I know they don‚Äôt put sauce or oil on their gyro though, it‚Äôs just a pita, seitan, and veggies so I‚Äôll get that next time.  i definitely made it clear the oil and mayo made me uncomfy and I couldn‚Äôt shut up about it (ugh, thanks ed brain) and I can definitely tell that worried her /: she‚Äôs been getting on me to gain weight since I‚Äôm technically underweight now but I honestly don‚Äôt think i need to even for health reasons. Yesterday she came into my room about to cry asking if I was ‚Äúscared to gain weight again ‚Äú (I had an eating disorder in 7th-8th grade that she took me to therapy for. I relapsed junior year of high school and am now a senior about to move out for college in 6 months!)   She‚Äôs especially worried since the doctor at my appointment a few days ago would not SHUT UP about my weight loss. I lost 5 lbs since last appointment but that was like 8-9 months ago so it‚Äôs really not much at all. I had a different doctor for that one and she was more focused on the fact that last time she saw me (like 15 months ago!) i was 12 lbs heavier. it‚Äôs suuper slow weight loss, it‚Äôs just that I ‚Äúdidn‚Äôt have weight to lose‚Äù because I was 102 lbs at first and now 90.2. now my mom gives me those concerned puppy eyes all the time and it‚Äôs hell ): ",False,True

I have a small vegan business by my home as well. When I eat there, I round up on MFP heavily. Their burgers and sandwiches are so good, but they also have an assortment of bowls, so I find that to be the easiest to OMAD for a day and not feel quite so terrible. Guessing how much quinoa and tofu are in my bowl still cause me a great deal of stress, but nowhere near trying to guess how hefty housemade sauces and dressings really are. üò•",False,False
