If you try to recover by yourself you could end up with refeeding syndrome. If you dont recover you're just going to get worse and your organs will fail.  It's ok to stop school for a while. School wont be an option if you get worse and have heart/lung/liver issues anyways.  Just take care of yourself and get help &lt;3,False,False
