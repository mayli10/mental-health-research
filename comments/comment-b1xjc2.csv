I mostly refer to the thoughts as *her* because *she* is an extension of me). I would fucking DIE if my husband started doing this... but I'm really glad it's working for you and I'm really glad he is able to help you separate. &lt;3,False,False

But I think that OP (and others who anthropomorphize their disorders) find it a helpful strategy to identify and disarm all of the intrusive and illogical thoughts. It's not about deflecting responsibly. It's about recognizing which thoughts are not serving you and having a system for discarding those thoughts.,False,False
