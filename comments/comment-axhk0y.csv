You're still here, you're still breathing. It's okay to focus on small goals-- if you can make it through the next five minutes, you're five minutes closer to making it through to the end of the day.   I know you're feeling awful right now and I'm so sorry. This disorder is dangerous and awful and it can really feel like it's actively killing us every single moment. But you're still here, and you'll be alright. Everyone can last for only one day. Whatever else you have to deal with right now, it can wait until you've survived this one day. For now survival is enough. As long as you're still breathing, you've won.   Just take things five minutes at a time. Every five minutes you're still here is a victory and a blessing. There are people out there that care about you and love you, including on this sub, and you deserve every five minutes you make it through. It'll be alright. You're still here. Everything else can be dealt with in due course, but for now you're here and that's enough.   Are you physically safe right now? That should be your priority; everything else can wait and be dealt with in due course. But your safety is what matters first and foremost.  I need to go for a jog, but feel free to DM me if you need to talk &lt;3 We're here for you ",False,False
