Like oh I had 4 beers time to order a large pizza and eat it all and take shots while waiting for it! And oops, accidentally got “too drunk” to keep anything down even though to drunk me eating it was heaven and it didn’t matter whether or not it stayed in my body ",False,False

I say that as someone who used to casually binge and purge regularly, but not enough for a full bulimia diagnosis I think.  I feel like I didn't get sucked in because I just really don't like purging. it's exhausting and i feel so embarrassed about the popped blood vessels in my face. I basically just transitioned to binging/restricting instead. Definitely had to learn to be okay with gaining (and re-losing...) weight in order to do that though.",False,False

I'm not very sure how accurate the statistics are, but if it's true, my guess is by not having all the mental components that can lead to EDs, like addictive/depressive tendencies, perfectionism and so on, like the way some people don't get a full on major depression after a life crisis.
