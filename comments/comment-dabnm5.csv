I feel like most people with an ED think they're ""different"" yk? ""I'll stop when I get to my gw. I'm different"" ""I'm not gonna get hospitalized I'm different"" ""I won't die from my ED I'm different."" ""I can get through school with an ED I'm different."" And we all think the bad things will never happen to us until life bitchslaps us and then the bad things DO happen. Love, no matter how invincible your ED makes you feel, you are not. I'm sure you're a tough one, but our bodies can only handle so much. Your mind and your body are NOT running on 100% if you aren't allowing yourself to eat properly. God forbid, but if it ever gets to a point where you DO need treatment, please go. School will always be there for you; you can always try again, but you've only got one shot at life. Remember, you're only different until you're not.  Be safe, hon.",False,False
