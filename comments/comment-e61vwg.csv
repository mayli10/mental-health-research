If you‚Äôre in school and have a dorm room I would suggest studying out of the room or specifically at your desk so that your bed can still be a safe and comfy haven for you that‚Äôs for sleep and sleep only.) I also do not have a TV in my room and my BF plays his PlayStation in the living room so that our bedroom can be completely dark at night (blue light from screens wakes us up!). I set my phone up so that night/dark mode comes on around 7pm and turns off in the morning while I‚Äôm already at work. That way I have a sepia color on my screen and the dark background with light text so I can minimize how much exposure to blue light I have rig before bed. Scientifically speaking we shouldn‚Äôt use screens for 30mins to an hour before sleeping but I suck at that so this is the next best thing. My routine is usually something like this:  -get into pjs when BF comes home from work (I shower earlier in the day after I get home from work but on weekends I take a shower right before I get into pjs to help relax me- I even take showers in the dark/dim light with meditation music on in the background. If you‚Äôve never tried th is DO IT it feels so special and nice.)  -smoke with BF when he comes home  -eat dinner between 7pm and 8pm  -watch tv with BF during dinner and up until 9:30 (I also smoke during this time) - we keep the lights in the kitchen and living room dimmed down and we light candles so th  at the room can feel cozy  -at 9:30 I pee and brush my teeth and then I go into my (already dark) bedroom and get into bed. I‚Äôll scroll on my phone for like 10 mins but then I usually go right to sleep.   I structure my bedtime around eating and going to bed bc i use pot to help me to have an appetite and also to make me sleepy but just keeping my bedtime routine the same has helped me to get better at winding my mind down and getting me to feel safe and okay to sleep.   I honestly view sleep as a reward/something that is SO precious because I know how deeply I am affected by not getting enough of it (everyone is different but my particular brand of anxiety is so much worse when I don‚Äôt get enough sleep) - I want you to be able to enjoy your sleeping time because you deserve to rest and relax!   I would think about the kinds of things that make you feel at peace or at the very least things that lessen your anxiety - once you can pinpoint t what makes you feel safe, you can work at building a routine around those things. Pamper yourself and take it slow (it may not work right away or work perfectly but it should help) and remember that you‚Äôre an awesome human who deserves all the good things.   And tomorrow is coming one way or the other so you may as well enjoy your sleep in the meantime.   PM me if you want any more info or if you‚Äôd like to know how I deal with work anxiety because I know that‚Äôs a whole other thing. ‚ù§Ô∏è I hope this helps!",False,False
