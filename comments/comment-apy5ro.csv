Whenever I forget to take my Lexapro for one day, I usually binge that day because all of my depressing ED thoughts flood my mind and I end up binging. My body image doesn't seem to get any better though, and definitely not by ED habits :/",False,False

I lost my appetite at first (what remained of it anyway) and then it got back to normal after about a month (on 10mg).  I recently stopped taking it because it wasn't really doing anything to help with my anxiety / sleep levels (what I went to the dr to fix) &amp; was actually causing more issues in my life.,False,False
