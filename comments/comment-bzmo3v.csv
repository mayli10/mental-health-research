I have several months spans where I B/P then several months where I don’t, but I feel like otherwise I’m usually watching what I put in my body. There have been times where I didn’t even do that I binged and didn’t purge... I’ve had a little bit of it all over the years. My GI tract is effed up.",False,True

I also started taking betaine hcl tablets before meals to raise stomach acid concentration and digestive enzymes (found them both on amazon) which has been awesome and I find that I dont get super bloated after everything I eat with them.",False,False

Aside from meds, eating multiple small easy to digest meals (low fiber, low fat, cooked veg, that sort of thing) will help. Are you seeing a dietician or have a treatment team?
