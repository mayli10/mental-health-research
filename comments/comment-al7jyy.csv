It felt like there *wasn't* a horrible, ugly lump of fat on my stomach, as I feared. It just felt like it was housing my little friend. It was the only time in my post-12-yo life where i *loved* my stomach, even if it looked distended and swollen.  Having a dietician make you a meal plan and sticking to it religiously might help.",False,False

I know my boyfriend wants a child in the future (waaaay into the future) what if I can't because my mental health is so fucked up I'm afraid of eating? I'm pathetic TBH. ,False,False

I absolutely felt out of control of my own body. I didnâ€™t enjoy most of my pregnancy. Breastfeeding was the same.   I love my daughter so so much. Iâ€™m so happy I have her. She was 100% planned-for and wanted. We have so much fun together and being a mom is everything I thought it could be plus so much more.   But sheâ€™ll be my only child. I have to take care of myself too. So Iâ€™m one-and-done. I read somewhere that kids love their pets more than their siblings, so when she starts asking for a baby sibling Iâ€™ll get her a puppy and call it good.   When it comes to having children, itâ€™s either 100% yes or 100% no. ",False,False

Maybe not the first or second reason but even if those reasons didnâ€™t exist I could not stand the thought of putting on weight like that, especially because I know Iâ€™d have to eat more than my regular burn to keep the baby healthy, plus, I couldnâ€™t calculate the exact extra weight necessary for the baby and make sure I didnâ€™t go over it.",False,False
