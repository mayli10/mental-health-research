Several allergies. Months ago her diet got restricted to just 1 cereal, carrots, broccoli and mushrooms. She lost so much weight. She is sick, she was not feeling well and her health was deteriorating fast, yet here is me being jealous about it.",False,False

All the girls in the office would go to the gym together before work, spend a couple hours at the treadmill desk, or walk laps around the building instead of eating lunch.  One of them kept turning down free food, saying ""no, I have to lose that weight"" -- meanwhile, she was underweight and the tiniest of everyone there.   When we'd go out to lunch (before I ""got the memo"" and before my relapse), I'd be the only one ordering ""real food"" while the rest just had lightweight salads.     Yes, it definitely triggered me back into my ED.  But the only thing that made me feel a tiny bit better was knowing that their behaviors were not incredibly healthy or normal, and that they just had the same body dysmorphia and societal expectations as the rest of us going through the same shit.",False,False

For friends talking too much about weight loss, I just told them or avoided them if they weren't someone I could tell (in which case, not that good of a friend anyway).   Friends who were bigger getting smaller than me is harder though. That's not really a behaviour or someone can change to accomodate you. The best strategy I have is to really work on not comparing, and reminding myself  size/weight is not the only thing.   It's good you're recognizing it, but it really does suck.",False,False
