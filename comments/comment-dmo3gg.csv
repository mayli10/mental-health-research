Purging, as you probably well know, is not safe behavior for your health. I have a condition which causes involuntary vomiting, I’ve had it for a few years now and I’ve lost three teeth (two of them were molars), and I have at least 70% paralysis of my esophagus. You don’t necessarily see the consequences until it’s sometimes too late to reverse them. I also struggle with fear of many foods and even though I physically cannot binge as I only have 5% of a functional stomach left, often the stress does set off a bout of involuntary vomiting, so I am definitely not minimizing what you’re going through - it’s horrible. There’s no overnight fix, but maybe they’ll help you identify some issues so that potentially you do end up purging less. You should not have to go through this alone.",False,False

I love socializing around food. It’s fantastic. I just hate the calories I guess? Idk it seems contradictory when I have a blast with my friends eating a regular meal, then I go throw up in the bathroom and head back",False,True

That’s the only thing that has worked for me.",False,False
