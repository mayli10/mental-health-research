I always end up waiting til late at night to eat bc I know that once I start it is HARD to stop but if it’s late I’ll be more careful bc I have to go to sleep. Like I can plan small low cal snacks for throughout my day and it doesn’t work I end up eating them all at once 😩 thank God for coffee. Sorry hunger signals I’ll fix y’all someday.,False,True

It’s crazy how 2 years ago I was one of those people (persons?? I can’t grammar). Now I eat to the point of being unbearably full bc that’s the only way I’ll feel “satisfied” and if I eat a normal amount, I’m thinking about what to eat next.   Ugh, if I had a job I’d be drinking a Bang for breakfast, skip lunch, and eat a shitty low cal dinner. I hate this",False,False

It is SO strange. As much as we don’t want them to, our bodies really do need the extra cals during our time of the month. If anything we should try to let this be the one time when we “let“ ourselves have what we want - at least we can blame our periods instead of ya know, our normal human need for food lmao. (I hope my morbid humor is okay). ❤️",False,True
