It's so rough, I'm sorry you're dealing with that  I rarely eat in front of anyone. I definitely can't eat in front of my parents, specifically my mom, because she constantly comments on my food/size/etc, like at least a comment or two a day. Which really blows because I'm temporarily between apartments and staying at home.",False,False

I hate any kind of gatherings because I can't make myself eat in front of people (except a select few) and I have to make up excuses why I only ate a single breadstick.  Also I almost entirely stopped eating together with my family and I have my meals in my room behind closed doors.,False,False
