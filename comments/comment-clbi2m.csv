Like a few days of low restricting and my stomach gets flat and I start feeling hot, then I weigh and measure and I'm barely different so I just assume what I'm seeing is much smaller than the real me so presume I'm actually hugely fat? /#stronglogic",False,False

Like I'm not going to pretend it's because I was confident, I wasn't, I think I was just deeply in denial - and now that I'm actually paying attention to myself, I can see my body for how it actually looks, and I'm always scrutinizing it to see if I've gotten any smaller, and it just makes me feel fat all the time. It sucks lol. But I guess it's better to know I'm technically smaller than I was before, right?",False,False

It’s the strangest thing. I wish it would stop.",False,False
