It feels like a waste to eat with something not perfect, like I can't focus. I even have to have a certain amount of food on a plate or a certain amount of liquid in a mug. If it passes a certain threshold I've set, I feel uncomfortable.",False,False

I even keep an old bowl thatâ€™s was once my go-to in my room, to collect jewelry now. Idk why, I just donâ€™t want anyone else to use it. I get pissed when my bowl is used to store other peopleâ€™s food in the fridge, so to make it unusable like that would honestly feel like such a personal attack against me (not even being dramatic). But yeah, these attachments are strange, a special type of crazy lol.",False,True

The bowls were plastic in 3 different colours and the colour corresponded to the meal I used them for.  My little sister turned them into bird feeders. She burned holes in the side of them, hung them from a tree full of seed, and I mentally could not bring myself to eat from anything other than my own hands for a week.  Getting attached to particular cutlery/dining pieces seems to just be another part of the disorder. I'm so glad that I can see that crazy in someone else.",False,False
