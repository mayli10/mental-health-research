I've tried it in every way shape or form and I still always end up relapsing.  I've done the whole Maudsley #recoverywarrior deal with endless milkshakes and chocolate. You know the type. The whole Instagram recovery community aesthetic. It's complete bullshit.  I've done the ""baby steps"" approach, eating barely enough and exercising too much. Lost too much weight and ended up in another relapse.  I've done inpatient treatment, really taking it seriously, going one day at a time and genuinely working to overcome my fears and irrationalities. I made some great progress, but the weight gain was more than I can handle.  I don't think recovery exists for me anymore. I'm okay with that. I've resigned myself to death by this disorder. It's fine.",False,False

It seems like what we all have in common is wanting a break from the fixation/obsessive thoughts... has anyone found any meds that help with these at all? ,False,True

But honestly, my view of recovery includes me maintaining an underweight BMI while being mentally unbothered by eating, food, weight, calories. I want to recover mentally, but not physically.

Not calorie counting and stressing if i do happen to eat too much and learn to cope with it and that it's not the end of the world.   Not thinking about food 24/7 so i actually have room in my brain to do more important things like doing well in school and socialising.  There are so many more but i feel like this post would get too long. Congrats on starting recovery!,False,False

Stable, healthy weight. No longer obsessing over food. Being able to understand my hunger signals and eat an appropriate amount without feeling guilt or a need to binge/restrict.

If I decline an invite to a meal I want it to be because I don’t want to socialize, not because I don’t want to eat. If I have a bad day I want to give myself a break, self care, rather than punish myself saying I don’t deserve food. I want to believe that food is nourishment, not discomfort. ",False,False

I’m not sure if that’s something I can attain or not. But I feel like I need to “break up” with it and move on.   If I’m not restricting then I’m binge eating.
