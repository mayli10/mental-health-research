My step-father used to call all me a 'disgusting dirty pig' and it's never left my mind. Please try not to take those things to heart. Yeah therapy would probably help lol üò¨,False,False

The only reason for this is that she sometimes throws comments like ""isn't this too much pasta?"" and I really, really don't want to be triggered by her. My dad also sometimes makes comments like ""are you really gonna weight this tiny piece of cucumber?"". He isn't triggering, but it's still annoying since I don't want to talk with him about why I weight my cucumber.",False,False

Hearing my mom ridiculing the bodies of beautiful women on tv while always mindlessly eating is so triggering to me I‚Äôve called her out on dumb things like this because it‚Äôs behaviour like that which makes me feel unsafe eating around her. I‚Äôm sorry I‚Äôm venting but I had an ‚Äúok‚Äù binge where it didn‚Äôt get too out of hand and finished 5/6 Ferrero chocolates and she came into my room and called me a pig because I guess she was looking forward to them all day.  The work thing is smart!! Will start eating at cafes or even empty office space.   Man I really need to go to therapy my ED really stems from my home issues.. sorry for venting fml,False,True

I moved out &amp; no longer have to stress over the parent situation anymore. I really do feel for you though, when my ED first started (or rather, when they first notoced) they were like hawks, asking so many questions, spending hours with me at the table, it was torturous. Any other public setting, I cant eat in front of people. One tip for work is to go away into a space other than the breakroom (if you can, idk what your work is like) not only do you remove the possibility of eating around your coworkers, but I also find it's a nice break (whereas in the break room everyone is talking about work... the opposite of relaxing!)",False,False
