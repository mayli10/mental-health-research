It's nice but I loved crunchy real deal peanut butter so I bought some.  It sat in the cupboard for a couple of weeks and on impulse I thought, fuck it and put some on a couple of crackers.  After a few more times I felt okay with it.  Feels wobbly at first, but the taste takes over from that.  You deserve it so I hope you join the Reclaimed PB Club soon.",False,False

I was like that with 99% cocoa Lindt chocolate.  Started off having one chunk a night with coffee, then 2 a night.  Now the thrill's gone but it's good to know I took one of my pleasures back from my ed and if I want it I can have it.  Peanut butter's good for you anyway, so double yay that you won that one.
