That’s where I got safe food snacks while I was in Europe.   But honestly I wouldn’t stress too much. It’s vacation and you’re supposed to enjoy it. It’s unlikely you’re gonna gain any weight, and if you do it won’t be more than a pound or so, which you can easily take care of when you get home. Enjoy yourself! Life is short ❤️",False,False

When I'm traveling I usually make oatmeal there for breakfast/lunch and then splurge on meals out here and there. But it's nice to be able to cook more safe meals as well when away for so long.",False,False
