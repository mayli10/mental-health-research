Not even five minutes ago he backhanded me across the face for putting a dirty cup in the sink. (I'm pretty sure that's where they go??) I was planning on moving to a new city in a couple months once I had more savings but I think I'm going to just max out my student loan money for the year and use the money to get out. I don't care how bad that fucks me up later- I can't do this anymore.,False,False
