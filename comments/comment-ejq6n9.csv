Even less expensive grocery stores have a lot of healthy and natural food. You can find rye and sprouted grains breads at many grocery stores though I don’t believe they are as popular as white or the sweetened wheat bread because they are usually more expensive. You can also get pretty healthy prepackaged low calorie foods but they are usually more expensive. There is a huge variety of options but you probably won’t find those options easily in some areas of the country.   It’s just that a lot of people choose to eat junk anyway because dieting is kind of looked down upon by many. I think it’s definitely mocked as being vain or overly virtuous by people who choose not to do it. The whole body positivity movement is tied in with that. However it’s still clear that being thinner or fitter is definitely considered better looking, so you have a lot of conflicting messages. Fortunately, where I live, I think most people my age make an effort to eat healthy so it’s a lot easier to diet than it is in other parts of the country.",False,False

Im always confused by some foods heres content. Why is there so much sugar in bread? Like plain bread why is it so processed it should just be regular bread but its got so much extra stuff added in it. Ive always have a very plain tongue with some foods i like salt and sugar but i like it very mildly flavored that way, but everything here is so...insane. I love me some bubble tea but the standard 100% sugar is completely disgusting to me. I would go for the 0% even without the ed bc milk and flavor is already sweet enough.

And not only do marketers know that sugar and salt make foods addictive, but the sodium is used to increase shelf-life so they have an excuse to load things up with salt.  And you're right about healthy foods being even more expensive. I recently thought to myself that I needed to stop eating fast food so much now that my ADHD is being treated and it should be easier to make time to cook for myself or even just to remember to do it before I get way too tired from getting distracted then not eating. I bought enough for maybe 500 calories a day for 3 or 4 days and paid like $50. I can go to McDonald's and get a value menu combo for like $6 and that's around 900 calories. So 4 days would only be $24 instead. Plus, after the supplements I take a McDouble combo meets pretty much all of my nutritional needs for a day. I try to spend just $10 a day on food, so if I could bring myself to eat at McDonald's every day that would leave me with $4 which I could spend on protein bars or croissants or something. I can buy proteins bars at my college for $3 each and croissants at this store next to my house for 50 cents each, so I could get enough food to be healthy if I did that all the time. Well, croissants still aren't the best idea, but if I include the meal replacement shakes I drink that would still be about $10 and a lot healthier. I guess I wouldn't be getting quite enough calories to maintain a healthy weight, but I'm kind of over that anyway. I do think that would technically be about $10.50 and I might still buy a croissant anyway if I get hungry and want a snack, but even if I spend $11 on food for a day that's still better than $16.

That's... that's really not supposed to be in there. I promise you. And I feel so bad because it's HARD to switch back!

Sure, you adjust, but in the meantime you have to deal with eating bland and boring food. Not easy, especially if you use food as a coping mechanism.  But sweeter and saltier foods are more appealing to our monkey brains so it's more lucrative, health impact be damned : /  I visited America and Canada when I was younger and on top of portion sizes, food expectations in general just... blew me away. I remember the family we were staying with bringing out a dozen Krispy Kreme doughnuts for breakfast and my fat little self was STUNNED and figured it must be a really really special occasion but... no... it was just breakfast.

Add on top of that how nutritional info is so heavily obscured and easily manipulated by corporations in the US compared to other countries... like. I can't stand people making obesity into some kind of personal failing when the cards are all stacked against them there.
