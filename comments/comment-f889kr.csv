If you’re cycling between being dizzy and excessive hunger and then binging, it’s probably not healthy for your body. Your blood sugar is low at night from deprivation and your body is trying to tell you what it needs, if it’s deprived for an extended period of time it can lead to overeating / overcompensation - it’s your body’s way of survival!   Maybe try an alternative approach, if you’re trying to eat healthy, plan out some healthy meals that you like for breakfast lunch and dinner (some go to favorites or easy meals - chicken and veggies, fish, pasta). Then stock your place/bag with snacks that are healthy and high in protein and fat and low in sugar(granola bars, yogurt, avocados, peanut butter). Have a snack every couple hours between meals. Also drink a lot of water throughout the day! Listen to your body; if you put in on a schedule, it will adapt, and you’ll be more in tune with when you’re hungry and full over time. And remember it’s ok to treat yourself every once in a while!!   I know there’s science behind intermittent fasting- but I’m not a fan. It’s too easy to go too far. And I that’s what’s fueling the cravings.   If you’re really set on sticking with intermittent fasting, maybe try seeking out a nutritionist to help find what your body needs to make sure you’re using the technique in the healthiest way possible.  I know all this is always easier said than done, and I know there are a lot of barriers to accessing healthy foods and maintaining this lifestyle. But try and trust yourself, your brain and body are INCREDIBLE in their ability to change and learn new habits if you give them time. And don’t forget to be kind to yourself, give yourself some compassion and love.   hope there are some practical tips here you can use! Best of luck!",False,False
