I get it usually half off at my Kroger. These pills finally got my anemia under control and I feel so much better. If pills freak you out you could also look into the iron fish",False,False

They’re really not that expensive, they can greatly improve your quality of life, and maybe next time you’ll be able to donate. They can be taken on an empty stomach. Some people say that it makes them nauseous but I’ve never had a problem with it. It can be taken with food too, but calcium interferes with complete absorption, so check your nutrition facts for the food first. Vitamin C boosts absorption, so I’ve been taking mine with I Love Lemon tea.",False,False
