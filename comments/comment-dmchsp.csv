You didn’t gain 2.4kg of fat, your body was holding onto water causing a 2.4kg gain in water weight. If your weight is up tomorrow it is from food in your stomach and water weight, it is NOT fat. Carbs are not magic macronutrients that will secretly cause you to gain fat even if you’ve been under your TDEE. If you gain any weight from eating a meager 110g of carbs it will be water weight because carbs cause water retention.  From the situation you are describing it is scientifically impossible for you to have gained any fat. Fluctuations on the scale are completely normal and can be a result of water retention, food in the stomach, hormones, time of the month if you have a uterus that sheds, stress, and other factors. You haven’t gained any fat so you can relax.",False,False
