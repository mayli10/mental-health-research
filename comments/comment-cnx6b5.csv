She has a way of saying really insensitive things to me very often. I don’t live with her or see her often but when I do see her she manages to say something that just gets in my head. If I say anything about this she is going to go on a rant about me being a super sensitive millennial and it’s just not worth it.,False,True

Non-ED folk just don't fucking get it. That would have triggered the fuck out of me too. Do you have the kind of relationship with your mom where you can tell her that those comments are really unhelpful?,False,False
