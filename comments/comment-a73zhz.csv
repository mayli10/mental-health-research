I mean, ideally these feats of athleticism wouldn't be inspired by the need to offset an overeating situation... but there are certainly worse ways to respond to a binge. Personally, I could have just stayed in bed all day, crying, but I didn't, and you didn't either; so, psychologically, that's a win right off the bat. Plus, our bodies are probably grateful for the fuel... might as well take advantage of that surplus energy, right? ",False,True

The concept of binge eating is a hellish nightmare to me, and I absolutely will not accept it as a possibility. The only reason I'm not suicidal after this weekend is that my weekly average still evens out to &lt;1,200 kcal and I know logically that it was more of a ""reactive eating"" episode than a true binge. I felt full afterwards, but not completely out of control or sick, or that it was emotionally fueled in any way.  Maybe I'm lying to myself, but since this never happens, I kind of feel like randomly eating 2,300 calories in a day is kind of understandable if you've been operating at a deficit for eight months straight? I logged it as an ""early snack"" on Sunday (before my run), so actually my total intake and macro ratios look pretty healthy and normal for fueling my workouts over the course of the weekend...",False,True
