I really hope that you can figure out what's going on, and good luck with your health. That is enough to scare someone straight for sure.",False,True

Then I found myself feeling so much pressure that this just came so naturally. And honestly I LOVE purging. Throwing up feels so good.  Sometimes I wish I was pregnant again so that I could just be sick in peace and quiet and have an actual reason to be sick all the time. ( I had extreme nausea during both pregnancies)   I know what I need to do.  I'm going to chat with my husband today and go see a doctor this week. I dont want to, but I need to.",False,True

I started purging one day 5 years ago and didn’t stop until 13 days ago. I went from 285 to 140. People have praised me and gushed over the weight lose, but I swear to you, it’s not worth it. Yeah I “look” better but I feel so bad about myself. I was purging up to 3 times a day (never binged only normal meals). Honestly, my husband was so over it and that was scaring me too. He’s been so patient but when is enough, enough?   Well guess what happened 13 days ago?! I woke up with shooting pains in my stomach and completely swollen. I waited it out and on Monday I couldn’t deal with the pain and swelling. I had literally gained 15 pounds in 7 days. I’ve had to get ultrasounds on my stomach and bloodwork for extensive labs. Doctor literally doesn’t know what’s going on. I get my bloodwork on Tuesday to see if it’s my gallbladder, liver, kidneys, or heart.   I’m not saying it was the purging because who knows. But this shit scared me. I haven’t purged in 13 days which is so hard. It’s hard to break that habit, something that makes people see you are “better” or “pettier”. I understand everything you’re going through. But this medical scare has freaked me out. I’m 29 years old. I shouldn’t be on water pills because of bloating (lost those 15lb in two days after the pills) until they figure out what’s wrong. You have kids who depend on you. It’s not worth it.   Also, you’ll never be thin enough. Even at 140 I don’t feel good about myself and was ready to keep purging every day until I got to 120. You already know that wouldn’t have been good enough either.   Stop purging today. Seriously, after 5 years it’s going to be way harder to stop. It became second nature to me. Something that was a part of my identity and a stress releaser. I haven’t been able to sleep a full night in these 13 days because I  think about the food still sitting in my body. But I tell myself, even if this medical thing is unrelated, purging daily will not help me in any way.   Message me if you want to discuss what I’ve done these last days to stop myself from doing it. Much love and I wish you all the best.",False,False
