My relapse last year happened in the spring when I didnâ€™t have a sport, and I was completely fine and losing weight until the fall season started. I actually ended up not making the varsity volleyball team because I had gotten so weak. For me that was just a huge eye opener, and I realized that in order to live a full life and do the things I enjoyed, I needed to nourish my body.   Hopefully athletics can be kind of a motivator for you, because if you give into your ED, you wonâ€™t be able to compete anymore, which would suck.   Stay strong, push through, I believe in you ðŸ’“",False,False

I used to row in high school, and I was good at it and serious about it. I was a lightweight (&lt;130), so I (along with the other lightweights) had frequent weigh-ins to ensure I would make weight for competitions, because in the lightweight division an entire boat is disqualified if even a single rower is over 130 lbs. I always restricted harder when I knew I had a weigh-in coming up, because I wanted to see the number to down. It came at the cost of seeing my times go up though, since I was losing muscle as well as fat. I ended up having to quit a couple months into my first semester of college because my health was getting so bad",False,False
