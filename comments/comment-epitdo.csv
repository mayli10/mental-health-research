First of all, I just wanna say, this isn't entirely on you. They say genetics loads the gun, and lifestyle pulls the trigger. So like, lots of people pull the same ""trigger"" you did, but may not face the same health consequences, simply because they happen to have better genes in this regard.   I'm not saying this to make you feel disempowered, but to maybe help ease some of the shame. Part of this stuff comes down to luck, you know?   In any case, please don't beat yourself up for bingeing. BED is extremely hard to fix in isolation, and if possible I would really recommend getting outside support or treatment.   Please feel better &lt;3",False,False
