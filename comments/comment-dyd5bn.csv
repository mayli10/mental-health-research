I frequently wish I would get an illness (like cancer) so I wouldn’t have to go to work (a job I fucking hate) for a substantial amount of time. And yes, I know that is terrible. My mom had breast cancer, my cousin died of breast cancer, and by best friend had ovarian cancer. Again, well aware this makes me a terrible person.",False,False

Since developing disordered eating in August, it’s extended to that. Like I imagine setting a suicide date and then imagine how happy I could be eating whatever the fuck I wanted with no worries because I’d be dead soon.  So yeah, kind of fucked up lmao but kind of a similar concept to you.",False,False
