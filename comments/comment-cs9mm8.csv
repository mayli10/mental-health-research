As an old hand at the fasting game, be reassured that you're supposed to work yourself up to longer, extended fasts by doing intermittent fasting first, and then 1-2 day fasts.   Just remember to drink more fluids next time. You should be drinking close to a gallon, actually. Yes, really, that much. If you're feeling dizzy, get some electrolytes in ya. If dizziness persists, eat something. There's absolutely no shame in breaking a fast. Just go as long as you can, no biggie.",False,False

Bougie pink salt is best but any sodium will do. If u r feeling ~fancy~ shove some lemon juice and magnesium citrate in there too!!   I drink this nasty cocktail everyday (regardless of what I am/am not eating) and it has drastically reduced my headaches, nausea, and the scary heart palpitations.",False,False
