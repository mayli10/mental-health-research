But I will count other things I add to the coffee, like plant milks and sometimes sweetners. I know there are calories in black coffee but if I freak out about them I know my stupid brain will be like ""WELL IF I GO OVER MY CALORIES ON COFFEE WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE IF I BINGE ON ANOTHER 2000CAL OF DOUGHNUTS!?"" so I just... drink the 5cal coffee.  I do have a fake chicory instant coffee thing I drink sometimes when I've had too much caffeine and that's significantly higher calories (F) so I do count that.",False,False
