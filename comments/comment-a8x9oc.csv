Even if you were slightly overweight it'd be better than allowing ED thoughts to dominate your entire life. Just try to eat a balanced diet at maintenance and find activities that you enjoy and don't think too much about the number.  Which, of course, is hard as shit with an ED. But I'm speaking from experience-- there is no need to lose weight right now",False,False

So it is possible. I can imagine it's damn hard though. ",False,False

Things like BED are EDs that cause unnecessary weight gain and typically it'd be part of recovery if you stop binging  But don't be like me and think ""oh god I need to lose weight"" because you went from an underweight bmi to around 21. There is jo reason to lose weight here and while it's technically okay to go lower, it can trigger a mega relapse as it did for me.  However, with a trained professional, you can discuss working out, healthier eating, etc and that might make a healthy weight feel more comfortable. That's how it is for me (I say as I've been eating a ton of sugary Christmas treats. Regardless, my weight is healthy, but I feel more comfortable when I'm working out and eating more veggies. But also maintenance u feel) ",False,False
