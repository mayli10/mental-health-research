As I read them one by one I really feel for the pain you are in. Things like accidents and work are really hard to deal with, especially when consumed with so many other thoughts and illness.   &amp;#x200B;  I lost my kitty 2 months back and I know how sick and sad you feel. It is truly devastating beyond words.  I wish I could give you a big hug!  I spent the first week hugging a pillow in the fetal position every night. Honestly that made me feel most safe and calm. I felt like he was with me. It really helped, esp. when I closed my eyes and squeezed the pillows. Some nights I still do.   &amp;#x200B;  It's okay to be sad and cry. Sometimes that is healthy, especially in a situation like this. You are 100% right, you can and will get through this and as things pass and the accident is taken care of you will feel relieved that at least you are free of that worry. Running out of bronkaid causes me to be insatiable as well and that one binge will be a distant memory in a while.   &amp;#x200B;  Take care of yourself and rest. Sooooo many hugs &lt;3",False,False
