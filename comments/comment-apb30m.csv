You can play with meal timing, composition, fasting, etc, to dull this response, but fundamentally, when you have a long history of restriction, during re-feeding, eventually you hit a point where your body says ""Play time's over. Give me food, and a lot of it, NOW"". Hormonally what's happening is there's a disruption in the leptin feedback system, and general hormonal fluctuation body-wide. The only way to fix it is to listen and keep eating. For me and many others, this results in body fat overshoot, as your metabolic rate stays suppressed while you are in this phase and takes a while to come up to normal.",False,False

This is a good sign, it means your body is trying to recover and still working! (Or this is what I try to tell myself at least, that is is better to be hungry because if I am not my body is shutting down and lowering my metabolism)  Or sometimes when you have been restricting and you start to eat your body gets very all or nothing, and is like if this is the only time I get too eat I have to make the most of it, abd so you do get extremely hungry, especially after you eat, (you could google recovery binges) the thing to avoid this by eating g regularly, at the same time each day and same amount, it doesn’t mean eating more, just trying to not go so long between meals. This is also totally normal, and doesn’t mean you are developing BED or something  ",False,False

I didn't have much to gain and 2. I had no problem indulging it. The extreme hunger did fade away and I had no problem eating a reasonable healthy amount of calories. I can't tell you how long yours would last, but it does absolutely fade away after a while. Plus, I think extra hunger is a side effect of frequent purging - your body is used to registering 2000 calories of food as 500.  &amp;#x200B;  Then I relapsed a week later, so I'm obviously not an expert, but I also watch a lot of recovery youtubers and they've all confirmed extreme hunger in recovery. It's hard to trust your body, but try if you can.",False,False

Aim for 6-8 glasses per day   Eating a little bit of fat, fiber, and protein with each meal? Those talk help slow digestion and keep you full longer  Eatng a lot of sugar or white carbs? These mess south blood sugar and make you want more sooner than later. Minimize these or be sure to eat alongside healthy fats, protein and fiber  Exercise? Just a 20 minute walk can change for body chemistry and distract you from that starving feeling  And of course,  I'm not a professional so if these tips don't help, please talk to someone who is qualified fo help.",False,False

When you don’t eat your stomach shrinks a bit but when you are eating frequently your stomach expands slightly and then physically your body wants it to be full so you’re hungrier,False,False
