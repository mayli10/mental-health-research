In the end what matters is your health and how you perceive yourself. If you want to lose more weight do so as long as it is not negatively impacting your physical or mental health and you are not already underweight. My family have also told me I look sick but I know that to not be true and they are exaggerating. I also want to lose more weight. I’m not underweight yet so it’s ok.,False,False
