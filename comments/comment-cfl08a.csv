And tbh the people I have heard they got it were most of my male friends so in normal or low weight, so is not necessarily a weight exclusive thing. But maybe they were fine being open about it and others no. I also see many kids get that both bum and armpits no matter their weight is.   Using cream and stick to cotton panties that are more breathable should help.",False,False
