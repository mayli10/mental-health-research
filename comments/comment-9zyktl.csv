I try to schedule binges around when my family have plans to go out and it helps? Someone once commented a big thing on a post of mine on ProED about how they wished they’d eaten more with family and it really stuck with me and I try to do it - obviously so much easier said than done! Hope your day goes well, and just think of how big ikea is - you’ll burn some off just walking around it! ",False,False
