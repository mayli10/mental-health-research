Obviously it's not good, but yeah. I can't remember the last time i had mine (sometime in the spring probably), but I haven't had it this entire summer. I've been maintaining 10 lbs underweight since spring-ish and content with my body. I figured i'll be ok slightly underweight since i don't want to lose any more-- like I'm not an anorexic chick with an ever changing GW-- but I'm not delusional either. Idk. I guess i want someone to scare me with the real long-term consequences (i figure there's some if I've lost my period). To profile me, I'm 17 F, long-distance runner, and i have minor pre-existing scoliosis.   Idk, a part of me thinks it really isn't a big deal to be 10 lbs underweight because there are many naturally underweight people who can maintain an underweight bmi and still be healthy (though i understand i that this doesn't mean the exception applies to me). But a part of me also knows it would probably be in my best interest to put on 10 lbs-- in vanity as well. I can recognize how my figure is unnattractive. Visible chest and rib bones, flat ass, gangly legs, tired, vaguely sunken face. I look good in clothes but not naked. But also the idea of purposely putting on 10 lbs is insane to me. Why would i do that? I don't intend to give up on calorie tracking, either, so there's no room for me to ease up on myself over time when I always know what's going inside of my body. Idk. I don't like the idea of gaining weight.",False,False

That's a myth.  Even in inpatient eating disorder treatment, actual metabolic damage (the real kind, not the bullshit youtuber kind) takes 2-3 weeks of medically supervised refeeding to resolve.  Other body systems can suffer from extended malnutrition, though.  Your reproductive system shuts down, and may or may not come back online.    It's unlikely you'll get sufficient vitamins and minerals at that intake, so you'll probably develop iron/zinc deficiencies, and all the skin, hair and heart problems that go along with those.    There's a good chance you'll end up with a potassium deficiency, which can also cause cardiac issues.    It increases your tendency to store abdominal fat, which puts you at increased risk of diabetes and, again, cardiac illnesses.
