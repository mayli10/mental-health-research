When my stomach acid starts churning and I get that nauseating hunger, I pop a cherry anti-acid chew. It tastes decent enough and literally gets rid of the hunger feeling. I never overdose on these or anything, but sometimes too much and water just doesn't cut it.   This does shit for emotional hunger, but for physical hunger it's bomb. ",False,False

If I'm thinking of eating I just start reading the doc and it helps to kill the food thoughts. If I still end up eating then my doc gets a bit longer with new thoughts and it may help on getting me to stop and think before I eat again next time.

Try drawing the food you want to binge on 2. Play the sims and make your sims eat everything you feel like binging on  3. try chewing gum  4.
