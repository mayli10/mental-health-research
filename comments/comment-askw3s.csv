I also love fashion but can’t afford Chanel, Gucci and Prada so if I’m skinny my fast fashion outfits from Zara will look chic with my one designer YSL bag.  I know how vain that sounds but clothes simply look more elegant on thin women.   A shirt from Zara on a thin woman will just look more expensive to me than if it were on a heavier set woman. Maybe that’s all in my mind &amp; I’m completely crazy. It could very well just be my ED brain.   Another reason is I get a lot more attention from men at my lowest weight. I’m 5’7.5 and I get hit on the most at about 108. I’ve tested this theory &amp; it rings true every damn time.   I also enjoy sex more at a lower weight because I can keep the lights on &amp; feel comfortable and sexy.",False,False

I know I look better at my natural weight, I don’t understand why I do it to myself.  It doesn’t matter how thin I am, even when I know I don’t look good and my health is in danger bc of my low weight, even when everything’s going right and I’m happy and I’ve got no excuses. I’m simply inclined to eat less.   I don’t know why, it’s automatic. AN is my default. I have to fight against it.",False,False

I’m only 10 desperate, cold, miserable pounds away from my realistic goal weight, which... Wouldn’t change my appearance that much.

Maybe it's because I've finally gained control of my weight after a life of being fat and it's the only thing I feel in control of? Idk if that's even true but I assume so since I obsess over it. Also I blame a lot of social problems on my weight and think being smaller is some answer,False,False
