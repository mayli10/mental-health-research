Just reading through everything my ED bulb lit up so many times. Your friend seems like a great reader. I wish I had something helpful or insightful to say but I'm a dumb bitch and far from recovery.  Gooooood luck with everything and I hope you can accept help, heal, move on and just overall feel better physically, mentally, emotionally! ðŸ’•",False,False

It was cool but also I felt really called out. From what I remember this was my basic reading:  Soul - The Tower - control and need for it; perfection  Personality(?) - The Chariot - determination, strength, commitment and achievement through trust   Embrace - The World reversed. Seeking closure, moving on, wanting to fulfill something but not taking the time to do so. Taking the harder path to do the thing   Erase - High Priestess. Represents inner intuition. Let go of assuming you have all the answers. Trust others and donâ€™t always go with what you feel is right   Face - The Hermit. Going on a journey for self reflection. Finding your true self and the goals you want to achieve even though they may be hard, facing what lies ahead of you even if you donâ€™t know where to take the right step. Enhancing consciousness. Invest in what you know is real.    Basically I see my soul/personality cards as literally my struggles with past trauma and my current ED and wanting control (always) and it not working (thanks ED). My three card spread is super relevant rn because Iâ€™m trying recovery and wanting to move on from this shit but am having a tough time trusting my team and accepting I might need more help than I want to admit",False,True

What did she say that made you think it was ED related?   I'm suuuper interested because I have a pack of Tarot cards and I've been meaning to practice forever but I never do ugh.,False,False
