Right now it's almost 2 pm and I've eaten half a can of kidney beans with broccoli and celery, and I had some soy milk in my coffee.

I'm trying to recover atm, and while I do want to gain weight, I wanna do it in such a way that optimizes muscle growth over a long period of time... and I'm nowhere near underweight enough for gaining a few pounds of fat on Christmas treats to be conducive to my well being. It would be a one way ticket to relapse-town for me :p   I'm writing a paper on how I'd design a dryland plyometric program for a theoretical young swimmer. It's interesting enough.

I feel like I'm not getting enough sleep and at work I feel like a zombie and that I'm just going through the motions.   But on the plus side I've been restricting and eating pretty clean to make up for all the binging last weekend.  Also tis the season of Christmas parties which of course revolve around food gahhh.

Uuuunfortunately, until recently I had barely taken it since I got on testosterone, and I think the hormone swap may have made it necessary for me to be taking a higher dose for this shit to work.
