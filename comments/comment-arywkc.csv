I'm going on three years now of waking up at 4:50am, ECA stack, pre-workout, make a 250 Calorie 1/2 gallon protein shake. 45 minutes lifting, 20 minutes bike ride. Get to work, coffee, ECA stack #2. Eat my 300 Calorie lunch I meal prepped on Sunday. ECA stack #3. Go home. Microwave and eat stir fry veggies and a can of soup. Then it's Melatonin, sleep, wake up at 4:50.  Working my ass off for three years. It's mentally exhausting. *Fuck mental health anyway amiright?* But I'm starting to feel more physical harm than benefits. And to be told my hard work is meaningless, because I'm ""naturally athletic"" is just a big fuck you.",False,True

They have NO CLUE how freaking physically and mentally exhausting it is to keep up this shape. I was just thinking about how freaking exhausted I am. I am pushing 10-15 miles/day and eating 1k-1.5k Cals/day and I still hate myself for eating that much (despite it being a serious deficit with all my exercise).

I don’t know if you’ve ever been around those people who always boast about their fast metabolisms like oh I can eat whatever and what not.
