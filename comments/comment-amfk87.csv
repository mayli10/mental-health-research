Many posters here probably can't relate or understand how your post was related to eating disorders and that is why you aren't getting responses related to an eating disorder.  And I'm really not trying to attack you here but part of why you are being downvoted and not getting appropriate responses is because your OP was difficult to understand and honestly contained a lot of rambling. This gives the impression that you are either underage or very strung out/intoxicated and that's why it's hard to ascertain what question you are asking in the OP, and people are concerned about your drug use. When I replied to the part related to EDs, I was just taking an educated guess at what you may have been trying to ask or imply because it is not clear. ",False,False

I never said i think drug binges are perfectly okay and normal and anyone who does think that is nuts, I'm working on harm reduction as of now. I don't know why i was even downvoted on my comment i don't condone what i do, I'm just sharing my thoughts and experiences like you are.",False,True

I got court ordered to rehab when I was 16 but I wasn't *really* an addict, they just had me messed up, obviously. 6 months of residential treatment and I came out still screaming I wasn't an addict.   You never think you're an ""addict"" until you're desperately piling old cottons onto a spoon and shooting up the liquid in an attempt to stop being dopesick because, you know, you shoot heroin everyday and don't have money anymore. Or giving up absolutely any of your morals in whatever illegal attempt to get money for drugs. I'm not saying messing around with occasional substance use will get you to this point, but it's easier than you think. Especially if the ""pills"" you like are opiates, MANY (in fact, most) heroin addicts start there, get addicted, and move to H because it's cheaper. Adderall is closer to meth than you think and if you ever get past the stigma of meth enough to try it you will see that. Even if you just ""do pills"" all it takes is one bad press or stupid combination and you will die like Mac Miller or Lil Peep. No matter how you slice it doing drugs isn't healthy and if you really feel that month long drug binges are normal and can/should be done regularly then you may want to consider help before you go too far and lose your life, or have to battle immensely with something horrible like hard drug addiction.  Long rant I know but I'm an addict and obviously hits close to home. Again, I know what it's like to feel that you don't want treatment and you shouldn't pursue it if you don't, but drug binges aren't normal, aren't healthy, and if you let it go too far without addressing it you could face severe consequences. I wish I had stopped when I was where you are. As for the actual point of your post, EDs go hand in hand w body dysmorphia and it is very common to be unable to accurately gauge what you look like or how much you are actually eating. You probably aren't eating as many calories as you think you are, and if other ppl think you've lost weight, you probably have or at least externally look like you do. You can't trust your own judgements or perceptions of yourself when mental illness is present, unfortunately. ",False,False

Drug addiction is extremely serious. I hope I'm not being too rude, but the way you write makes it seem like... idk, just very casual about going on a drug binge. That's not normal, and it's not healthy, both for your body and your mental health. Then add an ED to the mix, and you're putting your life in serious danger. My mom died of a drug overdose. She died alone. And like many people who die from overdose, it was probably while choking on vomit.  It sounds like your mother cares about you, and I guarantee she's suffering immensely watching you kill yourself. Please consider getting professional help",False,False
