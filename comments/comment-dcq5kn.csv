I’ve found being fit looks good regardless of what the scale says and you can actually eat enough to function,False,False

The eating disorder/body dysmorphia is SO much deeper than a number on a scale or a clothing size.    It's about something we're missing in our lives, a happiness hole. And feeling the need to be in control of our lives.  So what do we have control over? How much we eat and exercise.  What goals do we make to ""improve"" our lives?  Ones related to food and exercise.  What happens when we reach our goal?   We're still emotionally broken, but now have nothing healthy to look forward to.  &amp;#x200B;  Because you mention that you're in PE still, I assume you're still young--teenager, perhaps. I WISH I knew now what I knew then. I would have gotten the help I needed and my life would look much different today.  I suggest discussing this with your parents--if my assumption on your age is accurate?-- and seeking some therapy to deal with underlying issues.     Either way, congrats on reaching your goal weight and good luck on making health your ultimate goal, physically and mentally!",False,False

I had a goal weight in my head for a long time, but avoided scales so never knew where I was. Turned out I was only about 2 lbs from it, and I didn’t look how I thought I would. So I just lowered my GW further.",False,False

I’ve had my UGW set for the last year and a half but I recently saw my bff who is the same height as me, but weighs 106 pounds. It’s been fucking with my head hard ever since I saw her in a bikini and holy shit it’s killed me. Now, I want to go even *lower*. It’s like, I don’t think we will ever be happy with ourselves no matter what weight we get to. It’s like the lower I get the fatter I feel.",False,False

Actually at about 10 pounds before my goal weight I thought I looked good, but kept restricting to get to the “magic number.” Made it and kept going. 10 pounds on the other side of my goal weight and I think I look gross. I’ve been working on eating more, but then stepped on the scale this morning and was like fuck it, why not lose 10 more?",False,False
