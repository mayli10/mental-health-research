Yesterday with the doughnuts, coworker one did resist for a while because I had not gotten one. She was trying to be good. I told her ‚Äúwell lunch will be here soon!‚Äù (So you‚Äôll be fine without one) so after lunch she says I‚Äôm getting a doughnut I don‚Äôt care (comment about me looking from OP). She then tacks on: but I‚Äôm going to get one of the low calorie ones without all the toppings. (lol k)   For perspective, I have 5-10 pounds to lose. She gained 110 pounds during her pregnancy. Yes I typed that correctly. Her kid is almost 2 now. She asked me about food and I talk about meal prepping and weighing and logging everything. She asks how many calories I eat. I said around 1400 (I‚Äôm 5‚Äô8). She said AND you lift weights AND do cardio? That seems kinda low for that level of activity. (Please tell me more about a healthy caloric intake when you managed to gain 110 pounds in 9 months)",False,True

I feel you on the rewarding with food at work thing though. My boss likes to go around the office with a basket of sugar and carb dense snacks when we‚Äôve either had a rough day or accomplished something great. I hate it.

It drives me insane because it means I have to bring a lunch that at least seems like it's normal portions. It's even worse because they will comment on the size/content of my lunch.
