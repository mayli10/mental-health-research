I'm convinced that the only people who read wintergirls are people with EDs already, like it's objectively a trash book but it has a cult following in ED spaces",False,False

If I could ban non-ED authors from writing ED books, I would. If I could make it the law that ED books have to be edited by an ex-ED patient who is now recovered, I would. So many books with ED content either unintentionally glamorize EDs, or include SUPER triggering content like numbers.   Wintergirls plays into the ~forbidden glamour~ tropes that annoy me so much. It's also super cringe in parts, and just boring/contrived. I find this especially disappointing because the author also wrote Speak. Speak is such an emotionally raw book, with a socially responsible message. Wintergirls is like cardboard in comparison, imo.",False,False
