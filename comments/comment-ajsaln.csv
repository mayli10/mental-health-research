Miralax and anything with docusate will do this and then you will eventually ""poop"" out the fluid and your weight will drop back to pre-water retention level.   If you took a high stimulant laxative like bisacodyl then you'll have gnarly stomach cramps but probably will eventually have a small BM. If you took something lower stimulant like senna..probably nothing will happen and you'll feel fine and it will all be ok. ",False,False

If the bottle says to take two for an adult, three will be intense. Just make sure to keep your  electrolytes up and drink plenty of water. Keep drinking water/electrolytes until the laxatives wear off so you dont get dehydrated. Although, your experience may be different as your tolerance may be up due to being used to taking 10. As you probably know, laxatives usually takes 6-12 hours to produce a bowel movement, so just be sure that you're by the bathroom around that time. You should be fine though. I've taken 3 before, and I was on the toilet constantly for damn near 24 hours. It was rough. ",False,False
