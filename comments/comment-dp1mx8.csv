I think you might be right; Iâ€™m not ready to give up ED. So it almost doesnâ€™t matter what type of therapy it is because Iâ€™m not ready. Thank you for helping me realize that. ðŸ–¤,False,True

Outpatient therapy, group therapy hypnotherapy, counseling, then I relapsed and had a stint in hospital and lots and lots of CBT (got nowhere with that).   Gave up. Weight restored but hated my healthy body. Had my first child, relapsed again Had my second child, relapsed again. After my wedding I tried to be normal and weight restored but again, felt like i was in the wrong body. Accepted that that was what recovery was all about.  Went to the jungle and drank ayahuasca with shamans. Had a highly destabilizing, profound sequence of psychedelic experiences which left me shook. Six months later I found myself in the middle of a relapse, proving Iâ€™d been in denial the whole time, and proving that what I really wanted was to recover, and by recover I mean not just weight restore, full recovery. Recovery of the soul. Surface level recovery is not sustainable.   So now, after subsequent insights and revelations into my subconscious via shamanic retreats, Iâ€™m now trying another form of therapy called jungian analytical. Itâ€™s much more deep and comprehensive than all the others Iâ€™d tried, and so far has been helping me a lot.    So, there is hope I think.  It could be either that you havenâ€™t found the appropriate therapy for your needs, or that you havenâ€™t found a decent therapist yet.  It could also be that youâ€™re not ready yet. Sounds harsh, but I was told this when i drank the medicine and it was 6-12 months of hell when it finally sunk in and I was ready. Perhaps all my prev therapies didnâ€™t work bc I didnâ€™t wanna give up ED.",False,False

Maybe it isnâ€™t the right approach for you. I went to therapy for a long time and got worse until I changed to a different style of therapy. CBT increased my obsessions and self-hate. I would experience a shame spiral when I couldnâ€™t stop thoughts. ACT (acceptance and commitment therapy) was much more helpful. It taught me how to separate from my thoughts some, helped me figure out why I wasnâ€™t living out what I (not Ed) valued, helped me plan some goals and actions to move in my valued directions (not Ed). I did some work around grieving giving up Ed behavior and made small changes over time, focusing on what was improving in my life. My clinician also used motivational interviewing when I was really struggling with my Ed voice. I also had a dietician who was recovered from AN and did some trauma and attachment work with another therapist. I was in recovery for 4.5 years after that work.   Check out the anorexia workbook on Amazon. I used that with my dietician. It has ACT exercises for AN recovery.",False,False

I have bipolar disorder, and I have had really mixed experiences with therapy. I probably spent a lot more time talking about my poor body image and weight gain than having disordered habits, but I had one therapist who (when I talked about this) would just kind of zone out and roll her eyes and tell me I wasn't fat. Maybe if she had paid attention to me, should would pick up that I had an eating disorder and still had a lot of ED tendencies. It's just exhausting.  One thing I tried that was helpful though was group therapy. Generally people who have gone through similar experiences can validate and offer advice, but there is a professional to mediate.",False,False
