The worst is ignorant dumbasses who wonder out loud why people with anorexia don't just work out instead of starving themselves like...have they not seen ballet dancers who take it too far? Or heard of anorexia athletica in general? I think the most ridiculous post I've ever seen on Reddit is some guy ranting about how having AN is lazy and we'd be soooo much more attractive if we had the willpower to work out and eat properly. So much wrong in that post,False,False

Like, omg, avocado is like a thousand calories!   I know exactly how many calories are in this thankyou Denise. I weighed it this morning as part of my obsessive regime.",False,False
