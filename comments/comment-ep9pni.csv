I'm totally opposed to the kind of forced treatment you're experiencing. It causes trauma, deters people from seeking future help, and permanently undermines trust in the entire mental health system. It's not right. Sick or not, you are still of sound enough mind that your ability to make basic adult decisions shouldn't be taken away.  Idk how things work where you live, but I narrowly avoided a similar situation. Spent months ""playing by the rules"" and living in fear that I might be snatched up and hospitalized at any moment. My psychiatrist required morning and evening texts to prove I wasn't dead, and he wanted to see my blood sugar numbers too because I have type 1 diabetes in addition to an ED. Had to send pics of my glucometer for the blood sugar because he wouldn't believe me otherwise.  One thing that worked for me was switching psychiatrists and therapists after a little time passed and I didn't feel like the situation was quite as precarious.  I told my old psych and therapist that the whole situation had been too traumatic and that I didn't believe we could have a functional therapeutic relationship moving forward because trust had been broken. (For context, they both lied to me repeatedly and the therapist committed a breech of confidentiality as well.)   They wouldn't have discharged me from their care if I hadn't provided names of the new mental health folks I was seeing. But I gave them that info and the transition went pretty smoothly. With the new people, I was honest about the general outline of what I struggle with, but I left out a lot of the more troubling details and put on my best behavior.  After another couple months, I told them I didn't feel like continuing treatment at the time. I said the past trauma re: forced hospitalization was creating resentment towards the mental health community and I didn't feel I was in a headspace to benefit from further treatment. I told them I felt burnt out and wanted to discontinue therapy for a while, said I would be back if anything changed (which I truly meant - I liked the new therapist and psychiatrist on an individual level and wouldn't be opposed to working with them in the future).  For me and for the way healthcare works where I am, this worked. I'm free now. Idk if anything in my story was useful or applicable to your situation, but I hope it provided something helpful. Didn't mean to ramble about myself for no good reason haha, especially not in response to such a heartfelt post. Again, I'm so sorry to hear how trapped you feel. It's not fair.  Good luck.",False,False

When I was discharged from my hospitalization under the Mental Health Act, it was under a 'community treatment order act'. As in, I'm allowed to go home, but I have strict rules to follow. I think this lasts for 6 months, but can easily be renewed for a prolonged time. I don't want to bring it up just yet, for obvious reasons, but it's on my mind. Being forcefully fed and hospitalised has caused me an immense amount of trauma I'd do anything to avoid :(",False,True

Like, is there a timeframe for when you'll have your autonomy back?",False,False
