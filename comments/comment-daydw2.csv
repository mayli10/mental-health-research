I'm married and my husband is super physically affectionate. It fucks with me mentally because I can't fucking understand why he wants to touch me. Ever. We've been friends since middle school so he's seen me go from UW to obese and I fucking hate myself for it.    The running joke is that if he gets too close he'll melt my icy heart.,False,False
