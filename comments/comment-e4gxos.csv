During recovery I got to bmi 25 from the anti depressants and hypothyroidism. Plus I was eating a lot of processed junk but was never satisfied bc I ruined that part and was an emotional mess. Lots of trauma binging. I was able to get to bmi 21 by just making healthier decisions and regular exercise.I loved going on walks &amp; hikes for the calming and emotional benefits not just weight loss. I can’t say I never had disordered thoughts and never struggled but I was able to develop a healthier relationship with food and my body. Therapy and self reflection helped. I needed to learn to forgive and love myself. When I felt in control of my life and emotionally secure I was able to focus on hobbies, school, and dating instead of my ed. Occasionally I did a 1200-1400 calorie diet but it would trigger me so I had to learn to eat more intuitively instead (aka more fruits/veg less processed food). Sometimes I’d relapse and purge when I overate but I was able to get back on track easier.   Lol that was all ruined about a year ago when I semi relapsed and while I’m under my safe weight now I’d be at my ugw if I just stuck with a 1400 diet.",False,False
