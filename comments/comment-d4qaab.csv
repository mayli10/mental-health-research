If its hollow that means theres less fat under your eye and only injections can fix that.  If its color then a vitamin c serum will help. I personally love the Timeless Vit C + Vit E serum. There's a recommendation list on /r/SkincareAddiction as well.  Either way, hydrate like your life depends on it.  Before adding anything fancy you should have cleansing, moisturizing, and sunscreen figured out. You can just splash with water in the morning and only cleanse at night, and obviously only sunscreen during the day. I personally just wipe with micellar water in the morning.  Many people have a compromised moisture barrier so the best thing to do is find a cleanser, moisturizer, and sunscreen your skin like and stick to it for a few weeks. Once you're satisfied with that you can start adding things in for specific skin issues. Avoid all physical exfoliants (think face scrubs), they'll only further damage your skin.  The first 3 steps is the ""/r/SkincareAddiction recommended beginners routine"". I thought I had sensitive skin and needed help with redness - nope, just compromised moisture barrier. All that went away with the 3 step routine so I could focus on my REAL issues (which include under eye darkness).",False,False
