If I could go back and change one thing I would make sure I NEVER started to purge. I did for the first time about 6 years ago and have been trying to quit for the past 2-3 years, and still fuck up a lot. Its so fucking hard to fight the urge and its tempting to do all the time. Im scared it'll ruin my teeth, give me throat cancer, ruin my digestion, or worst case what if I pass out or die in the bathroom while purging and someone has to find me. It really sets you on an immense downward spiral, its 10000% not worth it. Its an addiction and its terrible and I wouldn't wish it on anyone.",False,False

When you’re stomach feels really bloated and it’s almost like bursting you know. And even laying down in bed still feels like 150% full after a binge. But man you just gotta wait 5 minutes and you’ll probably burp / fart and it’ll feel better. Then within 20 minutes you’ll probably take a piss or go take a shit.  Having your first successful purge is probably one of the worst decisions  I’ve made in my life.   I’ll never be able to eat food again without imagining throwing it up. I’ve done it so much I’ve perfected it taking strategic drinks of liquid and only binging on certain foods that throw up nicer then others. It’s terrible.  My bathroom is shamed with the memories of holding my head over the sink throwing up while snot comes out of my mouth and tears coming out of my eyes. Not because I’m sad but because the mouth eyes nose are all connected and they’re just trying to get me to stop. I hate using that bathroom in my house now because it reminds me that of what I do.   On the sink in that bathroom I have it running constantly while I throw up so it blocks out the noise and washes my hands before I put it back I my mouth. And it’s always cold water.  Now whenever I wash my hands and I get that feeling of cold water on my hands it sends goosebumps and tingles up my body and I can sense my mind telling me “please don’t” even though I’m just washing my hands.  Don’t start purging, don’t even consider it an option. It’s such a bad path and once you do it once it will never be the same. It’s not like trying weed or smoking a cigarette for the first time that you can just finish it and be like ok I guess I can choose not to do it again. Once you purge your body knows you can do it and it will become a temptation anytime you eat food. You don’t want to be at dinner with your family and after the first bite of food all you’re thinking about is when to drink water so that you choke less when it’s coming back up.   Don’t even think about it not even ONCE the first time will be the worst ",False,False

I appreciate your support and I can tell that you are super genuine and want me to not go down a bad path, and it's very heartwarming to read.  I will definitely try and not attempt to purge again.  I will say though that the only way I could potentially see myself doing it is if my parents or someone took me out to eat and I felt ""forced"" to eat a lot to not make it seem like I have eating issues.  And if I was forced to eat lots off food in a short period of time then that is the one situation as of now that I think I would try and do it.  Otherwise, I'm just NOT going to eat if I feel like I will eat too much.  That is where I am at right now.  I just don't want to hurt my body, but I can't go back to eating normally at this point.  It's so sad and horrible and Om glad I'm getting help because I NEED IT.",False,True

I would recommend focusing more on lifting in the gym because to get rid of stomach fat you’ll have to gain muscle in order to make it faster / easier.  I read about you trying to purge and I need to talk to you man. I remember the first time I did a true purge I looked up how to make myself throw up and then put my finger down my throat until it worked. That was over half a year ago and I wish I could go back and have never done that. Binge eating and restricting is very bad for you, but throwing up food, man destroys you. I’ve only dealt with the binge and purging, and I miss the days when I would binge and I didn’t even know what purging was.  Recovery is very doable but it takes strength.   Please don’t try and purge again. Because once you’re able to purge and know how too it puts you in such a downward spiral.   Please man don’t start throwing up. PLEASE it destroys your life.   I can’t describe to you the feeling of the day after purging when you’re dehydrated and you feel like your body is just on the floor begging you to never do that again. You’ll be watching a sad movie with friends and then the big emotional scene will happen and you will feel like crying but you won’t be able too because you threw up the night before and are still dehydrated and desensitized to the pain.  Please just don’t think of trying it again. ",False,False
