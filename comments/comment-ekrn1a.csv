Data gleaned in recent years have shown that opioid antagonists, such as naloxone or naltrexone, decrease the intake of palatable food, whereas opioid receptor agonists, such as morphine or synthetic enkephalin analogues, increase food consumption. Acute administration of morphine and other general opioid agonist drugs increases food intake and weight gain in a naloxone-reversible manner.  I'm not gonna tell you to stop because I know that's super not how habitual substance use works. but do you keep narcan (naloxone) around? if you do, ignore this next bit, but if you're in the US, you can [get it from most pharmacies](https://www.narcan.com/patients/how-to-get-narcan/) without needing a prescription from a doctor. the nasal spray form is really easy to administer and I've seen it save lives, seriously.   hang in there. intense substance use plus ED sounds incredibly rough and lonely to deal with.",False,False
