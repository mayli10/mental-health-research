Never met anyone, don't know anyone's real name, but I think of this sub and wish the hardest for the very best for you all.    I come here mostly when I feel down.  Unlike places like mpa, it feels supportive of those who aren't in a battle to be the lowest weight and struggling with recovery there're people here who actually get what you're talking about. x",False,False

I kinda love how we’re all hard on ourselves but so kind and supportive of recovery to each other. Gotta look out for one another, even if we’re massive hypocrites lol.   This is the only place I’ve felt comfortable opening up about my eating disorder. I’ve been struggling since I was 8 but didn’t get “caught” for lack of a better term until a bad spiral in December. Was in rehab until March but that was just a shit experience. Now I don’t know quite where I’m at but I really like this + the meme sub!  Take care of yourselves pals, I need people to vent and joke with!",False,False

When I have no one to talk to, I vent here.  I love you all.",False,False
