It helps me sort of rationalize any spikes or plateaus I have. (i might still sob on the floor but we don't talk about that)  I did a little bit of googling and it looks like some salt water can actually be helpful for your skin if that can help reassure you any https://www.mamamia.com.au/is-salt-water-good-for-your-skin/  Salt can help bring out and improve flavor but I think some people over-rely on it. Over-salting your food isn't necessarily the norm and I mean everyone has different health needs and concerns so it's totally normal to go light on the salt.   People who have low bp or have meniere's disease are generally told not to limit their salt intake while people who have heart conditions or high blood pressure are told to limit it. You do need some to help balance body functions and electrolytes, it's all about moderation.  I know it's hard to rationalize things though.",False,False
