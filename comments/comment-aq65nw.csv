First week of December I hit a new adult LW, was restricting successfully, had great energy. Finals week ended and I gave myself one ‚Äúcelebratory‚Äù lax binge - that was the start of the reckoning but I was able to get back on track and lose almost all the weight and got back close to my LW again.   Visiting my family was so triggering, I restricted intensely during the day/overexercised and binged at night. That was 5 days. When I got back I was so mentally exhausted I ended up b/p for a week straight and I gained so much.. January was a rollercoaster of fasting for 3/4 days, then b/p. Repeat, repeat.   I‚Äôm finally able to restrict again but it‚Äôs been so stressful this semester so far, I used to never go above 300/400 a day and lately either I fast or I struggle to stay under 1,200 on a good day. It‚Äôs become so hard to feel in control again. Losing at a GLACIAL pace.. ugh. ",False,False
