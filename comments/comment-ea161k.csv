The doctor could have considered what time of day it was, but I don't think it was wrong of her to point out she's approaching that 25 mark, especially if she has gained since the last visit. More doctors should point this out to people, because most have no idea where overweight/obese starts, especially in America as most people are overweight and think it's normal because so it everyone else.",False,False
