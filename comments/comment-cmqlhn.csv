An email, or a letter might help. I think I need to be direct with my parents to really get across how serious this is, but I know they‚Äôd be willing for me to get counselling. I might write a letter beforehand and even thought I want to say it in person, at least I could just read the letter out. Thanks for the help!",False,True

I don't think its a bad idea to do this in person, but make sure you emphasize how debilitating this is for you and give them solutions up front. It will be overwhelming to hear that you are struggling, so approaching them with an idea like seeing a therapist or going to a treatment center will help guide the conversation.  My dad is very logical, so I literally had to say, ""I'm struggling with bulimia and it interferes with my quality of life. I would like to go to X treatment center, will you support that?""",False,False

I literally just told my mother everything last week and I don't have a ton of advice but maybe this thought will help:  Don't try to predict how they'll react or feel; instead just anticipate how YOU will feel after getting it off your chest!  Sometimes people's initial reactions to big news can be out of character, and they may instinctively try to downplay things - not necessarily because they don't care, but because they've only witnessed the tip of the iceberg.   I think I got pretty lucky in my situation but she still said a few problematic things out of ignorance. These things can be improved on, though.  So just anticipate speaking your truth, and the relief that can come from that. You may get a reaction of immediate support and love...or one of confusion and ignorance. But that's only the first reaction and, with time, people become more receptive!  I wish you all the luck in the world ‚≠êüíñ‚≠êüíñ‚≠êüíñ",False,False
