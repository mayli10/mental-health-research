I used to live in AZ and the weather in these two states just makes me want to shoot myself. A little while ago I had to run 2.5 miles for this fitness final we had (I'm still in high school), and I could feel that I was going to have that similar situation you're describing. Gladly enough I had powerade zero right after the run (we still had strength tests afterwards-- dreaded pull ups and such). If you're feeling better (I assume you are), I'm glad! Please stay safe. When I really need to exercise and move I usually just do fitness blender in my room, as going outside really just bothers me and I really hate being seen running ):",False,False

I had a similar episode-  * I had b/p’d twice (and my ED brain is scared of drinking water after purging which is.... so dumb SO dumb) * endured a shitstorm because of lax * then my dumb ass decided I need to go to the gym to burn off remaining cals I couldnt get by purging * Did some cardio, felt lightheaded af and nauseous, tongue literally so dry and thick and stuck to my throat  * Tried to do my normal weights schedule and damn near passed out which was incredibly dangerous  Never again hooooly shit",False,False
