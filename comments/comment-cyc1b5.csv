It calculates a whole load of different things but interestingly what I have found is that my Apple Watch calorie calculations are the closest to reality, based on projected weight loss vs actual (I also project weight loss based on BMR, BMR + exercise, TDEE and TDEE + exercise, with exercise calories taken from Apple Watch workouts). I didn't expect that result.",False,False

Your TDEE will include an additional 50-80% depending on how active you are, putting your TDEE somewhere between 1560-1959  To find their TDEE, a lot of people will calculate it as if they were sedentary (so BMR + 50%), and then manually add on calories burned through exercise.   TDEE/BMR are just guidelines though, its really hard to get actuate numbers for these things through averages and online calculators as there are a *lot* of factors at play that just cant be adequately accounted for",False,False

If you want to lose more than a kilo, just times 7700 by how many you want to lose.  You could also do this is lbs (3500 calories per lb) but the math gets weird with the imperial system and the lb/oz conversion isnt as clean as kg/g. Also, I like working in kilos better because with lbs, small changes are super noticeable",False,False
