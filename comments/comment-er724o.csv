I feel obligated because I spent too much on some dumb fancy lettuce, and also when you’re full of veggies it helps stop to b n p cycle. Bonus points if you go to an actual cashier who has to pick up/‘judge’ your choices...that helps me not buy a bunch of bullshit at the store. Good luck!",False,False

I always full blown binge when I have easily accessible junk food to grab whenever I’m hungry. It’s so convenient to just reach into a container and mindlessly eat. I found that my binge cravings go away when I take time to prepare, measure, and cook actual foods. It makes me wait and really think about the meal, plus a home cooked meal is so much tastier. I haven’t binged since New Years and my cravings have been so much less intense, even with PMS!",False,False

Most of the time I eat it all before I can throw it out but I have thrown some out before. Then I don't go to the grocery store until I absolutely have to (easy for me since I hate leaving the house) and when I go i don't even *look* at the snack isles.   Someone else said eat a real meal. That helps me too, usually something with meat, a sandwich is my go to when I feel like I'm about to binge bc I get meat, bread, cheese, and some vegetables so it's very rounded. I only buy low calorie bread so I don't feel guilty about eating it when I do.   I drink a lot of water and sometimes go for a walk.   Get some healthier bingeworthy foods to keep around the house like fruit or vegetables so when you need to just go in there and eat, you can eat something that's actually good for you like a piece of fruit.",False,False

If all else fails take a moment to sit and breathe. Slowly.  You're in control.  You can do this.   We're here for you ♥,False,False

Like snacking is cool but get in 3 solid satiating meals that include a moderate amount of carbs proteins and fats. Also drink beverages throughout the day. I've been where you are now and I know it sucks. Sending good vibes your way shawty &lt;3,False,False
