This us exactly what I'm doing/going through right now haha  I think I'm with him because I don't like myself, and he obviously doesn't like me enough either, so if I can get him to like me, I can get me to like me. I know it's irrational but.. I can't help myself.  On the other hand, I decided to start going on dates with other people, because we're not exclusive and why wouldn't I? Maybe I'll actually meet someone nice.. and he's for sure hooking up with other girls.",False,False
