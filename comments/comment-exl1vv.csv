It’s helped me SO much, I’m actually shocked at how well it’s been working for me.   I think that you should tell her that you want to work on your ED and where/when it started so that you can get the thoughts/habits under control. I’m still trying to figure out what’s working for me in terms of my ED, but communication is key in the meantime and I’ll let you know if I find anything that really worked.   Best of luck to you, I think it’s really great that you are reaching out for help and that you want to recover. It’s an amazing step forward that not everybody can take, and it’s incredibly brave.",False,False
