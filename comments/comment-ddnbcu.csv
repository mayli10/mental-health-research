Family issues always trigger it for me too. I was recovering, doing good... And then my mama told me my dad is being awful again. I was already struggling with my brother and I went to vent to her about it (my dad loves my brother more than anyone so I don't go to him) and when she was done she told me not to worry, she deleted our texts so my dad didn't get mad at us because apparently he's looking at her texts constantly again. That's what plunged me from recovering and losing weight in a healthy way (1200kcal) to heavy restriction",False,False

I want to be skinny and all that but I honestly think that my ED stems mostly from the fact that as a kid, refusing to eat was my only method of control with my parents. It still is. I feel awful and manipulative but if I lose weight it gets them to listen and care about my feelings",False,False
