I restrict the most when I'm happiest and parts of my ED are extremely effective (but not good) coping mechanisms that get me through each day.   When I was in recovery, I had to accept that I wasn't looking to lose weight so much as deal with the tumultuous nature of existence. I'm not self inflicting myself with evil right now, I'm just coping. Acknowledging that and finding better methods are key parts of my personal recovery.",False,False

They make it seem like once you decide to recover you have to demonize the ED parts of you completely; to look back and acknowledge anything positive about them is forbidden. To me this is nuts. An ED is not a foreign pathogen that infects your brain one day by happenstance; we develop these behaviours and persist in them because they are on some level beneficial, somehow comforting. The harms definitely outweigh the benefits, but to act as though there are no benefits at all and there never were is wrong and counterproductive imo.",False,False

I think most recovery-related IG accounts are godawful. A lot of toxicity on there.   However, there are other recovery-related spaces that are great. I am part of an online recovery forum that was born from an old pro-ana community back in 2006, and honestly... it saved my life. I don't know where I would be without the people on that forum. I met my best friend on there.   So yeah, I think it really depends on where the community is. I think r/fuckeatingdisorders is great, and I still love the forum I referenced earlier, although not many people go on there anymore.",False,False

I think the endless motivational quotes were the final straw.    I agree with you.   I know that for others they appear to be helpful or supportive or whatever you can take from watching someone in recovery, but I'd rather do it myself.  Well, apart from this sub which is the only place I genuinely get something from others experiences (which seem more real than ""inspirational"" ig accounts.  I like to give people encouragement and congratulations here because on ig it seems like a cult.  The same accounts follow each other and copy the style of posting and it seems very forced and fake (not saying their recovery's fake).  I never joined any of the support group meetings and don't even know anyone else in real life with an eating disorder.  I like to get on with it quietly, lol.     Good luck to them, but ig is like facebook where people only show a snapshot of what they want you to think their life is.  When certain people post videos of themselves dancing around saying ""Weee, it's fun to gain weight"" (actual event), I'm just...nah, you're struggling and there's no shame in that.",False,False

I think it all the time but am scared people are gonna shit on me as soon as I say a single negative word about these people but I‚Äôm with you on all of this. I feel like the online ED community has dichotomised itself into ‚Äúin recovery‚Äù vs ‚Äúnot‚Äù and the latter group is always paraded as this broken mess whilst the former is this brave, courageous, special army of angels who post pics of on insta of rainbow bowls and protein snack bars as some kind of badge of honour.
