And i learned that they only shut up when i am as bitchy or aggro to them like they are to me.

Trying to ignore stuff is my go-to but it’s ok for you to set boundaries with them. I struggle with this a lot, but even something straightforward like, “I’m not interested in discussing weight or diet.” And walk away/ignore them if they persist. I know it’s harder when it’s family and even harder when you’re cooped up in the same house for Christmas! But you are in the right here. Their comments are total bullsh*t. Grrr.",False,False
