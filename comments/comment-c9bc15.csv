Theyve been going off a few every hour, three hours a night, for the entire week. and it makes my dog shake so hard she rattles the bed. tbh i hate fireworks anyways but its extremely annoying that people cant relegate them to one day only, or at least obey the fuckin law and just NOT.",False,False

They're one of my safe foods not only because of nutrition, but because they remind me of my childhood. I hope you're able to find some peace tonight, and I'm so sorry you've been dealing with this kind of inconsiderate bullshit.   To be honest, I like fireworks as a spectacle but for years and years and years and *YEARS* we've all known how horrible they are to PTSD survivors, animals, and people on the autism spectrum (personal experience). We've had silent fireworks for forever! Bottom line, I don't get why people like the boom part. I'm just there for the pretty part.  I kept going outside and going back in trying to smoke one damn cigarette and I kept getting jumpscared by fireworks. It's seriously not fair, even when it IS legal to set them off.",False,False
