I went to Ross and got the cutest pants. They were way cute but definitely too big. So a few days later I go to a different Ross (I‚Äôm wearing them) to see if I can find them in a smaller size or something similar.   I find the exact same brand and size and go try them on. They fit perfectly. I held up my pair next to them afterward and they had like a 3 inch difference at the waist. They both had the exact same size number on them and totally were the exact same pair.   Moral of the story, you really can‚Äôt trust the sizing! The cuts are all completely random sometimes!",False,False
