On top of all of that it is also possible that you do irreversible damage to your body, specifically your digestive tract. You may end up in significant pain for the rest of your life all because you wanted to lose weight in an unhealthy way. I don't say this to diminish the struggle we go through as ED sufferers, but if you're still early in this then at least try to build a habit of losing weight in a healthy way. Make sure you get all of your vitamins, don't restrict below your BMR, and don't overwork your body to burn extra calories. Take your time with this. You may still be able to break free of this all before it becomes too deeply ingrained in your psyche.",False,False

I overshot up to a bmi of almost 23 and that weight has been so difficult to shed.",False,False
