I’m awake sometime after 4 and out of bed between 5 and 5:15 now. Once in the last week I slept until 6:15 after tossing and turning between 4:30 and 5:15 and falling back asleep. I also wake up throughout the night to readjust because my body is uncomfortable.,False,False

And nothing in the world will help me sleep— OTC meds, prescription meds, alcohol. None of those things can even make a dent in my restriction mania.",False,False

I come to full consciousness in the middle of the night, in the kitchen, gobbling down junk food. I think it's my subconscious doing it's 'gotta keep this bitch alive GO GO her guard is down' thing",False,False

When I get to low weights I can't sleep because it hurts, because I sleep on my stomach and side and the worst is on my side because my knee bones just jab into eachother   Idk I feel you tho",False,False
