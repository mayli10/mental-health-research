The app tracks my progress and tells me what what my current BMI/BMR is. It also guesses body fat percentage, which is interesting, although unreliable.",False,False

The batteries didn’t work on my old faithful digital. So I’m using one of those old fashioned 90’s looking ones with the arrow that points at the #.   I’ll do the weight measurement when I get home and bring my scale down to the gym. Hopefully no one in my building sees me lol,False,True
