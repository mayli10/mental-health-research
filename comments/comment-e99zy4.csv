I feel rlly bad but even when looking at models I feel like they look fine and “healthy” kabdkajaljgfuk,False,False

I always see myself in chunks, never as a whole. I get shocked when I see videos of myself moving from dance because all my photos focus on face, stomach, thighs. Interesting how that skews my thought process.",False,True

It's not about seeing yourself unrealistically so much as it's about being hyper-focused in your flaws. It's wanting those areas to be smaller but then they're never quite small enough.  Have you ever seen one of those body maps that shows how your body conceptualizes itself based on nerve endings? So the hands and lips and face and all are massive, because your body is most aware of those parts because they're the most sensitive? Even though you know that your hands aren't actually four times the size of your hips or whatever, you still sort of conceptualize your hands as ""more"" because they're more sensitive.   And it's like that. Like, you look at your body and you see a body. Except you don't, you see pieces. And you look at your stomach and it's a perfectly fine, normal stomach, but there's a tiny bit of fat and you hyper focus on that, you don't go ""that's, overall, a fine stomach"" you go ""hmm, wish that fat weren't there."" And even though you know you don't have a massive balloon stomach, in your mental concept of yourself you *do* have a massive balloon stomach because you're so hyper-aware of that one little spot that it sort of overtakes the whole mental image.  Be careful viewing your body as parts. Be careful focusing on areas, spots. Be diligent about keeping a holistic view of yourself.",False,False
