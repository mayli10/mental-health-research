I'm very active, I think I'm going to try to stick with it for a month and then weigh myself. I cant bring myself to do it any time soon because right now i LOOK like I'm back at my starting weight even though I know that's impossible. Bloating??",False,True

That’s amazing and you should be super proud of yourself for this. I think if you’re not super active, you’ll probably be able to gain a little on that amount, but these things are somewhat variable. You can probably go higher though, since you may not gain very much on 2000. I’m not a professional and I’ve never been in your situation so take my advice with a grain of salt lol  Sending love and good vibes 💕💕💕",False,False
