I felt a bit lower in my general mood, but it was a really slight change and nothing to be alarmed about. But keep in contact with your Dr just in case.",False,False

I’ve been on (and off) lots of psych meds. Some didn’t seem to give any withdrawals but others were awful even with a slow taper. For me Prozac was nothing but Cymbalta was torture. I always recommend people to taper just in case. With Cymbalta I had anxiety, itchy skin, sleep problems, mood problems, migraines, nausea and more.",False,False

But so far I’ve been alright. Actually, I’ve been prescribed the meds primarily for my BED and my cravings or appetite haven’t increased, nor has my control decreased.",False,True

I was fine for a long time, doctor said I still needed it. I was like ""meh he doesn't know shit. I'll just stop taking it."" So I just stopped. A day later, I was in class normally and I got the worst anxiety attack ever. Out of the blue I have this quick overwhelming sensation that I am going to faint. My body jolts and I stand up gasping for air. My body becomes very hot and I experience intense nausea. My heart was racing and I literally felt like it was going to stop.   I still get anxiety, usually as soon as I wake up or at late night, but it's always so random and without a trigger.",False,False

The last time I tried to do that, I got really bad relapses and extreme anxiety attacks/headaches. My doctor told me the dosage should gradually be reduced.  I used to take Prozac at around 20 mg a day, so less than your current dosage. Even with the dosage reduced, I had horrible anxiety attacks, headaches and insomnia.",False,False

If you find yourself feeling any overwhelming withdrawal symptoms or any of the symptoms that led you to taking the meds, then try to slowly withdraw.   I used these Harvard links as references. But talk to your doc too. Maybe if your doc knew his much you don’t want to be on them. My doc said no as well. I did anyway and that could be why I could the withdrawal symptoms. I’m not a doc or any sort of medical professional, so pleas take my advice with a grain of salt.       https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/going-off-antidepressants   https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/how-to-taper-off-your-antidepressant   Ps.

Tbh I’m doing it without my doc because he said he wouldn’t take me off them just yet but I feel ready. I’ve stopped taking them 4 days ago and so far I haven’t had any negative symptoms. Do you reckon they may occur later?,False,True

Coming off of anti-depressants can be a bitch. You can be moody, sleepy, grumpy, tired, not eating, get tons of headaches, your stomach could get upset, diarrhea, constipation , etc.   Better to do these things with a doc. I didn’t. But apparently my symptoms were quite normal. Withdrawal symptoms. It took over a month. I thought I was ok after a month and realized I wasn’t. I started by taking half and cutting off. Didn’t work. So I took half one day and a fourth the next and then half again and a fourth again. Then I went to a fourth one day and none the next. And eventually cut down to none.   The withdrawal sucks but being off them feels better.",False,False

When I was at a high dosage my doc had me taper down, but even that was a fairly quick taper. But not everyone reacts exactly the same, if you feel any adverse effects a call to your doc usually makes sense.",False,False
