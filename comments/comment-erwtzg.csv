I have a new plan though which I got three weeks ago which includes no-cost services if I go in-network. I might ask my college’s health services for a referral to a specialty therapist or health center and see if theres any options.,False,False

I have my intake appointment with the nearby clinic next week and am very anxious about what they want since they said on the phone they think im more suited for an inpatient case but i can't do that at the moment. So outpatient is the way to go i guess.,False,True

Because I recently graduated and the second i finished school the ED just like kicked the fuck in and I havent found anything in my field and have been stuck full time in an office since just gently wasting away. I really wish id gotten help when I had time and could have delayed student loans and just put my education off by a year or a semester to start recovery because ive really gotten myself in a hole here. I dont wanna tell you what to do but god i regret not getting help sooner",False,True

I have a typical 8-5 job mon-fri. I was always involuntarily hospitalized, so they just packed me up and shipped me off. I had to use FMLA. I also had a ridiculous amount of annual leave and sick leave saved up because I never had a reason to use it. With FMLA, you can either freeze or use your annual leave or sick time. I chose to use my time in order to get paid. You just have to ask the right questions. I also pay for long term disability, which helped out significantly. I’m not rich, no real savings or anything, but my paychecks were never any different because I had saved up that time and also invested in long term disability.",False,False

Now I wish more than anything that I was just honest, or even more, I wish any of the adults at my school just pressed harder for me to tell the truth instead of just looking at me a bit concerned. Like when the counselor called me in to ask me about a note I had dropped where I wrote about how much I hated myself and needed to starve myself and wrote down my goal weights...how did I lie my way out of that one???",False,False

Its so hard to figure out where to go. I finally started looking into treatment for the first time ever and god its so grim, again I wish i was in high school again so my parents could take care of all this insurance crap and I was a dependent so there wasn't a financial issue for me.  Right now the only option I have is IOP and group therapies which can do a lot thankfully, but I have a feeling they're going to want to admit me due to my current weight and hopefully I can use my 2 weeks worth of sick time in a couple months for that.

I can’t just put my career and responsibilities on hold for a treatment program. Not to mention that I don’t really want to put myself thousands of dollars into medical debt. I feel like people are more understanding of a teen with an ED but as an adult it’s like they think you just need to get a grip and grow up. Which is dumb but I’m just speaking from experience here. I honestly can’t imagine myself going to my boss to say “hey- yeah, I have an ED and I need time off to get help.”   I know that getting help is an investment into myself and my future. If I keep down this path, the outlook isn’t great. I’ve been down this path 15 years and sadly it’ll probably be another 15 more. But I just can’t afford investing so much time and money into treatment at the moment. And I don’t see myself being able to in the future either. It really sucks. But then I wonder if I did get treatment, would I just relapse anyway? I know that’s not the attitude to have but it’s definitely something I thinks about   The one thing I do know is that this isn’t going away and I can’t “fix it” on my own. I usually recover and relapse about twice/year. It’s a terrible cycle.",False,False
