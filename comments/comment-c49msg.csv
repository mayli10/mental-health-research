It‚Äôs not like (certain) drugs or smoking cigarettes, where you can quit cold-turkey to fight your addiction and be fine. No no no. You HAVE to eat or you die. I have always been so envious of the people who just naturally eat the right amount and don‚Äôt have to worry about what or how they eat. It‚Äôs so ‚Äúsimple‚Äù because all you have to do is eat less, but that doesn‚Äôt take into account that so much of our social life is wrapped up in food. We eat food when we celebrate, when we‚Äôre upset, when we‚Äôre too tired to cook something wholesome. Our emotions are wrapped up in food. I didn‚Äôt realize I was an emotional eater until I started heavy restricting, because suddenly when I just wanted some comfort food, I couldn‚Äôt have it. And that feeling of deprivation made my emotions even more erratic and stressed me out even more!  So yeah. I definitely feel you. It‚Äôs super simple, but it‚Äôs also one of the hardest things I‚Äôve ever battled with.",False,False
