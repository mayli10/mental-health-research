Yeah it's been pretty tough, won't pretend it's always been a pretty journey so far but I don't hate myself &amp; I *think* I'm over the worst. I think think you're probably right in that it certainly won't harm me following the fitbit over some online calculator. Neither are going to be totally accurate anyway &amp; if I gain...meh, that's really the idea I suppose. You know the mind works in weird ways though &amp; I just hit a stall after seeing that stupid number today.",False,True

Sorry you are going through it alone, that must be tough.   Maintainence at those stats isn’t healthy, and you would benefit from gaining but of course I don’t want to lecture you (and I’d be a hypocrite giving the nature of my own disordered eating).  TDEE calculators are estimates - especially the selection of “lightly active”, “exercise 3x a week” etc and of course some take into account your age and sex - that’s why you won’t get the same answers. Plus we can’t really measure exercise like that so they’re pretty stupid.   Stick to your fitbit.  Your calories in will differ everyday and at least the fitbit will update this for you as accurately as possible. For example if you exercised an extra 600kcal one day, and sat on your ass the next day - these two days would not require the same calorie count for maintenance and your fitbit will show that.   Also if you haven’t - update your fitbit goal so it doesn’t give you wrong stats.   For maintenance eat what your fitbit states you burn for each day. So if one day you burn 1600kcal, eating 1600kcal will be maintenance.   The general advice to people is to never go under 1200kcal at anytime, and the majority of the time this is usually higher depending on circumstances.",False,False

My plan is to average what that and my fitbit tells me, as well as track my stats and attempt to calculate it from my own data.   Are you in recovery? Most of weight gain in recovery(and/or when you increase calories for the first time in a while) is actually water weight. I've read some research that it can take a full year before your water weight levels out.   I hope this helps.",False,False
