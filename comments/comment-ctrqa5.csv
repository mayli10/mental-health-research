Are all cannabis product illegal where you are? CBD might be helpful, you can find CBD teas, tinctures, lotions, balms, etc. you might be able to find some solace with that. Or aromatherapy, if you‚Äôre allowed to diffuse in your classroom, could benefit you &amp; your students.

They criticize you (we can‚Äôt even use our phones in class now) and their children are bloody spoilt.   I‚Äôve made a playlist on YouTube to watch instead of stuffing my face.

Smoke tons of weed!!! It makes you forget to eat/you can say you get the munchies &amp; eat a lot at night. Also, ever notice stoners are usually wicked skinny??  It‚Äôs also a great excuse not to have to talk about eating because when I am high I just ramble about whatever and the topic usually changes fast.   2. I tell people I have an undiagnosed allergy/food makes my stomach really upset. I literally just say ‚Äúthat will bother my stomach, I‚Äôll just have some plain steamed veggies‚Äù   3.  If I am going out to eat at any point that day, that is my only meal &amp; when I order I only let myself eat 1/2 of the portion. Then I take the rest home for tomorrow‚Äôs only meal or for my brother.   4.  Stay hydrated &amp; keep busy.
