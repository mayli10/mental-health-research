If you have that much of a trust issue, then they're either not right for you and have given you reason not to trust them, or you shouldn't be in a relationship.   This guy does seem to have some toxic behaviors/reactions, but OP kinda does, too.   In adult relationships, you should not be distrustful of your partner and expect to be able to look in their phone or through their computer or hey, through their journal or diary, for that matter.",False,False
