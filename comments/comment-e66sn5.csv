Not weighing yourself the day of said holiday *feast* is key. I know that shits difficult af. But we got this. I tried it for thxsgiving and I'm glad for saving myself a mental breakdown. Take care.,False,False

I’m thinking of switching to orthorexic instead of anorexic. I don’t know if I can starve myself anymore. It was easier to do when I was skinny fat. I’d read on this sub how people could barely go 24 hours without food and now I get it,False,True

Building muscle can be scary but it's great that you had some sorta peace around the holidays. I was scared before Thanksgiving dinner that I would go full on apeshit but i didn't binge afterwards so that's good. Restricting? Yes. Normalcy? We dont know her.,False,False

I hit a new low last week before Thanksgiving and I’ve been eating normally since. Put on 2 whole pounds and was anxious af about it. But today I was trending down again so I’m wondering if I might have kickstarted my metabolism? Also looking to fast today/tomorrowish... half-hoping that I’ll ‘whoosh’ down to another new low faster than usual.,False,False
