First thing I would say is take away the fear. I am guessing from what you wrote above you know how to KCAL count and understand food.  Don’t worry. You can have a small salad, soup or worst case scenario low carb high protein dish. Balance it out. This shouldn’t be a problem long term. Being a runner you should be able to balance this.   I think what’s really scaring you is the loss of food freedom. It must have taken a lot of strength to decide to have two meals a day. Now suddenly another challenge, eat out twice in one month. Someone else preparing your food twice instead of once and the break up with your BF. Its all a lot at once.   Remember though you are in control. You have decided to change your eating regime. You decide how this will go and no matter how it goes. This is just another life lesson and your more than capable of learning.   I can’t really advise you, just try and add a little positive affirmation.   Just remember sometimes it feels like everyone is looking at your plate and watching the movements of your knife and fork but in reality people are so self-involved if you only eat a few mouthfuls, they wouldn’t even notice.   Your in control. You are confident and this will come and go. Take the positive from being able to eat 2 meals a day. A little extra mileage can fix two dinning out experiences, feel comfortable in you.   Remember pressure is how diamonds are made. Millions of years of pressure. If you can with stand this pressure, when it is all over you will be sparkling and tough.",False,False
