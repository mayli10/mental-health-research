So if you consistently overeat, the calories you ate are already absorbed... that doesn't change with using laxatives. Those just serve to flush out your body quicker. So you get rid of water weight and the weight of however much poop is in your body, but once food turns to waste, those calories are absorbed, the only way to keep excess calories from turning to fat eventually is by working out to work them off.   HOWEVER using them every so often CAN get rid of some stomach bloat sometimes, I've found. But I still wouldn't recommend using them unless your dr says it's safe to use to flush yourself out every so often (which is why I started using them in the first place.)",False,False

It's something i picked up just so i can see the scale go down.  Regardless if its actual weight or not i feel great watching that number go down and i feel like shit when that number stays the same or even worse goes up.  Right now I'm taking lax like its some sort of vitamin and i'm using it as a bargaining chip.    Ya i ate 600 cals but you know what i have 2 little friends that say that everything will be ok.,False,False
