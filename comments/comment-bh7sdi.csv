I overheated after about 10 minutes and went down like a rock. I was only out for a few seconds but there were nurses taking my blood pressure and making a huge scene. It was mortifying lol. And my parents kept asking if I had eaten that day (I had a history of skipping meals) but I had literally binged on a bag of Hershey kisses a couple hours before so it definitely wasn't a lack of food lol.,False,False

You obviously didn’t pass out intentionally, and you were doing your best to be there for your friend in their time of need.  This isn’t too too embarrassing, but back when i lived with my parents, I was taking a shower and I guess the heat got to me and suddenly I woke up on the floor of the tub (luckily just a little bruised!) My mom ran into the bathroom because she heard a “thud” and I was trying to claw my way back up when she ripped open the shower curtain and knocked me back over!",False,False

You were actively supporting your friend and happened to have your own health crisis. Passing out is not good. Your friend wants to support you, just as much as you want to support them through the broken fingers. You are no less of a shitty friend for passing out then your friend would be for having been in the hospital with broken fingers and unable to support you when you passed out.  Not quite sure if that made sense. But I think a lot of us hold ourselves to higher standards than others, and it often helps me to try and imagine how I would feel if positions were reversed and try to apply it to myself.",False,False
