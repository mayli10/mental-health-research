My brain tells me that I’m disgusting because apparently there is only underweight and overweight no in between. Black and white thinking is a huge part of my ED, is it the same for you?",False,False

She said something that really helped me: ""It's okay to miss your eating disorder. At the time, it was serving a need of yours and allowed you to not really have to deal with emotions. However, it got to a point where it was not serving you.""",False,False
