The next problem is that those thoughts are convincing so I believe them and act on them. Is it fair to say everything we think is true? Of course not. Oftentimes, I struggle to recognize the eating disorder thoughts to be untrue, so I see a therapist. The therapist asks me to share an eating disorder thought and then challenges me to disprove it.  The end goal is develop a new skill and practice it when I'm alone. So, is it possible to have trouble controlling your thoughts/beliefs AND use evidence based logic to challenge them simultaneously? You betcha. Does challenging a thought = problem solved. No. I still have to go through a decision making process. I weigh the pros and cons of each thought and make a choice. All of this is hard for me to do. The easier thing is to give in. I know if I continue to put in the hard work, I will be able use this tool independently. I've already done so a few times :)",False,False
