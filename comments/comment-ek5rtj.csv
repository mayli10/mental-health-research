It creates a broth, just add some seasoning and maybe some noodles or bits of chicken (I guess it depends on what you are okay with eating at the time) and boom! Homemade chicken noodle soup. It also makes a lot more than a can, and can be cheaper too. You could also add different veggies like onions, peas, carrots, etc.  I absolutely love cooking, so I’ve learned a lot of things to help myself feel okay about eating things. I’m also really poor, so I have to make sure I pick things that can be cheap, and making homemade soups are usually under 10$ or maybe slightly more, but make a lot of it. It also can be really therapeutic (at least for myself) to make things that you enjoy. It also makes your house smell really good when it’s cooking! I hope this helps!",False,False
