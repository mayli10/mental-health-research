She tells me exercise is important for depression and anxiety. For me, depression and anxiety cause my ED.   I have never excessively or obsessively exercised, and I donâ€™t anticipate that happening.   So I think it comes down to knowing yourself.  I think it can be incredibly beneficial if youâ€™re not the type to take it to the extreme.",False,False

Itâ€™s totally possible to exercise in a healthy manner but itâ€™s less like at the beginning stages of recovery that itâ€™ll truly be healthy and for pleasure rather than an eating disorder behavior or something to mitigate hard feelings.

When it was warmer, i would walk on bike trails near the river. Super relaxing and great low impact activity. Yoga and pilates are fun low impact but strength building activities that I like to do as well.   Good luck in your journey! Take it one day at a time. ðŸ’œ ",False,False

The only exercise i can think of that i enjoy and won't get obsessed about burning calories over is football but the training doesn't start for another couple months. With that being said i think i might try walking for 30 minutes some days. Not too strenuous and i don't mind going for a walk with some music playing and because it's not an intense activity i don't think i would stress much about burning.",False,True

I was doing hour long yoga sessions and bike ride several times a week on less than 500 cals. (Def not fun or safe). Now I exercise five times a week for only thirty minutes. I find thatâ€™s enough to keep my ed satisfied ~~for now lol~~.  But, I actually wouldnâ€™t recommend exercising while attempting recovery if you are just beginning. You donâ€™t want to trade one disordered habit for another!!! One thing I heard in treatment that will always stick with me is: *any activity you can do for thirty minutes without any rules or rituals tied to it, is an activity you actually enjoy versus being fueled by your ed*. So, if you wanna exercise and would be okay with doing that for only 30 minutes and not be obsessed with how much youâ€™re burning, then I would go for it! If not, wait til youâ€™re a bit further in your recovery journey imo. ",False,False
