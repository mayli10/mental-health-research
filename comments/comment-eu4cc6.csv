Either youtube videos or guided workouts from a free app. There’s bodyweight strength training. Stretching, and yoga. Outdoor activity depending on the weather.   Rest days and lower intensity days can also be really excellent for my body and help me avoid injury, though I relate to feeling intense emotional need to get my HR up and log ‘real’ exercise. Fwiw, to cope with acute anxiety, certain grounding and self-soothing exercises help me. Best wishes. The hours will pass and the gym will re-open. It may not feel at all ok, but it can be ok.",False,False

Bought a treadmill a couple years ago, which makes the holidays soooo much easier.   Some gyms offer day passes for non members for like $5. Maybe call around and see if there’s one in your area.",False,False
