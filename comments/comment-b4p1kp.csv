I was diagnosed with anorexia at a healthy weight since I had restricted so much, exercised until I passed out, and was terrified of gaining an ounce (all of that other fun stuff also) and it made me feel like an outcast to people who actually suffered more than me and had an extremely low BMI. Everyone's metabolism is different (mine was really low to begin with, for instance) before they start experiencing eating disorder behaviors. It upsets me how I let my healthy weight define who I am since the ""actual"" criteria to have anorexia is to be underweight, according to the DSM-5. This is also the handbook that said that you had to experience amenorrhea to be diagnosed with anorexia (completely ignoring those who are male) and also having calloused knuckles to be diagnosed with bulimia (people use other methods to purge). It sucks how medical professionals follow this as a guide. You could always explain to him your situation, being open and honest in a relationship is key.",False,False

My BMI is 16.7 so he outweighs me, but he wants me to come up to his weight for my health and told me he wouldn't care if I put on 15kg, let alone 5 or 6.  He's legit such thinspo to me. I can't recognise that I am obvs smaller than him in every way other than height unless I look at photos of us. I feel you - I know it's so hard to believe them, especially with the height similarity hahaha, it's weird how much of an effect it can have on the ED psyche.",False,False

Iâ€™m just scared of bringing up the whole ED thing. Iâ€™m not underweight which makes me feel a little bit invalid (even though I literally purge anything I eatâ€”binge or not) and Iâ€™m scared coming to him with it this early will freak him out.ðŸ˜•,False,True

It's triggering since he likes girls shorter than him, and also because he looks like I could break him in half with my whale-of-a-body. When I see him, it makes me want to restrict heavily. I get your situation entirely. You should try talking to him about your struggles and how you definitely need more support from him. You could also start a new hobby together (pls dont kill me, I know it sounds cheesy) like going to the gym, taking hikes, walks, or something that will get your mind off of it. ",False,False
