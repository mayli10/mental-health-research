I remember when my parents thought it was a phase too. This stuff doesn‚Äôt go away. If you want help, don‚Äôt listen to her and get outside help. Parents are too old school to understand mental health sometimes.   As for tour clothes, it‚Äôs ok to give them away or sell them. It‚Äôs not admitting defeat. Keep your most favourite clothes. But just get new ones if/when you lose weight again.   From my experience, I kept skinny clothes for YEARS. By the time I fit into them again, they just weren‚Äôt in style anymore. Plus there were new things I liked and wanted. It was nice to keep my favourites. But most clothes were just a waste of storage space",False,False
