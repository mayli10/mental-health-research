But some doctors are real hesitant to push an ED on people who they arent sure have self Identified yet. She doesnt know if you identify with having an ED so she is giving you gentle nudges and asking for information asking if you want to eat something after almost passing out and you refusing gives her a hell of a lot of info but may make her hesitant to just confront you then and there so she softball confronted you by asking you about when you last ate and if you wanted to eat anything.,False,False

We talked abt the stuff we needed to discuss (i see her for my physical disabilities, not ED stuff) and came up w a solution. I just had a lil hope she might notice how badly i'm doing mentally. My ED is super externally motivated most of the timeâ€”i want my self-destructiveness to be visible so others can see it.",False,True

It could also be that i haven't visibly lost as much weight as i thought. It's also been over a month since i last saw her, so maybe she couldn't compare to see the difference bc it's been so long.",False,True

Maybe she was distracted by something difficult from the night before. Or she did notice and was really nervous to say the wrong thing and make you feel even worse.  I find myself always making up a story to prove my assumptions right. But usually there is another story that is just as plausible that would prove me wrong too. I am sorry the appointment didn't go the way you expected. But you deserve the help, attention, and patience you need to get better as soon as you feel ready. In the end good for you for going to the doctor. That is scary enough on it's own and you did it even when feeling down.",False,False

But it has been getting a lot worse, and i haven't told her how much worse. I was kinda hoping she would just pick up on it, lol  But yeah, that makes sense",False,True

But with the sensitivity a lot of people with ED's have of not wanting to really be noticed or pressured she probably lobbed you a softball couple of questions to get you thinking. If she went full on I think you have an ED and need help in 1 visit she might feel like you would get scared and never go back. I am 100% sure she knows you have an ED any doctor in there right mind would be thinking that with what you just posted.,False,False
