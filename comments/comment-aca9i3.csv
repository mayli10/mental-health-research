Met her in treatment, we‚Äôre both relapsing right now. I decided for the new year I‚Äôm going to try to eat 3 full meals a day and I told her and she was sooo happy and supportive and I‚Äôm worried it‚Äôs because she knows I‚Äôm going to be the fat one now.

Because this person is such a revered mind-reader/psychologist that he can determine the ‚Äúseverity‚Äù of two completely different manifestations of a category of ***mental illness***.  I‚Äôm sure he was thorough and v scientific.  *And* is so wise that he shares his ‚Äòfindings‚Äô with one of his examinees..? üôÑ Agree with the above commenter. ‚ÄúShining example.‚Äù  Also, yeah, anything you overthink and allow to seep into your self-esteem or identity security will definitely impact your mood AND behavior, if it keeps rolling like that. #speakingfromexperience?",False,False

Comparing suffering is a terrible exercise. What does ‚Äúworse‚Äù even mean? That they are hurting more? Someone else‚Äôs pain being a 10 does not make my 8 feel any better.  To me, being told these sorts of things feels very invalidating, which is a huge trigger for me. Sometimes it sparks something in me along the lines of ‚ÄúI‚Äôll show you how much *worse* things can be...*then* you‚Äôll see me/understand me/be sorry...‚Äù  But you don‚Äôt have to be ‚Äòworse‚Äô than some benchmark to deserve whatever you are longing for.",False,False

I ended up having to sacrifice an entire friendship with a girl I cared about very, very much because she was recovering and I was not and every time we hung out she'd make comments about how skinny I was and how jealous she was and how she wondered if recovery was worth it. I was a trigger, so I removed myself from her life. She's doing great now and I really look forward to trying to repair our relationship once I'm better, too.   It can be so comforting to be around someone who really understand what you're going through but then there's that nasty side that isn't good for either of you.  I hope this works out for you two.  Oh and BTW what your mutual friend said was incredibly insensitive and you have every right to be upset. It's a shining example of people being ignorant about mental health issues. I suggest talking to him about it to avoid future remarks of that nature for the benefit of all involved parties. ",False,False

Around summer of last year she started loosing weight and is now thinner than i am (shes also taller). I don't know if she has an ED like i do but my mind always thinks she might.. that or crazy self control that i lack. Anyways i cant help but hate myself after meeting with her or seeing her update a picture of fb. Its stupid and juvenile.. i am a grown ass woman, i shouldn't do this kinda shit anymore! When a mutual friend of ours told me shes just super picky about her diet and exercise i almost lost it. Restricted like crazy for a few days then binged/purged and felt even worse about myself.
