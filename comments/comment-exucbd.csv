Possible - I suggest eating some liver if you used to like liver. I do wonder if it could somehow be a fat deficiency. If you don't have a lot of fat on you, it's not as easy to stay warm unless you eat a lot of fat. I should follow my own advice because my hands are getting cold too.",False,False

I suppose I will just have to start layering but I hate looking bigger. I want people to notice I‚Äôm too skinny for the validation. üòï,False,True

I‚Äôm told a lot of this has to do with an iron deficiency- so just 3/4 cup of bran flakes (90cal) can really help.   Outside of that? I‚Äôve been wearing double layers all the time. It also helps the ‚Äúpeople are noticing I‚Äôm too thin‚Äù problem because I look bigger,False,False
