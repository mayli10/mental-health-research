I’m almost embarrassed I’m still drinking them as an adult but they’re easily one of the tastiest bubbly soda type drinks imo. I haven’t really noticed they’re an appetite suppressant for me - just tastyyy.,False,False

This will make me sound like one of those ""I LIKED THEM BEFORE THEY WERE COOL"" assholes, but I've been drinking them FOREVER. I remember when the white flavour came out and I was so excited because it was the only ""mainstream"" energy drink available with no sugar where I live except for Xyience.   The appeal for me is that (1) I like caffeine, but hate the taste of black coffee. So I like to get my caffeine in somehow. (2) I genuinely love the taste of them (specifically, the red and blue, I actually don't like the white \~that\~ much) (3) I have never ever ever drank liquids with calories other than alcohol, especially sweet things. I know some people hate the taste of artificial sweeteners, but I've been drinking/eating them so long that pop and juice with real sugar is just WAY too sweet and makes me teeth hurt.  So basically, I can't speak for other people with EDs, because I started drinking them while I was actively in recovery and continued to do so for non-ED reasons when I was in recovery. It hasn't changed now that I've relapsed; I drank them before my relapse and I still drink them now. My consumption of them is directly related to how tired and stressed I am, haha. Right now I'm on about 2 a day because my Master's thesis is due in two weeks.",False,False
