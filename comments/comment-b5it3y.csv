It’s horrifying and I don’t recommend it obviously. I lowkey wish purging was a more traumatic process for me, but it really isn’t.   OP, your habits aren’t any weirder than the rest of us, and I hope you can get to a place where you don’t need them anymore b",False,False

Even if you're not using your hands or a tool to make yourself throw up your food, it's still purging. I've heard of quite a few bulimics who are able to throw up without hitting their gag reflex - I'm able to do it to some extent, and I have diagnosed bulimia, for example.  I hope this gives you some insight and I hope you can overcome it. Good luck!",False,False

Sounds like plain ol' bulimia to me.      *The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders* (DSM-5) includes the following diagnostic criteria for bulimia nervosa:  * Recurrent episodes of binge eating. An episode of binge eating is characterized by both of the following:    * Eating, in a discrete period of time (e.g., within a two hour period), an amount of food that is definitely larger than what most people would eat during a similar period of time and under similar circumstances.    * Lack of control over eating during the episode (e.g., a feeling that you cannot stop eating, or control what or how much you are eating). * Recurrent inappropriate compensatory behavior to prevent weight gain, such as self-induced vomiting, misuse of laxatives, diuretics, or other medications, fasting, or excessive exercise. * The binge eating and inappropriate compensatory behaviors both occur, on average, at least once a week for three months. * Self-evaluation is unduly influenced by body shape and weight. * Binging or purging does not occur exclusively during episodes of behavior that would be common in those with anorexia nervosa.",False,False
