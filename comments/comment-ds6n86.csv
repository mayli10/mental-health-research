I am a woman and I grew over an inch after I turned 18. I *believe* (zero fucking evidence) that my growth was stunted during my teens due to my ED (I didn't grow in height at all from 12-18), and then when my ED shifted and I was eating and keeping down nutritious food on the reg, I shot up a bit.   I've read about this happening to others ED'd women.   This is all anecdotal and may mean jack shit.",False,False
