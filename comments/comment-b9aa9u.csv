If I don’t and they’re still there, I just add them onto the next and I rarely eat them all but I still lose very easily. And most importantly, it helps to prevent those random reactive zone-out binges from days of trying to stay under 1000 and stuff.   It’s kinda the same concept as a weekly calorie count instead of daily - our body doesn’t know that 12am marks a new day, and our body will use energy all the same. Sure, you’ll probably lose faster if you stay under x unhealthy everyday but you’ll just end up maintaining when / if you break down and have a binge streak. Trust me, I did it for months.
