Because I knew that if I binged, I'd just keep repeating the cycle, no matter what I told myself at the time.   Didn't quite hit the UGW before I gave up due to brain fog and exhaustion, but didn't binge, and the rest of the plan is going ok so far.  :p ",False,False

I decided to binge one night when I was 4 lbs away from my UGW. Then I binged the next day and the next day until I was 7 lbs higher than my original starting weight. This was a little under two years ago.,False,False
