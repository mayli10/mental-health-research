My mom: ""Do you want to eat some potato gratin?"", ""Should i make us a smoothie?"", ""I'm baking *my favorite cake which is already in the oven*"". WITHIN 3 MINUTES. FUCK THAT KILL ME I CANT HANDLE THIS ANY LONGER. I know she means well and she's so sweet but i'm done. Just so done.",False,False

I'll litterally be in the middle of eating my plate of food and he'll tell me to go get myself more. Whenever he offers me food and I say ""no thank you"", he always says ""yes?"" And I'm like ""No. No thank you"" and he'll proceed to ask me at least 2 more times. It used to piss me off so bad that I would never accept his food, because I HATE being pressured to eat when I am not hungry. But I kinda grew up and realized that he was raised kind of differently and he didn't necessarily always get food growing up. Now I feel bad for acting like that, but I still secretly get hella annoyed sometimes tbh.",False,False

Every 5 min my mom is like ""we've still got xy"", ""want some xy?"", ""there's xy, you can eat it tonight"", ""i've made us a smoothie!"", ""let's make cocktails!"", *bakes 2 cakes withing 3 days*, *comes home and immediately starts cooking no matter what time it is* ""we'll eat in 30 minutes! :)""  IT'S SO EXHAUSTING AND I HATE THAT IT MAKES ME SO FCKN ANGRY. I'm sorry you have to go through this too. It's a huge fckn pain. Especially if it's all food that you LOVE but also super super high calorie and only one bite would make you reach your daily limit.",False,False
