I’m in the “healthy” range but my bp is low, my heart rate is 36pm and I’m bordering on anaemic.  nobody would ever look at me and think I’m sick, though.",False,False

Saying that feels like cheating... I am now a ""healthy weight"" but I pass out often. Even if I don't  actually pass out things go completely black and i have to lean on something until I can see again. I'm anemic, low on a lot of vitamins   When I was overweight I was ""healthy"", now I'm ""normal"" and sick. Every time I eat I am anxious and tell myself how fat and gross I am. I can't  eat if I cant measure and weigh the food.I'm trying so hard to be just normal.  I also realize overeating to the amount I was was an eating disorder in itself but at least I could function. This is a million times harder.",False,False

I constantlY feeling invalid. I used to be a constant binge eater and now I jump from binging and restricting like it’s parkour. My resting heart rate is always under 60 and my lowest resting heart rate has been 37.  Even with the numerous side effects of disordered eating I just feel so invalid because I still have so much fat and loose skin and can eat 2-4K calories in one sitting sometimes. But reading your post I am mentally validating you but still can’t admit to myself that I have an ED. Must be an ED side affect. Needless to say you’re not alone and you deserve to recover and be healthy.",False,False
