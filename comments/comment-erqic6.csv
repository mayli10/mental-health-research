Recently I tried “Arctic Zero” and it was a game changer. It definitely doesn’t taste as good as Halo Top but honestly I don’t mind the trade. I believe it was 150 calories for the entire tub depending on the flavour and it’s also vegan so if that’s something you are looking for then this might be good. If you are looking for some more ice cream-ice cream then I recommend Breyers light ice cream although I’m unsure about the calorie count but it’s less than Halo Top for sure.,False,False
