So I was scared when my IBS got bad because I didn’t want the people to know to suspect things. :/   They make laxative teas which I like because (1) less fillers and (2) I can control how strong they are! The pills are too much for me, so I just get tea and strep it for half the time :) If you get something like smooth move tea from traditional medicinals, you can steep it for one minute (it suggests like 5 or something) and go from there. You can also tell your SO that it’s a tea for your digestion! Constipation is not inherently disordered, like self induced vomiting or starvation are. I don’t think people will be watching your every move if you only use them once or twice. A lot of people need them from time to time.   If you start using them all the time that’s a different story...   Have you tried glycerin suppositories? They help when the stool at the end of your colon is hard/dried up, which makes it harder to pass! It’s also no calories/not a food and usually helpful within a few mins. Most people don’t even know what they are lol.",False,False

Oil is a major fear food for me.   I just meant the harder laxatives. Nobody knows I'm disordered. I'm scared if I took a heavy duty laxative, my SO might catch on. Plus the anxiety of going to the store to buy them and then hiding the box.",False,True

Or doing wind relieving pose (yoga)? They help my constitution when it’s bad - or if it’s intolerable, wait until your stomach is empty and take a shot of pure olive oil (Add in a splash of orange juice if you need help stomaching it). You’ll be going in NO time.   Also- most detox teas ARE laxatives! Scary, but be careful about the ingredients in there.   May I ask why you’re scared of laxatives? Miralax is technically a laxative if my memory serves me right - so is a shot of olive oil! Anything that increases petal stasis or draws water in the colon to increase bowel movements I thought was a laxative!",False,False
