My weight has not changed in the past week. At. All. I’m hoping you’re right about the weight flying off bc I’m just really looking forward to seeing the 120s! It’s been so long!,False,False

I swear to god, the 130’s is plateau *hell*. I was stuck in them for like two months. It’s ridiculous.   But then when you break that plateau, holy shit, the weight flies off. It felt like no time at all between the 120’s and 110’s. It’s nuts. Probably psychological, but nuts either way.   So hold on tight. Your body is doing the best it can do- the human body is both crazy complex and stupidly inefficient. Don’t hold it against yourself if things slow down. Everything about weight loss is unpredictable and annoying, even depressing at times. But you’re stronger than to let it get you down! You will get to where you want to be, whether it takes extra time or not.",False,False

I know it’s frustrating to see how long it will all take but you will get to where you need to be even if it’s later than you wanted. The most important thing is to keep yourself safe, so please make sure if you’re doing this that you regularly see a doctor!",False,False
