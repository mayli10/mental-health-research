I have hypothyroidism and I'm convinced that even with medication, it f'ed my metabolism badly. I cant lose if I eat 1200. I have to eat 800 consistently to start losing weight. I'm so sick of everyone being like ""nooo thats not healthyyyy"" I just started lying if anyone asks about calories.  &amp;#x200B;  If I round 800 up by 30% though that's like 1040 so I'm probably eating more than I realize.",False,False

Especially meats. The rule of thumb is +\- 30% of the calorie count displayed.   If you look at the history of a product, I did this with some bobs red mill stuff, it varies slightly from season to season. I suspect it depends on the fact they keep sending samples to a lab to test. I kept looking for the highest fiber, lowest net carb coconut flour and found like 5-6 different nutrition labels for the same product.",False,False

I don't know if this will be any help but I've seen a few videos by Natacha Océane on repairing metabolism. She's from a biochem background and has recovered from EDs so she's really knowledgeable on the science. She actually eats about 2500/day (with exercise) and maintains really well.  I haven't tried her method fully so I can't attest that it definitely works but maybe it could help?,False,False

Anyways, its possible for tdee calcs to be inaccurate but usually because of picking the wrong activity level. its much easier for calories to be mistracked. not to mention eating more after a period of restricting slows your digestion (NOT metabolism) which can lead to bloating, constipation, water retention, and food generally staying in your digestive track longer than it would for a healthy person. its possible you could have a thyroid problem if your tdee really is that low, but you would need a full blood panel from your dr to be able to tell. messing up your *metabolism* /tdee permanently isnt really a thing",False,False

Like everyone preaches CICO but it’s not as scientifically accurate as it’s made out to be and that is absolutely terrifying.
