ESPECIALLY macadamia nut cookies. However, whenever I smell roasted macadamias now I get really, REALLY sick to my stomach. When I was in high school my mom baked four dozen macadamia nut cookies for some charity benefit. She left them out on cooling racks to bake while she showered and I ate two. fucking. dozen. in that less than an hour timespan. I was really upset that day and just binged my little brain out. I had to stay up late and re-bake the ones I ate, and I was sobbing the whole time. Needless to say, shout out to bad experiences bc now they're a big ol fear food :(",False,False
