My great grandmother survived a concentration camp and as a result became quite the hoarder. She married a Chinese man who owned a restaurant. Their kids were taught to cook and eat WELL, lots of sugar and oil and such 'enrichments'. One of them would grow up to marry my grandfather, who also loved cooking and delicious food. Of their 3 children, one has been very restrictive and underweight since she was a teen, and another (my mom) is also very particular about food and struggles with binges. And then there's my sister and I, both on pro ana sites at age 11. üëç",False,False

Generational trauma can be recorded in DNA in ways other than the actual nucleotide sequence, such as methylation and the way the DNA is packaged in the cell. Googling epigenetics and eating disorders brings up multiple [research papers](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28523542) and [overviews](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30353170), especially on [NCBI](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4803116/), one of the best resources for bio/biotech primary literature.

EDs have strong genetic components, as evidenced in part by fraternal vs identical twin studies. Based on studies like this, it's estimated that 58-76% of liability to anorexia is heritable. The numbers for bulimia are 54-83%, and for BED it's 46-72%.  I do feel like I got screwed on the genetic front. My mom had a restrictive ED when she was younger, and still has disordered eating, and her sister is super orthorexic/addicted to exercise. My dad, meanwhile, comes from a family prone to BED, which has made him super fatphobic. He eventually developed a borderline restrictive ED when I was in middle school, and while it got better, he's still goddamn weird about food.   I also recently found out my mom's grandfather was obsessed with nutrition, and had some '60s-era diet book aimed at women that he used as a rigid guide for what foods were ""acceptable"" to eat.",False,False

Like if an older family member has an ED, the way they spoke to and acted around their children could affect them as well.  If your father is obsessed with diets and losing weight and you grow up seeing that then a young child might copy, it might influence how they think. My mum has an abusive boyfriend and his favourite insult was to call her a 'fat cow'. It didn't matter that he was much bigger than her, it cut deep and and hearing that over an over again told me that no matter how 'good' she was, at he end of the day that's all she was worth to him (not true, she's pure gold) and that experienced changed me.   That isn't to say that perfectly healthy families can't have a child with an ED, there are many factors that lead to developing one ut a disordered outlook from your family doesn't help.",False,False
