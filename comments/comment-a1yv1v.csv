She was right on the edge and was trying to kick the last pound or two and is a big proponent of the [Cabbage Soup Diet](https://www.cabbage-soup-diet.com/cabbage-soup-eating-plan/). She did it several times when I was growing up and I literally cannot figure out why it worked (Day 6, I‚Äôm looking at you). I made the mistake of saying ‚Äújust don‚Äôt eat for a few days.‚Äù üò¨üò¨üò¨ I got some weird looks at the family dinner... yikes. ",False,False

Wow, that is such an intense environment to grow up in. It‚Äôs rough to grow up and see your parents as the flawed humans they are.   My teenage BFF‚Äôs dad was a wrestler with a (speculated) ED who would make both my friend and her mom do push-ups as punishments and would plan the moms diet &amp; had a specific weight she had to stay close to. That and lots of other things gave my friend tons of disordered patterns just handed down from family history.   I feel for you that you had to go through all of that! I find it interesting as an adult to look back and see how our parents molded us in fucked up ways.   We just do the best we can! ",False,True

He still suffers, but in that old man way where he can justify going raw vegan because 'health'. And every year I watch him binge/restrict feeling so sad for him. Two weeks ago we went to Whole Foods and I caught him secretly eating cookies while he prepared his raw salad BEFORE we had paid.  There was a grown ass man stealing and sneaking food! We have plenty of money between the both of us so it's not a cost issue. I was so sad for him. He came over for Thanksgiving and c/s on dessert so he could try each pie/cake/sweet.   Growing up he used exercise as a punishment and insisted to weigh me every morning. Money paid to me for losing weight, money paid to him if I gained. In hindsight he did the same shit to himself, so I assume he thought this was a valid parenting method. I remember my mom fighting him about it and he would add minutes to my stairmaster time every time she fought on my behalf, and or took away a meal. When they divorced, she went the opposite way and let me eat whatever I wanted and never, ever pushed me to move. My dad would pick me up and make me get on the scale as soon as we got to his house, the proceed to lecture me about my weight gain ever since my mom was in charge. Both situations from each parent molded my ED into binge/ restrict.   Anyway, IDK what it is about men and EDs - like you know this illness is fucked up when men (generally free from image pressures) are disordered around food and weight. ",False,False

In a way it was great bc it was the easiest thanksgiving ever, and I got to be ‚Äòdiet‚Äô buddies with my mom and bond over ordering large unsweet teas? But on the other hand I just watched the whole week with like morbid humor. The key is I realize my behavior is disordered. My dad, especially, has no introspection to realize he‚Äôs nuts.
