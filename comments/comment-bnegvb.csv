Nevertheless, it's good info for any future time you break a fast.  If what you ate is low carb, the impact will be tremendously lessened, even if it breaks the fast. [I love the example mentioned in this article](https://idmprogram.com/power-comparison-fasting-vs-low-carb-fasting-26/) : the measured insulin response is already reduced by ~70%, in comparison between a standard diet and complete fasting.  On the other hand, I've myself fallen into the trap of binging because I had some carbs more than I could count. If that's your case, the method I'm trying right now is to eat again with proteins + fat, as opposed to gorging on 2kg of chocolate; this is so I can feel satiated and then fast again.",False,False
