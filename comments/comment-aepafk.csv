And in any case, I'm halfway through a mini-cut and feel ok now. I feel in control again, and confident in myself that I can gain weight and get jacked, not fat.

I was super stressed and depressed so I used a soap and glory bath bomb, had candles, wine, weed, and Lizzo and Janelle Monae playing. It was so good that when the water went cold and Iâ€™d exfoliated so it was gross, I just drained it and refilled it with a lush bath bomb and stayed in for ages. If I ever have my own house Iâ€™m absolutely getting one of the baths that cycles the water to keep it hot. I was so pruney. Yesterday I also did a fun manicure and pedicure.    It was soooooo good. I had been feeling so shit even though I had good news, it really chilled me out and relaxed me.    After this weekend when my boyfriend visits I think Iâ€™ll have a 2 week T break from weed. Iâ€™ve been just caning it recently due to anxiety and depression but hopefully a break will help whilst Iâ€™m fasting. ",False,False

Sheâ€™s lovely and seems to be great at what she does but sheâ€™s a locum and is only there temporarily. A shame really.   A lot did get done, though. She wants to put me on an antidepressant but also wants to speak to my neurologist as she doesnâ€™t want it to adversely affect my epilepsy and lower my seizure threshold. I have a lot of respect for her based on that she isnâ€™t putting me on anything mindlessly. Sheâ€™s also going to chase up the referrals to two places Iâ€™ve been referred to for therapy and should call me back on Wednesday afternoon with everything.   Bonus points for asking me what Iâ€™d like MH professionals to know about autism when I said the lack of understanding regarding autism in MH services is unacceptable.

Weâ€™re celebrating my birthday in advance bc a friend of ours is having a major major surgery and sheâ€™ll be in recovery then so Iâ€™m buying pizza and junk for everyone.
