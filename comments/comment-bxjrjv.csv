I so relate to your experiences. I get anxious when the timing of things doesn’t mesh well with my eating times and I have unfortunately let that get the best of me and have missed out on some opportunities and fun things because I felt like I needed to stay home and control when I ate. Lately I just pack my food with me. I used to feel weird about it but it helps me be able to go out and try new things if I know I at least have control over my food. I also feel like sometimes eating is all I do/accomplish during the day and it’s what I look forward to most. If I just tried to listen to my hunger cues I might never be hungry, so what would I structure my day around? I’m sorry you are going through this but it’s kind of nice to know other people have similar feelings to mine. Best of luck :)",False,False

I recently moved across the country with my bf, graduated with my bachelors and quit my job. I’ve been lucky enough not to have to work for the last couple of months, so I’ve essentially been waking up, watching Netflix, and going to sleep at 4am every night for six months now. I feel useless and lost, and I’ve recently relapsed because of what I’m assuming is an identity crisis paired with a need to feel accomplished in something (starving and being skinny).  Volunteering has helped me a LOT. I haven’t gone recently but when I was going it really helped me feel useful and happy and accomplished. Find a library near you and start reading. I’ve gotten into coloring books which is a nice way to spend time. Maybe take a class at a community college if you can afford it! The world is your oyster.  By the way, your ending sentence is lovely and I’m going to use it now. I hope it’s sunny where you are, too &lt;3",False,False

The lack of direction that I mentioned. I know that even doing laundry could possibly count as something of value, but then again ugh. I fail to commit? Like I am also afraid to take up anything, so like when university tasks end I am like ""I don't have ANYTHING TO DO  OH NO "" when the reality is that I am probably just afraid to take anything up? FFS i overcomplicate everything, I am sorry.",False,True
