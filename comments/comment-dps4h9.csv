I don't have cake every meal, but like, I would opt for 500 calories of chicken tenders for my omad instead of a larger portion of boneless skinless chicken breast and steamed broccoli for the same calories. I try to keep protein in my diet because I have fitness goals, otherwise i would probably just be eating cereal all the time",False,False

I‚Äôll honestly socially eat unhealthy food that is perceived by the public as specifically too unhealthy to have in a large quantity more easily than commonly loved not-the-most-healthy-but-acceptable large meal foods - to put that in perspective, a pizza slice or half a burger may have similar calories to a cake slice or donut but the former more often involves people acting like there is something wrong that I ate so little of it and complain about how I need to eat more so they don‚Äôt feel guilty about their portion.
