Desordered eating signs they won'ttry to hide, they talk out loud about their behavior and how they wish they were skinnier. Or like ""Oh, I get full SUPER easily"" b. Sign's they try to hide but I catch right away cause hmmmm... been there done that",False,False

Like straightup follow people (really just strategically plan my route to walk past them as often as possible... But creepy AF) to see what they buy because I neeeeeeed to know if they are also going to stand in front of the peanut butter for 25 minutes hemming and hawing whether the cost and calorie count is worth buying the powdered bullshit instead of the delicious Jif. I've probably really fucking upset some poor Ana girl trying to buy her safe foods in peace but there is just some whale that keeps running into her in every single aisle and looking pensively into her basket. I can clock a binge at 10,000 paces because I know your skinny butt isn't just casually munching on some Oreos and Doritos and maintaining that frame. I feel like 25% of the time I leave the grocery store I'm thinking to myself ""the world is a really sad place when you know where to look.""   So yeah. Spotting ED behaviours in the wild is like... My thing. My ex husband knew about my ED (or knew that I had previously had one... Totally oblivious to relapses) and so I was comfortable enough to point out all the ways I could tell a girl (I'm only superhuman at spotting it in thin girls because I zone in on girls with bodies I'm jealous of) had an ED. ""Yeah that girl read the nutrition facts of 3 different types of jam"" or  ""she's checking out with about 500 Kcals of food and keeps tapping her collar bones"" or ""she has 2 boxes of laxatives and stopped at the pharmacy for bronkaid"" or "" she has a basket full of junk food and her face is puffy and red and her eyes are bloodshot"" he would never notice ANY of this by himself and it always just made me feel like the rainman of body dysmorphia.",False,False
