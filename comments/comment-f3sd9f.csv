Many people recovering from a restrictive eating disorder will go through periods of hypermetabolism related to refeeding, and often need a higher number of calories to gain or maintain weight. Hunger cues are pretty fucked at this point, and you really can't trust your own signals of hunger/fullness, so I'd say episodes of eating ""too much"" are common and explainable given the circumstances.   I think this restriction-related ""binging"" is different from the out-of-control-over-eating type binging that happens in other eating disorders (not AN).   A lot of people in this sub talk about binging, for whatever reason, or no reason. It seems like something most of us struggle with or have struggled with at some point in our disorder, whatever that may be.",False,False

I mean I speak as someone with diagnosed AN and I definitely do, although it's not particularly regular and I know what I'm calling ""binges"" are smaller in quantity to what some with BED might define as a binge - for me it's more the completely losing control element than the calorie intake (although that's a factor obvs). I think if you starve yourself for that long it's not surprising that your body drives you to binge when food is available - most people (including me) will snap at some point. And I feel so utterly shit after it, it would be good if it was recognised more as a part of restrictive EDs so it didn't make you feel so invalid in your diagnosis.",False,False

I binged a lot after my diet, but I don't have binging disorder since it was caused by a lack of calorie intake and is not a regular thing. I've been binge free for about half a year already simply by allowing myself to have a small bite of something I'm craving. I feel like I piece of shit when I grab a whole ass donut and only have 1 or 2 bites, but it helps keep the cravings at bay and ultimately helps me avoid feeling worse. 1/4 of a donut every now and again is better than 8 donuts at once later on.
