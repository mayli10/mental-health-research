Nothing was ever said.   The opposite actually happened a colleague and I actually began enabling each other. We shared tips on weight loss and cheating the scales.      We would discuss what was better oolong tea, green tea or coffee (for weight loss.) We sat beside each other at work dinners. So we could help each other hide food or help one another deal with the food anxiety or the comments of “is your food ok, are you not eating, are you not hungry.”  We use to both jog together on our lunch break and a rumour even started that we were having an affair. We were two very different people with very little in common except a way of life neither of us chose to live but none the less, lived to our detriment. The things we lost in the fire, I guess.

Obviously parents aren't perfect, but there's a difference between being blind to some subtly odd behaviors, and ignoring blatant signs of distress (such as a slice of pizza causing a breakdown). I don't think you're a dumbass at all for expecting a parent to be concerned about your behavior.  And I get it. It took me a long time to realize that my parents had failed me in this regard. I mean, what did they do when their 11 year old basically stopped eating, started working out obsessively, and lost 25 pounds in two months? They, uh...complained about my keto breath. And my mom just like bitched at me for not eating. And that was it.   They continued to do nothing as my weight declined through middle school. Random strangers were concerned but not my parents. In HS my mom found an abusive letter I'd written myself in an ""ana"" voice and just silently handed it back to me. The fuck? Obviously at the time I was happy to be left to my ED but now I look back and I'm like are you kidding me?   Part of the problem is that my mom has unacknowledged ED stuff, and maybe recognizing my problems would've forced her to face herself, As for my dad, I suspect he was so relieved I wasn't ""turning out fat"" that he didn't want to see that my low weight was a problem. Maybe your parents have toxic attitudes like this, too.  But the other ingredient in my parents' failure? I'm sure it was love. They loved me so much that they just didn't want to believe I was in such dire straits. And like, if your parents are generally loving and attentive, I'd be inclined to say that it's unlikely they flat-out don't care. I'd posit that they care TOO much - they care to a dysfunctional, paralyzing extent.  Either way, I'm so sorry you're going through this.
