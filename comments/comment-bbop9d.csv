That's really brave and inspiring,False,False

I can't go back to this place of regular binging and purging. I know it's going to be hard and I may end up with some of the same problems you are having getting through it, but I'm going to try my best to kill the ED voice, let it die out and push through the days like today when it's loudest. I sometimes get the ana thoughts after binges like this so I'm going to try and stay regulated. Thank you for your response. And I'll definitely check out those channels, they seem like something I need right now.",False,True

I tried recovery for about 2 weeks. I ate a ton but I knew it was extreme hunger and it would pass. I did slow down on the food and ate more normal at the end but I also saw how the weight / water weight was coming on and I went back to Ana and my old bullshit.  That was about 2 months ago and I think about recovery every day now but I’m still scared to gain weight. I know that if I don’t recover that I’ll just be constantly tormented by recovery thoughts but I also know that if I do eat the Ana thoughts will come back instead. I believe that If I actually commit to recovery and just keep going that I’ll kill the Ana voice and finally be able to think about other shit besides restriction and recovery.   I would give recovery another go and remember that extreme hunger is going to happen put it’ll pass.   I found there two youtubers very helpful in understanding the process and being ok with eating.    kayla rose kotecki channel https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCGV3pXwwGVoXu0cqZPI16Kw  Tabitha Farrar channel https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCa7G1P5WQopVMc9qTSP_lgA,False,False
