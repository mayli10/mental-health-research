Potassium chloride in reasonable quantities (1-3 tsp/day) is perfectly safe.  Potassium is absolutely essential for life, and the lack of it can quickly become dangerous,  so if you‚Äôre engaging in behaviour that tends to deplete electrolytes, it would be prudent to find a source for it.",False,False

The overdose threshold for potassium is quite high. I found that out during a few hours of rabid, anxiety-fueled googling one day when I accidentally took a double dose of my daily prescribed 80MEQ/6,000MG.   Here's the quote and the link to it. I saved it in my notes for the next time I lose count and freak out lol-  ""Probable oral lethal dose for humans is estimated to 500-5000 mg/kg [28]. Judging from the animal data and reference [24] it seems fair to assume that the actual value is in the upper region of this estimate.""  http://www.inchem.org/documents/sids/sids/kchloride.pdf  TL;DR: The body does a great job clearing or excess potassium and it's incredibly difficult to actually reach the point of excess with it.   For healthy people and especially for people who have EDs and either don't get enough through food or lose too much via purging a potassium overdose is very unlikely. ",False,False

They are made of potassium chloride.",False,False
