Personally, I’d suggest sitting her down and having an actual discussion about it. I find it easier if I write out what points I want to make the day before or hour or whenever you have a chance to. You gaining weight is something that *you* should control- you appreciate her input, but in the end you need to be the one making those decisions. Tell her how you end up feeling overfull and uncomfortable and that you can’t always keep eating. To me, it even seems a little stressful sometimes if you do end up running around for specific food items. Maybe suggest working together to make a loose “meal plan” with her- let her be involved but not in control. Try your best to talk to her as an equal- you just want some autonomy back for yourself. It sounds like you’re fine with gaining, but it’s something you have to invite her into.   I’ve been in your girlfriends situation- I felt my ex was too thin and unhealthy, and honestly it did upset me a bit because he even weighed less than me and ate much, much less. Wouldn’t even show signs of hunger.   And I ended up projecting. I wanted him to gain, I wanted him to be what I considered “healthier”, I didn’t want to feel larger than him. It was pretty selfish. So I’d ask him to eat, say I wouldn’t eat if he didn’t, brought and bought him so much food he could never eat it all even if he wanted to. I made him weight gain shakes, got him vitamins and supplements, the full monty. And it was very manipulative of me. I was overstepping big time. He never asked for that help, he didn’t *want* to be babied and mothered. He wanted to gain when he was ready to and do it the way he wanted.   So I’d talk to her about it. It’s likely she feels very insecure about being in recovery and is projecting the way I did. Obviously don’t come at her and accuse her of projecting- find yourselves a middle ground. You both clearly care for each other, so I feel like coming together to figure out meals and food together would work out very well. Cook meals together, make little snack plates, date nights to best restaurants, movie and gourmet popcorn nights, etc. I’d personally discourage discussing calories, but if one is going to want to lose or gain, calories are going to need to be paid attention to. That part could be one you keep private.   Y’all sound like you love each other very much. Disorders do put a wrench in that, but it seems you both are stronger than that. No idea if anything I said would help, but just my two cents.",False,False

I was wondering if I should include that part cause I was worried it would come off as bragging, but i felt it was kinda important to understand our situation.  The dietary needs/meal plan thing sounds like a good idea, unfortunately,  my girlfriend is also vegan, whereas I’m not, so that type of stuff is hard, but i’m sure we can figure sth out. thanks for your input! 😁",False,True

If you're trying to gain weight and she's trying to recover, you guys could both plan around your dietary needs and make it a couples thing so you can eat together that way. Also fucking jelly of your metabolism tbh",False,False
