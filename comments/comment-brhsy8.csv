We literally went to McDonald's haha It was shockingly comfortable, seeing as we were two introverted, awkward people with heavy emotional baggage.

It's now been 5 years and I still feel this incredibly strong emotional and intellectual connection that continues to grow stronger. We don't fight or argue, we communicate constantly and never forget how much we love and respect each other. I absolutely believe in soulmates because she's literally it. We are inseparable.
