To me, it’s not about the food itself — it’s the breach of boundaries and lack of respect for your private property. You asked her not to do something and she did it anyway, knowing full well that this is important to you? Come on.   I do think you could use this as an opportunity to practice forgiveness and strengthen your own moral character — resisting the urge to dwell on unkind thoughts, seethe in rage, etc. That’s what I’ve done in response to my own sister helping herself to my collection of cherished belongings. But it is infuriating and you are not in the wrong for feeling upset.",False,False

I used to really judge my sister's eating (her unhealthy choices, disregard for what I considered the ""holiness"" of food) and monitor her diet just like OP seems to be doing. When I got older, I realized she struggles with self control and overeating just as I have, just without the compensatory factor, which is why she's overweight. I feel so much regret for the glares and passive-aggressive comments I made when I was younger.",False,False

Only people with eating disorders hyperfocus on protein bar numbers and other people's eating habits like this. The way your sister is eating is very normal. Eating 1 protein bar a day from what I'm guessing is a communal kitchen area isn't selfish. Now if she was going into your room and taking them and eating them I would feel differently. But if you are in recovery right now you're going to have to practice giving up some of these rigid rules about what is ""safe"" food and not hyperfocus on other people's diets. ",False,False

For them it's an after thought. I know it seems like an atrack but for her it was probably a split second decision she forgot about as soon as she was done chewing.   Either way, if I was you I'd hide the bars in my room or disguise them in some food you know she doesn't like (like in a freezer bag of brussel sprouts or something). If it's common knowledge you're recovering it's not like your family will think your any more weird about food because you're hiding it ",False,False
