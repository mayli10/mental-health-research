We tend to be our own worst enemies. It's nice to hear someone is on our side when we feel like giving in to our self destructive ways. We could all use a reminder to be kind to ourselves. I wish you nothing but the best.,False,False

I'm deep into a downward spiral right now. I find it hard to give a shit about myself. I'm not ready to try to recover, but you.. if you're already on that path, be better than me. Keep on it. There will be obstacles. There will be times where you think you can't keep going. But you got this. I believe in you! We all slip and fall, but you can choose to pick yourself back up.",False,False

Staying in a dead end relationship especially if you're trying to better yourself will only hurt more as time goes on. Don't let him knock you down. Continue to build yourself up. Do it for you.,False,False

You need someone supportive who is going to love you harder through the tough times. Not less. Getting frustrated with your partner happens, but if it makes you question whether or not you love them.. the simple answer is no, you don't. As shitty and as hurtful as that is.. it's good to find that out before it's too late.",False,False

He talked a lot about how ‚Äúhe gets frustrated with me sometimes‚Äù and it makes him unsure if he loves me for the long haul.
