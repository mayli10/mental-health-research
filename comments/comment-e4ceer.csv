I went through a restrictive phase in middle school and I was like... was I skinnier back then? What did I even weigh? Will they even notice? I gained and lost fairly significant amounts of weight throughout our friendship, so do they remember skinny me or fat me?   One of them said I looked really thin though, so internal crisis averted ðŸ˜Ž",False,False

I used to be the skinner one!  Also I met other ppl who know us both and they kept talking about how good he looks now (and I could tell they also noticed I gained)",False,False

I have some friends that have only know me being super tiny &amp; skinny (I am currently obese but losing). They keep wanting to catch up, I keep making excuse because I am too mortified for anyone to see me like this. I mean itâ€™s been years so for all I know they might be obese as well now : /",False,False

Did they mention or seem to act different around you BC of the weight gain? Or more just a reminder in your own brain? Thatâ€™s kind of what I think it will be like for me",False,True

We lived together at my worst (and ""best""). We did not end on good terms one bit, partly bc of my ed... You can imagine how mortified I was to meet them after gaining quite a few (8-10 kg!)  To make things worse one of them was very chubby and used to be my biggest trigger, bc I literally could not eat after watching him eat (a very loud, messy eater, splatters things everywhere, eats four to five huge plates).  Also We were kinda into each other the first two months of living together (he's handsome and I don't mind chub) ANYWAYS, HE'S SUPER FIT NOW AND LOOKS SO GOOD WTF. He has fucking abs now! Looks amazing.  So yeah, fml meeting him for the first time in two years looking so overweight, I used to be the thin one. Relapsed right away hahaahahahafuckme.",False,False
