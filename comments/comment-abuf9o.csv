The texture is nasty, but if you chug then drink another glass of juice it's not so bad. Mixed in a protein shake also sounds super gross, I'd recommend just drinking it on its own. (It's pretty filling so thats a plus I guess??)  &amp;#x200B;  You can also get psyllium in capsule form, but you have to drink like 10 capsules or something and still need to follow it with a lot of liquid. It's also pricier, but it's what I do when I don't want to deal with mixing some of the powder up to drink.  &amp;#x200B;  You might react badly if you take too much (which happens any time you overdose on fibre) so start with the minimum recommended dose and go from there.",False,False

I have taken orange and pink lemonade flavors and they're pretty decent. Just drink it quickly after you mix it otherwise the texture is gross.  Or you could mix the  unflavored with some low calorie juice or water that has been flavored with mio drops.  The protein shake/engery drink combo sounds a little harsh. ,False,False

It's super rare for me to have a normal BM so I have to take an insane amount of pills but for me it's never cramped or bothered me like laxatives. They are the bomb but make sure you're getting lots of liquids to make everything move along nicely. ,False,False

Sounds like a terrible idea. Energy drinks are usually very acidic - which doesn't mix well with protein shakes (esp. whey based).    I drink psyllium daily, but I do mix it with water. You're gonna need alot of liquid and water is just the easiest and doesn't really upset anyone's stomach. If it feels weird drinking water, maybe make some tea. Or something equally neutral.
