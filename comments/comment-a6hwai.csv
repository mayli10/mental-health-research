Most stores I like carry XS-L and it feels so good to know I can only ever walk out disappointed if they're just understocked in mediums.   When I was super fat Charlotte Russe didn't have a plus sized section at the time and I remember going in there with my friends once and just cringing and trying to look like I was having a good time looking at scarves and shoes while my friends tried on lacey dresses and slutty tops and i was so so jealous. Now we go and I get to join in and yet I still wouldn't wear anything I try on because I'm Still. Too. Self. Conscious. Maybe even worse so! I'd still rather be seen in a mens L sweater and tightly belted size 10 jeans than anything that fits correctly because i just want to hide my gross body!! ðŸ˜¨  At one time I was wearing anywhere between size 10-16 jeans and they all seemed to fit the same. I finally realized it was in part my body dysphoria bc i only wore the big ones on ""bad body days"" and the well-fitting ones on ""good body days."" I finally purged my closet of anything XL/XXL/XXXL so I'd stop looking homeless, as motivation not to go back, and like, symbolically heal lmao. ",False,False

I keep jeans in a size 00, 1, 3, and 5 because I can't seem to be consistent and it suuuucks. I bought a bunch of XS shirts when I was an XS but now I'm back to a hard S, soft M. Ugh. Fucking clothes and their ability to stay the same size when I can't. I feel you on how shrooms affect your will to restrict. ",False,False

I'm happier because I can shop in any store knowing they'll have my size, I'm happier because going up one flight of stairs doesn't wind me, I'm happier because men give me more attention, but I'm not like, overall a more happy person.   I hate my body for new reasons! I have loose skin that hangs off my stomach and thighs! I learned I'm not a pretty hourglass figure, I'm just a rectangle! My face is still ugly and I'm still bad at makeup! I lost my curves, my closet is full of clothes that don't fit me and I can't afford new ones, I'm still annoying, and my personailty is the same. I still hate myself and I'm still going to starve myself because maybe I'll be happier in 10 pounds. Or 30. Or 50. ",False,False
