I started at an obese BMI and now (about five months later) I'm right at the bottom of healthy weight. I started seeing an ED specialist last week and she told me that she thinks I need to go to the hospital, but I've always felt like I'm not going to have actual health problems unless I am underweight (apparently false lol). With atypical anorexia, it requires your weight to be dropping, but not a specific weight.",False,False

Weight can affect the behaviors, and the behaviors can affect the weight, but in the end it’s the behaviors that make the diagnosis.  Anorexia Nervosa necessitates you be underweight, but atypical anorexia, bulimia, and EDNOS do not, to name the big ones.",False,False

Please take care of yourself as much as you can, we aren’t healthy here.  If there’s any hope of changing your mind, your body would really thank you. You can still lose with healthy amounts of food and exercise. Either way, the sub is here for you.",False,False
