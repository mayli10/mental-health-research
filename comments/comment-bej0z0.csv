Second, I'd try to figure out exactly what it is that is stressing you out. If its multiple things, make a list (if that helps you) and get to work on crossing them off. Even if it's only 1 thing everyday it's still progress and may help with your stress.  Third, if there's nothing you can do about what is stressing you out currently, try to find some non-exercise hobbies.   And fourth, if nothing helps, I would suggest EITHER slow and steady jogging for medium distances and do your absolute best to eat to replace those calories. Even if it makes you panic, overall it is WAY better for you. OR try sprinting short distances (after warming up your muscles). That makes me feel alive and doesnt burn many calories so you dont need to replace many.   I hope that helps and I'm sorry if it sounds condescending. I just know that in the midst of a struggle it feels like theres only 1 or 2 options and it's hard to see any others",False,False
