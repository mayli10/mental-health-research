I have tried high ball. My college has them all over the place. They’re not as sweet as monster but they’re probably better for you (as much as an energy drink can be). The only thing is when the cafeteria got new flavors of highball I got excited and tried the black cherry one and it was soooo good but then I realized the new flavors had calories! It kind of ruined it for me. And I stopped drinking caffeine anyway...,False,False
