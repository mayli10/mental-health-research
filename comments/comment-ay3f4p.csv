Also, I've never had faith in those scales without hard numbers. It was about a 7 lb difference total with clothes, I think I'm just overreacting but ya know how it is. Any unwarrented scale change and I'm questioning whether I've been wrong about my weight for months upon months",False,True

My own scale and weight everyday has been pretty consistent (10 lb range because of b/p, some restricting, whatever I'm doing atm) and it seems accurate. I also use the scale at my moms about once a month and it's pretty consistent reflection too, but idk, it's still conscerning. ",False,True
