Also, I’ve been chewing a lot of gum and people are telling me my face looks slimmer, I’ve heard this can sort of chisel it out and strengthen jaw muscles or something?",False,False

Get a dark color that's a little warm, then go around the top of your forehead, the sides of your temples, and really chisel out those cheekbones (I think my face goes from shapeless to very thin-looking when I blend the contour up higher than you'd think, right up to the top of my cheekbones, then use a bit of foundation to sharpen up the bottom right where the cheek hollow is). A lot of people just have less prominent/sharp facial features and it's not related to weight (and some people will have a chiseled jaw and cheekbones even when they're very overweight). Playing with makeup is always a fun way to up confidence imo :)",False,False

I had a fat face even at 67lbs when I was in my early teens. Now, at 18 and almost 20lbs heavier my face is *way* slimmer. Also, if you purge, it may be making your salivary glands swell which can make your face look hella bloated. ",False,False

I had trouble with my face, now just with my arms, stomach, and legs.  Starting to realize my face was dysmorphia because my brother and sister were both commenting about my popping cheekbones after I got back from a friend’s for two days. Caught me off guard.",False,False
