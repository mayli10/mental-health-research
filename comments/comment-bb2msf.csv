I call it protein fluff)  Fruit, especially ripe bananas.   Smoothies, either frozen banana + protein powder + coffee or frozen berries + water + lemonade Mio or some other zero-cal lemonade powder (like crystal light, etc)   1 square of dark chocolate  Oatmeal with banana and vanilla protein powder sort of tastes like banana bread, if you squint (add lots of cinnamon).   Truly desperate days, I add a sugar-free syrup to my coffee at Starbucks.   50-cal refrigerated chocolate pudding. Also highly advisable to dip strawberries into.   Some sugar-free jams are really good and I’ll have a spoonful of that sometimes.   Best of luck. Sugar is a drug and I’ve never been able to wean myself off it fully. Fruit and natural sugars are the best I can do.",False,False
