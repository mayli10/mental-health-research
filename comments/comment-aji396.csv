While I do work out while fasting, I don't let myself climb because of the dangers associated with it. I've almost passed out while at the top of the wall bouldering before while low restricting and it was terrifying. If you'll be bouldering or belaying you're putting both yourself and your climbing partner in a super dangerous position. I'd either traverse or do some other form of exercise! ",False,False

It’s hard at time and it takes a lot of caffeine and such to keep me going but you should be fine ,False,False

It’s so hard to maintain an electrolyte balance even with out exercising when you’re not eating.   Maybe take a walk instead or eat a small meal before heading to the gym. ,False,False

Even tho you feel fine now, working out requires energy. So best case scenario, you just get tired faster. Worst case scenario, you pass out. I’d keep your exercise light and not long. I’d also drink a little protein drink beforehand. ",False,False
