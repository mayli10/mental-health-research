It’s different for everyone. I would just focus on behavior and let weight be a secondary factor in your mind. It’s scary but I think it’s worth it to go to treatment and get the help,False,False

It gives me hope. I have also heard that it varies depending on the program/dietitian so I guess I will just have to see.,False,True

This is my first time going in ""underweight"" so I feel like the process is different. I just think weight restoration is usually ""the first goal"" for those who are underweight from what I have seen/heard.",False,True

I feel like that fight for wanting the answer to be no is something only people with eds get though. I get asked a lot by my family ""why I don't want to feel better"" and it's hard thing to explain; I don't even understand why I think this way a lot of the time.",False,True

They did make me gain, they set a goal weight for me based off past weights/etc. that was around BMI 21.   they kept increasing my meal plan but i still only ended up gaining \~2 lb per week- I gained around 8. which seemed like a TON at a time but in my treatment plan it said they were shooting for 4 lb a week so 2 felt safer than that :(  I had to gain the rest of the weight once I was back in day/etc. which made me super uncomfortable.  \~3 months later my hatred of my weight restored body is starting to decrease and i even have days where I feel good about how it looks (not just feeling good as in my body/etc. doesn't feel like shit). but ngl it felt SOOO uncomfortable to gain, mentally and physically. in a super cliched way, it's been worth it though.",False,False

My weight gain was pretty slow, most of it happened in PHP after being discharged from resi. I backslid and did need the support again so I'm inpatient now but planned to go to residential soon. I really want to encourage you to go. It's okay to have a conflict of wanting to recover and being afraid of weight gain, that's something that a lot of people deal with in recovery. When I got to inpatient last time one of the dietitians asked me a question that really stuck with me, he asked if being the weight I was at the time was worth the heart problems and fainting spells I was having. I'm still struggling with making that answer no permanently but it's really just not worth it",False,False

Its mental illness and far more complex then a number on a scale. I've never been in paitent so idk from first hand. But i hope this helps!,False,False
