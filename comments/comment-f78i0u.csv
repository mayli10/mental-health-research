My fear foods are also cakes and sweets but ironically I’m studying patisseries and training to become a chef. I restrict then binge every other day. The most triggering thing for me is watching people eat slowly or not finish their food, it’s like my brain needs them to finish their food so it’s okay for me to eat mine aha.",False,True
