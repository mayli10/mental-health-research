It actually went really well and I’m beyond relieved. We went over my blood work which showed everything was actually excellent despite the weight loss. She set me up with a new therapist and is trying me on a new prescription for 30 days. She was honest with me and said that it often causes weight gain/loss but since we’re only doing it for 30 days max nothing should happen nor does she want it to. She didn’t make me uncomfortable or talk down to me or threaten me. She said usually hey would set me up with a nutritionist and a whole plan, but she said she trusted me and thought I was able to work with my therapist on our own plan. I couldn’t have asked for anything better.",False,True
