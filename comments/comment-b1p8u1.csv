I couldn't take everything anymore. Went 100 Cals in junk over dinner on purpose so that I could get triggered. Got triggered to purge that. Led to a binge in crap food. Purged that. Was super dizzy and woozy, and I didn't want tomorrow to be an nature binge day, so I binged more that night... started on protein bars..except, I literally couldn't take a single bite more of sugar, as it was making me nauseated (that has never happened to me)..then I realized I didn't want sugar and that I was actually fucking starving, so I continued bingeing on chicken, rice, and pasta. Got full, then knocked out.  I was at a LW yesterday. I don't have margin for error. Every binge day sets me back so freaking much. I just hope that because the second binge was smaller, I'm only set back 2-3k, but regardless, that's days worth of work. I can't do this if I want to reach my goals in time. I'm so stupid; I blew it. I can't do that ever again.  The hard part though, is that I'm trying to recover from BED, but with all the restriction going on, I feel like I'm starting to manifest restrictive-type ED tendencies that I've never experienced before. My boyfriend says it's not an issue because my BED is stopping (he's a recovered bulimic), but for some reason, this still doesn't feel okay. Not being able to eat dinner unless I work it off beforehand doesn't feel okay.  I just..I knew losing weight wouldn't solve all my problems BED gave me. I knew that was coming, so why is it a surprise now that it's actually happening?  I said ""when I hit a healthy BMI, I'll be happy"", then ""when I get into the healthy BMI enough so that I won't fluctuate out of it with a binge week, I'll be okay"" to ""when I get to a 21 BMI, I'll be happy, because that's the lower end of healthy."" I'm here now. Now it's ""When I get to an 18.5 BMI, I'll be happy"". But when I look in the mirror, I see about 30 pounds to lose..yeah..I don't have 30 pounds to lose without entering an anorexic BMI.  All I know is that I'm still fat, and I need to lose more weight. At least 10, but preferably 20 lbs. That's all I'm sure of. After that, we'll see. I can't complain about restricting when my BMI is still so fat lol",False,False
