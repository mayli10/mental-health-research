I constantly feel like a fake. Mainly because I'm not skinny so it's different but still similar in a sense. Even when I'm fasting, even when I'm binging, even when I'm hiding bags of puke in my room because purging in the bathroom would be too conspicuous because someone saw all the food I brought into my room... I reason it all with myself. Restriction is for the better because I'm happier when I'm empty and not bloated. Binging and/or purging is my punishment because ""I'm a worthless ~~pig~~boar and always will be so what's the point in caring about anything?"" I think I make the choices but if that's true, why do I think my many years in the pro-ana community, which I've felt wrong about for so many years and still do, make me feel like maybe I really just am on a decades-long diet and I'm just obsessed with diet culture? Even right now, part of me is like ""yes, that's it, you selfish disgusting glutton"" and the other 3/4ths is recalling how my ENTIRE adolescence and early adulthood had been dictated and shaped by my food intake and weight. I'm consumed by my obsession with being thin, it's not just a coping mechanism but I'm also obsessed with diet culture itself. I know why, I grew up being relentlessly teased for being the fattest and tallest in my class. I felt like a monster. I still do, frankly. So many celebrities were also just as obsessed with thin at the time and achieved it in a month but I could never seem to kick BED and still haven't. I found all my basis ""dieting tips"" on pro-ana sites. I learned CICO and keto from reddit but I don't see them as inherently disordered, it's just me. Keto is a requirement for me as I'm epileptic and insulin resistant anyway.  We all crave control in our lives. I can't speak for anyone else, but my food is literally the only thing of two things in my entire life that I can control to a comfortable level. I'm not saying you are out of control because of your behaviours, a tonne of AN-diagnosed people would be described as the most organised/put-together people they've met. I'm not diagnosing you, please don't take it that way. It just almost feels like the ones who are really disordered don't show it IRL (like ""HEY EVERYONE IM ON A DIET"" to the office lunch room) and purely see it as a normal coping habit or ""just a thing they do"" whereas many that claim they had a problem constantly, will be vague and bullshitting you the whole time for sympathy points.  Regardless, if you're struggling with food and life and/or body insecurity, you belong here (some may find r/DysmorphicDisorder to be a better fit, if they are interested) . This is a community for everyone who struggles with eating, regardless of their specific eating tendencies. Even if you don't think of yourself as disordered and just relate to the posts, keep on relating! They've definitely got me through hard nights and I cannot thank both the old sub and this new sub enough for that.",False,True

Most of the time what I've done to myself is just a diet, and I'm only doing this to get small. I don't restrict, I actually eat a lot of food and am quite greedy so purging is pretty normal considering that.  I know it's offensive to people with AN that I have my label, but idk...I can't bring myself to get rid of it. Like I know that I can stop whenever I want, and this is ultimately my choice.  &amp;#x200B;  I'm so sorry for this, it's hard to admit you're an attention seeker.",False,False

I literally read about the SGD on Xanga? Probably. And did it and yet, I'm still here today as an adult, disordered as all fuck.  Every time I see or hear the word ""bulimia"", I think ""bulimia is so 1987"" ala Heathers. But it really is true. I want to, but I won't go into it because it will be triggering for others and also myself and that's the last thing I want. For anyone reading, you are not less than anyone. Regardless of the type, EDs vary dramatically and your experience is just as valid as anyone's. If you feel it is a problem, it is.   It's like depression and anxiety where ""normies"" romanticise being sad and insecure but never talk about not showering for a week+ because you're literally too depressed to get up because what's the point? and wanting to kill yourself rather than show the world your face or show them apparently how shit you are according to your brain. I suffer with both, severely, but never see representation for the worst of those diagnosis (although I just found r/agoraphobia and it's definitely help with the guilt), just the stuff that's ""acceptable"". It's wrong and wish more people would show the ugly but I also have an (albeit tiny) ego and still don't want anyone to see the state of my house... so I get it. I really do.",False,True

About bulimia being seen as the 'gross disorder' I 100% agree! Anorexia was the 'glamorous' one and all the gross bits were totally ignored. Not shitting for weeks, reflux, smushing unwanted food into sleeves and purses (which if forgotten about... yeah), bad skin, stimulant abuse and hair loss are all ignored.",False,False

I know just how secretive they can be and how much you can fake it. Please don't think that I made this post with this thread in mind because I didn't. I've never questioned anyone's validity. In fact, I'm the picture of invalidity. Male, obese, BED-centric. Most people would just say ""I need more food because I'm a man"" or ""You're just a big eater"". No, Helen. I hate myself for everything I ever consume and hate my body so much I avoid leaving the house unless it's absolutely necessary.  Plus, alot of people's crash-dieting fails were catalysts for their EDs. I know mine was, the binge/restrict cycle. They realised how much people treated them different before they gained weight back and they want that back.    &gt;i get what youre saying though and i find it annoying too (like, we get &gt;it, you read Wintergirls once and had a black-and-white thinspo/skins ?&gt;gifs tumblr and 'didn't eat for three days so you could be lovely' but &gt;that isn't the same beast as an eating disorder)  LMAO i actually laughed at this but it's so accurate. Reblogging b/w gifs of hit tv shows and eating 1200kcals doesn't make you anorexic. Like I said, I'm jaded so my opinion is over-coloured. But maybe that person was lying and pretending it wasn't as bad as it was. Bulimia is the ""gross"" disorder. Girls especially don't want to admit they will willingly make themselves vomit just to stay thin. They want it to seem effortless and I get it, especially in high school. You genuinely cannot judge someone from purely what they tell you. Don't judge them on hypotheticals, of course. But it's good to keep an open mind.",False,True
