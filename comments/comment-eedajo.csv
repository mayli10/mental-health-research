I actually have more muscle dysmorphia, as my therapist put it, but I think I have hints of dysmorphia along with blatant dysphoria.   I want to have a lean build, but a bulkier, bigger build, but instead, anorexia makes me lean, but very scrawny and small.   Damn Disorders.  They never make sense.",False,True

I don’t want to be tall as someone FTM might. I want to be tiny and take up as little space as humanly possible. I think this is an important distinction to make between dysmorphia/dysphoria,False,False

It's nothing to do with wanting to look less female, just that I have a fucked up idea of what a woman should look like. Don't know if this helps, but it's one pov.",False,False

I hate the idea of looking maternal and being seen as a sign of ultra femininity. I definitely do not want a man chest, I just don’t want to be seen as an object of fertility I guess. It grosses me out.   I don’t want straight hips like a man. I’m okay with wide hips, but I don’t want to have any fat on them. I don’t want to have a muffin top.",False,False
