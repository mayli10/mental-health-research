It happens frequently when I am mad at myself, when I am not as good as I want to be at something, or feel like a failure after working hard all day.  When I find myself doing this, I think of something my therapist said. ""You can be a real brat, but I like it when your brat."" For some odd reason, these words remind me that when I restrict because I am angry with myself, I am just being a brat to myself and no one else. Sometimes, I don't care much and restrict anyways, but there are others when I decide eat in order to be a brat against the disorder voice in my head, giving it a purpose. Not an earth shattering, or graceful, approach to recovery, but it has helped me keep moving forward in the past.",False,False

Sometimes it’s just less scary than facing the waves of emotions head-on. Sometimes it’s anger-turned-inward or an attempt at atonement. Sometimes it traces back to the idea that I deserve pain or that harshness is the most effective way to push myself toward achievement. (Spoiler: it’s not...at least, not anymore)   After the improvements I’ve experienced in other areas of my mental health I really do believe new ways of being are possible. It’s just...hard. As the slam poet Neil Hilborn said...”it is impossible to imagine a color you have not seen.”",False,False
