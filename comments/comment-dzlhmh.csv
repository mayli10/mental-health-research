Even though I was living alone before, I simply took one important step when going to the grocery store.  Don't buy the trigger foods when you go. Just do whatever you can to resist.  And I know that is so much easier said than done.. But every day you need to keep fighting the urges to binge, you're worth the fight. This has forced me to eat ditch most of my binging because I barely have anything to binge on. Sure sometimes I have ""sad"" binges when I just put stuff together of what I already have, but even those are decreasing.  However when I visit my family, all limits are off and I turn into a binge monster : / It's really difficult and I understand everyone here struggling.",False,False

But I'm also terrified to live with someone and have anyone see my bizarre safe eating habits. How will I have my safe food cabinet with roommates? How will I eat giant amounts of vegetables?
