Although with the Smiths it probably is. It's nice to see someone else who actually knows my favorite band. If it is a sad reminder, maybe my love for them will help a little: I love the smiths because my dad raised my siblings and I listening to it. For me, they're a symbol of the bond between my father and I.   I like your writing a lot by the way. It's hard for me to follow but that's why I like it, its poetic and mysterious but there's a deep truth embedded in it. I hope you take this as a compliment; your writing makes me think of Morrissey himself because you have a way with words that can make maybe unrelated things feel very relatable. ",False,False
