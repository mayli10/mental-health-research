Baking is dangerous, it's all full of sugar and butter and carbs. I guess her baked goods get sold in the cafe?",False,False

She makes so many baked goods, and it's making me want to bake again, but there's no way I can bake something every day like she does. Does her character eat what she makes every day? Does she just give all of it away? I'm sweatin'.",False,False
