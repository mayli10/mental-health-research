It’s so hard to get control over the eating, I’m currently trying to shed the weight I gained after switching from restriction to binging. I don’t have any advice, but it does seem to get better. My binged are less frequent so long as I don’t high restrict and get moderate exercise. Best of luck to you &lt;3",False,False
