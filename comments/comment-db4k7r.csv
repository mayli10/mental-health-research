Also don’t worry when you get off prednisone you will drop 10lbs like instantly because all the water weight goes away and you get a normal appetite instead of crazy prednisone appetite. ❤️,False,True

Just wanted to say I too have ulcerative colitis. I’m really jelly you were able to lose on prednisone. I’ve been on it pretty much continuously except a few weeks here and there for about a year. (Was diagnosed in 2016). I have the stupid round face and can’t lose a fucking pound if my life depended on it - but I haven’t really gained any either.   Anyways just wanted to say hang in there. I wish I could fast forward to being skinny too. Sometimes I wonder if they took out my colon if I would lose weight - honestly doesn’t seem too bad at this point.,False,False

I'm not a lawyer, and not promising the case has legs, but I do hate to see people preemptively give up on the possibility of suing. For better or worse, the U.S. is very friendly to lawsuits.   I also forgot to mention, please consider reporting all this to an appropriate state and/or medical authority. I don't know much about this process, bc I've never done it (despite having had the grounds to do it...ugh), but there should be regulatory bodies that take these complaints in your state.",False,False

I think I will head over to my universities law department. It’s in a different state than I’m currently in but at least they might be able to help me to check if I have a case. I also might give my uncle a call (he’s a lawyer) but I also don’t know how much help he’ll be because he’s on the other side of the country and mainly works in civil court for divorces and minor violations etc,False,True

If you know any lawyers, I'd ask for a recommendation to an attorney who works in personal injury. Or if there's a law school associated with a local university, you can ask them too (if you talk to the right person, they may even be able to tell you themselves whether your case sounds legit). If you feel you have enough ""street smarts"" to avoid sharks/ambulance chasers, you can call around yourself.   The consult should be free (run away if it's not), given that a case of this type will work on contingency. (Contingency = the lawyer only gets paid if she wins the case and you all get payouts.) So you really have nothing to lose by looking into this.   But if you can't sue, please at least leave negative reviews of this fucked up place on any platform you can, including Yelp/Google Maps/etc (yes, some people really do look for rehab on Google Maps...). Be honest but measured, to minimize the chance that your review will be removed (e.g., don't say, ""FUCK DIS HELL JOINT!!!!11!1"" You know.).  It's completely not okay that you've ended up with PTSD and a distrust in further treatment. THIS IS A REAL INJURY! You don't have to have your legs broken for it to be considered injury.  I'm sorry for the long post, it's just I know people who work in workplace injury law (so not the exact same thing, but similar), and am upset on your behalf. No one deserves to be abused in a treatment facility!",False,False

This too will pass. I know that's such a cliché, but you haven't always felt this low, and I promise you won't be stuck here forever.   &gt;gaslighting, and forcing me to eat shit like expired chicken and chunky milk as a punishment/not letting me shower/ not taking me to the hospital when I fell down the stairs and fractured my tailbone.  What. the. fuck. Is this dream stuff, or did this happen in real life? If it's real life, omg, that is very serious from a legal/medical perspective. What country are you in? Seriously, my jaw dropped.",False,False
