It's a pretty deep rabbithole though lol. I've probably spent $60+ on my collection of hot sauces, but I have such a wide selection of flavor profiles I wouldn't have it any other way. I have the classic Tabasco/Tapatio/Sriracha stuff, but then I have green verde sauce, mustard carribean, pineapple mango habanero, curry hot sauce, Scotch Bonnet &amp; ginger, chili con carne sauce, jalapeno &amp; basil (for an Italian twist).
