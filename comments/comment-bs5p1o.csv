Any time I eat above 1000 calories or so im so gassy. I also bloat by just drinking water but I think that’s just a personal thing.,False,False

And it's funny you mention intermittent fasting - I've been a natural IM-er since like middle school and do OMAD when restricting. But even on 16/8 lately I've been a bloated mess.,False,True

Having a food intolerance would really suck because I'm already vegan, so hoping probiotics help.",False,True

Also I make sure I get electrolytes.  Also after a period of restriction in college I developed lactose intolerance so it might be a food intolerance that you just havent pinned down? It's why I dont just use yogurt for probiotics.,False,False

I like the brand enzymedica digest gold. I took one or two every single time I ate, and it helped so much.   I also like to make sure I’m getting enough probiotics in; I take one specifically for mood, one for women’s/urinary health, and a couple of broad spectrum ones.   I don’t know how triggering it would be for you, but I’ve found that intermittent fasting really helps my digestion. My body likes to have a little break from digestion, so an 8-10hr eating window works well.",False,False
