Crack an egg or two, whisk those bad boys up until thereâ€™s froth (takes a while, your arm will be v tired).  Coat a pan with a lil olive oil, using a paper towel to wipe the excess, and turn those suckers into a fluffy FLUFFY omelet.  Yo, Iâ€™m not kidding folks.  Youâ€™re basically beating air into the eggs so they turn out incredibly fluffy, delicious and FILLING.  I used to be afraid of eggs bc fat and cholesterol, but good lord they are versatile S.O.B.s!!!  And I love them.    Iâ€™ll stop now.",False,False
