And where I’m at in the “ED home” effects it, too.   Like seeing someone thinner than me has only triggered me once and it was when I was at my previous LW and she was someone I went to hs with and for some reason, *that* was the instance I couldn’t handle it.   Otherwise, specific stat numbers are really all that “trigger” me. Mainly because it makes me competitive. But seeing someone lose doesn’t really get to me. It’s all a numbers game, in my head.   So maybe it’s like that. You’re just not easily bothered or the things that will bug you are really specific. We’ve all got different minds. It doesn’t make you fake or anything.",False,False

Maybe those comments don't make me want to restrict, but they may put my mind on looping thoughts about my eating disorder for the rest of the day. Eating disorders are both mental and physical, that goes for our actions as well.",False,False
