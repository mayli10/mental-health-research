I also avoided refined suagr and oil and did great. I started it to help me down the line, im afraid of diabetes and heart disease and given how common those are people shut up with their questions.   Restaurants... hmm chain wise I like chiptole and occasionally burger king. Then local restaurants are amazing where i live. Joining a facebook group for your area vegans would help. In my group they post about restaurants AND grocery store finds! I love eating a lot so I would make a lot of vegan casseroles and baked tofu jerky. Giant salads with nuts, dried fruit, and pickled stuff is a staple too!     Cliff bars has a couple of delicious vegan bars that are 240 calories. The ginger one tastes like gingerbread cookies. Other sweets I like are Daiya cheesecakes. Whole Foods cakes are not really that good but their pies are delicious.",False,False
