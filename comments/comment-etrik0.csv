Its 1200kcal which is still a net loss for the day and i thoroughly enjoy it. Tho high restriction doesn't work well fpr me i always slip up and b/p so I'm doing as little of that as possible   Oh god i should make me blueberry walnut oats next time. Or strawberry vanilla. Im hungry lol :/,False,False

Most my friends and fam eat heaps at dinner/ dessert and usually aren‚Äôt hungry til later in the day.,False,False

She may be used to eating small but caloric breakfasts like muffins or toast, like a lot of people do. If she is used to eating small, calorically dense things for breakfast, then oatmeal may be filling to her, despite being low calorie. Or like others said, she might not be a breakfast person or like oatmeal but gets her calories from other sources throughout the day.   I'm used to these kinds of comments. I eat high volume healthy foods and my portions seem huge to others. I can finish them no problem. And I still weigh less than them and am underweight, because despite the high volume, I'm eating healthy and lower calorie foods.",False,False

And she was being polite by trying to eat it but eating the whole thing seemed hard. I've said that kind of thing when I dont like what im served but dont want to say it.  Lots of people are used to real oatmeal or instant oatmeal and getting the opposite may weird some people out texture wise.  Sorry that happened to you!",False,False

But just a few counter thoughts:   - People sometimes eat different amounts at different times. Maybe she usually eats a really small breakfast and bigger meals later.  - Lots or people, even without EDs, are embarrassed by how much they eat and will eat less in front of others, and even make a big deal about not being able to finish a meal as presented to them. In my experience, this is especially true of young women, and especially if the person they think the person they are eating in front of eats less/is thinner/is healthier than they are (whether or not these factors apply, just pointing it out).  - She may also not be used to a high fibre diet and find the feeling of oatmeal more filling than whatever else.   Oatmeal is a healthy food, and you should feel safe eating the amount you need.",False,False
