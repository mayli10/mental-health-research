I'm glad I made sense because I've been up since 1 am for work so I can barely remember my name. But, I'm glad yall will soon be together, and I hope that will help clear up your insecurities. Ldr's have a way of bringing those out it seems. Enjoy your time with him!",False,False

I'm 30 years old, and I just got my first car that I own...sort of. I have no credit since my parents never helped me with getting a credit card or anything so I had to cosign with my husband. I've never had my own place and I too struggled in school. I'm so sorry that you feel this way. I'm sure your boyfriend isn't comparing you two, and that he loves you no matter what. I also understand the ldr thing, as I did that for 6 months with my hubby before I moved in with him. (Sorry, I'm probably making no sense and all over the place). If you ever need someone to vent to or just talk, please feel free to message me. Sorry this is kinda long lol",False,False
