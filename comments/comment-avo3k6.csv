I guess I self-harm in other ways, though. When I drink, I binge drink. I was consuming like 80 units of alcohol per week at my worst, but I can stop drinking easily (though not once I've started) if I replace it with restricting, which is what I'm doing now. If I don't drink, I tend to restrict instead. If I drink, I can't restrict and binge. Most times I've self-harmed have been when drunk, and the scars from those are worse from the few times I've cut when sober. Does the fact I mostly cut when drunk, and I rarely cut at all, mean it isn't valid in terms of potential BPD? I mean it still should be valid, but they probably won't see it that way. The only thing doctors care about is money. In America, it's making money. In the UK? Saving it. Patients be damned. I hate doctors. I hate them all so much, I'm tempted to just de-register from my GP practice, because I'd rather have no doctor at all.",False,False
