No one ever wants to hear #3, but actually doing just that is what got me out of the binge/restrict EDNOS cycle many years ago. Paradoxically, making the conscious decision to put restriction on hold for a bit can help you feel more in control and less at the mercy of those binge urges. It's just a lot easier on your body, too.  My perspective? If the choice is (A) maintaining or even slowly gaining on a more normal diet, versus (B) uncontrollably bingeing my way to possible obesity, I'd rather the former. u/35ants, please don't beat yourself up. Read up on ""reactive hunger,"" and just know this is very normal, and it will probably not continue indefinitely, but you can make it a lot better by not trying to overcompensate for every episode. I know it's hard, though. Hugs &lt;3",False,False

If you’ve been restricting for awhile and suddenly eat more calories than your body is used to, it will freak out and hold onto that water until you start eating more normally. I know how scary it can be to see the scale go up overnight even when you haven’t eaten more calories than normal, but there’s no way it’s all or even mostly fat. ",False,False

Unless you increase your calories, you're likely not going to be able to stop binging.   Though if it makes you feel better, it is highly unlikely that you're up 10 lbs. I can gain 8 overnight from eating a lot of starch even while at a caloric deficit. A good deal of it is probably water. ",False,False

It's pretty normal for the body to ramp up hunger and make you eat almost compulsively in an effort to have you take in more calories when you're underweight or have been restricting heavily. This is a physiological reaction as much as it is a psychological one so don't beat yourself up.  2) You likely are holding a large amount of water weight. I can easily gain 5-7 lbs of water weight just from a couple days of binge eating.  3) The best thing you can do to stop the binge cycle is eat more. I know it's the last thing you want to do when you're upset about gaining weight, but you're setting yourself up for further binge eating by having such low restriction. Calculate your TDEE and then try to consume that amount of calories, including a lot of calories from fat and protein to nourish your body.",False,False
