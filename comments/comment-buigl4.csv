It has nothing to do with wishing he looked differently or anything like that! I just like to look at pretty oriole. If he were to ever compare himself to the other shit I watched or found attractive and felt hurt I would also feel hurt that I did that. He’s perfect, but idk I find other shit nice too and that doesn’t mean I want him to change. I hope this offers you a little perspective.   I’m currently restricting while me and him are going through a tough spot (almost broke up ha) and I think it’s because I need more control over our relationship and to feel a little more secure. I think maybe this might be what you’re doing as well? Please don’t hurt yourself!",False,False

OP, you're totally justified in being hurt. It's completely understandable. I don't know anything about your relationship but how long have you been together? How open is communication?  My boyfriend's ""type"" is slender. I'm definitely curvy and NOT slender.  When I found out I had a similar reaction as yours, and I made it about me. ""How can he love me when I'm not his type!?"", ""Is he even attracted to me?"", ""Will be get bored and cheat on me with someone who's his 'type'?""  We talked and I told him it made me never wanna eat again. And he told me I was being stupid. That there was so much more to me than my body. That his ""type"" is just bodies, and if he wanted that, if he needed that he wouldn't be with me.  And that made me feel better. I'm more than my body. And you are too OP. You are more than your body.  AND if having NSFW pictures on his devices is an issue, you may want to have that open discussion and draw that boundary (as well as any others if there are any).",False,False

I hope that you are able to heal in the best way you can. You deserve to be respected and loved no matter what happens. You deserve time to heal no matter how long it may take. You are important and deserving of happiness.

It's been a little over two weeks since a new issue appeared in my relationship, but it was not new, it was just a new form of the same thing... I blew up about something nonrelated because I didn't want to bring it up, caused a huge argument that way, eventually we spoke and I brought up the real reason, thought we got past it, turns out we didn't, had another multi-day argument and hash-it-out session and now... I'm waiting for the healing. My trust is broken, and my self-esteem is shattered, but the wound is no longer fresh so at least that part of the pain is gone. But I know this will be something that will take a long time to get over, just like the older wounds from this relationship - in fact it's more like a death of a thousand papercuts at this point. I'm currently at a tipping point and if one more thing happens I'm going to absolutely lose it. I feel like I shouldn't have to teach him how to respect me, but he seems utterly clueless and not malicious, so I'm willing to be patient... to an extent.   Life unfortunately isn't black and white. It's many shades of gray. Think about where in the gray you are, and the most important thing you can do is talk about it. It sounds like he didn't do this to you out of malice, he was just clueless, so do you forgive him? Do you forgive him with a clause involved such as he no longer does it again? What happens if he does it again, what happens if he hides it? So many people are afraid of communication or speaking up, but would you rather suffer in silence or take a few minutes of discomfort and be your own advocate? Past me would rather have suffered in silence, but life goes on and I promise you there is someone out there who can and will love you the way you need to be loved.",False,False

What you’ve written resonates with me very much and you have managed to put words to my feelings. Thank you so much for taking the time to write all of this out; it means so so much to me. Boundaries are something I strive to defend more than anything and hearing someone else have similar ones validates me so much. I will come back to this post for strength in the future.,False,True

I personally am not a fan of porn, but I allow it because people are allowed autonomy over their own body and not everyone can have a great imagination to get off without visuals (ahem, plebs, ahem). My boundaries are real girls, this includes instagram models (because let's be honest they aren't real pro models, they're just pretty and naked), looking at real girls, saving pictures of real girls, and also extends to cam girls (live interaction) and strip clubs (live interaction). Those are my boundaries, hard stop, I don't care if someone doesn't agree, if we are in a relationship it must be agreed or we will not be in a relationship.   Especially if my partner would have a problem with me being a producer of those things. Being a consumer is only innocent if you don't have a problem with your partner being a producer. If your partner producing those images, or being a cam girl, or stripper causes you mental anguish you need to do some introspection and think about why it bothers you.   Does this make me insanely jealous and controlling? I personally don't think so, maybe jealous, maybe envious, but not controlling because those are my personal boundaries. Respect them or step off.   Does it fuel my mental problems including my anxiety, self loathing and eating disorder? Oh, absolutely. Is it their problem? No. Is it my problem? Yes. If they continue after stating my boundaries, is it their problem? Well... yes until we break up.   If I am able to find my partner to be all I need emotionally, mentally, and physically, it is not outside of the realm of reason to want a partner who views me the same. I may not come second to photos of girls online, but I also want no contest. And I might be in the minority but I also know I'm not alone.   Why do I have so many thoughts on this matter? Because I'm going through this right now. I've gone through iterations of this in the past including one very ~\*triggering\*~ and soul-crushing relationship in my early 20s, I was afraid to state my opinion then and it hurt me deeply, and I will not go through it again because I respect myself now and am no longer afraid of being alone or being judged as demanding. Love alone does not fix everything.",False,False

This is a horrible situation to experience and regardless of anything else (he's faithful, he's attracted to you, etc) it still happened and understandably hurts.   It changes nothing, but something to think about... he doesn't have pictures of girls who look like you saved because he already has you. That doesn't make it ok, or right, or less painful. But he is with you for a reason (probably a lot of reasons) and even though those randos may be pretty doesn't mean you're not also pretty. I hope you feel better soon.
