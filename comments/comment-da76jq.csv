My thighs have loose skin and my EDmind uses that to tell me it's fat and I need to lose more. Bullshit.   I believe working out and drinking much maybe can make it better, but I doubt it goes away on its own completely :/",False,False

I'm not saying that to make you upset, but I'm in the same boat. I have it really bad on my tummy from both years of yo yo dieting and having kids and I know there's no way it's going away on it's own. Also have some on my upper thighs and arms. Idk how yours is though, if it's better than mine or not, and it could possibly improve with time and maintaining weight loss (easier said than done, I know), but loose skin isn't something that always goes away by itself. It's a shitty truth to try to accept and I still haven't because I feel the same way as you, I hate it SO badly. I also feel like I look heavier than people who have the same stats as me because of it and it's incredibly frustrating.   Sorry if I'm being a downer. I know it really fucking sucks and messes with the self esteem.",False,False
