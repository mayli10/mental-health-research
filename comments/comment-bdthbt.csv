I have to remind myself how much better I felt and looked when I was in shape instead of starving,False,False

The most helpful thing for me was reframing my thoughts and body neutrality. So an example of a reframe is like, if I think ""I love how I look right now and I want to stay thin"". A reframe that I would find helpful would be to remember that my body cannot physically house a child if Im this thin, and a baby is one of my goals for the future. Body neutrality is thinking ""My body is just a body. It is neither good nor bad"". I used body neutrality more once I had started to gain weight during treatment because I also loved how I looked and didn't want to change. Feel free to PM me if you have any questions. Good luck &lt;3",False,False

I am not recovered, but I dimly remember what it was like to be fully concentrated on things that were not food. It was a better life.",False,False

I take naps all the time and pretty much just lie around all day since I stopped forcing myself to do 10,000 steps or more a day. I really want to be able to go on walks, go swimming and I want to start horse riding again but I just can‚Äôt right now. If I tried to horse ride I would probably break my tail bone, haha.

When I'm tiny, I love the way my body looks, but it's not capable of doing much tbh. I lay on the couch, in bed, etc. because I don't have the energy to go on walks. Maintaining even 5-10 lbs more and I start having the energy to go on short walks with my partner, go bouldering/rock climbing, and don't need naps all the time. When I'm comfortable, 5-10 lbs more than that and I might be able to go dancing, biking, hiking, or camping without pain. It helps make me more okay with maintaining a certain number as long as I can justify it with ""seeing"" that I can have a more full life and feel better too. Have you noticed a similar incremental list? Sometimes keeping the tradeoff in mind helps with perspective.",False,False

My fianc√© is constantly telling me what a good person I am and tries to highlight what I have achieved, but I just can‚Äôt see it, in my mind all I have succeeded at is becoming very thin and it does feel like that is all I‚Äôm good at and it is my only good quality.

Look forward to the future and push to recovery. Just because you dont love the idea of that body doesnt mean that you wont eventually. Hang in there and don't demonize yourself.
