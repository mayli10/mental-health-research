It tends to give you a more accurate number I think. I weigh on Tuesdays! Just kidding. I weigh everyday. But I only write it down on my chart on Tuesdays. Its helped me deal with fluctuations to the point I'm not even bothered by them. I think of my daily weight as an ""unofficial transcript"" and my Tuesday weight as an official one. It also helps keep me on track and set short attainable goals! I set a healthy weight loss goal (2lbs) and no matter how low or high I go I can usually meet that still.¬†:) ",False,False

I do try my best to keep my fibre up, because I also have been severely constipated before and no one wins at that game.   I guess I'll weigh my poops to try and give me some more peace of mind!

If you want to poop every day you need sufficient soluble fiber (fruits and veggies) and enough water (1.5L per day) .   When I was at my worst with AN I used to go 2-3 weeks without pooping because I wasn‚Äôt eating anything, just drinking skim milk with sugar in it and swallowing a multivitamin every day. Zero fiber and I ended up in hospital with stomach pains so bad they thought I could be in labor (lol! I was 37kg) and when the pregnancy test came (obviously) negative they were suspecting appendicitis. It turned out just to be severe constipation!  Re weight, everyone‚Äôs different but I know my poops weigh 0.2kg (because I‚Äôve weighed before and after) ;) so if you‚Äôre just missing the occasional day you can guess that your non-poop weight is approx 0.2kg less.  I highly recommend consuming fruit and veg though no matter what your calorie intake is. I assure you those severe constipation pains are not pleasant, and having actually given birth since I can confirm the pain level was not such a long way off! You really wanna avoid it ;)  ",False,False
