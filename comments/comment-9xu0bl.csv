I had a performing arts charter school in the afternoon and we were allowed to eat during first class if we didn't have a scheduled lunch period. I would write down all this junk food in a big list (different everyday), get a full lunch (sub sandwich, mashed potatoes (with mayonnaise in them, yeah, I'm disgusting)a Tropicana twister and 1 other side item), and buy like 7-9 items from the a la carte (giant fudge round, 2-3 bags of chips, zebra cakes, cookies, Swiss cake rolls, oatmeal cream pies, etc). I'd stuff all the junk in my side pack backpack, eat my lunch during class, then go to the bathroom and inhale all the junk. I'd even put fake names next to the stuff on the list and mutter about not being a delivery person while grabbing everything. Maybe if all that s*** wasn't available to me I would've eaten like a normal person, wouldn't be obese now, and wouldn't be struggling so hard with eating a 70 calorie cheese wheel ü§îüòï",False,False

It really makes me sense but then I end up binging on all the food I just bought.   I refuse to go into restaurants to pick up food. I don‚Äôt want them to have to look at my whole body. ,False,False
