I think for Wyderâ€™s their raspberry is the lowest, but itâ€™s actually pretty tasty. Cider is my major jam. My favorite is Cider Boys,  it itâ€™s sweet and pretty caloric :( actually my favorite is [JKâ€™s Scrumpy](http://jksfarmhouseciders.com/ciders/), but I donâ€™t even want to think about how many calories it is, itâ€™s really sweet. Plus i can only find it in the [bigger bottles](https://imgur.com/a/8eIssup), which of course fit in my wine glass that fits a whole bottle of wine ðŸ˜¬ ",False,False

Last time I logged 16oz of Guinness was over a year ago and it came in at over 200 on myfitnesspal so I haven't drunk it since. Also for ciders are still full of sugar and alcohol carbs, and I prefer to just have the alcohol carbs. Why add all the extra sugars!? 120 is very low for cider in my experience. Is raspberry the lowest? Because things like woodchuck cider are 220 cal for 12 oz.",False,False

Personally when Iâ€™m out I donâ€™t like to get vodka sodas (typical skinny drink) because Iâ€™m OCD about them not actually measuring out the vodka. A lot of the times theyâ€™ll put more than one shot (100 cal) which leads to potentially 2-300 calories per drink. I like drinking a standard sized beer because I can easily track it and it fills me up/isnâ€™t as easy to just keep endlessly drinking and get too drunk.,False,False

Guinness is a dark beer and about 200-220cal per pint and cider has lots of sugar and is typically 150-200 for a 12oz.

If you donâ€™t want to drink at all, and pretend that you are, just order Diet Coke or lemonade and say itâ€™s vodka/coke or gin/tonic. People wonâ€™t notice/care if theyâ€™re already drunk, but when everyoneâ€™s ordering their first drink you might not get away with it. In the past Iâ€™ve taken my first drink with alcohol, and then when everyoneâ€™s had one or two and are too busy being merry to notice what Iâ€™m drinking I switched to just mixers. I do this also sometimes if Iâ€™m not in the mood for drinking but I want to be social.",False,False
