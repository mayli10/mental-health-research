I distinctly remember the day I had the thought ""I am too skinny."" I was exactly as you describe. XXS clothes hung off of me, and I looked like a prepubescent girl. On one hand, I liked it. On the other, I looked like a very sick person. I was a very sick person.   If I could do it over again, I would have entered treatment right away. I gained the weight on my own over the course of 4 years, but I took stops in bulimia and compulsive exercise land, which were NOT ideal. Those years where I tried to do it on my own ruined my career, my marriage, and I ended up in treatment (while at a normal weight) anyway. Gaining weight in recovery sucks. But, it sucks less if you have support, people around you going through the same thing, and professionals to help. Now here I am today, as a 30-something woman starting over and rebuilding my life. I wish I would have caught this early by being brave enough to get professional help.   One thing I noticed in treatment was that all of the young patients were anorexic, the middle aged tended to be over-exercisers, and the older were all bulimics. It's because at some point, your body will rebel against the starvation. I literally woke up in the middle of the night while eating, not realizing how I'd gotten into the kitchen. You will start and not be able to stop. At first you can starve and exercise your way out of the holes, but eventually they get too big. Then starts the B/P cycle, which almost certainly results in weight gain.   I beg you as a person who wishes so desperately to rewind to a few years ago. Be brave. Get professional help. Your brain will tell you they don't know what they're doing, but they do. They really do.   Cheering for you today and always.",False,False

Those are really helpful. Keep talking about it and writing about it, but focus on shifting your inner monologue to positive self talk and forgiveness.",False,False
