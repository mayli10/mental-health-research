A lot of the things I would regularly binge have kind of lost their appeal. Ice cream, mountains of dollar store bulk junk food, and my Dominoes order of green pepper cheese pizza, cinnamon twists, and Parmesan garlic knots, sometimes with an extra side or desert. I don't even look at the cheap cookies and candies I used to buy at the store, and the last time I had pizza, and ice cream I felt unsatisfied and disinterested. I guess that's a good thing though! I used to like pizza a lot, but now I can refuse it easily because it's associated with all of that binging and I just...don't want it anymore.   &amp;#x200B;  That being said, if someone put the little round Tombstone pizzas in front of me, I'd probably enjoy it just because of the nostalgia. I had them all the time as a kid. And I'd love to try a veggie pizza.",False,False
