My bf left me because of my mental illnesses, and it triggered me to stop having a shit about being concerned about the way I look.  \&gt;Cue stopping a month-long binge cycle immediately  I tried so hard to get out of that shit, but it was goddamn impossible.  Iâ€™m happy about that..but now Iâ€™m eating less than 1000 Calories a day...which tbh, is a lot more than I have in the past, but considering I donâ€™t care, why am I still restricting even a tiny bit when I was just going to maintain...Weird.",False,False

I mean, it is a vanity thing but it's also a control thing. It depends on my state of mind. I bounce back and forth from making sure I'm eating healthy and getting everything I need, and trying to lose weight the right way and maintaining tight control of all my macros and micros, and if everything is shit and I dont have the mental strength to manage everything, I just fucking starve. It comforts me being able to control something sometimes. Of course more often than not, the control isnt there. I binge and hate me self. Rinse wash repeat.",False,False

The voice eventually disappeared  for me but damn, be prepared if she ever comes back. She recently returned and it's hell. It will be so, so difficult but no matter what remeber that the the voice is not there to help you. The voice is not the only thing you can trust. The voice is lying to you and manipulating you. Listening to the voice isn't the only way to succeed, be happy, pretty, beautiful, or handsome.   This is only if the voice disappears and then comes back. I'm so sorry hun, we've all reached that point. Our final ""goal."" It's the first time you may ever be the tinniest bit closer to recovery, if you want to recovery. It's perfectly okay if you're not ready.",False,False
