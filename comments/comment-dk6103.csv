It's disgusting to read those posts. I just saw one the other day where a guy posted a picture of his wife and basically said ""haha divorcing this bitch"" as if somebody he loved enough to marry is worthy of being tossed to the side and left and called a bitch online without any sort of thought. I don't understand how over 100,000 people can be so sociopathic. It's scary",False,False

I know especially a few years ago was the height of online wide-spread misogyny, and there would be online forums dedicated of men sharing their experiences of “putting a woman’s confidence down a notch”, especially pretty women. Negging and stuff, too. Look at mgtow, it’s so gross.  If he wanted you to hear, that should tell you something... because men usually just straight up ignore women they think are really “ugly”, not make it a point to point them out.",False,False
