Initial phase of restricting is good. I feel good, happy, in control. I'm productive and making progress towards my long-term ultimate goal. There's the tiny voice at the back of my head warns me about the potential subsequent binge. But I ignore it - ""This time will be different"" I tell myself. ""I've learnt from my mistakes"" I convince myself.   &amp;#x200B;  A week passes and I start to get the crazy food thoughts. I do everything I can to avoid eating, usually by immersing myself in anything food related, including but not limited to   * extensive meal planning (usually in a very OCD way) * scrolling through restaurant/ delivery menus and imagine what I would order * watching food related videos - my favourites being ""10k calorie challenges"", ""what I eat in a way"", any sort of recovery video involving watching someone eat * think about what I would do for my own 10k calorie challenge * talking to people about food  Despite the obsessive food cravings, my brain, at this point, still has the ability to convince myself that I'm not hungry, to trick myself into thinking that everything is okay as long as I don't give into these cravings.   &amp;#x200B;  The downward spiral never begins with a binge. It always starts with small food swaps or slight leniency e.g. 2 oreos instead of 1. And before I know it, the binges have arrived. The warning voice is still there, telling me ""I told you so"". I just don't care anymore. Then there's all the unsurprising, guilt, shame, disappointment we're all familiar with.   &amp;#x200B;  I don't hate the restricting phases. In fact, during the binge phases, there's nothing more I want than to be restricting again, constantly trying to trigger myself to go back in the restriction. I may feel cold, tired during restriction but at least I'd be productive. Being in the binge phase means  feeling like shit yet moving no closer to my goal.   &amp;#x200B;  Each time this cycle repeats, I feel a little more despaired What makes this cycle different to the last? It might feel different but it felt different last time too.   &amp;#x200B;  I do have a therapist who has shared some helpful tips with me that I haven't included here (exploring things apart from food that make you happy, breaking the unbreakable link between body image and self worth blah blah blah) But this reply isn't that, this was to organise my unorganised thought process that had sparked from reading your very relatable prompt. All the words just flowed out and before I know it, somehow, it has amounted to half a page.   &amp;#x200B;  I hope we get better at this :)",False,False

What I've just never understood about recovery is that it seems to assume your problem is almost entirely emotional, and that if you get better emotionally, you'll be fine with gaining weight. Basically it assumes you'll start considering thinness unnecessary or a net negative.  But.....while I acknowledge I have emotional problems and have an ED for many reasons, some practical and some irrational......I also just.......really really REALLY value being thin. REALLY. I have valued it from a very early age. I just like it. It makes me feel attractive. It makes me feel closer to the way I experience God. It makes me feel like the Other, the alien, the stranger that I feel like on the inside (in a positive way). It makes me feel like myself. I usually think I'd rather be dead than not thin, partly because of social consequences but also just because I AM thin on some freaking cellular level.   I feel like most people who recover don't enshrine thinness to this degree? Like if you told me I had untreatable hyperthyroidism or something and could eat freely while staying thin, then I'd look at treatment very differently. But the crux of it really is that recovery would ask me to gain weight, and I simply...can't. Won't. Not interested.",False,False

For me my ED is still really recent. About 6 months ago I realised my eating habits have always been somewhat disordered. I was overfed to obesity as a kid and now at 21 I can’t help but crave sugar and junk food non-stop. I don’t eat most meats (can’t stand the texture or fat), I barely eat anything that’s good for me and will go through at least 2L of plain ice cream and a full jar of peanut butter a day to satisfy my cravings. Restricting is a new practise of mine. It puts me in control, distracts me from my depression, and it satisfies my daily suicidal and self harm urges. Sadly that’s the only reason I started this in the first place. This time next year I’m hoping to either be dead or close to it. There’s no goal weight, just an end destination. On my journey so far though I can feel myself becoming more vain and attracted to having a deathly underweight body. Restricting and forcing myself to exercise daily (which I HATE doing in the first place) has also strangely motivated me to start acne medication and Invisalign (two birds with one stone y’all - can’t eat with my retainers in). I honestly don’t know what to think or where I’ll be in the future. That uncertainty scares me more than dying.",False,False

It took me almost 3 years to start being able to accept my body and function with a rational mindset. Even now, I still spend most days struggling.

I started learning how to communicate more effectively and working on my depression and ocd. Bit by bit it became easier. Instead of looking at the whole picture, I had professionals help break it down into little chunks I could manage.  Basically, I realized there is nothing I can't do.

As they continue to starve themselves, however, the brain responds by increasing the number of serotonin receptors to more efficiently utilize the remaining serotonin. So in order to keep feeling better, the person needs to starve themselves further, creating the illness’s vicious cycle.

My thoughts were the exact same 3, 2 years ago. Basically, I reached a point I could not function with my anorexia. I didn't eat, ever. I was terrified of everything but water. And then, because I spent 6 months biking 3 hours a day and eating nothing but peaches and cucumber, my body broke and I started binging. Hours a day, thousands of calories at a time. Naturally I gained weight, and I blamed myself for being weak and a failure. I almost died in a suicide attempt and spent 9 months in various treatment centers and programs.    It took me a year of finding a new purpose after treatment for me to actually start recovery. The scariest part of that process is letting go of the safety of restriction and something you call home. It gave me security, power and purpose, why let it go? Because goddamn you will be so much happier, so much more vibrant and there will be no more fear or avoidance of something so normal and everyday for everybody else. Yes its hard, so fucking hard, but what is there to loose? If you needed an organ transplant and would die after spending many years isolated and in pain if you didn't, but there was a major recovery period, wouldn't you do it anyway? If you want a purpose, find that purpose in bettering yourself. Heck, you can even put that focus into fitness and health and say fuck you to the disorder thats tricking you into destroying your body and mind. I found mine in art, specifically ceramics. Through that I found the best friends I've ever had, the love of my life, and a brand new veal for living. It's really incredible once you get through the scary parts.  Everything telling you there is no reason to recover is part of the eating disorder. The mistrust, the delusions and the false hope that everything will be alright is keeping you trapped. Think of a victim being groomed into staying with their abuser. It's that disgusting. I promise with my whole heart its not a trick, there is a reason why this is a disorder and why people die from this. It doesn't matter how thin you are, your body can give in at any time. It doesn't matter how sick you think you are, you're still sick. You're worth treatment, you're worth feeling better. It's an unthinkable act that takes many years of very hard work, but hey, arent we used to that?  My therapist, who has been seeing me for almost 4 years now and has watched me grow up from a scared, scarily thin 14 year old to a confident and powerful adult, brought in a former patient of hers. She was one of the youngest girls my therapist (Lisa) had when she started treatment. They had met in inpatient and Lisa basically became her one to one for several months. Many years later, that little girl is a beautiful harp player helping young kids with disabilities. I asked her how she had the energy to get through recovery and commit to it.

It makes me terrified, because I feel like one day I will be forced to recover and my life will crumble. It eases my anxiety, makes me more motivated, less suicidal. I know that's bad, in some ways, because, according to a therapist, it's a false illusion. Like anxiety is not improved, just redirected into a manageable area, an obsession. the cause is not dealt with. Negative emotions are dulled, and the sense of control gives you power, invincibility. The sense of purpose gives you meaning and a drive. The future is less dark, with starvation. But it scares me that it's all false. Nothing is really dealt with, no learning or growing happens.
