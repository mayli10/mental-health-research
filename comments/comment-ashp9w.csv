So 1lb of fat is 15% bigger than 1lb of muscle. I know it's definitely not as big a difference as those comparisons photos make it out to be, but it does add up.",False,False

Essentially, you can weigh the same or more than someone else but look smaller if you have more muscle, because it takes up less space per pound than fat. That's why a lot of people in fitness and weight loss communities focus on measurements as much as or more than scale weight! It's definitely possible that you're the same size, despite the weight difference. Your BDD isn't lying to you!",False,False
