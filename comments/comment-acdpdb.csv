Like if you're going to eat a TON of sugar, it's best to eat it with other 'normal' food that has more nutritional value, so sometimes I justify it by eating veggies along side. I think it's supposed to help keep insulin levels from spiking up incredibly high, or something science-y like that. :)",False,False

At the moment just fasting for an excessive amount of time to regain control seems like the best option, but if I decide to eat, that seems like a good idea.   I don’t purge, so no need to worry about that.   I think I’ll sleep on it to set a reasonable length of time.",False,True

This balances it out, forces me to consume less of the unsafe food, and provides fiber and other nutrients which is just better for me :) for example, if I wanna eat the pizza or rice in the fridge, I'll eat the pizza or rice, but I'll ALSO eat the same amount of cabbage or broccoli so its half and half. Also, just try to remember its not the end of the world, even though it feels like it is. One binge wont ruin you, and please please please if you can, resist the urge to purge it. ",False,False
