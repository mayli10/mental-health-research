I would restrict all week and eat without limit all weekend.   Recently I went through a binge period of about a month so I’ve gained quite a bit of weight and have had to change up my routine in order to lose it, but once I’m back to a more comfortable place I intend to return to this schedule, I found it to be really effective and comfortable.",False,False

I've been doing it for 1 month straight and i don't feel like i've lost some weight. My ED brain thinks that i'm not losing weight bc of the binge's weekend so i'll probably start restricting 6 days next month.",False,False
