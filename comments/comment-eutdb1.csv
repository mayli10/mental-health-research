You can get it online or from your dentist (I think you are only supposed to get it from the dentist, but I have ordered from this site and the product was fresh). It's a treatment for your teeth that has fluoride, and minerals that actually help rebuild enamel. You can do it at home - it's meant to be taken home and it just a paste you apply to your teeth like a ""mask"". Comes with instructions and everything.  Ask your dentist about it if you're not sure. Obviously it isn't a miracle worker and won't rebuild all your enamel, or prevent all the damage from purging, but I'd imagine it would mitigate *some* of the harm.",False,False

The stomach acid from a purge will soften your enamel and it will gradually brush away if you use a toothbrush too soon afterwards.  - rise with plain water, plain water + small amount of bicarb soda or rub some toothpaste around your mouth to help neutralise the stomach acid after purging - a small piece of cheese eaten after a purge can help to strengthen teeth again",False,False
