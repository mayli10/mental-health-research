My reason most days for restricting is I work with some unbelievably conceited and corrosive people. I mean some petty and spiteful people. Who project their baggage and insecurities onto other work colleagues.   Without restricting I wouldnâ€™t be probably to deal with their bullying passive aggressive behavior. I was always raised to treat people with respect and dignity, never to raise my voice and to give respect to get respect.   On a number of occasions I have seen younger members of staff being bullied by management and one other particular person. Unfortunately I donâ€™t have it in me to walk away but without restricting. I know I would probably say something I would regret and fall into their trap.  Like I said above bank holiday weekend this week. I have been restricting all week. Restricting gives me a better appreciation of alcohol and helps me write. This weekend I will go out and party and it's the hypertension and the adrenaline in my body that will keep me going for days.  Allow me write and document my thoughts.   I will say be careful. I have been doing this a long time and have lost consciousness on numerous occasions. Broken and fractured bones. Take it from an old Stallworth be careful.",False,False
