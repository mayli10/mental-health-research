It's like how if someone's asian or black then the insult's going to start with something referring to their ethnicity.  It's the shittest attempt at an insult/camaraderie someone can come out with when it involves the word ""fat"".  There should be an exam you have to take before you can enter the world of other people to check you're not a dick.  That'd be bliss, but until then day in and out they walk the streets.  If you told them what you'd been through to get healthy they'd laugh about it together and make jokes.  On their own they'd think about it and really fucking impressed and know it's something they'd probably never be able to do.  They'd also want the ground to swallow THEM for being insensitive assholes.  You keep doing what you're doing.  It's your life to live, not theirs.  I know you can't ignore it, but that's all the comment's worthy of.  Enjoy your life.  You deserve it and those two teens are never going to be the amazing person that you are.",False,False

And passing them on the hiking trail...you have fueled your body, your muscles and brain. You have worked and nourished your body to get to this point in fitness and strength.   You are strong and beautiful.   Fuck them, cos they are empty-headed, stupid and shallow. ",False,False

Remember that inner beauty is even more important than outer beauty.  You've been proving that you're strong, dedicated, and beautiful; they've proven that they're cruel, petty, and ugly.   This is understandably going to be a bit of a hit to your self esteem, but you don't need to let them win. You can win.   Sending much love and good luck. You've been doing such a great thing for yourself. ",False,False
