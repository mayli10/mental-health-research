A lot of them have a thick seam on the shoulder to make the shoulders look wider. perfect for looking huge and shapeless lol,False,False

Sweat pants make everyone look like they have wider hips/bigger thighs.  As for shirts, go for a really unflattering cut. For an hourglass, try something like a tunic or a t-shirt that doesn't have much shape to it. If you are wearing something sleeveless or its cold, then wear a cardigan.",False,False

Try wider, narrower, deeper and shallower versions of different neck lines. One of them will make you look fatter. Generally, a deeper neck line tends to make your neck look slimmer.  2. the volume of tops and bottoms: Try a puffy top and slim pants/ a fitted top and wide pants/skirt. One of them will make you look heavier.  3. Hairstyle. If you have long hair, try curling it and add volume around your cheek and neck.   Good luck! ",False,False
