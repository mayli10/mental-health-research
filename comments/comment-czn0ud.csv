After the initial weight loss, it didn’t help me lose any weight. As long as you find something to replace the oral fixation and possibly the stimulant, you should be fine. Even just switching to nicotine gum would be a good idea, even though it’s addictive too. Please save your lungs!! Im really worried I ruined mine.",False,False

I do notice an increase in appetite, but I do this thing now where every time I crave nicotine, or have hunger that would normally make me hit my juul, I take a big drink of water. I’m super hydrated, and I’ve lost weight lol.",False,False

I was really worried, smoked from the ages of 15 or 16 to almost 30, Then I magically actually lost weight when I quit, but I think it had more to do with my starting to run more coupled with my intense fear of gaining weight and then starting an SSRI that I was also afraid might make me gain weight.

Started smoking at 19, 24 now. I've started running at night to distract myself and have noticed less Juul cravings and I'm glad I'm working out.",False,False
