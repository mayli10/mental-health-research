We didn’t treat it as anything other than what it is, a shitty painful mental illness that we all want to be free of. Is that a fucking crime? To seek help and support for that? Ghhhghh",False,True

Instead they make us out to be dumb perverts doing it for attention.  &amp;#x200B;  Dickheads lol.",False,False

Ehh, good enough. Allowed.  Support group sub: WOW this gives our website a bad reputation. What’s that? It helps people? Well, better safe than sorry lol   Fuck this noise.  ",False,False
