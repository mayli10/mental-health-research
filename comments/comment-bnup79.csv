I punch my thighs when i'm frustrated to the point where i leave bruises. I've head butted things in anger/deep pain and left cuts and marks on my forehead.,False,False

I’ve never self harmed like that, but I’d never judge anyone who does.  What I do though is when panicking I hit myself. I’ve left bruises all over my thighs and arms from that. I never knew if that counts as self harm. I’ve never heard of anyone who hits themselves so I’ve been super embarrassed by it",False,True

I’m 21 now, so Ive been suffering for 9 years now. I remember thinking and being angry, as an anorexic, that I did not get the “glamour” that other beautiful anorexics got. I felt like I was the only ugly anorexic.  Bulimia is so much more painful. I want to suffer less, that’s why I want my anorexia back. Everything hurts and I feel disgusting. I definitely struggle with glamorizing anorexia. And I shouldn’t and I try to fight against that. But bulimia just feels so wrong, bingeing feels so wrong, eating at all feels so wrong.",False,True

First of all I’m against the glamorization of anorexia like that - absolutely unnecessary. It fucking sucked and was 0% glam.  But to be honest, bulimia has sucked 50000x more. I have suffered more. Been hurt more. If EDs are about suffering then bulimia will do it for you.  Never feel like you’re not “suffering” right. We’re all struggling; we’re all in pain.",False,False
