It's not mine.    The important part of that is that I can NEVER eat it, even if I were to measure out a small portion.  Once I've broken that barrier for a particular package of food, I have triggered a binge every time.",False,False

One time my ex partner was hungry and I was like.....uh......I have no food. Do you want some oats?   When we dated for a little while and he came over fairly regularly, I would stock my apartment with some things he likes that I won't eat like chips, mixed nuts, and packs of ramen. I'm sure just having some  fruit and maybe a couple snack things like popcorn or mixed nuts would be good! Then you can find out what she likes to snack on and get some for the future if you guys get more serious.  I haven't dated anyone since my ex but I do worry about that if I date someone again. My fridge is currently STUFFED full of just vegetables, then I have a safe drawer that literally just has like 15 bottles of sugar free syrup and multiple boxes of sugar free pudding.
