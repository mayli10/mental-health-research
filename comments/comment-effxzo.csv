But on the other hand, I consider how much my ED thoughts have literally defied all logic before, and I wonder to myself how I can possibly expect an unaffected person to understand it or how I feel.  I'll add mine.. Last night while watching old home/family movies, my mom started bragging about how skinny she kept her figure when she was pregnant with me. She even went as far as to mention the exact number of her weight, like she's treasured this accomplishment for all these years. Like, why? I'm 29 now and I first developed an ED at age 12, so all of this is not new to my family. I have been in recovery for a few years now, so I feel pressure to be ""cured"" and unaffected by comments, but goddamn that annoyed me.",False,False
