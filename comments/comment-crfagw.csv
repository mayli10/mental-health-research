I used to hate it and straighten my hair all throughout high school, but within the last few years I because way more confident and started wearing it naturally. It‚Äôs depressing to see it become so brittle and fall out.   I‚Äôll look into the powder tho! I think I‚Äôm okay with 90 cals and almond milk (35 cals per cup) for the added protein. It‚Äôs worth it. It‚Äôs prolly better for recovery too if I start becoming less afraid of calories!!  I think I can also do oatmeal with the protein powder as a meal. I just need to suck it up. I wanna work towards eating lunch and dinner. I eat all my cals in one meal at night.   I also have pbfit so maybe a shake with that and coco powder and the almond or cashew milk could be good? (I‚Äôve always loved the chocolate/peanut butter combo)   I‚Äôve always loved tofu and actually picked up some from the Asian grocery store since it‚Äôs way cheaper there. I wanna do a stir fry with shirataki noodles. I can even try with zucchini noodles or just veggies.   Tyvm for the info and thanks for making me feel better about the added cals in protein!!",False,False

Mine is about 120 per scoop. I also really love tofu and don't mind working it into my cal allowance.  I really focus on spending my cals on protein, even if I fall a bit below my allowance and don't particularly WANT to eat more, I'll still force myself to have some protein shake. I don't use the full scoop so it's around 90 cals.   I feel your pain,I love these cashew protein bars but they're so high in cals and aren't at all filling :(( I'd rather have oatmeal with added powder for a filling 200cal meal than spend those cals on a bar I'll eat in mouthful and still be hungry af   High protein things tend to be higher in cals naturally but imo it's worth working it into your allowance. My hair was falling out like crazy before I was making an effort, it's much healthier now.",False,False

Their peanut cookie flavour is by far my favourite. Their chocolate silk flavour is good too, it tastes like the milk that's left in the bowl after chocolate cereal in the best way possible.

Also it low-key gives me an excuse to be very selective when I eat out, it's an easy explanation for why I eat a salad every time I'm made to eat out.  And I get plenty of protien. I eat more than most people I know because I add protein powder to my oatmeal and just generally enjoy higher protien foods.   Although if you think vegetarianism or veganism would make you worse, fish is a good option for low cal meat.",False,False

Like super thin deli ham or prosciutto or pancetta.  I guess because they're so thinly sliced that I can eat what looks like a lot for actually not that many calories.
