A member appeals with the human aspect as support. You are reminding them you are a person who has needs to be met. It's worth a shot.  But first I really do reccomend calling your insurance and asking why it was denied. I mean ask for the legit reason that should be in the letter you (should have) gotten a copy of. Because if the doctor forgot something, you need to know.   If you get a half answer or they won't tell you. Hang up. Call again. Get a different representative. It can make a difference.  3lbs from uw can mean the difference between a medically necessary diagnosis code vs not med-ness code. But still...what do they want you to do? Fast for a few days and get sicker before you can get help?",False,False
