Not only are there not many gummy bears in the bag but the bears aren’t plump and juicy like the standard haribo ones. I’m not complaining though because they force me to portion control and that is very much appreciated.   I didn’t realize how much fiber they have...I might just need to buy them again.,False,False

I liked the fish but they aren't anything like swedish fish. They have a more gel-type texture. I think it might be the safest to try.  The peach rings have a powder that I expected to be sour but it's rice flour. Not bad, but I wouldn't buy them again.  I thought the sour gummy bears had a weird aftertaste. My boyfriend liked them.  I haven't tried the sour blast buddies or regular gummy bears.",False,False
