I used to watch ""secret eaters"" to trigger me but now I feel even worse than the contestants so I stopped watching.  I hope you'll do good too...I sadly don't have tips about restricting too much, because I never sustained this issue. But I hope you stay in the best health possible and I hope you'll find help around you when needed. You too are worth so much more than any ED!",False,True

You are worth so much more than any ED, and I hope that you see that one day. I am still going through it, but it’s on the other side... I fear I am restricting too much. But it’s working. So, really this food thing is hard. And people (for the most part) don’t get it at all. So I’m with you there.   If I could offer, I found something that really helps me through a binge craving. This sounds mean and I would never admit this to those who know me, but I go watch some HungryFatChick on YouTube. She seems like a nice lady, but watching her sit there with a meal that could feed 9 people and shovel it all in makes me not even hungry anymore. It’s gotten me through almost 30 pounds so far. It also helped me get rid of my fast food addiction.",False,False

I really want to avoid a full blown binge eating disorder, but I already have a disordered eating pattern, and I had these episodes many times in the past, but I used to compensate by fasting. It's just that right now I am unable to do it and I don't have an alternative. I want to lose the weight, and I'm not trusting the therapists around me, I already had very bad mental issues for years and never found the help needed despite trying ten therapists, and my issue was quite ""common"" (depression...). They tried to cure my asexuality, one diagnosed me as schizophrenic, another said I was borderline, and another said I was bipolar, while the rest did nothing basically. Going through therapists in my area burned me out a lot back then, I don't want to come back with a problem that I feel is even more personal, I fear how they'll treat me and I also don't have the time anymore, I don't even have the time to sleep correctly, nor the money...  I am going to watch Katie Morton and see if it helps, and I'll keep your words with me everyday, thank you very much for your concern and your kind words.",False,True

I WAS you. Don’t do this to yourself.  My best friend died when I was 13 years old. Shortly after, I was sexually assaulted by my step father. I started binging as a means to stuff down the emotional pain. I was a very healthy 115 pounds at 5’1. Some many life events later, and I ballooned up to my highest weight of 228 pounds in August. I have been restrictive eating for 3 months now, and am finally back in the 100s (as of today actually). It feels great to be getting my health back but trust me... don’t do this. Find a therapist to talk to. Watch some Katie Morton on YouTube. But don’t ruin your life with a binge eating disorder to deal with sadness. It hurts, but there are so many people here that are more than willing to help you cope. I hope you are doing okay.",False,False
