I‚Äôve had two RMR tests done in that time and got near identical results both times- my metabolism is 19%(!!!) slower than it should be for my weight and height and age. So I burn 1150 calories a day without normal movement factored in. Which SUCKS.

However, the amount by which this affects weight is highly debated. As far as I'm aware even with ''''starvation mode''' it's highly unlikely that any adult TDEE will be under 1200 cals a day. If you low restrict, or even high restrict while doing anything at all during the day that isn't sleeping, then you will still lose weight. Starvation mode be damned.  If it was as real as some therapists would imply, then actual starvation would not be as life threatening as it is.  Look up the Minnesota Starvation Experiment also.",False,False
