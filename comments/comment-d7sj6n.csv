I was always the smallest in my family, I achieved basically a fat free weight for a long time but through some unfortunate years I started to really lean on binge eating for support and I've gained 40? (I know) pounds from my lowest weight. I know that weight isn't sustainable for my body now but regardless. At this same time my sister who has always been bigger than me ( weight+height) has now lost all of her extra weight and is smaller than me and it's caused me a lot of issues. I obviously love her but I can't stand to be around her because it reminds me of all the weight I've gained purely because I was sad. Regardless, the best way to loose weight is to try to be as safe as possible. I eat 800? calories typically and work out on the treadmill for around an hour 200 cal and it has effectively toned me greatly in the past. I highly recommend this so you can keep the weight off!!",False,False
