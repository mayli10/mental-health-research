A lot of us I’ve found use our bodies as a way to communicate to others what we can’t say, for whatever reason. It’s one of the reasons people self harm, use drugs or alcohol, etc. we do the best we know how when it’s too hard to say “I’m suffering”— and we want people to know it, to take us seriously. There’s nothing wrong with that. It’s normal. It’s human. I’ve grown up around people who aren’t very good at expressing emotions and their care and concern for others, and it’s affected me. I’m very similar to you in this sense. You’re not alone. Your suffering is real, and valid, and you deserve to be told every day that someone cares for you.",False,False

Idk kinda cheesy but basically you aren't attention seeking, you are just getting the care your mind needs via how your body looks",False,False

I was a quiet child and I often slipped through the cracks - only noticed when I achieved something brilliant, or when something bad obviously happened. My wants and needs paled in comparison to the bright and vibrant world around me that I just didn’t fit in to. But, suddenly, when I got sick, my needs began to be seen, people stopped to really look at me for the first time in my life. This isn’t attention seeking. It’s just wanting to be noticed and looked after for once in my damn life.",False,False

The distinction that is really important to me is that it’s not the coldly calculated manipulation that people seem to mean by “attention seeking”. Something willfully turned on and off for clear and specific ends.   It’s only me, a hurt and confused human, desperately reaching out to fill genuine emotional needs that I don’t know how to articulate. Needs that I don’t know how to ask to have filled (or how to believe I deserve to have them filled). Needs I don’t even know how to allow to be filled when emotional sustenance is on offer. It’s not some bitchy adult supervillain. It’s a small scared little girl who never learned how to be loved.   ...soooo that got long. (I think about this a lot I guess)",False,False
