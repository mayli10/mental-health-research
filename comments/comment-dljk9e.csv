Work is the only time I feel like I’m doing something worth while which is the closest thing to happy I usually get. I’m not tempted to numb myself with booze or weed with work and it sometimes - rarely - makes me feel a little nice about myself when I do a good job.   Things aren’t looking good for me right now though. I might lose the one job or more likely be forced to quit.,False,False

On my days off, I find, if I force myself into a lie-in, then spend an hour or so in the gym, and then go for a wander somewhere, I can avoid being stuck in the house for at least half of the day.
