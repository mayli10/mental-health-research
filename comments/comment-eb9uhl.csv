My point was that if a person only needs 1500-2000 calories than the amounts I have seen listed for various maki rolls could be enough for someone depending on their eating habits and so it was reasonable for you to just order one and nobody should have judged you for it. I'm sorry if I didn't make that clear and hurt you.",False,False

I do think itâ€™s worth pointing out that not everyone with an ED obsessively counts calories (at least from what Iâ€™ve gleaned by lurking here). It could also be that I have disordered eating, not an eating disorder, but thereâ€™s no way I could talk about this with anyone irl so here we are.   As to the cost, I didnâ€™t pay for it, but the place we went wasnâ€™t too pricey (my roll was about $5).",False,True
