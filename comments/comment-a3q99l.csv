The actual amount depends on your starting weight and your height. Short people show quicker results because every lbs is a larger portion of their total weight. And losing 20 lbs at a normal BMI is rather obvious, while the same loss on a large person might not even be one dress size down. ",False,False

But I know it's hard to visually see the difference, so I actually measure my underbust, waist, and hips every so often with a tape measure. For me (I'm tall), it takes about 10 lbs to see a difference in my measurements. So 20 lbs on you is probably a pretty big difference :)   Take care of yourself â™¡",False,False
