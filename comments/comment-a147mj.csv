He even was like “people die from that!” I didn’t actually say ed. I told him my diet and weight goals. He doesn’t want me that tiny because it’s dangerous. I was expecting him to react like that. He’s very caring so I knew it would scare him.   It’s okay to be nosy lol,False,False

Person one was an ex who was actually a best friend and support at the time..  Let me live with him however, my ed was left as my issue to deal with alone a majority of the time. If it ever came up it'd be me talking to him about it by my own choice nd he basically addressed it as ""therapy maybe? "" don't mean to hate on him, tis my own issue to deal with but I really needed a meal plan / support and I was too afraid to do it myself.   I was basically crying for help. If I was him I would of tried to find a diet we could do together or talked to me more as its an everyday struggle... But turned out he secretly had a vendetta against me anyhoo so part way maybe he didn't mind knowing I was struggling?. I had a high expectation that he'd care enough to help and that was my fault thinking anyone else but myself could really help me.    Person two is still a current friend, we talk diets sometimes,  other health / bodily things and he basically just let's me vent when I need (he's majorly an online friend) he doesn't really give input either but he's openly said its because he doesn't know how to help but that he's always here.  I appreciate him as I can disclose gross bodily things and he doesn't judge. He's recently had a gross medical issue himself involving poop things and due to how I've shared in the past he felt comfortable confiding in me which is a relief because I want to make sure he's okay.  Technically some others probably know, the guy I like knows but we don't really talk about it. Hes tried to interrupt purges, tried to get me to eat, and he's tried to stop binges. I love him and just want to make sure he's okay,  and so as per late its been easiest to just restrict to avoid the awkward binging / purging tell tale signs.  Most people don't really notice if you're not eating unless youre with them all day..    In conclusion I guess I've realised there's no point talking too much about it to others anymore beyond online. I'll only recover when I can seriously push myself to it and I'm not at that stage yet. Most people have a similar reaction that indicates I am in this alone at the end of the day.  My health, my responsibility..  ",False,False

Had you been doing behaviours that harmed other people, was this just a reaction you expected from him in general, or did he just react in anger about your mental health diagnosis/challenge (however you choose to frame yr ED, sry I'm never sure how others frame things).

I was doing it the “right way” for a couple of months but then I told him all my feelings if guilt over going over my cal limit where back... he was supportive and made me get therapy, but sometimes he doesn’t understand what I’m going through.  I purged for the first time in 3 years last summer and told him, it was after we had dinner out with his mom. He told me that maybe I shouldn’t go out to eat if I’m just going to throw it up... and I realized that he had absolutely no clue. He wasn’t trying to be mean, he just had no idea what having an ED is like. I had a long talk with him and a few weeks later he was more compassionate and had obviously read material over EDs.

At first there was a lot of misunderstanding. My family didn't ""get it."" They didn't see that it wasn't something that I could just stop and my parents/grandparents still don't really respect that it's an illness. My brother, though, has been nothing but supportive. That's a common theme I've noticed as I've become more open. Younger (and thus generally more understanding about mental health issues) people tend to be a better bet. Friends and relatives of a younger demographic are a safer bet, IMO, when it comes to ""coming out."" That said though, I'll add that I live in a very, um, stubbornly non-progressive town that's basically socially stuck in the 1970s and in a more modern area I suspect you'd have even better luck.   There have been a lot of scenarios that have led to a confession on my part.   I'm pretty thin and frequently cold, and at times when people have commented on that I'll just tell the truth. It's usually totally ok and they've never turned on me over it.   On one occasion I mentioned it to a girl from my psych class my senior year of high school who I did/still do consider a friend. We were talking about what we'd covered in class one day during the obligatory ED unit and I mentioned that I had firsthand experience. Turned out she did, too, and I think it was a positive experience for both of us. ",False,False

It has been bittersweet since. He is genuinely concerned for my wellbeing and wants me to get better. He is a great listener and I’m glad to be open with him. But his idea of what getting better looks like isn’t reality. As much as he cares, him trying to feed me doesn’t help and makes my anxiety worse. I have tried to explain how this feels and he just doesn’t understand. I think I wouldn’t change telling him since now he understands my behaviors at least, and we have opened discussion (i think with anything in relationships, communication is the ultimate problem solver!). But it has definitely brought some hardship to our relationship. Thanks to him, I’m seeing a therapist for the first time in my life this week who specializes in women’s issues and eating disorders. I’m happier about this than everything else. Overall I think telling him has been a good choice. ",False,False
