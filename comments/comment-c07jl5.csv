No appetite decreases, no weight decrease. Only I wasted money on it.   Everyone has different reactions. Some people get heart palpitations, some people get light headed, some people get addicted.   Honestly, I don't think it really does anything more than placebo. Caffeine alone can be an appetite suppressant, you don't need to risk your health for the chance of mmaaaaybe upping your metabolism by a few calories.",False,False

One time I had such bad heart palpitations I had to pull my car over and lay on someone‚Äôs front lawn until they passed. Took a solid 15 minutes for my heart to calm down, and the people really wanted to call 911 but I was too afraid to have anyone find out I was wired on diet pills so I fought them on it.  Another time I passed out when I was running (energy is artificially high - actual energy is 0). Shot right off the back of the treadmill into a brick wall. Hilarious now, but traumatizing at the time - there‚Äôs some psychological damage for ya üòÇ   Not to mention that it‚Äôs hard to buy in most places and loading up on congestion medication makes you look like an absolute crackhead. And then there‚Äôs the can‚Äôt eat, can‚Äôt sleep, can‚Äôt stop being a huge irritable bitch, can‚Äôt stop shaking bullshit that comes with a regular stack. But don‚Äôt forget to up your dose because it‚Äôs efficiency plummets with time!!   I could honestly go on for days about the bullshit that comes with an ECA stack. Works a trick, but your mileage may vary.",False,False

Also, taking bronkaid is just annoying, the pills are huge and if you break them in half you just live in fear of accidentally getting the gross taste of them in your mouth. With all the issues in my disordered life right now I am actually happy to have gone cold turkey on EC stacking.",False,False
