But I trick myself.  When I plan something like ""Oh I have to eat less tomorrow, I ate  so much today and yesterday... tomorrow I am going to have a small dinner, and mayber a snack prior around lunchtime..""   This won't work. I'll get hungry and think ""fuck it"" and just eat.... and eat...    When I don't think about food, but just have a lot of stuff to do and I am studying and working and whatever... then I don't start eating and eating and when I realize this, I am often like ""should I even eat dinner now? I am not even hungry..."" but this doesn't happen often, because I always think about food all the time and that I should eat less etc.     But I noticed, when I have a really structured plan, kinda scheduled my whole day, and planned EVERYTHING I am going to eat and the time when I am going to eat it, I can hold onto that plan. You know what I mean?   For example: ""maybe a small snack for lunch and a small dinner in the evening"" is too unspecific, so I eat too much in the end, and more than a small snack during the day (more like 20 snacks -.-).  But when I say: ""I'll eat an apple at 1pm and 2 potatoes with 1/2 zucchini + 1 carrot + 1/3 cucumber + fresh baby spinach as a salad at 5pm"" then I'll set the ""food alarm"" on my phone and start working/studying during  the day without snacking and just doing my stuff I have to do, until the alarm rings and then I just eat what I planned out. Fasting for days isn't for me since my circulation system will just shut down after 10 hours and I get so shaky and dizzy that I can't even climb the stairs up to my room. So I tried intermittend fasting and when I really plan the meals beforehand, it actually really works for me. But it has to be specific to work.",False,False
