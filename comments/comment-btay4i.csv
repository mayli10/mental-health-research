A guy friend walked me home so I would be safe. I drunkenly repaid him with all of the Fiber One muffins I made. He called me the next day super pissed. I didn’t wanna tell him about my eating disorder/obsession with fiber. So I just played it off. To this day he still bad mouths me because I “poisoned him”,False,False
