We are long distance so when I visit, we will see each other for every meal so I am forced to have some semblance of normality in my daily meals. I just hate feeling bloated around him - it's not very sexy.  It's gotten better lately because I will divide my plate in half and then save the rest for later. He'll poke fun at my ""small appetite"" but it's better than being uncomfortable.  I hate having larger legs than my BF but my type is long and lanky and somehow I always date green beans.",False,False

When I'm with my SO I'm USUALLY in a more positive mental space and I don't obsess over the calories in everything because it doesn't matter as much to me at the time. It's odd because I don't binge, but I eat kind of normally? I'm basically that meme that's like ""eating disorder who? I don't know her ðŸ¤”"" but then also if we're fighting then whoo boy it's starvation city",False,False

I gained something like twenty or thirty pounds when I first started dating my gf because she eats horribly so I did too. Problem was I ate way more than she ever did and then gained that weight. I love her so much but I hope I never do something like that again,False,False
