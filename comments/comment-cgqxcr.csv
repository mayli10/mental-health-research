I guess instead of having that constant back and forth argument in my head I should just go like ‘it’s done, it was necessary, discussion over’ and try to stop trying to rationalise my way out.  Thank you so much, this is some much needed advice.",False,True

I like using radical acceptance when I can. You already stated the logic behind why it was totally okay and in your best interest to eat a meal. Keep reiterating that to yourself whenever that persistent bitch of an eating disorder feels like piping up and making you feel guilty. When I’m trying to avoid using behaviors to compensate for something totally necessary for my health and well-being, I just try to interrupt the ED voice when it’s talking shit, like, “Welp. We ate the soup. There’s no going back now, and it wouldn’t benefit me in any real way even if I could. It’s fine, and the world isn’t going to end all because I ate some soup.” Or something along those lines. Just keep interrupting the voice until it subsides for the time being. Hope that helps a little. :]",False,False
