You‚Äôre welcome here. No matter what eBaying says, you‚Äôre welcome here. And if someone invalidated that, it‚Äôs because they‚Äôre trying to validate their own feelings. But you are always welcome in this community. We are all here to support and relate to each other. I love you so much.",False,True

Especially not to wish to have one.  I wanted to make a point that your struggle with disordered eating is valid even if you it‚Äôs not what people think of immediately when they hear eating disorder. That, exactly, its NOT always how it‚Äôs portrayed in the movies. It‚Äôs not pretty. It‚Äôs bending over the toilet with an entire six pack of ramen noodles  coming out of your nose because your sinuses are FUCKED. its backsplash from a dirty gas station toilet. It‚Äôs your stomach gurgling so much during finals that your professor hands you a granola bar and asks you to please leave the room and come back after you‚Äôve ate. And then standing in the hallway having a panic attack because you‚Äôre about to fail your final AND eat 200 calories you didn‚Äôt plan on.  But because you don‚Äôt purge after every meal, people hesitate to call you bulimic. Or because you eat at all people don‚Äôt recognize you as anorexic. And it‚Äôs this same mentality that escalated my issues with food.  And I want other people who feel like that to know it‚Äôs valid. And most importantly, it‚Äôs valid to seek out help for an ED even if it‚Äôs a mild one.",False,True

I monitor my macro/micro nutrients. I would never touch diet drinks. If my hair ever started to fall out I would eat more. If I feel faint I eat. These types of posts seem like theyre from someone who watched a movie about EDs and are trying to force themselves to have one. Theres no right or wrong way to have disordered eating.",False,False

I‚Äôm not diagnosed with any sort of ED but I go through cycles of basically binging and purging except I purge through taking a bunch of adderall and using the loss of appetite as an excuse to barely eat. Not sure if I‚Äôm even welcome on this sub but I find it helpful and hella relatable so here I am.,False,False

If you feel compelled to do these things and have a v difficult time resisting. If you purge, restrict, count calories dangerously. Its disorder. Even if it lacks a name in your mind. Please dont invalidate your own struggles because i can assure you theyre there and you deserve to recognize that and you deserve to recover",False,False
