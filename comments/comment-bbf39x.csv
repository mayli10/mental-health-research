I dont go to the gym either now but my sport of choice is skating and i do restriction band exercises at home and have a kettle bell too, resolving to sport was what got me out of my extreme restriction and then slowly out of my ED behaviours. Losing hair was so traumatic to me i keep running my hand through my hair every minute or so to see if its falling out still months after it has passed. It fucks you up so bad i wouldnt wish it on anyone. On the bright side they grow back really quickly when you stop restricting, there will always be time to recover and get better. But for now i will keep you in my thoughts",False,False

I’ve been trying to do body weight exercises at home but a gym isn’t really a possibility for me. It’s not quite that bad yet though. I’m not really at that point where I’m ready for recovery yet. I gained a lot of weight this past year and it’s really getting to me. I was underweight and then I gained almost 100 lbs and it makes me absolutely sick,False,True

But recovering was so worth it. Look into reverse dieting and start going to the gym (and start lifting) if the calorie amount makes u uncomfortable. But this is the only way to stop it. I cried so many nights thinking i will have to shave my head bc there was no way to stop it, i thought i would be completely bald by christmas.",False,False

I remember that prior to my ed every time i was on a diet i had to stop bc my hair started falling out. During my ED i tried everything i could; horseroot extract, castor oil, maca powder, b12, iron, folic acid, biotin, nutrient dense foods, fats, high protein,keto, expensive ass hair multi vitamins and potions. Nothing worked. Only when i started eating 2000 calories a day while exercising it stopped (I only gained 1kg in 2 months while doing this while losing cm off my waist so it was worth it. also im 5'4). It also is a huge sign of hormonal imbalance, when i didnt have my period it got to its worst. Prior to the worst of my ED i had dyed my hair black, and 3 months after i noticed i still had no roots showing meaning my hair growth also stalled. The only way out is starting to lose weight the healthy way. I study biology and i thought i could hack my body with the just right nutrients but its not possible.",False,False

Around 6 years ago I had hair down to my ass. Almost all fell out, ended up having to chop it off to my neck. It has been six years and it is finally starting to get long again. Takes longer with disordered eating I guess. It started happening again a few months ago and I was just like I have to eat a super low calorie but high nutrient diet and it seems to help. Granted I don't restrict now as heavily as I use to, but when it started coming out in geater quantities again I almost had a heart attack. I feel you on this whole heartedly. I would love some info as well.",False,False
