They would go to the doctor for something that wasn't weight-related, explain that they elected not to be weighed, then proceeded with their appointment. It can be super uncomfortable, but advocating for yourself should be your priority. If the doctor needs your weight later for pharmacology reasons, you can do a blind weigh in.",False,False
