You‚Äôll burn those 12kcal in about 3 minutes of walking, so I wouldn‚Äôt bother but it‚Äôs up to you.   Personally I don‚Äôt count zero calorie stuff and I haven‚Äôt found it to sabotage my weight or anything so I definitely wouldn‚Äôt worry.",False,False

Unfortunately I‚Äôve just been eating wayyyy above my TDEE so I definitely gained at least a couple pounds. Hopefully not the 4 the scale is showing but ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è.

By this logic I also know I should be counting coke zero and diet coke as a couple calories but for some reason I don't.  I count black coffee as 5 kcals per cup.,False,False
