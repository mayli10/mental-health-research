Like on the one hand it’s great because I’m now a 4-6 (2XS) or 6-8 (XS) in their sizes, but on the other hand it sucks bc like I know I’m not actually a size 4-6 so I feel like a fraud.",False,False

Their sizing is just too black and white with little to no grey area. H&amp;M hasn't been that confusing for me but that may be because I've only ever bought shirts and skirts from there rather than jeans.   Underwear has really taken a comfusing turn in terms of sizing charts, too. Small feels like a medium, extra small feels like a small, etc. Shit's ridiculous. At least bras are still safe (shout out to my main bitch Victoria's Secret.)",False,False

I can never fit my boobs, shoulders and arms into their size small but the rest fits perfect, if I go up a size it's too loose all over but still tight on my chest.. and my tits aren't even big...  Don't get me started on H&amp;M, I've had many a breakdown in their dressing rooms. I remember a pair of jeans that were 3 sizes too big for me being tight one time. Mental. ",False,False

I used to buy cheap work pants there when I fit their plus sizes but now those fall off of me and I’m just way too big to fit their L.,False,False
