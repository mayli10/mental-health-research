Not a huge thing but it's nice to know ppl think of your needs and want to take care of you even with something as ""ugly"" as an ED ;w; sometimes I ask my gf to cook for me and she weights stuff out and writes it down for me so I can log it etc without me asking her to do so and it feels rly loving  (also she used to be able to pick me up and carry me around before I regained weight and fuuuuuck I miss that so much!!!)",False,False

I am so, so grateful, and his love and support has actually made it easier for me to deal with my various mental illnesses. I think many people who donâ€™t love themselves may not know how to accept love from other people, which is important in a relationship, but that doesnâ€™t mean they are doomed to be alone until they love themselves. We are all works in progress, and having someone whoâ€™s got your back can make a huge difference when it comes to healing from mental illnesses.",False,False
