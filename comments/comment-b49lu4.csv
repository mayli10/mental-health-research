Once I had half a bagel with cream cheese in the fridge from the day before, it was nearly dinner time and I hadn't eaten anything yet that day, and when I tried to make myself eat the leftover bagel I started crying. It made me realize how awful things had gotten and how awful eating disorders are in general. Even if you can't  make yourself eat a healthy amount I want you to at least know you can eat a lot more than 500 calories before it has any effect on you. How much depends on your TDEE, but probably a minimum of at least 700 calories more. Typically only people who are short and severely underweight would gain anything at 1200 calories.",False,False

To use an example specific to this sub, an underweight young woman with anorexia nervosa may lose her period, lose head hair in exchange for fine body hair, experience muscle deterioration, and have severe bloating and water retention when she does eat food, which increases total body weight. Her body is experiencing symptoms of starvation and the body's adaptations to low food intake and low bodyfat/weight to maintain homeostasis.  Her body does not retain bodyfat, and she will not lose weight more quickly if she eats more calories. That's nonscientific but is the colloquial definition of ""starvation mode"".  The reason people often lose weight when eating more is because they were eating so little day-to-day that they'd started having binge or reactive eating episodes; the higher intake meal plan reduces the episodes and allows for sustainable weight loss.  Neither OP nor any human being within a wide weight range would gain true body mass and add to their bodyweight from eating only a 500 calorie noodle packet on top of fasting.",False,False

You cannot create mass out of thin air. Food is how we get energy  Sure, as you get smaller you need less energy. And starving will make you more sedentary and therefore lower your BMR  But at the same time, as long as you eat below your TDEE it‚Äôs literally impossible to gain real weight (aka not bloating/water weight/constipation). Your body cannot run on 0 energy, so it cannot create mass if you‚Äôre eating below your TDEE. ",False,False
