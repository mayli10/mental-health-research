I didn‚Äôt want to assume, and I only googled quickly bc my boyfriend flipped out when I mentioned it, saying I was clearly just obsessed with weight and judging her, etc (even tho I‚Äôve been recovered from Ed for a while now, he‚Äôs always just jumping at me if I mention anything related to it). I was surprised when it wasn‚Äôt the first thing to show up on my search tho.    But I feel validated now! She just does not look naturally skinny - it‚Äôs either an Ed or she has some other health issue going on (but then she‚Äôd be more likely to just admit that).   And to be clear, I wasn‚Äôt trying to hate on her or judge her, it just sucks that she‚Äôs presented as a healthy person and people see her and think her appearance is normal. It‚Äôs shitty for everyone for it to go unsaid. And for her especially bc I‚Äôm sure she‚Äôs under an insane amount more pressure now to keep up that image. :(",False,False

She is of course absolutely gorgeous but on unedited close ups of her face, even with heavy makeup at events and in glamour shots that are mostly edited, she looks very tired for only being 22. She just looks generally unhealthy. I dont want to be mean or anything but I noticed because a lot about her face and skin looks like mine did at its worst. On top of that, it‚Äôs well known that she dabbles in drugs so I‚Äôm guessing that plays a part in it too.",False,False

I got a breast reduction last month and was left heartbroken when I saw that my surgeon didn‚Äôt give me the flat chest that I wanted. Sure, I got pornstar-esque boobs (DD-&gt;D), but he basically only gave me a lift, not the reduction I asked/paid for. Sad lyfe.  I get so jealous of children because they have no boobs they have to worry about, and it‚Äôs quite disgusting actually.  Maybe I‚Äôll be happy he didn‚Äôt cut them off when all of this is said and done, but for now, I wish I really regret not going to a different doctor to the point of being suicidal :( sad lyfe x2",False,False
