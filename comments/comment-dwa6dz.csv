That's just what happens. Time flies and before you know it, you're in the same eating habits as when you were 15. It's sad and depressing but it's the only thing you know. If imagining being a grown adult still with an ED scares you, good. It should scare anyone. If you are able, run while you still can. Good luck.",False,False

Her social life isn’t impacted at all by her disordered tendencies... just her meals are super sad af... things you’ll see on 1200isfineiguess and 1200isjerky.,False,False
