I even find excuses for the scales measurements. ""Maybe I moved it a bit"", ""I went to the gym this morning, it's probably just sweating and I didn't drink enough"" etc.   I absolutely don't see myself as skinny. I'm officially in the underweight category, yet I just list all the things that I find too fat about myself. I'm probably never going to be satisfied about my body, but I'm trying to listen to what people are saying.   I'm seeing this guy and he keeps telling me he's worried that I count calories and do all these weird diet methods (OMAD, for example) and I love that he says those things but I really just can't believe it when he says I'm perfect the way i am. In my head, he's just saying this because he likes other things about me, and that makes me look a certain way in his eyes. ",False,False

I know natural weights are basically a myth anyway, but I feel like I'm lying to people just because of how much unhealthy shit I've done to get down to this weight. ",False,False

My BMI is typical in the low or middle range of normal. I’ve never been underweight. I think it’s because I’m very short and I have big boobs that make the rest of me look less fat. I don’t think I’m even that much thinner than my friends. ,False,False

When I had a 20BMI a few years ago, my family told me I was getting way too skinny even when I was clearly in the normal weight range. Now, I'm at a normal 22BMI right now and people say my body is ""goals"", I'm ""skinny"" and want to know my diet (heh, wait till they find out what my real diet is).  It's actually pretty crazy. People used to think Paris Hilton was slim and healthy (and she is), now I see people call Taylor Swift and Ariana Grande anorexic while saying Demi Lovato is considered skinny (Demi is gorgeous but I would consider her average). Just like how they discredit VS models as not being ""real women"" just because they exercise and practice portion control instead of eating TGI Friday's every other day.",False,False

I was talking to one of my friends I met recently so he hasn't seen me at a higher weight, and I mentioned how I wanted to lose more weight before going to a concert so one of the band members can notice me (fun fact my bby didn't notice me lol) and he said I was already so skinny and there's no need to.  I wear (very slimming) leggings to our class and super oversized sweaters to hide my tummy so I guess it makes sense he'd think that I was thin, especially since I hold all of my fat in my stomach/hips area which my lovely sweaters cover perfectly.
