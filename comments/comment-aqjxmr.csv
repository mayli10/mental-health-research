There’s a local restaurant I want them to try &amp; my go to order is a salad bc it’s fucking delicious. Idk the calorie count but I barely use the dressing so it doesn’t stress me too much to eat it without having the calories  Lol that’s smart! I usually pull the “SO never wants to eat ‘insert place w food I’m comfortable eating out’ so when I eat out without him I always want it” ,False,True

(Shameful story: one time I bought a gift card to Panera so that if any of my friends want to eat somewhere calorically unsafe I can be like “actually guys I got this gift card I need to use” it worked)",False,False
