I walk myself through what I think will happen, and then I walk myself through what I will do if that happens. Sometimes, having a plan for what will happen if the worst occurs helps me calm down. Telling myself, ""theres almost no chance this will happen, but if it does, I can do xyz"" helps me calm down. Then, I walk myself through the BEST case scenario in which I am funny, confident, and happy. I visualize myself like that and constantly go over it to block out negative feelings. That way, you have a plan for the worst, but you are planning on the best.  I hope that helps",False,False
