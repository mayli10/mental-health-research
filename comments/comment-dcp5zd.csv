I‚Äôm glad you‚Äôve stopped, addiction is a constant battle.",False,True

Self harm is one of my biggest regrets I‚Äôve ever done in my life and if anyone is reading this and thinking of doing any form of self harm, please don‚Äôt it only starts of good then it just ruins your life like any other addiction.

Most people who binge and purge but do not restrict are either average weight or over weight. It just ruins your teeth, throat, and bloats your face.         I highly do not recommend itüò¨ I stopped purging a couple years ago and I'm still damaged from it.             Don't make yourself throw up. Don't try to ~get~ an eating disorder. If you wanna lose weight, eat a bit under your TDEE. Losing one or two pounds per week is healthy, and when you lose weight in a healthy way it's consistent and safe.",False,False

For some people, it's a method of self-harm. Some people feel ""clean"" after they do it and they're ""empty"". Some people just can't stand having food in them. Everyone does it for different reasons. However, it's still very dangerous and can really fuck up your electrolyte balance and digestive system",False,False
