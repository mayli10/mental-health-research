We even run together now. And its not like heâ€™d leave me if I gained weight or anything heâ€™s favourite thing about me is my brain in he makes that very clear. But weâ€™re allowed to have preferences he likes skinny/slim girls and I prefer myself that way too so itâ€™s a win win,False,False

I would feel awful if my boyfriend triggered me directly like that. The guy I'm dating is suuper skinny and forgets to eat, so he's naturally like that but he has never said anything about me! But I don't know what he thinks really. I just feel like I need to think about what I eat while he can eat anything and stay very skinny, and it's difficult when he wants to go out to eat :/",False,True

My boyfriend only likes skinny/slim girls and always talk about have women get bigger with age. And heâ€™s pretty skinny but have a bit of a stomach developing so heâ€™s been running a lot lately and letâ€™s me know. Now that I started fasting and running and loosing weight he told me heâ€™s proud that I actually donâ€™t only talk but also do something about it (unlike most ppl) He doesnâ€™t even mind me fasting and even suggested that we could stop going out for food and he could skip eating at home when Iâ€™m over and fasting.  Basically heâ€™s been super triggering which is actually helpful, I canâ€™t help but think that if u was skinny enough he would worry instead of encouraging me so Iâ€™m actually more determined now to loose weight",False,False

It's like relationships these days seem to revolve a lot around food. I'm actually terrified of the thought of getting with someone and then gaining hella weight, so I've decided to just stay single haha",False,False

My bf actually triggered my restriction even more when we first started dating(heâ€™s naturally very skinny) but after I ended up in a clinic and almost dead he worked really hard to help me recover. It worked for a little while until I gained hella weight and just started restricting secretively behind his back. So I guess a relationship with the right person might help your recovery but it could also make it much worse.",False,False
