I believe your first thought about someone or something is what you’ve been trained to think or what you instinctively think, the second thought is how you actually are as a person.

I'm not saying this to condone stigma against people who are overweight. Its just a reality that needs to be addressed. People who judge fat people, especially if they have an ED themselves, most often can't help it and most wouldn't act based on those thoughts anyway.
