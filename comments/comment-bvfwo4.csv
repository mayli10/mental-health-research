Whoever we go to therapy, or she sees me crying or starving myself, she’d cry all the time and keep shouting “why is this happening to me” over and over and makes it all about her. Then my brother keeps telling me to stop making her feel like this when it’s not even my fault?  And actually, turns out my mom struggled from bulimia for a while. I only noticed it a few months  ago. It blew my mind because I didn’t even think my mom knew about EDs because our country doesn’t focus on these things. Back when I was nine, I’d always hear her throwing up in the bathroom, and the toilet always smelled like vomit.    She also does the force-feeding thing. But doesn’t really shout or anything. I know she cares about me and just doesn’t want me to go back to the same road again, but I just can’t eat without binging, so I don’t eat at all.",False,False

My family therapy was just one big show about how I was hurting my mom by being hospitalized and how I was the only one who could make all the hurt go away by just being happy and I didn't want to even do that. (they all agreed to ignore the eating disorder since my weight was above bmi 17,5 and my mom had the therapist convinced it was about attention.)      Someone else has already given you the link to raised by narcissists. I think it won't hurt for you to read a bit there. I'm not the biggest fan of some of the drama on that sub, but the heart of the stories do not change with that. And I personally find them very helpful when I am in self-doubt.",False,False

My heart really hurts reading what she has put you through, and for what it’s worth I’m so sorry she’s put you through so much. There’s a subreddit here called r/raisedbynarcissists that might be worth checking out.  In my opinion, I think living with your mother again would only hurt your mental health. Her telling you that doctors and therapists don’t understand you just seems to be an attempt to isolate you from the help you deserve. You need a support system full of love and sympathy, and from this post it does not sound like your mother provides that ):",False,False

The fact that you can’t tell if this is normal is so devastatingly sad to me. I’m so sorry for what you’ve experienced. Not normal. I’m glad you’re finding ways to do this recovery thing on your own terms and in your own way. I hope IP is exactly what you need. I hope you can find a good therapist too who can give you the perspective you’re looking for by posting on here. You need a professional to help you out of her mental/emotional grasp and find recovery in those areas too.   You can do this!!! Be strong and fight for yourself! ♥️,False,False
