He seems very open and accepting. I have so many crushes on professors because of that and honestly, all it had was positive impacts.

The first time I went to uni (dropped out lol) I ended up being in a tutorial class with the subject lecturer, who I thought was super smart and lovely, and she told me how great she thought I was and asked me to please reconsider when I said I was thinking of taking a year off for personal reasons. I did take the year off and didn't see her again after that, but her nice words still stick with me now years later.   I'm glad you had such a good experience, I think, being friends with people in academics now, that lecturers do really enjoy when their students engage with them and care about them, because I think a lot of students think they're too busy or won't care normally.",False,False

I have a favourite prof who emailed me last week about an assignment I didn‚Äôt hand in, saying it wasn‚Äôt like me to miss something and if I wanted to hand it in late (it was due over a month ago), she wouldn‚Äôt penalize me. She said I could talk to her if I‚Äôm struggling with anything, but I felt weird being like ‚ÄúI relapsed hard and all my mental energy goes towards food and the lack of it!!‚Äù so I said I‚Äôm struggling, but would prefer not to get into it.
