I think I do have low motility, I have very frequent episodes of constipation (usually 4-7 days between). Kinda gross, but I canâ€™t really digest sesame seeds, and thatâ€™s when I realized how long it takes me to process food. I think I had sushi one day, and then finally passed the seeds like 50 hours later. XD  But yeah, I donâ€™t understand why it would still be undigested. Itâ€™s hella gross, and even after hours it has the chunky texture of beans. I probably need to see a doctor but I kinda donâ€™t want to know the extent of damage Iâ€™ve done on my body.

I was also thinking that maybe your LES (Lower Esophageal Sphincter) isnâ€™t functioning properly anymore, which could explain the food coming back up, but it doesnâ€™t explain the fact that it isnâ€™t digested after so many hours. You could also have low motility? I know that some people who b/p a lot have a risk of getting Gastroparesis. These are all just thoughts, of course! I am by no means a medical professional haha (just a psych student ðŸ˜‹) so I was just trying to think or anything possible that could be contributing to your symptoms. But if it is really bothersome, please do get it checked out! I hope everything turns out okay though!! ",False,False
