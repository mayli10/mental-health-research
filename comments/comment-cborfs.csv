Thereâ€™s a common misconception that only kids can have type 1, but some people develop it later in life (and itâ€™s completely genetic bc itâ€™s an autoimmune disease so like weight really doesnâ€™t factor in). The treatments for type 1 and prediabetes/type 2 are very different, so I think itâ€™d be really good to make sure.   And, as someone who was diagnosed with type 1 almost 4 years ago at 16, I really just want to let you know that itâ€™ll be okay. Diabetes sucks. Like REALLY sucks. And it can complicate ED related things as well for sure, so if youâ€™re in treatment for your ed I would certainly mention this and your feelings about it to your treatment team. Itâ€™s scary and itâ€™s an awful situation to find yourself in, but itâ€™s not the end of the world. Youâ€™ll be okay. I hope that things improve for you soon, and that you can start working towards improving your health. ðŸ’œ",False,False

I would follow your doctors advice, and make sure they take your ED into perspective, I would guess they wouldnâ€™t change your diet so you lose weight, but more so to stabilise your blood sugars.   Stay safe - seriously - do not make yourself ill. And donâ€™t worry.  (My husband has type 1 - Iâ€™m not very familiar with prediabetes so I hope my post makes sense.)",False,False
