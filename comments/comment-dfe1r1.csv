Express how scared you are that she’ll break up with you, because after all it’s not your fault, even if it seems like it; it’s the illness. I guess if she can’t at least show you some compassion and try to understand then maybe she isn’t the one for you. If she truly cared for you then she’d be understanding.  However on the other hand, she might be angry that you’re doing this to yourself and doesn’t know what else to do other than threaten you with something she knows you care about. It could have even been an “in the heat of the moment” remark. She might not be able to bear to see you like this and cares for you but doesn’t know how to help; she isn’t a doctor (or maybe she is idk). It can be quite stressful to see someone you love do something so harmful that you don’t understand and didn’t sign up for.
