I remember you’re the one who said I looked like a dead person. What are you trying to do here?  First of all, yes, I tried to OD, and I needed help.  I’m allowed to swear because I fucking despise what this disease puts us through and I want others to be okay, genuinely. Lastly, everyone on this sub is suffering and I am not worse off than anyone else here- saying that can be a very triggering thing.    Of course I’m losing control. I’m suffering from anorexia nervosa and depression. Life isn’t great right now but I am trying to make it through the best that I can and this community helps me.",False,True

All of your posts at the moment (most of which you have now deleted) fall into the categories of:  -	threatening suicide and overdosing on pills; -	excessive swearing and wishing other people well whilst calling them love and saying how bad life is; and  -	treating your body much worse than the average person on this subreddit.   As an outsider to your life I feel like you may be losing control and could benefit with asking somebody for help or at least talking to somebody?   In the spirit of your posts - I hope you are fucking ok love.,False,False
