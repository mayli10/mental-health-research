A friend of mine has a large home garden and grew then subsequently pickled the beets.   They lived in my fridge for about 6 months until I rediscovered them during a binge. Well this is one of those XL pickling jars. I fucked up the whole thing in one sitting. I was high as fuck, coming off a 3 days restriction, also they were delicious.   Well let me fucking tell you, the next morning was one of the most terrifying poops in the history of poops. It took me about 15 minutes to remember the beets as I was wandering around the kitchen cleaning up and contemplating the ER.    Worth it.",False,False
