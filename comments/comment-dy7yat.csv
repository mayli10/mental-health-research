If I were alone right now I wouldn't ever have tried recovery. It really helped for me to tell someone (him) about my eating disorder and have him worry about me. I did not want him to worry about me constantly, which is why I started seeking help. So essentially because of feelings of guild and also wanting him to be happy while being in a relationship with me. Also I realized that if I don't recover I won't be able to live a fulfilled and happy life - and that's what I want. I don't want to stress about calories and weight and my body every single day of my life. I want to learn new things, have exciting hobbies, do my job well, but also spend all that time and energy on people that I love.",False,False
