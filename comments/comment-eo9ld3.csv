I know it sounds appealing. The longer your eating disorder has its claws in you, the more desperate you become and the more likely you are to do anything to lose weight.    If you do, you will inevitably develop a tolerance to whatever substance you abuse. It won't work for long and you will keep needing more and more to get the same effect.  Be careful.  Substance use disorder (""drug/alcohol addiction"") is real, and a common self-destructive condition that likes to tag along with disordered eating. You are at a very high risk of developing another unhealthy coping mechanism.  Don't tempt yourself.  For me, it started with Adderall.  Then when I developed a tolerance, it stopped killing my appetite and everything I lost was gained back.  Then I decided to start smoking.  Nicotine kills your appetite, right? I reasoned.  But it didn't stop there.  Then there was cocaine when nicotine didn't work. I started experimenting with stimulants just because I liked feeling happy for a little bit, even if it wasn't real happiness. Mixing coke with alcohol. Mdma.  Meth/amphetamines in general. Alcohol to fall asleep at night, cuz uppers will keep you awake.  It's been 10 years, on and off, and now I count on drugs and alcohol for a lot more than just weightloss.    It is a slippery slope. I know your intention is innocent, but it won't stay that way if you start. Be careful.",False,False
