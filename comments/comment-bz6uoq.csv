It can be difficult to explain why a short relationship fucked me up so bad. I guess I mean to say, I’m sorry you’re going through this right now and I hope that it starts to get easier soon ):",False,False

I’m really sorry you’re going through this, I know how hard it is, I really hope things improve and get better for you, if ever you would like to talk about it I’m here for you, it would be nice to relate to someone in a similar sort of situation I think, stay strong and take care!!",False,False
