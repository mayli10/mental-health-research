I have abnormally wide hips and when I did have a thigh gap, I would drop things through it on the floor (like a tablet during the exam which was super embarrassing) &amp; cats would not sit on my lap.  Like there's nothing good to the thigh gap. Of all things being made into ""goals"", this is the most questionable one.",False,False

The only thing that seems to have made a difference for me was childbirth. Pre-pregnancy I had to get below 42kg to get a “full” gap (it’s the full gap I “need”, not the triangle-at-top-and-separate-convex-lens-shape-below, because any contact at all seems to grate on me)   idk it’s like a form of somatoparaphrenia or something related to that, it’s illogical and irrational but hey that’s ED for ya 🤦🏽‍♀️  I guess part of my recovery has to be accepting it’s just not possible for me without being very underweight and just learning to cope with the discomfort 😬",False,False

I'm kinda thankful cos I couldn't deal with having bigger hips as I miss having a pre-pubescent body. But until I get a thigh gap I don't feel like I'm thin enough. Smh. Maybe you could try and do toning exercises to tone the muscle at the top so they don't make so much contact? It's something I've been doing a lot of recently and really helped. 💕,False,True

So why do I really want something I physically can't get?? 😂 As if its gonna change my life or something? ED thoughts are so irrational...,False,True

It’s one thing I’m struggling with in recovery tbh as I don’t think I can reach my target without the gap closing at the top (which is the bit that bothers me!) to make it even more complex to work on, it’s not even about aesthetics. It’s a sensory issue. I can’t bear feeling my thighs make contact when I walk, for me it’s like nails scraping down a chalkboard. It’s been this way my whole life.",False,False
