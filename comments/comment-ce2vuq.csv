I basically realized that I'm always going to binge if I try to avoid eating all day... So I decided to use my ED against my ED. I want to be a fasty good girl Ana ™️ so I don't eat between 10pm and about 5pm the next day. I spend all day funnelling my binge desires into planning my giant meal. I start in the morning and let my imagination go wild, think of all the binge shit I want and let myself imagine eating it. As the day goes on and I get hungrier (and usually start wanting real food not just donuts) I amend my plan and decide on a blowout dinner. On my way home, I start logging the ""binge meal"" and can usually find a happy medium where I'm eating 1200-1700 cal and it's decadent as fuck. I go home and prep the entire thing just knowing the clock has to strike 5 and I'm doing this shit! I lay it all out so I can see the volume/have it ready to go and go to town once the clock hits the designated time. Usually part way through I calm down and save some as leftovers. Sometimes I don't.    Sometime I still binge or go back and get more. Sometimes I eat one thing and the devil leaves me and I'm like.... ""I don't need this, I'm gonna have a diet soda and some yogurt the go to bed"". I do break my own rules, I don't always eat enough, and I eat too much. But I haven't purged in a really long time. YMMV, but the emotionally addicting part for me seems to be the planning and prep steps, and once I change my mindset to ""I will binge at this time"" instead of ""I'm not gonna binge, I'm not gonna binge!..... Oh fuck it!"", It got so much easier to step outside myself and not always go through with the 3500+ cal I WANT.  Yes i do still spend all day thinking about food and I'm still kinda restricting and binging, but it's harm reduction for me. My teeth, throat, face, and weight are better for it.",False,False
