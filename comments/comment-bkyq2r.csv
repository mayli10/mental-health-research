Or I pretend that this is complete news to me like “huH wHaT wEIGhT loSS???” For instance the other day an older coworker (picture a mom type, so societal pressure to be respectful) said “Every time I see you you’re skinnier!” She tries to feed me. 😒 I literally start laughing and go “What! No way! It’s an illusion!” And didn’t even stop to make eye contact, just kept walking. If I pretend I don’t even notice the weight loss you can’t accuse me of having an eating disorder, riGHt???? 🤪🤪🤪",False,False
