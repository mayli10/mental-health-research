Pizza and pasta is so good though no matter how evil i think of it, do you have any replacements for pizza/pasta, like gluten free?  I don't know too much about celiac other than not being able to have gluten because of it harming your intestines.  awww thats so sweet of her to use a code for you and be super lowkey about it! thats a true friend right there!! I definitely have found some replacements, its just not as fulfilling as regular stuff? if that makes any sense, like if imma eat a whole pizza I'm eating a whole pizza not to be healthy and most GF things are super healthy lol! I have made my own pasta which was really cool!!  Dude i feel the whole ""commenting on my food choices"" i literally cannot escape it because people are always like ""omg can you even eat anything here??!! are u gonna eat at all!?"" like stop worrying about me i am fine i will eat when i want and what i want ma'am! But i definitely feel pressured when there is GF pasta/pizza/bread on a menu and friends/family want me to get it because ""I NeVeR GeT To HAve It"" but i just wanna salad because I don't want to feel like crap for eating pizza or pasta!  I also am having a total trip because when I used to eat pasta all the time and unhealthy food (before the relapse lol) I was having so much trouble with doing activities, but now that i eat way more plant based and have no gluten- even if im only eating 500-1000 a day, i feel way better...   So yea sorry for my long ass reply lol! just nice to know someone else gets social anxiety when eating out! I'm here to talk/rant if ya ever need :)",False,False

Pizza and pasta is so good though no matter how evil i think of it, do you have any replacements for pizza/pasta, like gluten free?  I don't know too much about celiac other than not being able to have gluten because of it harming your intestines.  I was scouring the menu earlier, looking vegetarian options, or something low calorie, I'm just worried if my friend will say something.  She often says ""is it playing music?"" Which is her weird way of saying if my stomach is growling because she knows i dont eat breakfast and eat lunch later.  And i dont know if she told her sister about my disordered eating, once she offered that her sister would help me with creating a diet plan since she knows a lot about that, and I'm assuming her sister knows it's me.  Just paranoid someone will comment on my food choice or force me to eat.  Today she literally almost jammed her chocolate/protein granola bar in my face while I was talking and fbqbebwbwbw I just brushed it off.  Again, thank you for answering!",False,True
