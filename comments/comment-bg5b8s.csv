You can be overweight and have one. Its one of those things people think = skinny, but its all about the shape of your hips and shit. Most thigh gaps are faked anyways. Stupid, unrealistic, illogical thing they push on us.",False,False

I'd never gotten obsessed with it before I had one because I assumed it wasn't possible. I had always identified so strongly as having big hammy, strong legs like a horse or something that having a symbol of ""thinness"" in my legs literally changed my entire perspective of myself.  Anywho, to this day there are girls skinnier than I am whose thighs don't touch. With the exception of extreme emaciation there's no way for some girls to get thigh gaps, and there's nothing whatsoever wrong with that. I hope one day I can overcome the cognitive dissonance I get with stuff like this.",False,False

I know for me personally 100 was bad. I got very sick and was working 10 hour days with a fever in the middle of restricting. It was terrible. I'm much happier where I am now.
