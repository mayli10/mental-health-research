One is for candy I‚Äôve collected over the years that I couldn‚Äôt eat at the time; either it was seasonal and I didn‚Äôt want to miss out, or it was something I bought while travelling. My SO estimates we‚Äôve got about fifteen hundred dollars worth of candy at least, just sitting in our storage room.   The other is highly calorific, calorie-dense ‚Äúhealth‚Äù food; boxes and boxes of protein bars, nut butters, healthy snacks, energy balls, flavoured nuts and nut clusters, etc. When I find a new brand I can‚Äôt stop myself from ordering something.   The last is cheese. This is especially stupid because obviously cheese goes mouldy and you have to throw it out, but any time I find a new cheese I‚Äôll buy it and add it to the hoard; about a third of our fridge is taken up by cheese, most of which will eventually get thrown out as soon as it starts to go bad. Worse is that I‚Äôll also collect stuff that goes with cheese, like little jars of jam and chutney and pate spreads.   I get soooooo territorial about this stuff too, like once my dad was staying with me for a couple of weeks and one morning he mentioned he hadn‚Äôt been able to sleep and he nearly grabbed one of the chocolate bars from the candy hoard to graze on while he was up, I nearly went for his throat üôÑ",False,False
