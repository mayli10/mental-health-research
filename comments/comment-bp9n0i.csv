It does suppress your appetite completely so I wouldn’t necessarily say you need to eat more to not lose weight, you just need be mindful about getting in enough calories to maintain. It’s hard to stomach actual food when I’m on Ritalin and I know that I can’t bring myself to eat huge amounts of food at once, so I just make smoothies to sip on throughout the day. I think it helps to make sure I get some calories and nutrients in without the overwhelming task of having to eat ALL my calories within the few hours that I am not on Ritalin each day.  Hope this helps! X",False,False

Like if I had had them in high school, my anxiety would have been so much more bearable because I could have focused to some extent.  They are stimulants, so it’s important to cut back on any other caffeine or you could get very anxious/tics like eye twitches. It can also be a diuretic so you should keep track of how much you’re drinking and make sure you get enough. For me it really reduced my appetite so it was especially important to keep track of my food and drink intake so I wouldn’t get dehydrated or dizzy.   They’re not for everyone but it is definitely worth a shot if your doctor recommends it.",False,False

I can’t tell you about other ADHD meds like Adderall, but with Ritalin: HOLY SHIT. I felt soooo clearheaded and I kid you not, whole writing that essay that I’ve literally been putting off for a whole month, I didn’t even get the URGE to get up and distract myself or touch my phone. It was like all the signals in my brain that scream “this sucks!!! go do something else!!!!! this is rlly boring!!!!” just went away, and all that I could think about was the fact that this essay was something I needed to get done, plain and simple. I was so calm and collected about it, no frustration or boredom, just pure focus. It’s just amazing. I did get a dry mouth and had absolutely no appetite so I’d recommend eating before you take the pill. Honestly if ADHD has been affecting your ability to do well at school/work/life in general like it has been with me for years, I think medication could bring really positive changes and increase your quality of life! Obviously talk to your doctor about it because everyone is different, but personally I do think it’s worth a go.",False,False
