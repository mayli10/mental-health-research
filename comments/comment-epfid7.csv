Something else it could be:  Depending on your type if ED, and the fact you mentioned anemia, there's a possibility it may have been a seizure or something similar.  Bulimics and anorexics are at a higher risk of seizure activity, and you already have another risk factor that makes it possible. Certain medications may even advise people with having/a history of bulimia *not* to take it; that's how much of an influence our EDs can have on our neurological functioning.  When you think of a seizure, you're probably picturing the kind where the person loses consciousness, falls down, and has convulsions (tonic-clonic or grand-mal).  However there are different classifications and not all of them present as obviously as that.  An example includes a petite mal--it reminds me of what happened to you, but it's not exactly similar.  There are many different types that are worth investigating to see if any applies to you.  I don't have a medical background so don't take this suggestion to heart.  The only reason I bring it up is because I had a single seizure, and after being rung dry from all the tests and appts and consultations, the doctors were baffled by the cause.  Doing my own research to find out wtf happened by myself led to the discovery that disordered eating *coooulld* play a role in events such as this.",False,False

It makes me wonder if we potentially share a similar condition that may/not be related.",False,False
