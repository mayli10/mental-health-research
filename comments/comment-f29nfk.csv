I think anything that helps him feel agency wrt food will work towards making food and eating less scary (imo sensory stuff is not purely down to that but every little bit helps), together with patience and positive feedback at home and in therapy once you get to that :)",False,False

He is supposed to get prescription ensure but I'm going to try involving him in the process of making food so he can show me what he needs. If it's overwhelming I can move him away from that. He is a wonderful kid and definitely puts pressure on himself (he will overpunish if he gets in trouble by grounding himself; another thing we're working on).,False,True

I can recommend \[this site\]([https://www.ellynsatterinstitute.org/how-to-feed/childhood-feeding-problems/#the-picky-eater](https://www.ellynsatterinstitute.org/how-to-feed/childhood-feeding-problems/#the-picky-eater)) (the specific part linked and other parts, just look around and see what looks helpful), it helped me a LOT as an adult when all my childhood I was just considered a nuisance pretty much. The key for me is having a variety of food available at mealtimes, seeing people eat it and enjoy it of their own free will, with no pressure to eat it myself (basically using positive reinforcement only, \*no negative reinforcement ever\*). Over time that creates positive associations that can override the fear/aversion to a specific food. Your son seems to be putting some pressure on himself to be a good role model (and it's likely school will contribute to food stress) so it's important to get this idea across to him IMO, so he knows for himself that food isn't threatening - it'll give him the courage to try new/disliked stuff of his own accord and maybe even internalise the want to work on his food aversions (that's how it is for me at least, obviously this all took time). If you're worried about calories you might wanna try adding some cals to the ensure via cream/full fat milk or peanut butter for example. From my own experience, I would avoid making separate food just for him or supplementing with hyperpalatable high calorie food, it might work short term but long term it made me \*even more\* picky and gave me the world's worst food habits (eg. when I moved out from my parents at 22, I lived off grilled cheese and ice cream for a year). Once you get around to ADHD medication it'll be good to make sure you talk about the ARFID too, as stimulants are first line treatment and they typically kill your appetite (luckily there's non-stimulant medication!), which is the last thing you need here :P  FWIW I also have ADHD and I'm pretty sure I developed ARFID as a kid from a combination of sensory issues and undiagnosed celiac making me sick randomly. None of this was diagnosed when I was a kid bc my family didn't give a shit, so I'd say by getting your son treatment now you're doing great :) I wouldn't worry about other EDs bleeding into it, I have pretty strong AN tendencies but they developed separately and 20+ years after my ARFID did.  Anyway lol sorry I wrote you an essay! Hope some of it was useful. There's also an ARFID subreddit ar r/ARFID that you might wanna read/post to. GL!",False,False

I second the other comment saying that dairy is fantastic. If he's drinking chocolate milk, I know they're not usually for kids but would a chocolate flavoured powder+milk protein drink help? I'm thinking like the ones Slimfast ( [https://www.amazon.com/SlimFast-Original-Replacement-Vitamins-Chocolate/dp/B001KYVXEW](https://www.amazon.com/SlimFast-Original-Replacement-Vitamins-Chocolate/dp/B001KYVXEW) or  [https://www.amazon.com/dp/B017WGI2BI/ref=dp\_cerb\_1](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B017WGI2BI/ref=dp_cerb_1) type stuff. You can probably get these products cheaper in-store if you can find them or something similar).   These drinks taste like chocolate, which is your son's thing, but they contain a load of vitamins and nutrients and protein as well. Obviously, speak to the doctor before giving your kid protein shakes, I just thought it was worth mentioning as an option.   If protein shakes aren't an option, then Weetabix does breakfast drinks that would be suitable. The Weetabix chocolate drink provides similar nutritional and calorific value to what he would get sitting down and eating a bowl of chocolate weetabix cereal.   [https://www.amazon.com/s?k=weetabix+drink&amp;ref=nb\_sb\_noss](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=weetabix+drink&amp;ref=nb_sb_noss).  &amp;#x200B;  I want to take a moment to make it clear that this isn't a result of your own eating issues. AFRID, when paired with ASD, is not the result of copying someone else. It's a deeper-rooted issue that you did not cause; this is not your fault at all.  If he's willing to eat cheese, try to see if cheese and crackers (with or without butter; the kid I know never eats butter, but if your kid likes dairy he might do) works. That'll provide protein, dairy and carbs all in one meal.  If possible, occasionally try eating out. Restaurants, fast food, cafes, whatever. The kid I know has a real issue with being able to see or smell what's cooking before he eats it, which makes giving him hot meals very difficult. But if we take him out to eat, he is MUCH more likely to eat a hot meal - even one he'd never CONSIDER touching at home - because he couldn't see or smell it before it was in front of him.  &amp;#x200B;  As for what to expect, in the case of the kid I know, the list of what he will eat changes a lot depending on his stress levels. If something is REALLY stressing him out, any and all foods he used to eat will now be untouchable and entirely replaced with a new set of foods. This isn't to say that he never goes back to old foods, nor that this will necessarily happen with your son, but it's worth keeping an eye out for and if it does happen, pay attention to what is stressing him out/what potential triggers are causing the changes.  &amp;#x200B;  And keep talking. To him; Keep a close eye on his triggers, his fears around food, what specifically can cause him to refuse different foods (is it texture and taste? in which case, would the same type of food prepared differently work? is it smell? would this work if he couldn't smell it beforehand? etc.) And to your doctor or the eventual therapist about him; They can help you cope and help him gain a better relationship with food.",False,False

We can get him to eat chocolate ice cream and chocolate milk. I'm going to see if we can get chocolate ensure as well. I've worried about a sugar addiction but honestly... I'd rather get him to a healthy weight first. His multivitamin is a gummy, which helps. Occasionally he will eat veggies to be a good example to his brother, but it's strictly three bites and no more, almost to an ocd extent (asd maybe?). Little brother watches everything he does and wants to be just like him.",False,True
