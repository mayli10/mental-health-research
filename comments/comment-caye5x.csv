You're gonna ask people with eating disorders for weight loss advice? Let me break down for you why your post is wildly insensitive and offensive: this isn't a dieting sub, there are plenty of those. This is a sub for people struggling with mental illness and shit like this validates people's eating disorders in the worst possible way, because it makes us think of ourselves as experts at weight loss or some nonsense, when not a single person on here loses weight the healthy way. Not to mention one of our rules is not to encourage this behaviour in others.   You are in the wrong place. My eating disorder is not your get thin quick scheme.",False,False
