Idk maybe I'm unfairly potraying my interpretations on that girl based on her FB (we only met once since she lives quite far in a different city and they are long-distance)",False,True

Literally none of the people I know, whether they're healthy or have/had EDs, have ever posted their BMIs on normal social media. And trust me, I've known some sick, sick people. To do this really reeks of some sort of disordered thinking (or at least a dismally poor understanding of what an underweight BMI means and that it's not something to brag about).  I think you 100% made the right call in unfollowing her. Good for you.",False,False

But if you have loving parents, I am sure they will support you. I will be sad if a loved one does not reach to me for help tbh, that is what we are for. Share as much as you are comfortable. And you can work with a register dietitian to get a healthy weight loss plan if you want, but a dietitian is still a good idea to not be so focus on 'what to eat' that is hard to balance.

I think I might tell my psychiatrist, the bigger problem would be with my parents..they really love me and care about me so I just feel so guilty that they would have even more to worry about..also - I know this thought is unhealthy - but I'm scared to telling anyone will destroy my plans for the weight-loss, I will have to eat and gain weight and I'd hate that..",False,True

Depression and an ED can be related (comorbidity is the term) .  Maybe throw some hints about it. 2. ED affect anyone, no matter their weight, and the health consequences are not unique to sever underweight cases.  3. Feel completely free to unfriend, block or unfollow anyone that makes your mental health decline, even if it is not intentional or seems silly. That is actually something brave to do and shows a lot of self care.  I am proud you did actually I should do the same. ",False,False

I would have probably done the same if it were me, or just hide her posts in case unfriending her could cause suspicion lol. But I have to say, you don't have to be ""skinny enough"" for it to be a problem. If you can, and want, you should get help before it develops into something worse. ",False,False
