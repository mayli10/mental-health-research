During treatment i’ve been trying to challenge that to see if it’s still true, I ate whatever weird things I’d been craving and even ate meat a few times. It wasn’t as good as I remembered it, and I also felt uneasy about it but not because of the cals but because of how those foods were made.   I decided to stick with veganism but not to eliminate treats. This means buying dairy free halo top, vegan cupcakes, whatever I was craving but the vegan version. I feel much better about where I’m at with it now.   This is just me, try and be mindful of why you’re making these choices, if it’s just because your ED tells you to, check in on that and challenge it",False,False

I've been vegan for a while. Animals are my number one priority, environment is my second priority. I've recently added eggs back to my diet though.   But a lot of safe foods, it's best for me or more convenient when it's higher waste.   For soda, have you considered a sodastream? Significantly less waste that way! Plus cheaper overall!!! I would highly recommend it.   I think just doing your best. I'd consider maybe trying vegetarian (not full vegan) and see if you can adjust some safe foods the way. Like don't get rid of eggs but maybe can adjust some meat or something like that",False,False

Obviously its varies a lot depending on what you eat and how your ED presents tho. Although helping the planet is very important, you need to put your mental health first. Just reducing your animal consumption is great if you can't become vegan. You can look into other ways to bring down your waste like cardboard packaged bathroom products and buying clothes second hand. Maybe in a couple years you'll be in a better place to go vegan but if it damages your health atm you'll never end up doing it. Best to go vegan when it's safe for your health.",False,False

I’d really like to start buying my produce in bulk instead of in bags. Wanna know why I bought bagged potatoes instead of “loose” potatoes?? The “loose” potatoes were bigger and the idea of consuming 50 calories more of a potato for a meal made me so anxious and frustrated that I couldn’t do it! It’s so frustrating and silly.,False,False
