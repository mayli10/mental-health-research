I've been super serious about the under 1000cals everyday thing for over 2 months too and we're almost the same height.

My period had always been light, but suddenly when restricting it got really light and I didnt even have one for a month.  I talked to my doc not even thinking about my eating but now I'm attempting recovery and at 1650 and its fucking BACK and HEAVY. Everyone is different but it's possible (esp with exercise) to make it go away even at a healthy BMI",False,False
