Something that helps me is literally playing tricks on my brain? I know this sounds silly but I REALLY have trouble seeing myself as the size I am vs the size I was 65 lbs ago. For example, I have a medicine cabinet with a folding mirror on the doors. If I stand right where i'm bisected by the crack it makes me look wider than I am and my brain goes, yeah, looks right. But then if I sidestep to where my whole body is in one mirror panel my brain goes HOLY SHIT i'm waaaay not as fat as i thought?   The effect only lasts a minute but at least it's given me some ammo to challenge the negative body thoughts. ",False,False

There's way more to it, obviously, but I feel like I've spent my entire life like this, so no wonder my view is distorted.

I'm on a relapse after four years without behaviors and this time I can definitely objectively notice when I've lost weight and see myself as skinny.
