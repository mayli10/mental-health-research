But if you wanna work on quitting, maybe try to start doing it less and less each meal, try to swallow at a pace comfortable for you. Even if you only get one swallow in, it's progress. I say this because from what I understand the damage caused from c/s is the body prepping digestive enymes and not using them, resulting in damage to your digestive tract. I'm sorry if this wasn't helpful, but i'm glad your seeking out tips for harm reduction. Thats a wonderful thing.",False,False

Instead, swish with water for a few minutes to get those sugary particles out from between your teeth and gums, and then brush.  As for quitting c/s, it depends on how you do it. Do you do it only to ""binge""? Or are you doing it with like, every food you eat? If you are doing it only to ""binge"", maybe you could try drinking water in between foods that you c/s. For example, if youre planning on c/s a candy bar, you could stop halfway through, drink a cup of water, and see if you want to continue or not. I was thinking maybe feeling full and taking,a break halfway would help. Also, think about when and where you c/s. In your car? Alone? (Like me lol). If you can switch up your location when you feel an urge, that could help.   Lmk what you think about this ‚ù§",False,False
