I only feel like being productive when I am fasted for like 2 days and don't feel fat. I pretty much just lay in bed after working out on days I feel gross, which is so often. I pretty much binge, purge, fast and work out. I also have agoraphobia that's triggered by my BDD. I think it's just an anxiety/ocd thing. We don't think rationally, etc. I would say, give yourself days to rest and than push yourself to be productive even if you feel gross.  Being around people you admire can be a good motivator to be more like them. Just try to get used to eating like, one good meal a day, and than using that healthy energy to live your life. The longer you have a healthy routine that you're comfortable with- the more you will assimilate. I always realize that after I binge, regardless of my weight, I feel super guilty. I can't eat normally like you said. I'm envious of people who have self control and, like you said, don't seem to think twice about the food they eat/their body.",False,False
