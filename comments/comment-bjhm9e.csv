It's extremely common especially in european countries. I'm always extra careful about who i'm talking to after I've posted online about my disorder",False,False

He was friends with a guy I dated. Not kidding, the last contact my ex had with him was Michael (We all knew him as Ren) saying my ex was crazy for quitting a job.   The dude seemed normal enough at the time. Basically seemed like a normal geek dude. My ex said he knew Ren was into bdsm, and had a dungeon in his house, but he didn’t think anything of it at the time.  I think this girl’s issues, although with this dude appearing to be normal, created a serious hellstorm.",False,False

A well-rounded person would hopefully be able to see this whole thing as crazy and fight tooth and nail to get out. I know I was severely depression and felt like trash when I got sucked into the same type of situation (comment above). I really hope she's getting counseling and meds.,False,True

(i can even give proof if yall really want)  i think she had to repeat a grade or two in middle school?  8th grade was when i was in my lowest point in my eating disorder. I was underweight and my life was a huge shitshow but I did get help and got so much better until junior year when my eating disorder creeped back up onto my life.    She was in my social studies class which was the last period of the day. We waited outside because we had trailer classrooms at my middle school and she came up to me and she was like asking me how i was so thin and to tell her my “secrets” and all of that shit and i was so fucking confused and i remember just shrugging it off but i was like oh FUCK YEAH and it just fueled my eating disorder. I told my best friend who was also in the class at the time and she was telling me how the girl would sing songs about someone named “anna (aka ana) and anorexia and starving herself on the school bus. (She also has schizophrenia if i remember correctly.) Then she went missing about a year or two later i think but she was found and i read on the news that this guy starved her  She sat in the front of the class and was always on some online chat website. I remember because my social studies teacher called her out on it one time but she kept doing it.   Holy fuck,False,False

I've been in the bdsm/kink scene for 13 years so I understand the issues they would have with a con/noncon relationship. HOWEVER this is why these relationships are life threatening when not done properly. My first ever RL master snapped me up when I was just starting out and thought I wanted a 24/7 slave con/noncon thing. It turned abusive and manipulative immediately. He raped and beat me, he never explained contracts or the ability to call ""time out"" to have a conversation as equals, he didn't explain limits. He turned out to be a convicted pedophile (he gaslit me into believing he was unjustly convicted) and when I got tired of his bullshit and did my own research I found out he was listed as ""absconded"" because he'd left his state to live with me which violated his parole and they didn't know where he was. As recent as last summer I had FBI agents approach me at my home and ask if I knew where he was (he'd been gone 6 years).   This story scares the absolute shit out of me.",False,True
