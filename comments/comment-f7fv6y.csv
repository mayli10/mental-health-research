So shipping doesn't necessarily have to take forever. IME the 'putting it on a plane to europe' part takes 2 weeks or so and the rest is customs/local post, so depends on that and where you are in relation to the warehouse.  Also I remembered I have an elastic fabric belt [like this](https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn%3AANd9GcR41zpW85BBxMLmPeWFQQD6CFC9LLDFBnbo8LNtiI5oP5pA6Crn)!
