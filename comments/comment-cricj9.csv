Really glad to hear youâ€™re gonna seek treatment and I hope you find something that works well for you!  Likewise and I hope you find an effective way to deal with all this, you deserve to be happy :) &lt;3",False,False

Those times are some of the darkest times in my whole eating disorder, I have never experienced depression in quite the same suffocating way. I wish I had some better advice for you... are you diagnosed with depression/taking any medication for depression? Maybe talk to your doctor about an SSRI?   I think itâ€™s also important to think about WHY youâ€™re where you are now - did you gain weight because of recovery? Or was it an accidental gain while you were still engaging in behaviours?   Either way please please remember that IT WILL PASS - I know that sounds meaningless at the moment but things will change, itâ€™s so much easier to feel overwhelmed by your ED in summer when college has broken up and you donâ€™t have a consistent schedule. Distraction is a magical thing, I think what made it so bad for me was shutting myself off in my room and wallowing in my own self-pity, it felt nearly impossible to summon the motivation for even the most basic of tasks, HOWEVER maybe trying things like cleaning your room or the kitchen?  General chores like vacuuming or something might be a way to fill up an hour/30 minutes and also give yourself a little sense of achievement at the end?if you donâ€™t feel like you can even move from bed maybe try distracting yourself with music (not sad songs! Lol) or a podcast...   I wish I had the cure for this feeling but this is the best I can do.   Sending internet hugs and sunny vibes your way tho, hope you wake up tomorrow feeling a little bit better than today. ðŸ’•  (Sorry this turned out so long! Didnâ€™t mean for that to happen :P)",False,False

I eat like a normal person, but it's a nightmare for me. I feel like a big, fat failure and putting on weight completely devastates me. I am only ""happy"" when I restrict but I know that's not the way so I keep fighting all those thoughts. It's really exhausting and demotivating.",False,False
