I was too busy with uni to pay attention to eating. And I actually mainained at BMI of 19-20 at that time. Life was perfect.  Then a year ago I moved to a different country, started feeling lonely, isolated and depressed. Fast forward to now and the binge/restict + obsessive calorie counting routine is back in full swing. I've never been this anxious in my life.",False,False

The first 2 of those I actually lost weight, then the last 3 I gained. Totally thought my ED days were behind me and ""just a phase"", until I hit my HW this year... then it was like a light switch turned on and now somehow I'm obsessive and back on my bullshit.   I get you. I just wanna be normal too. I thought the same thing about my depression being ""just a phase"" but here I am full on in the pits again, so I have to keep reminding myself that mental illnesses are lifelong and it sucksssss",False,False
