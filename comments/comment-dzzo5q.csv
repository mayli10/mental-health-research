I get so worked up trying to decide what i can eat and psyching myself up to do it...then when my plans get messed up i just c a n n o t deal. I freak out and end up having nothing out of panic at least once a month and then I'm extra disappointed because now I'm mad AND im still hungry. Its an awful feeling to have food plans messed up. Good on you for managing 5.  That guy is great though. I think it was a nice spontaneous gesture from someone who prob doesnt live with the ED food anxiety so wouldn't have ever thought extra food would be such an emotional issue.,False,False

I'm definitely not desperate enough to eat that, even reheated...",False,True

Ive had extra when I was counting on a certain amount. I think it was just a kind gesture and not meant to force you to eat. I would suggest to just eat what you planned and saved the rest for your next meal. The nuggets arent that bad reheated. Lol.,False,False

I used to work fast food and if I'd heard you were struggling with eating, I would have assumed it was a money thing.   Still, surprise calories suck and I definitely feel the whole ""can't stop once I start"", but you don't need to feel ashamed. And try not to be mad at him. It was a sweet, if accidentally unhelpful, gesture.",False,False

That is normally a faster thought in this fucked up economy. and gosh that is sweet that he risked to be fired for you.  I know how you feel but probably ED was not in his mind when he did that.,False,False

I know it didn’t help at all but it seems like a super nice gesture. I completely relate to the surprise calories tho :(,False,False
