It's bigotry, and they know it. That is why they are so quick to defend themselves and blame others for taking things too seriously. Those sorts of comments are NOT normal, but they're normalized and even celebrated here on Reddit. And honestly, it fucks me up too. There are so many amazing supportive places on Reddit, that sometimes you can almost forget how fucked up others are. So when you come across something so blatantly awful, it's hard not to be affected by it.  But seriously? Fuck those assholes. People like that are just threatened by people who are comfortable in their own skin, especially when they defy what people like that feel is ""normal"". You are a person worth of love and respect at any size.",False,False
