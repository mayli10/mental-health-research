The sororities that girls actually want to be in—-not the “reject” ones—absolutely judge your size. Every school has the “hot” sorority, the “rich” sorority, the “hot” and “rich” sorority, the “fat” girls, the “nerds.” Sometimes they overlap.  People will say it doesn’t matter and to just be yourself. I won’t comment on that. I will just say Greek life has less to do with appreciating a person’s inner qualities and more to do with the image they project. Just pay attention to who’s wearing what letters when you walk around campus and what they look like. It won’t take long for you to see a pattern. Restricting makes some people look sick. But not every single person. Not giving tips, just saying, not everyone who restricts looks like the crypt keeper. But it’s also true that it’s such a slippery slope and before you even realize it, and even though you didn’t mean to—-you MIGHT still end up looking that way anyway. But yeah, lots of people look back on their college experience and regret not “being a part of.”  And they don’t get over it for years, sitting on the sidelines, not getting invited to certain things, not having their clique. Yeah, it’s super shallow, but it is what it is.  Be careful if you can 💞💞",False,False

Rather the opposite. Forget being thin; we're talking pale and dry skin, dry nails that break easily, bad teeth, sunken eyes (with huge bags under them), thin hair that's falling out all the time, extra body hair, blue lips because you're freezing all the time.. I could go on. It isn't pretty. And that's just things that happens to your physical features, don't get me started on what happens to your psyche.  I can't even count the amount of times I've been told I'm not attractive because of the way my body looks. Being thin and healthy is one thing, being thin as a result of an eating disorder is something else entirely. I really hope you can get help. Starving yourself is not the answer.",False,False
