We’re asking for the people who hated their food but are too afraid to speak up. U can tell pretty quickly the people that didn’t like the food vs the people that weren’t hungry or whatever. I never assume someone has an ed if they didn’t eat a lot I just assume they got full. Although I don’t see a lot of extremely thin girls at work in general.,False,False

When the waiter asked me what I wanted, I said the risotto. He was just like “Are you sure?” Idk, even to this day I still get annoyed when I think about it.  YES bish, I’m sure lmao.",False,False

A few years ago I went downtown to see a show and my friend and I decided to have brunch beforehand. She knows about my eating issues. It took me forever to figure out what was ""safe"" on the menu, decide if I want to splurge or not, etc etc. There was a buffet too. I finally figured out what to order (not safe but not traumatizing) and I ate the whole thing. It wasn't a particular generous portion either because it was a pretty fancy joint. When the waiter came back to clear our plates he said something along the lines of, ""Wow! I guess you must have been hungry!""  Ruined the my meal, the show, and entire rest of my day and week.",False,False

I did not eat in a restaurant for two years after a waiter took my friend's mom aside to inform her (at a nonetheless audible volume) that I needed to eat more, and that it was ""not okay"" for me to be so skinny, and that he found the sight of me ""really uncomfortable.""   I had such Schadenfreude when that restaurant closed within a year lmao",False,False
