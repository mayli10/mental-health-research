I am a long timer anorexic. I can see from my group, things are a lot more complex and tangled for people now. Then LOL hahaha in my day.  Just keep the chain going. If I helped you and you can help someone else please do and someday the person you helped can help me or the person they helped can help me. The universe will be better place.  Stay strong stay positive.",False,False

Stay strong, even though as you said above. You are facing some unbelievably nasty toxic trolling comments. It goes without saying if someone forms an opinion, you might be suffering from an ED and continues to make harsh comments.   They are by their nature and their own actions just horrible, manipulative and damaged as a person. Projecting their own personal shortcomings, weaknesses and inadequacies onto you.   Try and draw strength from the fact you‚Äôre living your life without judgement of others and the universe will reward that. Like we say in Ireland ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt let the bastards grind you down, don‚Äôt let them win. Fuck‚Äôem. Our day will come‚Äù   What you said about your boyfriend I couldn‚Äôt comment. That‚Äôs a personal thing. I don‚Äôt know the context how he said what he said. Sorry if that‚Äôs a cop out on my behalf. That‚Äôs your relationship and something for you both to discuss.   Take it from someone a little older and who has been dealing with comments around the results of my anorexia a lot longer. Group can be incredibly help full with these things.   Hope my sharing helped.  Keep writing, keep posting and keep talking.",False,False
