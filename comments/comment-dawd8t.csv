But the other thing is that on tumblr, there's this whole phenomenon of users calling ships between adult characters ""pedophilia"" bc one character is ""child coded"" (sometimes this is something super-offensive like, ""they have autistic traits, therefore they are meant to be read as a child""). This often occurs solely bc people want to take down users they dislike, or sink ships that interfere with their preferred ship.   (I'm not at ALL suggesting OP is involved in a toxic fandom war like this, just providing some add'l info about the ongoing drama/weirdness on tumblr.)",False,False

That person is either a fucking baby or your criticism hit a little too close to home if you know what I mean. Either way they're not the kind of person whose opinion you should take to heart, ever. Nothing justifies this behavior. You deserve to both have your opinions and eat so that you're healthy and satiated.  I think it's generally best not to mention your mental issues on tumblr because people will and do use them to their advatange if they ever want to fuck with you. But if you want to be open about those, then this is something that will probably come up from time to time. It sounds like you initially handled the hate really well. Please take care of yourself, your weight is fine and you deserve to eat!!",False,False

If you wouldn't take advice from a pedophile seriously, don't take their criticisms seriously. Like you said, they've never seen you. They got your goat, and used it against you.

It's naturally very upsetting when a stranger decides to purposely be mean to you. Especially if it's something which you are already self conscious about.   I find there are certain communities/platforms which I just avoid because some peoples opinions trigger me so much. Then to have some nasty person DM me, urgh gross.   I don't really understand what shipping means or the context of your comment (I'm old lol) but maybe remove yourself from tumblr for the time being, as I known it can be a bit of a toxic community sometimes.   Be gentle on yourself. You're allowed to feel upset, but you don't have to hurt yourself further in the process. ðŸ’™ðŸ’™",False,False
