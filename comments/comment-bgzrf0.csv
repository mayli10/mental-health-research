I spent ages 12/13 to 19/20 overweight (HW was a BMI of 29), and now that I'm starting to dip into the teens of BMI, it honestly just feels completely fake and surreal to me. I still look like I did 50 or whatever pounds ago..and tbh, part of what fuels me to keep going is knowing that I'm one day possibly going to relapse into BED again (and much longer than the 7-day relapse I had last week) so I need a buffer zone.  I also feel like could of a fraud because I spent so many fucking years trapped in BED, and now that I'm finally showing symptoms of what is possibly another ED, I don't feel like it is at all valid.  Two more months of this, and I will be underweight. How the fuck am I going to claim I still have BED when I'm underweight?  I still have all the thoughts and urges of BED though; I just have a smaller body than before, and it sucks because I know how precarious it is. Like one day, and I can slip and undo all this work in about a month or two. It would not be the first time.  I guess I just feel my weight isn't as safe as if I had, say, anorexic tendencies. Like sure, I'm starting to have the body of certain, more recovered anorexics, but I just don't have the same mindset as them. This is very fleeting.",False,False

At least in my case.  I don't feel like I'm very good at anything else but weight loss. I've been yo-yo dieting since I was 11 and the idea of not swinging between periods of overeating and then obsessive dieting feels so foreign to me. I'm not sure if it's really possible for me.",False,True

I started out at a BMI 39, and I'm at a 23, now. Which is surreal to say the least, after being overweight my whole life- and today I had the thought ""ugh I can't wait until this is over"" which I kneejerk thought was just about my fast right now, but I realized an hour later I meant countung calories. and fasting. and being so obsessive about food. about my eating disorder. like. woah. and I try to be proud of myself for ""putting my health first"" but I can't. I didn't do this the /right/ way. I cringe when people praise me. But any time I try to change my habits healthier I end right back up where I am now.   I've been doing this for so long that I know recovery would be really tough because even in my ""good"" periods where I'm okay about my body and feel good mentally, I'm still eating at a deficit. This is my normal, this is my daily rhythm that keeps me sane. My whole adult life has centered around this obsession with losing weight that it's honestly what I base my perception of myself on: ""the girl who lost all that weight."" what the fuck am I supposed to do when I meet new people and don't drastically lose weight in front of them?? That's literally my whole brand.",False,False
