It's so easy to invalidate ourselves with this disorder. Thank you for sharing this - it really helped put things into perspective for me.  I did talk to my dietitian about it afterwards. I texted her. I then spiraled over texting her and texted my therapist. I don't usually bother either of them outside of my appointments but I was seriously so triggered and so distressed over it. My dietitian explained the reasoning behind asking again but it really only made me feel worse. She did apologize too but I didn't really feel better about it.   I think I'm just hypersensitive because I'm in the process of admitting to a hloc and am pretty constantly dealing with the never sick enough thinking.,False,True

I often feel the flip side of the coin - if I go above my planned calories then I must be faking my distress. Because people with real EDs don’t give in to urges. I need to be stronger. I need to push harder. Etc. The only thing that ‘counts’ is xyz and xyz is always a bit more dangerous than where I am. It’s all the distorted script of my disordered brain. It feels very very real, but it’s not reality.   Have you been able to discuss these thoughts with your dietitian or with a therapist (if you’re seeing one)? I’d hope your dietitian did not mean to come across as minimizing your experience. It can be helpful to close the feedback loop - let them see how you’re feeling, get clarification from them on what they meant, and get help reframing the thoughts into something more effective and self-compassionate. &lt;3",False,False
