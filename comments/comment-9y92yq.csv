When I lost it (eventually), it only confirmed they were huge because now I'm left now with saggy skin there.  My obsession's switched from wanting the fat gone to wanting the skin cut off.  I know no doctor would agree to it because they want me to fill it again, but also it's not exactly that drastic.  The fact it exists reminds me that there SHOULD be something to fill it but at the same time I hate when it's filled.  All my body's a problem area to be honest.  The only part I like are my damn feet which nobody ever sees!",False,False

(Amazon would probably be a good alternative) The important thing, from what I know, is that the more cultures = the better. you want BILLIONS of cultures, not millions. mine has 20 billion.  there are other probiotics that have fewer cultures but more strains. These are generally a bit more expensive. I don't really know what the difference is.  I bet there's a lot you could learn from google if you're interested, though!  oh, and most probiotics should be kept in the fridge to preserve them.",False,False
