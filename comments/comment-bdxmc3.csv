If they were really asking, I would find this very invasive and prob brush it off with some maneuver like the above  ""how:"" I'm pretty open about intermittent fasting / water fasting and the fact that I normally drink a lot so periodically cut back, so some combination of that, plus maybe ""watching what I eat."" You know, the generic brush off",False,False
