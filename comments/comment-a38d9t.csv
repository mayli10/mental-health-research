Also I've been taking caffeine pills and smoking like crazy so my appetite is shot lmao ,False,False

I wake up early every morning to workout for minimum 40 mins and I do a 20 minute stretch routine before bed. It gives me energy for my classes and studying but makes me tired so I go to bed early and get enough sleep.  It's finals week so I can treat myself. I am burning calories working out anyways. also once finals are over I can heavy restrict without worrying about brain fog.  Good luck on all your finals &lt;3 &lt;3 ,False,False

So I reward myself by spending an absurd amount of time looking through the snack section of my local dollar store for cheap low-cal foods to reward myself with haha win win I guess?,False,False
