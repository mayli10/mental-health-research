For example I have a friend who weighs more than me and is leaner than me while I have another friend who weighs less and looks like a fatass. I thoroughly believe that if you let your body get to a natural weight you will look good. Just eat healthy and trust the proccess.,False,False

BDD is characterized by an intense preoccupation with a perceived flaw in one’s appearance. That perceived flaw might have a basis in reality, or it might be imagined. It could be weight-related or something else. But sfaik it centers on the self - not on others.   (Some of that might be semantics since body dysmorphia has also entered common parlance, and what people encompass when indicating BDD can vary. Sort of like how depression spans a huge spectrum of experience. The word alone only establishes a nebulous outline of what someone might be dealing with.)",False,False
