I have never been able to stick to any routine, ANY. I think my ED might have stemmed from my underlying need for stability, a pattern or something I could rely on when I seemed to fail at keeping anything in my life remotely organized.   So kind of the opposite for me, I guess!  I feel really out of place sometimes because I know it’s really common for anorexics specifically to strictly plan/organize/adhere to routines, like I don’t fit into the mold. But I also know we’re all different and most of us don’t!   Here I go psychoanalyzing myself l o l I’ve always wished I could have that kind of discipline and structure.     ",False,False

I also have OCD, with fear of food tampering (and associated seal checking).   So I have OCD safe and ED safe foods. But the fear and behavior around each are definitely different.  I’m still working on the OCD foods, but finally getting somewhere (I can eat yogurt without spending 10mins staring at the freaking lid and then later worrying that it was actually open all along... woohoo...). This is actually great because plain yogurt is now an ED safe food lol",False,False

I have not been diagnosed with either of those (OCD nor OCPD) but I can definitely say I have the traits of the OCPD type. ,False,True

I have been diagnosed with OCD and for me it was fear of contamination/compulsive hand washing that led me to disordered eating in the first place. I was scared of food and stopped eating “unsafe” foods, and once I got treatment for the OCD I dropped the compulsions but still kept the obsession about food. While OCD and eating disorders are often co-morbid, for me at least, the compulsive aspect of it is really different.",False,False

That's why I said OCD or OCPD... both is often linked to EDs. I like ""anancastic personality disorder"" better than OCPD because people often confuse this with OCD.    In my case, I don't want to call it OCPD, because I feel like it's not prominent enough... so I always say ""something"" obsessive-compulsive.. but it's always really interesting that so many mental health issues go along with other mental health problems.

Needing routines, following lists, needing everything to be perfect are most oftenly linked to OCPD which is a personality disorder. OCD is an anxiety disorder and focused more on compulsive acts, they don't stem from the need for something to be ""perfect"" (eg   everything needs to be organized exactly right because otherwise I'm going to panic) they stem from an irrational anxiety that makes you do things you ""have"" to do to prevent imaginary catastrophies (eg. I have to wash my hands 3 times after I touch a brown chair because my dog is going to die).  Just had to put it out there.",False,False

I also feel like I have some obsessive-compulsive ""problem""... or at least OTHER people have a problem with it.    I have to do lists, a perfectly planned schedule, basically I am planning everything in my life, and I can't be spontaneous.

I have a routine that’s so rigid I have panic attacks if a bus is two minutes late, or a restaurant changes its menu, or the weather isn’t what was forecasted. I have rules for myself that are so important it would be utterly unconscionable not to follow them. Like breaking the laws of physics. ",False,False
