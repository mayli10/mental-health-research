I am extremely suspicious but obviously I can’t truly know unless I ask him. a big issue for him was jealousy, which I think is a big part of why he downloaded instagram. I have a lot of male friends &amp; even though I never gave him reason to be suspicious he would get jealous when I hung out with them, would send me passive aggressive texts etc. on instagram he posted a picture with his “platonic female friends” (his caption) when he knew I was hanging out w a good male friend so I had to confront him about it then. based on this &amp; a few other examples, I think he thinks trying to make others jealous is a normal part of dating, &amp; I don’t really think it’s coincidence that he posed a picture with a paragraph about his new gf on a social media app that none of his close friends use. it feels personal, but I don’t know to what extent it actually is personal, &amp; it feels manipulative to some extent too.  regardless, I don’t know if you were trying to help but I think your response was needlessly aggressive. it’s pretty obvious that I was coming from a place of insecurity &amp; pettiness, but you were making a lot of assumptions ",False,True

Uhhh...   It sounds like your ex has moved on and wasn’t thinking about you in the process. I know it’s hard but you have to remember you are both your own individual people at the end of the day. Unless you have good reason to suspect he’s purposefully attacking you, his actions have nothing to do with you. ",False,False

It does sound like your ex has chosen to date someone quite different than you, and skinnier than you. This is what he wants to do right now.  I know what it's like to have the type of breakup that makes you feel disoriented, despondent, and question your value. My ex avoided fully explaining why he left me after 10 years, and I still feel betrayed.  I guess I'll give you the type of advice I give myself:  You have to believe in your worth each day, and you would likely benefit from continuing to work on being kinder to others and respecting their agency and choices (respecting others can be positively correlated to believe in your own worth etc.)  &amp;#x200B;  I'm so sorry you feel so confused. I relate.  &amp;#x200B;   I personally think it is totally possible you can find someone who is attracted to you as you look right now, and you can find someone who is excited by how passionate and clever you are.  I agree with you that many people are intimated by someone who is smart, driven and it gets more confusing and messy when presenting as femme/female etc. In my experience I feel it remains this way when you are thin.",False,False

I didn’t intend to write the post to get validation, I think I wanted to vent &amp; see if others have through similar situations and how they coped. I edited out most of the specific relationship stuff bc I don’t think it was relevant but I will respond to some of the general points. summary at the bottom once again.  I never said she sucks, I don’t know her. I’m not in the business of tearing other women down, I’m comparing myself to her bc of my own issues &amp; I don’t understand. the examples I listed are the qualities/traits I could perceive from some of her social media, I don’t know how kind she is or thoughtful etc. I’m being judgmental bc from the traits I can see she just doesn’t seem that great. most of my exes have gfs who I really respect &amp; can say are better than me based on things you can compare. also this isn’t some random girl, there are obvious reasons for being obsessive, irrational, judgmental, etc or however my post is painting me  I think ‘achievements’ are pretty relevant in dating though, especially given the current culture. a doctor is perceived differently than a cashier &amp; I’m not saying it’s justifiable or fair, but I’m pointing out that everyone is judgmental whether they’re aware of it or not. it also doesn’t mean the cashier is doomed to a life of disrespect or loneliness. I only recently graduated from uni and got this great job, I’ve been insecure about poverty/class/status my whole life bc people absolutely see you differently.   on a side note with the achievements, I feel kind of frustrated bc I feel like dudes often say they like smart girls or passionate girls, until those girls disagree with them. the dudes I’ve dated have pretty much all complimented me on having a hard major &amp; ambitious goals, yet I sometimes feel like it’s a disadvantage in the end (w respect to dating, I’m still ambitious), so it feels personal when the next girl they date doesn’t seem smart. this girl may be smarter than me, who knows &amp; it’s hard to quantify anyway bc people are smart in different ways. I think from a superficial level that I’m smarter &amp; again, my comparison of myself to this random girl isn’t healthy in the first place. have you never had petty thoughts about an ex’s SO?  I only brought up my ethnicity bc I’m acknowledging a privilege I have in dating. in the same way Asian men statistically have a more difficult time dating, I think white women have an easier time. my ethnicity has a lot of stereotypes that are perceived positively &amp; I acknowledge that eurocentric features are an unfair privilege in dating. yea, people are into what they’re into, but we live in a society that upholds a certain look to be the standard of beauty &amp; everyone is influenced by that unfortunately. I don’t think acknowledging my white privilege is the same as being proud of my race. I don’t really feel the need to defend myself on the internet on this but I don’t consider myself racist.  I’m annoyed about it w this girl bc she’s the equivalent of a weeb with Russia instead. I don’t know how West Asian people feel with white people acting like they’re Asian but for me, I feel annoyed when people borrow the convenient or fun parts of my culture without having to deal with any of the negative repercussions. &amp; why is it more attractive? otherwise I grew up in the states &amp; am super Americanized so your other points don’t really apply to my situation, but I’m annoyed that this white girl can borrow my culture &amp; get away with it bc it’s quirky  I’m absolutely comparing &amp; overanalyzing &amp; engaging in unattractive &amp; obsessive behaviors; this is an eating disorder sub. If I could turn traits like that off at will, maybe I wouldn’t be here  look, the bottom line here is that the other girl is not even relevant. I wrote that late at night when I was upset so it would have been great if I could be more succinct or direct but I wasn’t  my issue is that despite working on every other aspect of myself, despite having these achievements &amp; talents, despite being a kind &amp; empathetic person (when I’m not writing insane posts on reddit on strangers I guess), despite being funny &amp; thoughtful &amp; ambitious &amp; working towards being a better person all the time, it always feels like none of this matters unless I am thin. it feels like no matter how much I work on self-improvement &amp; how much I grow as a person, the only thing that really matters is being thin, that the only way people will even recognize those other traits is if one is thin in the first place. I think I’m still far from perfect &amp; if being thin for me was as easy as dieting maybe I wouldn’t have had this disorder for 10+ years. so I’m asking for advice on how to deal with the concept of all of a person’s self-worth (viewed by society) being based on thinness? I feel like everything else I’ve worked towards is irrelevant because none of it matters until I am thin, how do I cope w that?   logically I know that that’s not true but those are thoughts I deal with all the time. should I need to make another reddit post just to be taken seriously?",False,True

You do have to accept that you’re not going to be funny to everyone, and maybe he enjoys that “14 year old humor”. You say your ethnicity doesn’t matter, so then it shouldn’t. Why mention it. Unless you do think it matters. You say your face is prettier, but umm.....that doesn’t decide if he thinks you’re prettier.  The thing is a lot of the traits you mentioned that make you “better” also have negative associations. Difficult degree with fancy job could mean you neglect your home life. Multiple languages could hypothetically mean you’ve created an environment that requires him to know your languages and that’s too much work for him (I say this because my boyfriend speaks another language and so I don’t know any of his friends really and that’s frustrating, and I speak a different language so my boyfriend can’t speak to my family). Comparing your heritage can come off as being bias or obsessed with race even if you don’t think yourself to be. (Like I’m biracial and while I’m aware some people will find me exotic for it, I don’t consider it something that all people will find attractive, and I don’t make those assumptions. In-fact racist people don’t find me attractive, so maybe don’t let this perceived exoticness swell your head) . Very funny and witty could mean you sometimes make hurtful jokes.   You just writing this post implies you compare and over analyze and maybe he’s picked up on that and jumped ship.  Look I’m not trying to make you feel bad or anything, and I’m not saying any of those aforementioned examples are “really you”. I’m just saying from this post alone we really don’t get the picture and we can’t help you aside from just generic encouragement.   ",False,False
