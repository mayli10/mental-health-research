I retain around ovulation, which took me a while to figure out. It makes me think the changes I see in my body must be my hopeful imagination, when the scale doesn't reflect it. It's so exhausting.",False,False

I retain water for a week before my period and then the week of my period so I tend to plateau for like two weeks at a time and then drop all the water in two days. I also turn into a ravenous eatmonster and it's so hard to avoid binges while i'm PMSing. This month I had TWO periods thanks to my lovely birth control, and I didn't drop any weight after the first one like I usually do. Was freaking out that I still had a crazy appetite and was plateauing, then BOOM, second period. Ughh. ",False,False

Just have to keep in mind it WILL pay off eventually if I keep it up. ,False,True

I'm stuck on an absurdly high weight right now, which is super fucking frustrating because I've been at a 1000+ deficit for most of the month :(   Reassuring to hear that this is normal for many people though. Hope (for both of our sakes!) that this hellish plateau ends soon xxx ",False,False
