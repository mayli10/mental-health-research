In the US you guys have on the one hand access to the largest and most interesting ED food ever, and on the other hand an extremely big and rich and interesting (fast)food culture.",False,False

They also have much smaller portion sizes (this applies to all of Europe), and in France the clothes are a size smaller than US sizes (if you’re a small in the US, you would be a medium in France) so that’s a fun trigger lol. Honestly, in Europe most cities are all about walking instead of driving, and there’s a larger emphasis on savoring food during meals which kinda helps you eat intuitively. I hope you have an amazing time, with so much to see and do, hopefully it’ll take your mind off of food! Goodluck and enjoy your time abroad!!",False,False

Definitely bring pepto bismal because dealing with the farmacia thing can be stressful especially if you’re miserable in the tummy. Other than that I enjoyed some Italian desserts. Didn’t really like the food in Spain—fatty, bland, no vegetables. Felt somewhat similar in Italy but I was staying in Milan and food from other regions is better. I can’t eat gluten and have issues with dairy, but Italy was amazing for gluten free Italian treats (cannoli, ravioli, gnocchi) that are hard to find in the US. Also amaretti are so good—try them! I was living alone in Milan for work for 6 weeks, and it definitely triggered my b/p tendencies, though I think partially because I was worried about GI upset. In Spain I just didn’t really enjoy the food. We had some good meals (yummy seafood) but far more bad meals, including seafood on the ocean!   Italian clothing sizes are triggering to me. There was amazing high end secondhand shopping in Milan. I’m a US 12 usually—sometimes a 10, sometimes a 14. In Italy a US 12 is a 48. My EU size is a 42. It’s confusing and stressful. It also seems that anything above a US 12 doesn’t exist in most typical stores, whereas straight sizes in the US usually go to a 14/XL. It’s especially bizarre because while you don’t see the same kind of super obese people as in the US, a lot of women were equivalent to US 10-16, not perfect and thin as I expected based on stereotypes and what you see in stores.  Try to enjoy yourself with the food and tasting new things. Short trips shouldn’t be too bad!",False,False
