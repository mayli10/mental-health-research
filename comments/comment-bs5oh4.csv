My eyes, brain, and tummy are all living in their own world. My lunch today was huge, it filled an entire plate. Even though I’ve been calorie counting for a decade now I still wouldn’t have guessed the amount (250 cal). So basically my eyes would have said 600 cal easily, my brain knows it’s 250 cal and my tummy hasn’t decided yet.",False,False
