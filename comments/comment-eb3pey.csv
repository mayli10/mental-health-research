I can 100% guarantee you that there is never ever a sick enough. you will never feel skinny enough to be allowed to recover, because being skinny enough to be allowed recover isn't a thing.   if you are struggling then that is enough. if you have an ED, that is enough. if you're unhappy because of your ED related thoughts and behaviours, that is enough.   being able to eat freely and without guilt, food not impacting your mental wellbeing and happiness is something everyone deserves. you ahead and go on your recovery. it will be hard but remember, you deserve it, and once you're on the other side you'll see how worth it recovering was. if it doesn't feel worth it, then you just aren't finished with your recovery yet.   I wish you well!",False,False
