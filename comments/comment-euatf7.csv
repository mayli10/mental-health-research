All ~950 estimates are correct, but also none of them are correct, because when losing weight, especially when you've functionally lost all your fat, you can also lose muscle weight (because your body just doesn't have the energy to maintain the muscle), which is broken down into far fewer calories than fat weight is.",False,False

Thereâ€™s over 3.5k calories in a pound. Similarly, any numbers the scale adds to your weight will disappear in a day or so because of natural weight flux. Your body is gonna wanna store more water because of the salt content and thatâ€™s whatâ€™s gonna show up on the scale. Even without eating, our bodies flux between 1-3lbs every single day.   And tbh, a lot of these calories are gonna go to body restoration before weight. So if youâ€™ve been restricting heavily (as this post implies), your body is gonna put this energy to healing cuts, raising your temp, and restoring muscle tears.   Donâ€™t feel bad about nourishing yourself. Good luck ðŸ’œâœ¨",False,False
