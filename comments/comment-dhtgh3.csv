Feeling completely unmotivated to look after yourself? It’s completely valid and I’m so sorry you’re feeling this way ♥️ do you think maybe microwave meals might be a good place to start with trying to eat with little energy wasted? That’s what I did when I was really struggling with energy to make food. There are healthier ones available and they’re super low effort but probably better and more filling than takeaway. It’s great that you’re catching this early and maybe stopping it before it spirals out of control. You can do this!,False,False

I’m in a psych office, so I have access to several psychs, I actually had one before him, and I’m gonna email soon to see if I can go see her again as well. This therapist is helping me through other issues as well, but it just gets frustrating because I feel like I have so many problems that need fixing sometimes. I see a psychiatrist as well, but just for my ADD, I’m terrified of other meds lol   Thank you, honest to god, thank you, for the advice on food. My family has always been really judging what I eat, and making me feel like I should only eat healthy foods, and telling me to ‘just make some food, it’s easy’ when I barely even have the energy to go grocery shopping. I need to remember that surviving is the first goal, and thriving is second.",False,True

That doesn't make your struggle any less valid, I was the same before I developed an ED. Still, EDs can easily grow from the behaviour you're showing, my most recent relapse was because of it actually. Not eating made me feel good, I noticed I hadn't eaten in a day, decided to see if I could go 2,3 etc.  Is there anyone else you can speak to? Can you change therapists? I know my psychiatrist takes my ED a lot more seriously than my therapists ever have. Therapists tend to focus on the feelings behind behaviours and not as much actually addressing said behaviour. Also, depending on where you live, your psychiatrist might be able to refer you to a better therapist, yours sounds SO dismissive and you shouldn't have concerns batted away like that!!  If all you can eat is takeout, eat takeout. If cooking is too hard, it's okay to buy premade, microwave, or junk food. If all you eat for a week is ramen noodles - it's better than eating nothing, and definitely better than developing an eating disorder. Trust me, you DONT want to slip down that slope.  It's good that you recognised these behaviours as worrying, because they are! You deserve to be taken seriously! You deserve to be nourished and have adequate services to help your mental state.   Again, eat in any way that you can manage to make yourself eat. Keep a sleeve of oreos by your bed, eat microwave meals, order takeout, buy junk food that you KNOW you will eat. Have chips for dinner! You need to eat, you don't need to eat perfectly healthy. And you definitely don't need to develop an eating disorder. Depression is fucking terrible and I know it can be hard to look after yourself, but do it in ways that are easy. Please eat yummy things ❤️",False,False

I just got a random burst of energy and did my dishes (mouldy salad be gone!) and reheated some dumplings.   I don’t feel like I want to restrict, or lose weight, I feel like it’s more the overwhelming desire to do nothing which I can’t escape. I still haven’t been able to find the cause of it, even after 10 months of therapy (:",False,True

The thing that i can tell you is don't look in to the ed voice idk if you have it yet, but don't listen to it when it tells you  to now eat or eat something smaller. Just try your hardest to eat how you feel happy and don't try to restrict",False,False
