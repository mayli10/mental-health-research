I totally get restricting (i've had every ED except bulimia lol), but it shows your body that there isn't confidence that your body can depend on food being available the next time it needs it, in the right amounts and varieties. Your body is basically going ""well if i'm not sure when you are going to feed me next, so i might as well eat everything i can now to get those reserves"".  &amp;#x200B;  Remember, our bodies are not fully acclimated to modern day society; for the majority of our history, we were hunter gathers, so I personally think that our bodies still have that mindset &amp; haven't realized that more advanced civilization has a problem of food abundance, not food scarcity. We're getting there, but we're only spent a very very very small sliver of our time on this planet in civilized settlements/nations.  &amp;#x200B;  Brain over Binge is a good book, if you need help understanding why you have these urges. It's overly simplistic, but narrows it down to a simple theory (one used in addiction treatment too) and makes it easy to understand and apply.",False,False

Your calorie amt of 900 cal/day is a lot less than you need, so having eaten 1200 today your body is so excited at getting more food than usual it's hoping you'll give it even more. Your body is simply saying ""you're starving us here but that extra 300 was great, keep going.""",False,False
