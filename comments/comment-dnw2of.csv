I have an analog scale that needs recalibration sometimes, so I’ll weigh the known item and adjust to the proper weight to be sure it’s accurate.",False,False

My SO is a programmer and he says that’s a more likely reason for the disparity than that the tiles are uneven or whenever. Definitely contact them and see if you can get it replaced, or try a different brand if this has put you off them. (I use Qardio and it’s bomb.)",False,False

Yeah it's only a few months old, has never been dropped or anything and I don't weigh enough to break a scale by standing on it. So it's been broken this whole time I guess? Fuck",False,True

It happened to me with an old scale once. Best option is to buy a new scale. If you just got this fancy new one recently you should be able to get it replaced for free if you tell them it’s broken, which it sounds like it is.",False,False

So I moved it and the new spot shows my original weight and now I'm questioning whether I ever lost anything at all and freaking the fuck out about it lol",False,True

I now have a masking tape outline on the floor that I line it up with every day. I figure it doesn't matter if my actual weight is 1 or 2lbs out but it does matter if I don't get an accurate idea of how much it has changed day to day.   Like, I am fine being 2lbs heavier than I thought as long as I know for sure that when I weigh myself next time it's going to show whether I am someway towards loosing more or not. So I keep it exactly in the same place now every time.   Damn. Don't take this as encouragement to loose more weight though please - I am here relapsing my tits off but I have made a rule to myself that I will never encourage another person to go backwards.",False,False
