So, if you are under stress and also restricting on top of it, your body may be taking it really hard.   I've missed periods due to certain life stressors like moving (independently of restricting food behavior) My period is also just lighter some months then others.   I know you said you don't want to go to the doctor, but I'm still going to reccomend it, because there could be a whole other medical issue going on too, and they are the only ones that can determine what the culprit is.",False,False
