Some people can't do carbs the way others can. I gain like crazy on a ""normal"" diet even with restriction. So I have to cut out certain things to see any sort of results. I was keto for nearly 5 months. When done right, it's a really healthy diet. Now I'm low carb though. I keep my net carbs between 50-70. Really all I did was add more fruit, oats, and maybe a slice of toast now and then into my diet. But I'm still not consuming rice, pasta, or sugar. I haven't added beans back in yet. That I'm working up to. There are definitely worse diets to be on than keto. Idk why people shit on it so much honestly lol.",False,False
