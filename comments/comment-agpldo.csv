It helps me to read depictions of queer women who are not that shoeboxable. *Paul Takes the Shape of a Mortal Girl* is super cool although maybe a little triggering for some (the main character can completely change the way they look, so they go from muscled leatherman to skinny twink to curvacious lesbian to tiny twig lesbian whenever they want). And Michelle Tea's *Rent Girl* is such a cool depiction of actual women and all their different bodies and being sexual but not sexualized and objectified by an other. Although she does spend a lot of time commenting on how small she is and how she swims in her girlfriend's dresses and they hang off her and she doesn't fill the chest like her girlfriend does and it's all her insecurities but tbh that sounds like goals.   ok but like I promise they're a net positive for me lmao",False,False

I'm asexual, so I need to be thin because otherwise I feel like people assume that I'm just too ugly to get any and so I pretend not to want any in the first place?! Ugh. Does that even make sense?   I _hate_ having to turn down people who hit on me, it's awkward and sometimes scary, but it's also strangely empowering.    When I was overweight, I was practically invisible as a sexual object. That was nice, don't get me wrong. But I can not be the frigid fatty who didn't even get laid in college and who'll end up with seven cats. I need to be the cool pretty lady who _chooses_ to give zero fucks. ",False,False
