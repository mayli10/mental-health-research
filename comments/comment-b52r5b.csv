I've told no one, but I think some people might have some suspicions at this point. I lost about 35 lbs in like 2 months and now I've been ""maintaining"" (binge/restrict cycling) for about 2 months. I am 10 lbs away from my ugw and I just lost all momentum, my body is really fighting me now.   People have noticed my weight loss... Most of the time people compliment me, but a few people have shown some passing concern.   I try my best to eat like a normal person in public. To not turn down *every* food I'm offered and not turn down every social eating invitation (seriously, why does eating have to be such a freaking social thing fml) or show my self hatred/disgust when I do eat. It feels like a constant battle, how many times can I say no before people start to question me?   I've learned I have to keep my arms hidden because they're super veiny now because (I'm guessing) my body fat has become pretty low (that and dumb genetics probably make them stick out more to begin with). It's not even me being self conscious, multiple people have pointed it out.   I've debated bringing it up in therapy, but I'm not sure if I want to address it yet and I don't know what kind of follow through process there will be. So here I am stuck in a loop of wanting to have some normalcy in my life and wanting to reach my ugw.  ",False,False

Ive had an ed for well over 6 years and it recently reared it ugly head again and im dropping weight like crazy and never eatinf and its wild how none of my friends i see literally all day everyday at work and school dont notice.  Im a notorious c/s and ive done it right next to my friend while shes eating too and she completely doesnt notice my pile of napkins with food.  I have one friend i feel has caught on or at least is just worried about my stress and weight loss. Every time i see her she asks if ive eaten and if she has a snack doesnt ask if i want any she just puts it in my hands. One time she literally put a baby carrot in my mouth.,False,False
