I was in an abusive relationship at the time and he helped me realize I deserved better so after a few months of preparing myself, I left the ex and started dating my current partner. He also helped me begin recovery for my ed (he has family members with it and a past gf so couldn’t keep it a secret if i tried) and all I can say is that love will spring up on you when you least expect it. Once you stop looking for it, it’ll find you!",False,False

Things were normal. we got really close and closer and fell in love. Then I think he began to notice how sudden i would get with food. And how quickly I lost 20lbs one time. He thought I was loosing it healthily. One night I was dying drunk because hurray booze on an empty stomach. He held my hair back as i puked endlessly into a bucket and sobbed about how disgusting I was and I told him all about it right then and there with puke on my chin. 2 years later we are still very much in love. And hes very gentle about it. Never pushes. but helps me during hard times once in a while.,False,False

We met through work and I just remember looking at him and thinking, ""holy shit, I'm going to marry that man.""  Most attractive person I've ever met in my entire life, to this day. So naturally we had a one night stand....that turned into a multi night stand.....that turned into me getting snowed in at his house and then never leaving. We've been together for 5 years now, and I love him dearly, but I'm not open with him about anything. He has no idea about my anorexia, or my depression, or the fucked up shit I went through growing up. I'm really really good at keeping shit secret. I opened up one time, to one person, who I loved deeply and who abused me pretty severely for several years. I dont think I'm able to do it anymore, and that's okay. I'm very happy in my relationship, and I dont think my current SO really needs to know any dark details about my inner mind. It would just make him unhappy. He loves who I am now, and that's enough.",False,False

Pretty much all of my relationships I’ve kind of “fallen” into. One before that I met online gaming (lol), one before that I met through another friend, one was a friends ex (it’s different when it’s gay), one before that was actually one of my friends. I don’t really go out and seek them or outside of my teeny tiny social circle.   Which is great because fuuuuck socializing.",False,False

He's supportive whenever possible, but we both understand that he can't ""fix"" me and it's an unreasonable expectation for him to be my only support.  I am healthiest when I have a combo of therapy, healthy choices, and medication. Then it's easier to get needed support from my partner and not ask too much of him.",False,False
