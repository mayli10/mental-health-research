I also have a friend who, as soon as I said that my weight loss was nothing but Calories In Calories Out, heard it as ""oh, I should take up running!!!"" So now she's running but her only feedback from it is how she thinks her boobs are saggier now. I'm like, that's also not how THAT works?!?!  And the holier-than-thou Keto crowd, OMG. We all started at the same time and while they lost weight much faster, ALL of them have now gained back the weight. It's been a while since you last wore your skinny clothes, SHARON, but let me hear about how much more superior your diet is for weight loss once again",False,False

I remember when I first tried to talk to brother about my ed. (I was in a bit of denial about having an eating disorder, but I started recognizing some signs...I thought I would try to ask my brother, who was the closest to me at the time, what I should do...I didn’t say it was an eating disorder because...again...denial. I am pretty sure I presented the information/signs to him as “having a really, *really* bad relationship with my body &amp; food”  His former girlfriend/now fiancé was there (which, at the time was not a big deal, I had known her for as long as they’ve been together, which at the time was 6 years)  She was into the MLM that is beach body,  I remember she tried to denounce the patterns I explained that were disordered eating. She kinda chalked it up to, “you just don’t have self control, need to lose weight, and hit the gym” ...... she then tried to sell me those stupid beach body shakes &amp; told me to get a gym membership “to solve my all problems.”  It was pretty much after that time when my purging &amp; bingeing got really, really out of control. I didn’t feel like anyone was in my corner. I didn’t want to talk to anyone because I felt like they wouldn’t take me seriously and I would get unsolicited weight loss or nutrition advice, rather than help to address my ed.",False,False

My dad thinks carrots are fats, a friend in the nursing program thinks your body magically stores food as fat past 7pm, and someone else overweight praises the keto diet while the weight loss has inevitably stagnated.
