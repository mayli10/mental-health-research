Right after I quit I just started restricting again and am almost back to my pre-recovery weight eh.   TW (calories): The only thing was that recovery fucked with the way I counted calories. Pre-r I would see f.ex. 600cal as a huge amount but while in recovery I was made to eat nearly 3000cal daily and for a while eating around 1600cal felt like a small amount. Now I'm back to my bs and feel guilty going over 800cal cause it's ""too normal"" ðŸ™ƒ",False,False
