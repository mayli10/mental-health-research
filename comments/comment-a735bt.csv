It usually happens when Iâ€™m heavy restricting, like under 500. And usually always when I nap to avoid eating. I donâ€™t have them at night, which is weird. But if I decide to nap for a few hours because Iâ€™m tempted to eat, I usually dream about bingeing. Sometimes theyâ€™re SO vivid itâ€™s insane. Once I woke up literally drooling on to my pillow. I actually kinda like those nightmares because I feel such guilt, but then I wake up and the feeling of relief is nice hahah. The realization it was all just a dream and I didnâ€™t actually fuck up.

My dreams are always very unrealistic, so if I wake up from a dream where I was binging with an orca friend, I'm not concerned that I actually binged or anything.
