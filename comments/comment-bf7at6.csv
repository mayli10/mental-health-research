I was in the throes of a relapse at the time, and she had baked special cupcakes from scratch and brought them with her just for me.

I never had one. It‚Äôs one of my saddest regrets about that time. Don‚Äôt be me. Try to enjoy yourself and the food. It‚Äôs one of the only times in your life that you‚Äôll regret *not* eating the thing.",False,False
