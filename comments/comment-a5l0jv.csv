I feel like it changed my brain chemicals or something. After several months on keto I ended up binging for the first time in my life...on stuff I wasn't ""supposed"" to eat if I wanted to be keto. So I resorted to purging, and my life has never been the same. This was 7 years ago. I'm 30 now. ",False,False

People selling fad diets need to be able to sell a simple solution; to point their fingers at one thing. ",False,False

But I was also morbidly obese when I started it, like just a few months over a year ago. I lost about 180 lbs in one year, no surgery, no doctor, just keto and good old switchin up the ED behaviors lol :/. Lost a bunch of hair and my period while everyone congratulated me lmao. (Clearly I’m ~so healthy~ now!!!)  In all seriousness, yeah, I would vouch for keto being effective like that. I jumped right into a huge deficit and was able to continue eating that way for a very long time. For close to the one year. Then I snapped and started binging on carbs...relapsed into purging, started doing longer fasts to compensate for my higher intake and it’s all kinda been downhill from there. Not even steadily losing anymore, bouncing up and down while Suffering. Wooo.  But keto works. It can definitely make you not hungry. But like someone else said, would not recommend if you’re underweight. And at any weight with the ED brain, demonizing a whole ass macronutrient and possibly being widely supported in that is gonna wreak havoc on your mental health at some point.",False,False

Your brain especially needs carbs, and carbs are the most efficient way to get energy. If you use them right away, they aren't going to make you gain. Fat and protein are important as well, but 50% of your calories are supposed to be carbs.",False,False

But low-carb isn't actually good for you (unless a doctor recommends). You need the gylocogen replenishment that comes from healthy carbs like grains and vegetables.   Especially if you are underweight already. Ketosis will decimate your lean tissue and fuck your body up.   Increasing the fat content of your diet is probably fine, but skimping on healthy carbs is a dangerous game for someone who's underweight to play. imo, if you are intent on doing this, increase the fat content but don't cut carbs.
