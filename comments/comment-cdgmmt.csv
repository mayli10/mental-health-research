There's nothing more captivating than speaking with someone who's driven and passionate about something. I think it's difficult in this technology era. There's a lot of distractions that give us instant entertainment without needing to put in effort and time but it's also the effort and time put into things that makes life mute fulfilling and lively.,False,False

I use my hobbies **to** stress over my weight. I play guitar and bass and I'm going to upload covers after perfecting a few songs. I aspire to be so thin that people in the comments tell me to eat and say I look sick. Sure the comments about my playing would be nice, but I want people to pay attention to my deathly thin body and frail arms. (It's kind of a weird thing because whenever someone has pointed this out I feel superior like I accomplished something.)  I also love drawing to chill, but it's more of an excuse not to eat for a few hours. Writing also takes my mind off eating and makes me forget about being hungry.",False,False
