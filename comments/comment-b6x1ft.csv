You need to put on your own oxygen mask before assisting others with theirs.  If she needs someone to vent to, there are tons of IBS support groups that she can look into, both online and irl.

So I have EDNOS and IBS, her need to discuss it is so below your need to avoid these triggers. You need to sit her down and tell her that the not talking to you about fasting, food, or your ED is not you just not wanting to talk about these subjects, it adds fuel to the fire and feeds unhealthy thoughts you are actively trying to tame. If this wouldn't trigger anything maybe tell her she can complain and rant about the rest of the IBS related issues, but that the food and avoidance part of it is an absolute no-go.     Maybe also show her r/IBS ? If she uses reddit? It's a really good community and a helpful resource.     But you are absolutely not the asshole. Your avoidance of triggering convos is something that aids your recovery. Her discussing her symptoms will not hurt or help her in anyway.",False,False
