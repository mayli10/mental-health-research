So what you are describing is having an eating disorder without body dysmorphia, which is a thing; not everyone with an ED hates their body or wants to become/stay underweight, in fact many people here actively like the way their body looks and maintain a healthy BMI, but they still engage in harmful disordered eating behaviours like binging, purging, C/S, obsessive body checks, etc. For other people, their disordered eating is/was never about how they looked in the first place, so it's separate from any body dysmorphia; disordered eating can be about control, or ""revenge"", or self-harm. It might even be about comfort/routine if this is a pattern you've followed for a long time.  I would caution against considering yourself ""completely recovered"" for as long as you engage in disordered eating practices like binging/purging, and encourage you to seek support for those behaviours even if you no longer experience body dysmorphia (which is still a tremendous achievement in itself).",False,False

A lot of us here might feel ok with our bodies but still practice ED behaviors. However... you say you are recovered. If you binge and purge still, especially that frequently, you aren't recovered.",False,False
