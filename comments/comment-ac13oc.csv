Yeah still going through an existential crisis about that one..,False,False

I don't know what I was expecting, some sort of graduation ceremony? A surprise party? Literally, I just stepped on the scale one day and looked down to see this number I had been envisioning for years, quite literally putting my life on the line to reach, losing friends over, etc. and there it was, and nothing happened, at all. In fact, at this point no one in my life is happy to see me lose weight anymore or even hear me mention it, so there was no one to tell except Reddit.   TLDR I think this is pretty much everyone's experience when they finally cross whatever threshold they consider ""skinny"", it's unbelievably anticlimactic and leaves a big empty hole in your life that's terrifying to fill.",False,False
