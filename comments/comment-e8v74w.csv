Feeling food in my stomach feels awful and terrible i feel disgusting. I pretty much survive off small amounfs of solids and mostly broths, apple sauce, and lots of coffee/tea/diet drinks.   I even get freaked out when holding food im given because feeling how heavy my plate is is so much to think about the weight of food going in my stomach. Good lord the first time i got a bowl of chipotle the weight of it terrified me",False,True

I think it's going to be fine. It seems fine while I'm eating it. Then suddenly I'm like, nope, not fine, go puke. And then the other part of me is like ""seriously? That perfectly healthy low calorie x? Wtf?"" And then I'm like ""yep, that's how it be"".",False,False

It also happens when I feel like I’ve enjoyed my food too much (ie, I don’t deserve to feel happy so it’s a punishment thing) and any time I have even the tiniest bit of food that I consider unsafe.
