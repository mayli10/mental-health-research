I was looking st some high protein probiotic yogurt last night, but it was plain and I don't like plain yogurt. But I was also looking at jam and oatmeal before I decided on what to snack on. So I'm thinking, what if I just took some yogurt, oats, and jam and put them all together? Wouldn't need much jam to make the yogurt taste good and the oats would make it filling. Sounds pretty great. Too bad yogurt doesn't have a good shelf life. I doubt I could eat the whole tub before it expires.",False,False
