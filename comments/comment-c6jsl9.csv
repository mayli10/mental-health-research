My big issue is waking up at 4AM starving and going insane on of I should wait until breakfast or not. If I only have an hour or so to wait until a meal or snack, I usually feel fine but anymore than that really triggers my old behaviour and suddenly I'm wondering why I should eat at all, etc... What helps me is trying to contextualize why I have these cravings! Most of the time, they happen because I restricted in some form or another. For example, yesterday I ate around 2,5k but did an insane amount of walking and pretty much burned all of that. So naturally, I woke up wayyyy hungrier than other days. Gotta remind myself that if I'm not consistent, my body is gonna find a way to get food and it's probably gonna be scarier to eat peanut butter at 4AM than a slightly bigger meal the night before. Hope that helps! :)",False,False

It was worse last week and is already getting better, I'm able to stick to a meal plan and a reasonable pace. You can do this &lt;3",False,False

Did you experience this consistently for a month or two (like were you eating like that basically every day) or was it more of an occasional occurrence for a month or two for you? Thanks for your advice so far",False,True

It can be really scary but it will go away soon. Its basically your body trying to make sure you don’t restrict again, and now it finally has enough energy to send you proper hunger cues, so it can seem intense at first compared to what you were used to. It probably took about a month or two to really go away for me. It sucks but you just have to push through it :/",False,False

I didn’t see Tabitha Farrar say anything about that, so it just makes me worry that i’m bingeing and messing up my body more instead of helping it get healthy",False,True
