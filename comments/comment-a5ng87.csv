I can't even imagine going out let alone even having 1 alcoholic beverage right now.,False,False

Leave for a friends house at 1pm, tell my parents I'll eat at their house... when I get there, I'll tell my friend I already ate. Then I'll leave around 6-7 and tell my friend that I'm going to eat with my parents. I get home and tell my parents I already ate.

Lying to everyone around me about meals, not caring if I purge in public or at work because at least I can say I was “suddenly sick” and just so much more. Even dumb little games I play in my head like how much longer can I fast, what calories can I cut from my pre planned and weighed meals and just sooo much.
