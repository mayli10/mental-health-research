I keep myself with extra weight because I hate the comments on my body and being poked at in the ribs. I judge myself for being weak and having small boobs.  I am flexible though! So I‚Äôve got that going from me at least.,False,False

I don‚Äôt have an ED but I am tall with a tiny frame.   I feel like I‚Äôve been screaming into the ocean about my weight issues. I exist! I am a real woman! I‚Äôm more Kendall Jenner than Kim Kardashian! And that‚Äôs okay!!   I‚Äôm convinced that no one has any clue what a tall healthy or fit woman looks like.  Even Karlie Kloss who got reamed for her weight actually doesn‚Äôt even look that bad in candid photo shoots. Like she looks completely normal, if a bit flat chested!  Some people just have different bodies! Let me a pasty ass vanilla waif of a woman! Wonder Woman I am not.

I hope that she still lived through many happy moments with her kids and with you and her other grandchildren.   But for me it's not just looks. I'd say I focus on the looks aspect so I can stay motivated. The real reason why I have an ED imo is because I am obsessed with being in control. And with perfectionism. So it drives me nuts to have my life all over the place(to the point where I'm suicidal and extremely depressed), but if I can stay on top of my weight game it makes me feel safe.   I also live in a really bad African country and the food here is terrible esp for my particular health issues so that worsens my case as well.",False,True
