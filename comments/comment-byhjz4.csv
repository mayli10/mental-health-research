The things they say remind me of what I use to justify my unhealthy behavior, like when they talk about not wanting to go to a party, out with friends, or to their parents' house because they'll have to eat high calorie that day.   I just saw a &gt;!200 calorie!&lt; (spoiled in case you dislike numbers and calories) meal made up of Gerber puffs, dried strawberries, and almond milk. Desperation meals, people.",False,False

Fasting for weight loss when you don't have an eating disorder seems like walking a very dangerous line to me because it is sooo easy to fall into disordered habits and thoughts and you don't realize it until it's too late. No one thinks they're going to have an eating disorder until suddenly they have one  I also don't buy into the ""our bodies weren't make to eat everyday"" thing. I feel so much better and more productive when I eat normally so surely that means something. I feel like death when I'm fasting and even when I'm riding that initial fasting high I am not productive and makes lots of mistakes in my work  I do also feel like you can diet without getting an ED of course. I have a friend that tries out new diets sometimes but she isn't obsessive about it and I think she does love her body. She isn't incapable of having a good time after having a big meal or feeling like she gained weight. She doesn't need to examine a menu before hand, will eat samples in stores, and takes bites of food without thinking about it. There is a stark contrast between us and how we handle food. I think she is a good example of having a healthy relationship with food while still being able to try diets and maintain a healthy/fit weight. One key difference between her and the subs you mentioned is that she doesn't spend time on subs or sites like that. She just learns about a (healthy) diet and tries it out and keeps living her life",False,False

I remember a post about someone hearing about their sister being in a serious accident and then a tornado hit their house and she didn’t binge on cookies that were at the house and everyone was congratulating her and shit. That truly made me go WTF.  Also when people calculate their deficits they are told that calories burned by exercise don’t count, ever. That kind of iffs me for some reason...  I started from keto subs, then loseit, then 1200isplenty and the jerk versions (my favourites), then ended up here. So OP, you’re definitely not alone. I deffo find myself having more and more disordered/obsessive thoughts the lower my weight goes.",False,False

That’s not intended to shame or upset you - we’re all here because we’re here, after all. There is a grey area of disordered behaviours where the wider culture may validate them to some extent, but they are certainly not necessarily “healthy” for most people who engage in them. It would be a good idea to consider seeing a doctor for a physical work up to get your general health checked, and consider maybe getting in with a counsellor who has experience treating disordered eating - if that’s an option for you. It doesn’t have to be full-on diagnosed ~anorexia~ to be a real, valid, serious health concern.",False,False

When I was young you used to be unhealthy when you skipped meals. Now it's trendy and called IF. If I see people call skipping breakfast IF I just think Meh generations of people did that and where called unhealty and or lazy. People whom eat keto used to be called 'too poor for vegetables'.      Now everything is a diet trick and people try to shove it down your throat. The irony. I think it is very sick. But I also think people do not realize how sick it is and how sick they are. They only know classic AN and BN. But there is this really weirdly growing group of people who starts and fails all the diets only to end up trying more and more rigorous methods and thinking 'hey it works imma getting health now' not realizing they are taking very unhealty roads to that healthy place. And TV is probably not helping with that...,False,False
