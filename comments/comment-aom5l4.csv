Maybe you've already tried this?  First, eating food prepared by others. Surely you will still estimate the calories, but the lack of precision may help transition into not counting at all or at least alleviate the obsession.  Second, setting yourself up to be more distracted around food. Like eating with other people and having a conversation, maybe even sharing food; watching a movie or doing an errand while eating or snacking on something unportioned.",False,False

The way I chose to deal with it when I started recovery wasn't what anyone else had told me to do. I'd start my day and make a to-do list, EVERYTHING I did or wanted to do for the day went on the list: laundry, shower, fill fuel tank, feed the fish. I'd go through my day and notice that I'd done a few things and felt like I DESERVED the food I put in front of me. As long as I got X amount of things done, I could eat. If it was a ""small item"" to do, I would deserve something small to eat. It made me feel like I had to WORK for the food, therefore I was still in control. Letting yourself know you deserve the food makes it easier IMO",False,False

Tbh Idk if I’m ever gonna be able to stop counting calories and eat like a normal person. I’ve had this habit for 4 years now and I can’t think of my life without it, it just feels so normal for me to control my food intake every day. But man I hate it sm, it saddens me sm to think that my life’s gonna be like this forever.",False,True

Once you've counted calories enough times and find a sense of security in doing it, your brain will start to consider calorie counting an important thing for survival and wants you to keep doing it. This is why we automatically brush our teeth in the morning and get hungry around the time we usually eat for example.  There's really no easy way to stop it, you simply have to resist the urge to count calories and manually control your food intake until your brain ""rewires"" and stops seeing the habit as important. It may take a long time if the habit is deeply ingrained after years of doing it though.",False,False
