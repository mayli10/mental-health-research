Weight is not a permanent characteristic and it’s not a good thing to base a potential relationship on. If he is that shallow, *he is doing you a favor.* you deserve more than a fair weather shallow lover.  In reality, you have no real idea why he “chose her over you.” You may never know. It could be your weight, but the odds are that it’s much likely to be something else, totally unrelated. Regardless *you* deserve to be *kind to yourself* now.  You don’t need him. You are great on your own, and you *deserve* someone who wants to love and cherish you as you are. ",False,False
