I’m on the pill and I will get my period for like three-four days a week before it’s actually supposed to come and then again on the scheduled period days. I have an appt with a gyn today...   Besides this being annoying as hell, I’m such an anxious hypochondriac and have spent way too much time on Webmd that now I am worried it could be something serious, like a cyst or even cervical cancer .. even though that’s probably not likely ",False,False

My doctor gave me an order for bloodwork that I still haven’t done anything with because he thinks I have low iron. I bruise easily and my hair is thinning. I guess low iron is also really common after giving birth, on top of the fact that I restrict. I had no idea that it could make my periods WORSE! In my non-medical-knowledge-having-brain I guess I figured less iron=less blood? Lol thanks for the tip. ",False,False

I feel you girl! I guess I should have mentioned that I'm 26, never had a kid, and my periods also last 7 to 10 days. And I also have gone through periods of my life or my period disappeared. Yeah bodies are weird especially women's hormones. I wish I could just go off birth control but I'm afraid it will be just as bad :(.   ",False,True

I had a baby 10 months ago and since I started restricting again, my periods are like really really long. They used to be maybe 4 days from start to completely finished. Now they are like 7-10 days long, with random bursts in higher flow. I have no idea why restricting has made my periods MORE extreme, last time I was on my ED spiral my period stopped altogether. Bodies are weird. I don’t want to get pregnant ever ever again so the whole reproductive process including periods is totally unwanted, so of COURSE my periods get worse.    As far as your situation goes, you could always mention it to your doctor and specifically ask to try any other birth control pills/methods that do not list acne as a side effect? OR: Is there a caloric threshold for your periods to normalize? Maybe you could try to taper up calorie-wise little by little until you find that your periods stabilize. ",False,False
