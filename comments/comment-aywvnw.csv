But what I’m talking about is someone who literally won’t EVER eat even professionally well prepared seafood, or won’t eat a salad because X green has a small percentage of a chance of infecting them.

That’s when it’s excessive and disordered, not when you’re like “this meat looks a bit dodgy, I think I’ll skip this one today”",False,True

Maybe there's non-disordered reasons behind things? Sorry if I've misunderstood the post tho xD",False,False
