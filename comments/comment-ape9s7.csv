Maybe 2 days out of the week I'll log everything.

I quickly started to memorise because I only ate the same things mostly, so then kept a running tally in my head. The good news is that once I broke the habit (took awhile) I haven’t gone back to that. So there’s hope!",False,False

And I was young enough I didn't even know what calories were. 15 years later and I've used them on occassion, but mostly just keep a tally in my head.
