Being underweight is only possible by being unhealthy to some degree, but how unhealthy you are is determined by a number of factors. The less you weigh the more likely you are to experience serious problems though.",False,False

I had complications when I was at the low end of a healthy bmi, not even underweight. Some people don't have complications til a very low bmi. The longer you're at a low bmi, the higher the chance of severe complications. 15.6 is pretty low, I would be very surprised if you didn't have complications right now. I personally would use your current level of clarity to reach out to someone. A common side effect can be brain fog and a reduced ability to reason. So you might not be able to rationally determine if you need help in the future. And if you get help now you can stop any long term damage going on inside of you that you can't see.",False,False
