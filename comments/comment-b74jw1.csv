I had trouble finding the right birth control too, because it made the migraines and depression worse and I was scared to go on anything long term because I didn't want to be stuck for months or years with something that wasn't the right fit hormonally. Doctor was very understanding, and we tried a few different dosages of the daily pills (so I could stop them really quickly if it did anything bad), and when we found the right one I was set. A bit of increased appetite but I just... Didnt give into it I guess? Maybe I'm lucky but all the drugs that are supposed to ""cause weight gain"" (read: increase appetite) were manageable for me. Like yeah I'm hungry, but I'm always hungry and I like it that way so... I just don't overeat. I know it's not that easy for everyone, but it's still in your control, and if you know it's coming maybe you can prepare yourself to handle it better.   You can do it! Enlisting a good doc will probably help. Good luck, my friend:) ",False,False
