Theres a video Eugenia posted about a curling hair wand, and in the background you can hear yelling.  Apparently the first statement is ""you're going to kill her"" followed by ""I want the money.""  Obviously if she has an eating disorder, I hope she continues this recovery, but there's a part of me that's worried that she never had an eating disorder to begin with.  It seems like there's abuse going on in that house, and it's possible Eugenia's mother is starving her own daughter for monetary gain",False,False

I just made a post about it. Something is very very wrong here.,False,False
