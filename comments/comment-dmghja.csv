He’s a very picky eater (the kind that never completely outgrew chicken nuggets and plain cheeseburgers, but has opened up to new foods). He also has mild IBS, daily heartburn, and other stomach/digestive symptoms that he takes meds for and a narrow esophagus, so he eats very slow. Even knowing all of that, it still bothers me that I must eat so much faster. I attempt to eat slower, but it’s a really difficult habit to break. Logically I know I shouldn’t compare how we eat, but my ED-recovering brain can’t handle it.",False,False

Idk I understand you though and it sucks",False,False

My boyfriend eats craaaazy slow but it doesn't stress me out because he eats so much food he's pretty much always eating. Still weighs less than me though.",False,False
