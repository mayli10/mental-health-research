I would definitely consult your doctor about this, there are healthy ways to lose weight and to prevent an eating disorder from getting worse/making a recovery. You seem to be asking all of the right questions, just know that your self worth is not a weight or body type. I'm always here if you want to talk ‚ù§Ô∏è",False,False

And (2) I‚Äôm not a medical professional, and if you do have concerns, you‚Äôre best to consult a medical professional and not the Internet.   I‚Äôm bulimic and I think the key to bulimia is the restricting-binging-purging cycle. I will starve, and then binge eat to a point of discomfort, followed most often by a bought of purging - meaning I‚Äôll either throw up, over exercise, abuse laxatives, etc to try and rid the food. In my experience, the purging piece is very diagnostic and characteristic of BN patients.   I think that it‚Äôs possible that you have eating disorder habits. It‚Äôs also possible that despite disordered habits, you do not have a full fledged eating disorder. (See this article: https://www.psychologytoday.com/ca/blog/contemporary-psychoanalysis-in-action/201402/disordered-eating-or-eating-disorder-what-s-the)   I think that being mindful of your habits and asking questions is an excellent place to be!! You‚Äôre definitely on the right track. Have you considered talking to a trusted loved one? Your family doctor? If anything, I would call your local eating disorder association (I believe numerous countries‚Äô info is available in the side bar) and ask questions. They‚Äôre much more qualified and will be able to get you whatever support you may need!! üíï  EDITED to add that your weight doesn‚Äôt necessarily matter in a diagnosis!! Meaning that you can be anorexic and have a high BMI or struggle with BED at a low BMI! Don‚Äôt let that stop you from seeking help and SURE AS HELL don‚Äôt let that stop anyone from giving you help!!!",False,False
