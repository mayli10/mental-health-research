I am reading you with a lot of sentiments. I have suffered ED for many years, I am now eating and living more ""normally"", but somehow forever marked. What you are writing resonate a lot in me,  and I think what you're saying is quite ""on the spot"".      Me, I am a 38 years old woman, living in Europe, I work with art and I am studying philosophy. As I said, I have had, and still, have, issues with ED. I have personally ever talked about it, ever. It has always been my secret, visible or not. I have reason to believe I am not the only one. This reflection makes me genuinely interested in the silence that surrounds ED, and thats what I which to reflect upon in my research.      Now, I have a question. I am writing an assignment on ED, and I would like to use this thread (what you have written on coffee) for my research.  It is of course completely anonymous. It already is, of course, since I don't know anyone of you. But for ethical reasons I want to be completely transparent on me being here. I truly hope you will accept my demand, but if not, I will respect that.      I know it might feel a bit awkward reading this; it is you/our safe space and not a zoo. Anyhow, I give it a try. I would be very happy to have your concent of me using your words.    Concretely, I want to reflect upon how nutrition may provoque negative and positive feelings when having ED, as coffee being a both positive and tricky thing...I would quote you using either your reddit-names or change reddit-names for numbers, If you prefer. I will not make any more questions.     I don't want you to feel as I am sneaking around spying. I feel grateful for this space that I believe fill an essential role. Please feel free to contact me and ask me anything on this, and please let me know if you're not OK, as I said, if not,  I will respect that.      Oh, that became long, sorry for that.      I'll sneak off having a coffee hoping to read you :)     &amp;#x200B;",False,False
