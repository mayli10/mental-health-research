If you can miraculous in another way it might make up for gaining weight. Like maybe if you learn a new talent or maybe if you dedicate yourself to making others feel better. There are lots of ways to be special :),False,False

It's a pleasant distraction and seeing the word count rise gives me a satisfaction almost like the type I got from watching the numbers on the scale fall.

Even if you can't, learning how to do something new is definitely worthwhile, and if you can keep it up long enough, eventually people will know you for that. Personally, I do art, and it's enriched my life a lot. Having a productive hobby helps a lot for building a strong and healthy sense of self. ",False,False
