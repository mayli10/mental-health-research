If you're really at 17.5% body fat, you probably actually need more calories to even maintain your weight than most counters suggest. I'm at \~20% at 103 lbs 5'3 F and to maintain, I tell apps I'm trying to *gain* about half a pound a week. Not to mention, I'm a decade older than you- you're still growing, and need more calories just due to that. You could literally eat a thousand calories more today and it still would not be maintenance unless you have literally been lying in bed all day. ",False,False

I'm a mom and when I see a kid on here doing this I just wanna say what I'd want someone to tell my daughter. You can still run away from this nonsense. It's hard, it's bullshit, it sucks but it'll be easier and people will be easier on you and more sympathetic now than when you're 18, 20, 30, 40 etc. when I was 13 someone told me  I would probably be dealing with this for my entire life and now I'm 27 and just starting to realize what that means. The health complications aren't even the worst part. It's when you're so consumed by this everything else in your life goes on the back burner. Dealing with this your entire life is harder than dying from it. I'm really sorry to be such a lamo fuddy duddy. Youre probably in the grips and I doubt you'll  be free from it but just try to make other things in your life more important than this. Like people said, yeah, eat. ",False,False

I started extreme restriction when I was your age and I truly, truly regret it with every fibre of my being. I will never have the body I want because I stunted my development in my teens.

I'm not saying that because I think you've done something bad/wrong, I'm saying that because I am legit concerned for you (I am 23/f). You're so young and still growing. Your restriction is so low already. Do try to eat, it is important. I won't tell you what to do, but I think you should eat. Stay safe ❤️",False,False
