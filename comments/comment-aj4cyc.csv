You could do 1,200-1,500 and then work your way down to what you want. I in no way want to promote low restriction and dangerous deficits, but like.... I get it. I’m pretty much in the same boat as you. If you commit to eating really fresh foods it might feel better as well. High volume low calorie foods can help as well, to keep you more full and prevents binges. Idk if any of this is helpful, but I wanna let you know I’m here for you, and I definitely get how you feel. Pm me if you want/need to talk :-)",False,False
