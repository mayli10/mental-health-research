It’s better than what she was doing but if she’s serious about true recovery she’ll have to change more than that   Good luck to both of you&lt;3",False,False

We already eat our one meal of the day together and neither of us are comfortable eating outside of our window. I never force her to eat, but do gently remind her that it is important for her to do so and that I love her with all my heart and only want the best for her.",False,True

When I'm going through periods of hard restriction he will encourage me to eat, but won't force me to. He'll say stuff like ""if you eat some I'll eat with you too!"" And it helps me feel a lot better since I'm not the only one eating.",False,False
