I know you don't want to hear it, but stop being mad at yourself, accept what you can't change anymore and try to do better moving forward.  I can't count the amount of times i was lying in bed telling myself ""i just have to restrict for x amount of time to reach my baseline again and then i'll eat normally again and everything will be great"", but we both know it doesn't work like that.  Idealizing the Restricting is part of the problem, eating normally comes first, worrying about weight is something we need to concern ourselves with after.  Even if you're finding yourself in some tough times, have faith that things can improve. Do it at a reasonable pace and brace for setbacks, but know that you're not alone in struggling. :)",False,False

(not trying to be condescending at all) that’s what worked for me. your body is probably starving because of the restriction so don’t blame yourself! hang in there &lt;3",False,False
