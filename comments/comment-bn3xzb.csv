Per 100g, vital wheat gluten has 14g carbs and 75g protein. It's one of (maybe the?) most protein dense vegan proteins other than like soy or pea protein isolate.",False,False

There are more sustainable, energy friendly ways to grow crops, even on an industrial scale. The issue simply isn't with the consumer.

Many require large amounts of water to grow and are being grown in places currently experiencing droughts. In some cases the crops were considered a staple food for locals, but are now being overproduced for foreigners leaving little for the people who relied on them. There's also the factor of carbon emissions from shipping them over such great distances. I wouldn't say that environmentally going vegan is worse, but I wouldn't say it's better either. My main concern is the conditions people work under in countries which don't gave the same labour laws we do.",False,False

I’m planning on going vegan for environmental reasons and everything I’ve read so far points to vegan diet = better for the environment.,False,False

If you research how a lot of popular vegan foods are farmed you'll see that it's not a reality that going vegan is helpful. I'm not anti-vegan, but I think it's important to realize that there isn't actually a moral benefit to changing your diet.",False,False

But I'll also say that if you think going vegan would negatively impact your eating, you can focus on the non-food aspects of veganism first. Reduce your consumption of non-essential items, reuse/repurpose things and shop at second hand stores, buy sustainable natural plant-based materials like cotton and hemp over wool or leather, etc. Household items, grooming items, clothing, furniture, tools - animal products sneak into lot of non-edible consumables and you can start your veganism journey there, instead.  If you do want to get into vegan food then you can start with simple swaps you do feel comfortable making, e.g. swapping dairy milk for a plant-based milk and trying different ones to see which one you like best, trying out a few different egg replacers, etc. Add rather than remove until you feel comfortable.  At the end of the day your health should come first.",False,False

Like I know vegetables have carbs, but I find myself wondering what carbs OP thinks they would start eating that they aren't already eating as a non-vegan, unless they're already practically keto...?  I don't eat refined carbs like sugar, pasta or bread or even rice outside of specific situations. I guess if you're looking at meat replacements, many of them are VWG (vital wheat gluten)-based, so they'll be carb-dense? But again, I rarely eat them, and you don't have to eat them at all to be vegan. I'll admit to not paying much attention to macros so I don't know how many carbs are in beans/lentils, but beans and tofu can make up the bulk of a person's protein while being pretty low-calorie too.  Is there a reason particularly to be afraid of carbs except for how many of them are calorie-dense?",False,False

As a vegan I don't eat many carbs, I find now that when I do I get really bloated. I eat a lot of vegetables, stir fries with broccoli/baby corn/cabbage, oven roasted brussel sprouts etc... If anything, I eat less carbs now than I did when I ate meat.   One thing lacking from vegan/vegetarian diets is b12, supplements are an option but I like to drink a cup of cashew milk per day as it contains 50% of your daily b12 requirement (and it's low cal). So if you do choose to go the vegan route, keep this in mind and make sure you're getting enough b12.",False,False

I know some people it can be very bad and restrict their diets. But for me it got rid of a lot of guilt because every time I ate I thought I'm helping the planet and I'm not killing an animal. This helped me eat a bigger variety of food and eat carbs again. Before my main safe foods were chicken, eggs and low fat cheese. Whereas now I'll eat almost any vegetable and things like tofu and bread. If you really want this it's totally possible!!",False,False
