She sounds very brash, short-tempered, changing moods very fast. Someone could be like that due to low blood sugar/other deficencies but to me, it just sounds like her personality is that way. Either way, I think therapy would do her good, if she'd want to go. From what you said, that sort of explosive behaviour cannot be anything but toxic to all parties involved.",False,False

When we were together, she would pick fights very fast, have serious road rage, and just get mad very fast.  She stated her weight was low because of a ""very fast metabolism.""  She even left me because I was moving without even discussing it with me.  Do you think her behavior could be due to the restrictive eating pattern?",False,True

For example, I could diagnose my dad with an ED a year ago, he lost weight, declined food, went to sleep instead of having dinner, but he did it purely because there was no money for all of us to eat.  Basically, what I'm trying to say is- people (especially us) see themselves and their own thought patterns in other people even when they aren't there. Perhaps the root of the eating problem is money, depression, or something entirely different. Luckily, they all have the same remedy- just talk about it. Talk honestly about what could be the cause, and go solving it firther from there.  Thank you for caring about her enough to talk to us here! You're a good person. Have a great day!",False,False

I would offer an ear, or support if she/he wants, but only she/he can take steps towards treatment. They have to want to change.",False,False
