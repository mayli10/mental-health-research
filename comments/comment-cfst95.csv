I'm really scared for her. The childlike voice, vacant smile, and people pleasing? I hope I'm wrong but it just screams trauma/abuse to me.",False,False

Pushing their kid into the public eye and to work more, weird sexual stuff, food issues, controlling money, drugs. No joke, I'm really sure.  My own narcissistic mother expressed weird semi-joking regret about not exploiting me for YouTube recently and I've been thinking about it since. (Plus Wubby+the weird asmr child videos, that girl's mom is nuts too).   There's always been these scary, ""put on a show"" parents. From typical, perfection at home to extreme stage parents pushing surgery. With YouTube the ""maybe they'll be famous"" level pressure is so accessible. No packing up and moving to Hollywood. Ugh, not good for our society IMO. New child pageant type shit.",False,False

It sounds like her mom was very much against her getting treatment and there's even suggestions that her mom controls her life (to the point there are locks on doors inside her home that Eugenia can't open??) and tries to prevent her meeting up with these friends. Anyway now Eugenia is back in the (possibly abusive) environment and control of her mother again.      I know we can't and shouldn't really speculate but this makes a lot of sense for why she got so sick for so long. What kind of mother watches her daughter waste away like that, and go so far as to enable it??",False,True
