Just some salsa. Lettuce, tomatoes,taco beef or chicken, even cheese can be super low cal depending on how much you eat. Restaurants are pretty good at customizing orders. Just read the ingredients and ask them to take out that high cal stuff like cheese and whatever else.  You can eat a lot for not a lot of calories. I love salads. Salad dressings are always the worst with them.",False,False
