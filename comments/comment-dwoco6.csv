Upon hitting my “ultimate goal weight” I had to comes to terms with the fact that I literally have no more fat to lose. All I have left is my organs and a little bit of muscle. I look disturbingly thin and yet my body still looks “wide”. This is as good as it gets. Even plastic surgery won’t help me unless I get my ribs removed/modified.,False,True

Usually someone who is 5’5 would need maybe 1600-1800kcal/day, if i remember correctly. +300 per every hour of exercise.",False,True

I think my main issue is I have actually no clue how much I need to eat/exercise in order to maintain, so my default instinct is to underestimate and feel disgusting whenever I eat because I’m so afraid I’m going to gain it all back.",False,False

At this point I‘m fine with how I look, but I’m still restricting. Partly because I’m scared that eating my actual maintenance will cause me to gain, (which scares me), and partly because I’ve been doing it for so long it just feels natural. I don’t think you’re fake for thinking like that. It’s still disordered thinking. If you are ok with your intake, stay with it. It’s a good amount to have in a day.",False,False

It’s so hard still having anorexic thoughts, but trying not to act on them too much bc u kno how bad it is and then feeling fake and awful",False,False
