Definitely talk to your boyfriend more about how comments about your body are unhelpful. It‚Äôs hard enough dealing with comments from randos, let alone the people we care about. Wishing you all the best. Hope you stay on track!",False,False

I think you should focus on the part where you said ‚ÄúI know for a fact that I‚Äôm not [fat], and he doesn‚Äôt think I am.‚Äù You KNEW this for a fact. Focus on the facts, not feelings. Yeah you FEEL gross but the facts are your body is doing its job of keeping you alive and letting you experience the world, and you have a boyfriend who loves your whole being ‚Äî including your body.   Also helps to think of how recovery is improving your life and take stock of how important that is to you. Do you think it‚Äôs worth throwing all that work away over a joke?   Sucks being triggered but we can‚Äôt live in our society and avoid it unfortunately. Fortunately, you get better at handling it with practice.",False,False
