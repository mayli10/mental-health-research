I think I stunted my growth just by being athletic personally. I mean, I never ate enough as a kid because of a surgery I had when I was a baby, and I only started eating a normal amount as a teen, but as a teen I was very physically active and so I must have been burning much more than I was eating. So I guess you have to eat enough and make sure you eat healthily. Figuring out how much is enough to grow is tough though. It will probably be more than you want to eat. You also can't know how big you're supposed to grow. Like, all the women on my dad's side of the family are pretty tall. That's on my grandpa's side and my grandma's side. My grandma was probably the shortest of all of her siblings at 5'7"" (before she started shrinking from old age). I'm 5'6"" and I think her sisters are still taller than me. I haven't met my grandpa's sister (I think he only had one) but she looks really tall in photos I have seen. Despite that my aunt is barely 5 feet tall. And of course even though my brothers are 5'10"" and 6'1"" (*I'm trans so that's relevant*) I'm still much shorter. From what I can tell even though I am a couple inches taller than average for a girl (*a few inches short for a guy though*) I do seem to be smaller than average for my height. Like, in terms of measurements like shoulder width, underbust circumference, etc. Basically, my growth has almost definitely been stunted even though exercise is often recommended as something to help you grow. My guess is that I have just never had a healthy appetite and that got in the my growth. That last time I got taller was at 13, so that would be just as puberty onset and then my increase in energy use must have caused a problem there. It's really hard to know. I'm honestly just making assumptions here. There could be any number of reasons to explain why I'm so small compared to the rest of my family.",False,False
