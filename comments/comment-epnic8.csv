Autumn and winter give me the best ~restricting vibes~ because, as everyone says, HOODIES",False,False

I can't handle the hot weather very well and just become dizzy and tired and my appetite is lower. Plus I'm getting triggered every day when I see other women in revealing clothes so I want to abstain from eating more.  In winter I just want to bundle up, not move at all and consume all the ramen and hot chocolate lol. Kinda wish I would lose weight in the winter so I'd be skinny by summer",False,False

Always wearing layers of baggy clothes is a bit annoying but I’ve got used to it over the years lol. Winter is just depressing as fuck.",False,False

And january+february are **always** a period of extreme loss (thank god, or else I'd be morbidly obese by now).  Not really anything to do with seasons, though. It's merely a consequence of indulging in festivities, then compensating hard afterwards.",False,False

But only because I find it easier to restrict during the holidays because I don't have to have energy and focus for work. So I usually go hard during the summer break and come back a lot skinnier. But now my SO has caught on to that pattern and he refuses to let me restrict or go running during the next summer. I don't know what I'm gonna do. I'm gonna freak out :(,False,False
