(I.e. my friends dad last week would not stop saying I lost weight- made me feels lol  good that what I‚Äôm doing is working, but also how fat was I? And omg I was right in thinking I was huge and not cute cuz now I‚Äôm getting weight comments- like what did they think before? And now what happens if I gain weight again??)   I‚Äôm not saying it‚Äôs their fault by any means, still a social cultural issue. They‚Äôre socialized by society to think a certain look is good or that losing weight automatically means good (as am I unfortunately). There‚Äôs also such a lack of knowledge/education on the topic unless someone really seeks it out to understand.  Tbh this rant just made me realize I probably say the same comments I hate to others, thinking that‚Äôs why they want but who knows they could have an ED too.",False,False

Unfortunately the majority of girls my age all naturally look underweight and skinny so I sort of just appear on the lower normal side these days, I don‚Äôt like stick out horribly but just on the thinner side. It‚Äôs so annoying because I feel like I finally fit in even though it‚Äôs just my body dismorphia and I was never even the slightest bit chubby. But yeah people saying my body is goals or my abs/thin thighs are what they want... like I want to tell them the amount of stress I put on myself everyday to achieve this. You want to eat 3 rice cakes for lunch or feel dizzy all day!? Just to achieve ‚Äúabs‚Äù",False,False
