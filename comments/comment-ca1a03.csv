We became very close very quickly. I tried everything I could do to help her as somebody also struggling with an eating disorder, but I went into it knowing that I couldn't truly help her. That she had to help herself. My goal was to introduce her to coping strategies and to help her look after her health even when she still isn't eating. She doesn't have the will that I do however. Nothing I tried ever helped her. That's okay though. I believe that our bond alone helped her improve. She hasn't made much progress, but I believe she has improved more than she knows. Unfortunately we haven't talked much lately and I do worry that she may have gotten worse again in this time, but there's nothing I can do about that and so I simply have to wait until she feels ready to reach out once again.",False,False

I assume you're a regular user here and have an eating disorder yourself. You can talk to her about it and explain what a terrible thing it is and how you're worried and how you don't want her to end up like you. Just let her know that you're there to support her.",False,False
