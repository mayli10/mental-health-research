I cant even mention my ED because my younger sister has a mental illness and all the focus is on her. If I even try to bring it up, I'll look like I'm desperately trying to get attention.

Iâ€™m sorry you have to deal with that, but I hope you know the problem is them and not you. It sucks when your parents donâ€™t understand/care, but hopefully you can find some comfort in knowing that the people here do care and do get it ðŸ’•",False,False

Your parents reacted badly, maybe more out of pure ignorance and bewilderment than coldness.  Think about what you *really* want.. Do you want to enter recovery? Did you just want them to know? Tell them that you think they should protect you from what is hurting you because they are your parents. Tell them what you think you need, even if it's something like more time spent with them, or needing more hugs/attention and support... Or even needing medical care and counseling.  Be serious rn because shouting threats about making yourself sickly skinny to spite your Dad into believing you need help can't work. Instead try printing out an article about BED so he can educate himself about invisible EDs   ",False,False

When I see low weight anorexics, I immediately figure it's because no one gave a fuck or said anything to their face. They're desperately trying to get someone to care about them but they could die waiting for it to happen. ",False,False

Absolutely everyone enables me, my family never gave a fuck, either. Their response was basically quit burdening everyone and get over it. I don't even have to keep it a secret because no one cares in the slightest. I think it's actually incredibly rare for anyone to give a single flying fuck for someone with an ED.

I am so sorry you had that experience and it's not fair to you. You opened up to them and they were ignorant about the situation. I sincerely hope they they educate themselves and apologize to you.,False,False
