I was forced into recovery w/ weekly checkups about a month and a half ago and I gained 9lbs in the first 2 weeks.

It's even worse if you situationally happen to be a pretty independent person. Like, I have to take care if myself, but when I went to treatment they didn't teach me how to do that at all so guess who's relapsing",False,False

If I don't go voluntarily my mom and doctors will get a court order.   It's really tough, but you should give recovery a chance. You're so young and have so much ahead of  you. And you didn't gain 5lbs in 5 days, most of that will be water and food weight. Your body needs the nutrition  to fix itself.  Sorry for being a nag, I know this isn't what you want to hear. But the younger you start fighting the ED, the easier it is to win",False,False
