Kids pick up on so much, and I’m sure they’re already curious or envious of your body type.  Not talking about it or directly saying heavy is okay is the best way to prevent the girls from trying to emulate you, but you might want to be prepared for if/when one of the children asks you directly why you don’t eat or don’t eat healthy amounts.  I have a 2 year old and she’s already noticing that I don’t eat with her and my husband at breakfast and lunch or snacks.  She’s starting to take her own food and hold it up to my face saying “eat mama!” It’s such a tricky and heartbreaking situation to deal with because with an ED I don’t want to be my child’s role model in regards to food but I also want to guide her to eat healthy and be healthy.  I can see you’re struggling with the same issue and I honestly don’t know how to “explain around it” if directly asked why I don’t eat or told to eat by a child.  For now all I’ve got is deflection.

So I guess it's not that surprising. Me, I rather motivate a kid to be active and healthy with something more fun like pokemon go or walking the dog. But if this girl is obsessively checking it, I imagine mom or dad has their own and does the same... But I don't know this kid obviously and I am only guessing. ",False,False

That’s exactly when an eating disorder first begins to plant the “I’m too big/fat/much” seed in humans brains.   Keep being the positive role model you are. Keep reminding them that if they’re getting a little big, it’s their body using storing energy to get ready for a growth spurt. Joke about how you used to weigh 80 pounds as an 8 year old and by the time you were 11 you were 110. Whatever truths it takes to make them think their changing and soon to be changing bodies are normal.   You have an opportunity to positively affect these girls for the rest of their lives and I am immensely proud that you are taking every reasonable action.   My 8 year old self thanks you.

Give them opportunities to lead, or to shine in the areas they’re good at, celebrate small victories with them. Even when a kid is in trouble I’ll always end a lecture by telling them, “you’re a good kid”. Make they believe they matter, that you’re on their side.  Another line I like to use, when they call each other or themselves stupid, I say: “kids aren’t stupid! Nobody’s stupid until they grow up.” Then they usually point out im a grown up and I say, “well, not all grown ups are stupid, but all stupid people are grown ups.”  It teaches them that they can question the authority figures in their lives, but doesn’t give them permission to dismiss all authority.  Kids are so great and the best thing we can do is let them grow without fear",False,False
