Ugh  It's good to know that it's okay to post here, and that there are people that i can share shitty jokes with, or just vent to without getting an ""lol really?"" as a response.",False,True

I usually lurk, sometimes comment (but rarely giving advice) and if I post, I mention that I have no diagnosis and that if anyone feels the post doesn’t fit, I can delete. No one’s gotten mad at me or anything",False,False
