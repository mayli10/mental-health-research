Idk where you live/what resources are around you, but you might check with a local food pantry. My sister’s been a couple times and you might be able to get something at least a little more nutritious than soda/pizza. That said it I’m not sure what types of food that food pantries actually give out.   Your flair says you’re around college age. Idk if you’re college, but some colleges have a food pantry type of thing as well. Just throwing that idea out there as a potential solution because I know a situation like this would trip me out too.",False,False

I could get them if I really bug em about.  I just had to rant about it because we finally got some money for more food and they buy Frozen Pizzas and Pepsis, knowing damn well it will make them sick with high blood sugar.   Well thanks for replying, I feel dumb for ranting but I need to let that out. Thanks again",False,True
