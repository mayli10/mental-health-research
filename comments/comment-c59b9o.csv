Rest between each flight of stairs. (If nobodyâ€™s around, lie flat on the floor with your feet elevated against the wall- the newer, better version of sitting with your head between your knees). Embarrassing for sure, but if anyone sees you you could say youâ€™re sick and just need to get home to lie down... and itâ€™s better than passing out mid-flight and falling. Fainting and hitting your head could be really dangerous. Good luck!",False,False
