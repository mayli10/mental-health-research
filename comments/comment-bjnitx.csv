I think one thing that's really important to me and so many people (particularly women) is the ability to have supportive spaces where they can discuss their problems, everyday annoyances, and bodies without being rigorously psychoanalyzed and forced to become a clinical object for someone else to digest.",False,True

I didn't mean what it meant concretely (like what weight or height is actually tiny). I meant it like... what kind of emotions does it evoke, what characteristics or qualities or privileges are ""tiny"" people afforded, why is it important to you and to so many people (particularly women).",False,False

There's no weight/height/etc at which someone becomes ""tiny"" and there's no objective definition of what ""tiny"" looks like. I've had a bad binging streak recently so I was just reassured that the version of myself I'd been seeing in the mirror + the extreme self hate I'd been feeling wasn't how other people perceived me. I definitely have BDD so I don't really know what that guy saw me as or what his ""normal"" was that he was comparing me to.",False,True
