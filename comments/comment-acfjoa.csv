My husband does not know I suffer from an ED (poor oblivious man) but he does recognize how self conscious I am and never makes comments that could make me feel bad about my appearance. If he ever did it would break me. ",False,True

I’d eat sub 600 calories every day and my friends would get sick of me being groggy and hangry and difficult to make plans with. Then I had kids/moved away from everyone. Now no one sees my day-to-day life and I can easily lie to my husband about what I’ve eaten during the day and only eat at dinner time with him so he doesn’t suspect anything. It’s so messed up.   I just don’t get it. Like objectively I know I have a problem, but having one week where it disappears makes me feel like a fraud. How does one week totally negate a decade and a half of this? I’m just so lost. ",False,True

It used to be, when I low restricted for a while, my bitchy, hangry mood tends to be contagious and it ruins everyone's time. It got to the point where I've lost friends because I let my ED run my life. Now, I've developed this... *ability* to put my entire ED on hold when with a lot of friends, and I just stop thinking about and every calorie meticulously. It puts me in a better mood and everyone else is happier. Of course, similar to you, the holidays end and I go back home and weigh myself. I pull up MyFitnessPal and enter every calorie like I have a photographic food-diary memory.  Considering I've gotten good at turning it off and on like this, it makes me wonder: Is my ED even real anymore? Or have I just gotten so good at hiding it, I don't even know?",False,False
