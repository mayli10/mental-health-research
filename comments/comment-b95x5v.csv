A doctor's room should be a sort of safe room to talk about your needs and concerns. Definitely address this, with the nurse even if it's more comfortable? Docs see so many patients that they hardly brush up on the chart before moving on. I've had to discuss a certian health issue with my doc every. single. visit. And every single time he has forgotten.  I'd say give him one more chance after a discussion. Then it might be time to shop around. ",False,False
