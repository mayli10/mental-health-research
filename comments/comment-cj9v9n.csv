I feel challenged too, I know her body is just like that (not being able to eat a lot) but it made me feel like i should pull the starving card and beat her at not eating. As messed up as it sounds I wish she would just gain more weight than me one day so I can be the skinny friend",False,True
evdb4xl,t3_cj9v9n,t3_cj9v9n,sodiddlydone,1,2019-07-29 16:02:18,/r/EDAnonymous/comments/cj9v9n/my_closest_friend_is_causing_a_relapse/evdb4xl/,i also have an internet friend who very frequently mentions her weight being like 45kg or even 43kg if she doesnt eat much and she says shes underweight and wants to gain weight.  once however she mentioned how she's scared of getting fat if she would eat at McDonald's once???  And she told me she sometimes doesnt eat when her family cooks something she doesnt like but she's also too lazy to cook herself. Like how can you say you want to gain weight so desperately but then actively choose not to eat?!?!  i rlly like her and she's a close friend but she triggers me so much. im meeting up with her for the first time soon and im so scared that ill feel like a fat whale next to her.  I constantly feel this pressure that i have to lose weight and become skinnier than her like i feel challenged?????? I HATE THESE THOUGHTS AND I FEEL SO BAD BUT UGGHHH ITS NOT FAIR!!,False,False

Hmm... I really think you should tell her you have an eating disorder. It could bring you two even closer and she can perhaps hold you accountable during your recovery.   Btw, nicotine is an appetite suppressant. So that really explains everything on her side. Just know your behaviours while spending time together, was and is great progress.",False,False

She’s my best friend but she’s way more beautiful and much smaller than me. It’s so hard because you just want to enjoy your time with them but you spend the whole time thinking of how much better they are. How everyone always gives their attention to them instead of you... you aren’t alone,False,False
