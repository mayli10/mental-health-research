I want to hit between 108/100 by november but i‚Äôm scared that it‚Äôs too high of a expectation for me",False,False

I'm very hungry. I'm starving.      I had a breakdown the other day because I COULD NOT force myself to eat a small bowl of oatmeal. So I sent him a loooooooooong ass text about what's going on and how I really need help conquering this.          He's been so sweet and helpful. He keeps buying my favorite foods after work, but he also hasn't been pressuring me at ALL. Just encouraging.          I'm still not recovering perfectly :/ I keep saving half of my meals for the next day, and since I only eat once a day that's pretty bad. I just don't know how to deal with being so FULL. After my one meal, I'm done as fuck and I don't get hungry until the 24 hour mark. Eating smaller meals doesn't help, it's the same if I have one cookie for dinner.         So idk what to do.",False,False

I didn‚Äôt really realise how much I was undereating until I tried to get more cals in and my body freaked the fuck out. So baby steps it is.

Today will be my third full day of trying to recover after finally telling my fiance about my ED. I'm not tracking things (Fitbit relinquished, app willingly deleted üò≠) but I hope I'm eating close to or above maintenance. Or I mean, I should hope I'm eating above maintenance, although I secretly hope I'm not.   I keep getting dragged out to dinner (literally the past two nights) despite being like ""hey this is going to hurt my digestive system a lot I need to eat less at a time"" so I think if he tries that again anytime in the next week I'm going to FR throw a fit- I am so gassy, so miserable, so uncomfortably full and bloated. I shouldn't be dealing with the consequences for an entire 24 hours post-dinner but with what I've done to my system? I can believe it!   Recovery is hard but we can do this!!",False,False

So far it‚Äôs going well. I‚Äôm still eating below maintenance calories (working my way up slowly) but the biggest hurdle is to get used to feeling so fucking full all the time and not die of guilt. I had a little slip up and purged yesterday because I just felt too damn full after lunch and my brain like went on autopilot. But today has been going well, I‚Äôm trying to stick with smaller calorie dense meals so I can avoid that bloated feeling.   This recovery thing is hard. But I am just so surprised at how amazing I feel physically- so much more energy, I can think clearer, I don‚Äôt feel like a walking corpse anymore. I feel happy, generally. Aside from food anxiety but tracking my calories to meet my goals is helping with that.  I don‚Äôt spend much time on this sub like I used to but I hope everyone is doing okay ‚ù§Ô∏è",False,False
