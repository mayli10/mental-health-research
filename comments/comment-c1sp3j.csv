It completely kills my appetite, so much so that I‚Äôve lost 7 pounds in around a month. It also leaves me feeling fatigued and tired most of the time even though I get near 10 hours of sleep every night. Oh and also, it doesn‚Äôt work.    But neither have any of the other 4 antidepressants I‚Äôve been on.",False,False
