I'm not gonna change what I'm doing. and even if I wanted to,  it's not like I don't know how to eat more. I just don't want to.""",False,False

I can throw out some questions you can ask yourself you dont have to answer on reddit. You said you are high restricting. Would that be eating enough to maintain enough to just drop a few more and be on the low end of healthy?  Are you just dropping the dietitian or the therapist as well?  What are the chances you will go full blown ED agian? I guess as long as your not stopping therapy you probably already know the drill the dietician is going to give you.,False,False
