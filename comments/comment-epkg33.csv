But I know exactly how you feel. There is one particular girl I work with that no matter what, I can't stop comparing my body to hers. Even when I thought I was doing better, I would look at her and get so triggered. I understand how hard it is. But just keep trying.",False,False

That way, anytime you're feeling insecure you can look back on that and realise that you don't need to compare yourself. &lt;3",False,False
