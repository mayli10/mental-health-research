Or quite often, I eat something that's like 100-200 Calories that i feel guilty about but I can't justify a purge over, so then I will binge just so that I'm forced to purge everything, including the first thing I ate.",False,False

It’s weird cause my tastes seem to change when I’m in this mood. Like I start eating the thing I want, generally a nicer food thing, but then I want more.

Then it’s time to get diet sprite and some gas station food and go all in lol",False,False
