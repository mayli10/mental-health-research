EDs are really fucking isolating, even if you have met someone who gets it.  I've talked to a lot of people about binge eating struggles, and it's really painful hearing ""I don't know what to do,"" ""I'm gaining weight, and don't know how to stop,"" and ""I can't talk to anybody about this.""   It's really cathartic going here and seeing people understand, but it hurts knowing we're all struggling. I hope things get better for you OP and you're able to find someone who can helpðŸ’™",False,False
