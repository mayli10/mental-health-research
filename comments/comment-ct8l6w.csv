It might be helpful to ask her what would be best for you to do but her answers are not necessarily going to make you happy.,False,False

Your gf's BMI is incredibly low and it's definitely hard to sustain without feeling like you literally can't eat- which obviously leads to over eating and that leads to purging/lax. Just be there for her and ask her why she feels the need to be THAT skinny. I understand though, I only feel pretty when my BMI is stupid low, as well. She will need to get over this herself, to be honest. All you can do is support her and let her do her own thing- the more pressure she has on her to be a certain way the more her anxiety will trigger the eating disorder. I usually feel a lot better and more rational about my body/diet when I don't have people talking to me non stop about it. I'm sure she gets enough crap from her job, just be someone who helps her focus on the other things. If you two hang out and she's having a great time, chances are, she will eat when you do because she isn't anxious. The distance thing probably doesn't help. If she's alone with her ED there really isn't a reason for her to get better- and she'll just keep restricting following with a binge/purge. It will take time for her to really recover mentally, but most people with ED's do eventually recover so just be there for her when you can be and just be honest. Sporadically remind her that the body needs food and that she will keep hating herself if she continues with this toxic cycle just to have a body that she can probably have without all the disordered behavior.  &amp;#x200B;  The thing about eating disorders is that we don't know a lot of people with the body types we want that actually have that body from being healthy. We think the only way to LOOK a certain way is to do things a certain way. I didn't even realize I had an ED until I got comments on my weight- and than I realized I liked how I was starting to look and the thought of reverting back to my old body terrified me.",False,False

I wish I had very solid advice, but it sounds as if she's so deep that she may see no real issue or no way out. Sometimes, we aren't ready to get better, even when it's so painful both physically and mentally. Your support will mean the world to her, I'm sure, and perhaps talking to a professional would help, whether just you to begin to understand it and how to help, or if you can persuade her to give it a try, if only to ease the struggle a little, if she's adamantly against recovering.   At the end of the day, the most powerful thing you can do is to be there for her and give her unconditional love.",False,False
