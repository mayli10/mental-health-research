It's the best material to wear in the hot seasons because even if they're long sleeved, theyre loose enough to let air in (or to layer thin clothes under for any needed warmth). Styles aren't particularly feminine or masculine imo. I like the squarish blouses, lightly padded jackets, thigh-length coats, and harem pants (which range from very wide leg to slightly tapered leg to straight cut leg). These basic clothes can be found on almost any Asian clothing store, online and offline. ",False,False
