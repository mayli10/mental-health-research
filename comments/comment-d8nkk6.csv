Most all of them benefit from being heated in the microwave for like... 40 seconds.  They take on this delightful gooey texture, but you lose the crunch from certain fillings (like the chocolate chip cookie dough... melts the chocolate chunks!)  Good luck, have fun, but don't EVER EAT MORE THAN TWO A DAY.  The fiber will stop you up.  They are very bingeable and will drain your bank account, so buy with caution!   Let us know what you think... :)",False,False
