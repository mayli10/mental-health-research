We had a small and (for the most part) healthy thanksgiving but just from eating out of my comfort zone I feel fucking horrible. And my birthday is in a week. And then after that is Christmas. I haven’t even changed my diet that much I just FEEL worse ... I swear I can tell when I’m even the teeniest bit bloated or when I gain even a single pound (though that could just be the dysmorphia). To make matters worse I hit my GW two weeks before thanksgiving... LOL and now I can’t stop eating. :( love to everyone out there this season for SURE sucks a big one.,False,False

When I went home all of the holiday food and the fact that I wasnt in college (didnt have my dining hall to rely on for food , it was just everywhere) made me put on fat like insane amounts.
