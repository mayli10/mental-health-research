I'm quite tall and very active so my restrictive days are pretty similar to some people's normal-ish days (from a BMR point of view). It freaking sucks because I feel like a giant lumbering oaf most of the time anyway, but I can't physically function if I low restrict.   Thank you for reminding me that we are all valid. Our struggles don't have to look exactly like someone else's to be valid. Sending love to everyone here ‚ù§Ô∏è",False,False

I'm 6ft tall and involved in competitive sport/ training and it's always reeeeeally hard not to compare my numbers, whether it's weight or kcal intake, to someone who's 5'0 and sedentary. Genuinely think seeing my ""normal"" weight being bandied about as someones horror weight on trashy TV shows (they never mentioned their height) when I was younger was a trigger for my ED........",False,False
