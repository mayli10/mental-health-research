Once I was in class and my prof brought in donuts and this girl said “no one can resist a donut... except beth I guess” and I wanted to shout NO I AM JUST AFRAID OF PASTRIES,False,False

Sometimes I sit back and I just wonder: When did I start to think like that? What triggered it? Are people with such a mentality more likely to develop eating disorders? Honestly I have accepted that this is who I am and I'm trying to make it work for me.,False,False

I stay away from sweets and things I know I like too much (like goddamn peanut butter) for fear of losing control and eating too much. After a while you stop missing it and it’s not as hard,False,False

Either way, whether I eat nothing or 1000s of a thing, I know it’s because I lack discipline.  If that makes sense? It does to me.",False,False
