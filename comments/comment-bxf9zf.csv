Sounds like you are really supportive of each other and thatâ€™s great! Recovery is a long road but you are already on the path and doing so well! You got this!,False,False

One of my best friends told me she is struggling with an eating disorder. I was kind of relieved, because she was visibly losing a lot of weight quickly (she was already skinny) and i thought she might have an illness. However i wasnâ€™t feeling jealous of her, i was extremely worried about her instead. So if i had to give you advice, iâ€™d try to change your â€˜jealousyâ€™ (for lack of a better word) into concern.   Its very rare to meet someone who opens up to you about their eating disorder and i think if you and her can work through this together, you will have a friendship for life. Goodluck to you, hope you can work it out with yourself ðŸ’ž",False,False

Often times we'll go out to eat with our non disordered co-workers and we'll have sidebar discussions on how to go about this and support each other if one of us is feeling uncomfortable in the situation. She's a great source of encouragement for me and always builds me up, it's just the sight of her that's so triggering, just knowing she's smaller than me and knowing that it's because she has the same ED as me, in a fucked up way it feels like she's doing it ""better"" than me. I hate feeling this way but I can't help it.",False,True

Like, old enough to be my mother. Sheâ€™s been struggling much longer than I have, and understands. There isnâ€™t really anything I can do to stop myself being triggered. I just try to remain respectful and positive. It also helps to remember that we are both on the same â€˜teamâ€™,  as screwed up as that sounds.",False,False
