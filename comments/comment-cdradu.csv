Best way to avoid smells/mess etc, and you won’t have to worry about clogging toilets. I will say that it’ll feel gross at first to like, hold warm puke in your hands but everything about eating disorders sucks anyways so what’re you gonna do!",False,False

I would wait until it was empty which surprisingly happened a lot or I would just do it in the shower and play music. I only had awkward run ins a few times but honestly it was more awkward for the other person I think. Good luck!,False,False
