It's so odd to me how some of the serving sizes are more than ours. American portions are crazy but that pasta suggestion made my jaw drop!  The only items I saw on your list that I also have on hand...  Hot cocoa (I know Milo has vitamins but this was as close as I got) - 28grams for 110 cals  And tofu - 84grams for 130 calories.  Seems Australian and European suggestions lean towards even numbered portion sizes and whatever calories come out. And American ones lean toward even calories sizes no matter the portion.  Fuckin wack.,False,True

Tastes better too imo.",False,False
