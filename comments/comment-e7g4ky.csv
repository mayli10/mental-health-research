And sure, maybe he doesn't know that. But that doesn't mean OP should stay with someone who makes her feel bad about herself and worsens her *life-threatening* illness. That would be a shitty, hurtful thing to say to anybody, but the stakes are a bit higher here.   And it's not like we're talking about some years-long marriage. I admit that I'm making some assumptions, but I get the impression that this is a fairly new, casual relationship between two young people. There's no expectation of commitment and working out problems here. This is a glaring red flag that this relationship is not going to be worth the effort of continuing with it. So hit the bricks. Don't sit around hoping it gets better until there *is* some expectation of commitment and it gets even harder to leave. ""Don't make me so miserable that I hurt myself"" is the lowest possible standard, and this guy isn't meeting it. Bye.   Which brings us to...   &gt;Also this ""Dick is abundant and low value"", what a shitty and sexist way to view men.   It's snappy phrasing for something I doubt any woman would disagree with: Male attention is easy to come by, and no man is worth sacrificing yourself, your standards, or your boundaries for. (Finding a good man/husband material/true love is hard, but like I said - I don't think that's the dynamic here.) This asshole is probably not some rare, sparkling diamond in the sea of mediocre 20yo men. He's probably just another mediocre 20yo man. There are a lot of those. She's paying too high a price for a very abundant resource.   &gt;Not saying OP should tolerant a shitty guy, but humans make mistakes and I can't stand people jumping on the ""DUmP HiM GurL!"" For one mistake.  Why not? They're not married. She doesn't owe him anything. And there are men out there who won't make that ""mistake."" I can't stand people acting like bad behavior in the early days of a casual relationship should get the same treatment as bad behavior in the context of a long-term, committed relationship. That one ""mistake"" is a much larger percentage of their total interaction, and it should be weighed accordingly.   Speaking of ""mistakes."" A mistake is something like forgetting to make dinner reservations, or bringing her coffee instead of tea. Telling your girlfriend that you don't think she's all that hot, to her face, is not a mistake. The *kindest* explanation for that is that he is tragically stupid and bad at expressing himself. Which is fine, but still not really a desirable trait in a partner. The worst case scenario is that he is deliberately cruel and manipulative. Most likely, he's just a selfish asshole who doesn't really care about OP's feelings. But she's under no obligation to hang around and figure out which one it is. Go find a partner with better traits.",False,False

If OP said this was a common thing I'd agree with you. But this only happened once, and he apologized.    Also this ""Dick is abundant and low value"", what a shitty and sexist way to view men. Guarantee if OP said her bf said ""Pussy is abundant and low value."" You all would be jumping to attack him, and rightfully so.

If it's a serious long term relationship it may be worth sticking around but honestly if he is openly insulting you...it doesn't sound healthy.  We can be pretty petty but you gotta be an idiot to not reassure your partner that they are good enough for you as they are.  I don't have any super model ex's but if I did I wouldn't tell my wife ""it's okay because you're ok looking"".

One of the best pieces of advice I ever got was, ""Be careful what you tolerate - you are training other people how to treat you."" A second piece of very valuable advice: ""Dick is abundant and low value.""  If my HUSBAND said something like that, we'd be in couples counseling before the sentence got out of his mouth, and there would be a long road to forgiveness. I mean, it wasn't the best way to request validation that he finds you attractive, but he's not that stupid. Nobody is that stupid. And if he is, do you really want to waste your valuable time on somebody who is that fucking dumb?  You're not being honest with yourself about your behavior OR his. Why would you ask a question like that in the first place? Two reasons. First, you wanted validation that he found you attractive. And second, you were trying to see if he was in tune with you enough to understand that was the real question you were asking. His response was a resounding ""Meh"" to the first issue, and a firm ""NO"" to the second.   Quit making excuses for him. When somebody tells you who they are, believe them. At BEST, he's tragically stupid. At worst, he's deliberately negging you, and is therefore a manipulative, toxic jackass. And you're taking his bad behavior out on yourself.  You are young, you are hot, and you owe this man nothing. Certainly not your health, your life, or your hard-fought strides towards recovery. Go ghost. Cut him off. You deserve better.",False,False
