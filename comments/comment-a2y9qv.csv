Taking constant breaks to sneak running in place in the office bathroom. Skipping out on shared team lunches. Feeling cold as shit in a heavy sweater.

Unless you grow long legs with an ED (I never have) and suddenly look like a model (never happened here), you'll reach a point where you ARE slimmer but you still won't look like them.  So you'll try harder and harder to lose more weight because you don't look like them.  You may get thinner than those girls but then those girls will look ""too big"" to you and your thinspo's going to be more extreme.  TL;DR  You'll never find what you want in an eating disorder.
