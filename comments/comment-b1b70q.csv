I'm supposed to go on a cute night out with my boyfriend on Saturday and now I want nothing to do with it. I dont want to meet people and have them see what a troll his girlfriend is. I'm really excited to go out with him but of course my ED is going to ruin it.  I'm already thin, how can my body look like this? How can it still be this awful flabby thing?
