I highly recommend them as steps for harm reduction as well as feeling smaller/lighter.  Pure psyllium husk has few calories, and Metamucil has a sugar free version. Probiotics can be found in raw fermented foods or in pill form, though research your pill. Propel makes a 0 cal electrolyte powder, or Nuun is a brand I really love.  Most ""diet pills"" just dehydrate you and make you poop, you're not losing actual fat. I was dumb and took them as a teen for like a month before realizing they did nothing.",False,False

Like \*maybe\* it was a lot of that water weight coming off but that is unreal unless he was also making other drastic changes. oof,False,True

I remember that I did the math and that it equaled 5250 calories burned in excess every day. So if an average guy need 2200 calories to maintain his weight than this guy must have been burning 7450 calories every day. If that were possible it would require an extreme amount of exercise and he would be shredded in the after pic. There's no way a person could burn that much and not put on a ton of muscle.,False,False

Yeah, my dumbass tried some when I was 16 and the only thing it did was make me thirsty and my heart pound lmao, so not doing that again.   But there are also these like weird 'n a t u r a l' products and its like, whats really good for you? Probiotics, yes. Fiber supplements, probably. Apple cider vinegar.. pills? Eh?   I'm also a little irritated because when you search under ""health"", weightloss is the first thing to pop up with all of this shit they're marketing to desperate people that probably doesn't \*do\* anything.",False,True

I've never used any weight loss supplements, but my understanding based on looking into some of them is that the most they really do is clear your bowels or dehydrate you. That's not worthwhile weight loss. The number on the scale may go down, but as soon as you eat or drink anything it goes back up. They don't really help you burn fat.",False,False
