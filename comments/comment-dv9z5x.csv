My brain can be dumb and think ""Well things aren't going exactly to plan, guess I'll just sTaRvE!"" I just try to realize when I'm having irrational ED brain thoughts so I can try and process them without throwing my recovery out the window or saying stupid stuff I know I'll regret the next day, etc.   Keep at it with your recovery, friend!",False,False

It's like I've developed BPD or something overnight.

Right down to the people were having a good time last night with the end result being me crying for an hour because I think everyone hates me. Srs I hate this emotional roller coaster and I need to figure out how to talk to my doctor about it because this ain't fun.",False,False
