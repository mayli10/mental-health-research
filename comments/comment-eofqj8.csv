And getting out isn't always possible, although I'd encourage anyone being abused, regardless of the kind of abuse, to try and distance themselves from the situation.",False,False

But physical abuse is a “oh god please don’t die” vs verbal abuse where its “get out now please take care of yourself”  I didn’t mean it as deep as it’s reading to be.,False,False

It's completely not your fault she is doing this to you. Her beating and being verbally abusive to you is not acceptable and I really feel you should tell an adult  you trust about this. No one should ever beat you. My mum hates that I'm vegan (she's a sheep farmer) but she would never beat me for that. I hope things can get better for you.,False,False
