A friend of a friend grew 6 inches of hair in 4 months getting them every week. Maybe something to look into! I'm going to try them soon",False,False

My favorite was sew-in as far as preservation of natural hair and longevity. I only needed to adjust the braids every six weeks-ish. If you live near a big city you should be able to find someone experienced to apply them for &lt;$100  Clip ins are great for beginners but you have to be super gentle, alternate where you put the clips, and never sleep in them. This route can be expensive because buying hair with clips adds $20-$40 per pack.   I wouldn’t recommend tape or glue because it can be pretty damaging but it’s definitely the cheapest route.   Another popular and fairly easy option is micro loops. If done correctly and adjusted every 4 weeks or so you should have any real hair damage. The best place to buy these would be online from alibaba and then get the tools from Sally’s Hair Supply and have a friend apply them.",False,False

Also what’s helped me is buying a tangle-free children’s brush. It doesn’t pull out hair as bad as most brushes. Deep condition if you can as well and minimize heat tools.   I also do extensions on myself and others so let me know if you have any questions about that ❤️,False,False
