I know context is important for some of what the Bible says. I just feel completely swallowed up by my ed these days,False,True

I try to look at it from the grace perspective too but I just feel so bad about still struggling. Even though I know God still loves me, it’s hard to believe. Thank you.",False,True

As a result, I think I've really accepted that it is 100% an illness, and I can't just decide to not have it.   I feel guilt just as you described for the same reasons, + ""starving myself probably makes God really sad""  but I think that even in the midst of my illness, it is a great picture of God's enduring grace. I'm suffering like every other person here is, but God is still there for me always. + trying to live for God gives me a purpose more important than losing weight",False,False

If I might soapbox for a minute, think the Apostle Paul writes somewhat harshly in general but was strict in the larger passage of the verse you reference because his flock was disregarding the very basics of religious propriety (he references them seeing prostitutes and starting messy legal drama instead of resolving their differences quietly). He tries to curb it by reminding them forcefully of their higher purpose, but my humble opinion is that he wouldn’t class struggling with an ED in the same category. . .",False,False
