Sometimes we become to desensetized to the topic of ed's being brought up in rl we dont know how to react, but usually people really do get uncomfortable, so it wont seem weird if you say that to her. I just really hope she doesnt know about ur ed and tries to trigger you, because that already happend to me, and its really messed up.",False,False

If it was me, I'd probably say I don't want to discuss anything ED/food/weight related as I find it uncomfortable.  If you don't want her to know something is up, maybe just say you had a close friend who went through an ED and you find it upsetting. ",False,False
