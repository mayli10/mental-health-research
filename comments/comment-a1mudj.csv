He's not a narc but he has untreated bipolar disorder. I cut him out when I was 15 because he's an asshole and I deserve to be treated better.   Be prepared for randos to lecture you on how ""you should forgive her because she's your mom"" ðŸ™„ even a friend that saw some of the shit my dad put me through told me I should forgive him.   But honestly no regrets. Sometimes I'll see the shit he puts my siblings through and it reaffirms my decision to never speak to him again and skip his fuckin funeral. ",False,False
