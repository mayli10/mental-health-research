Like, people need to wake up and realize the norm is not  healthy DAMMIT The only ppl benefiting from it is the bourgeoiS Sorry if I’m cringe-y but I’m genuinely hurt by your hurt, I hope you’re Doing okay :(",False,False

I understand the impulse to share how little you’ve been eating, but I fully do NOT understand people validating that kind of behaviour. Like quite aside from any triggering I might feel from somebody saying that to me, it would be so counter-intuitive for me to encourage any sort of unhealthy or maladaptive behaviour in somebody I know or care about. Even though there’s definitely a performative element to it, there’s always a chance the girl you talk about here and people like her just don’t know how to ask for help and want people to notice that they’re struggling. The congratulatory words from the people she’s telling is just wrong and weird.",False,False

It’s never a pleasant experience. Hope you’re doing better now :)  And thank you for your words, it always makes me feel better to know that I’m not alone. We just gotta keep reminding ourselves that food is not meant to be “earned” and not to put insane pressure on ourselves for consuming calories as hard as it is!   Completely feel ya on the munchie front though haha the one downfall...",False,True

I have a friend who’s clinically obese and he’s been doing really well with losing weight “the healthy way” so he exercises and has been tracking his calories and lost some weight. The other night I smoked weed when we hung out, he didn’t because of work so I was chillin. Of course I got the munchies and decided to head to 7-11 and buy myself those Lenny and Larry Vegan cookies. They’re 400 cal a piece and ofc I know that but really wanted a cookie. We got there and he picks one up and he goes “wow there’s so many calories in this geez! And he begins to look at granola bars and read off the calories in a surprised manner. It made me feel like fucking shit and I just ate my cookie in my car feeling pathetic after I dropped him off. So don’t worry, you aren’t the only one being triggered by your peers. Keep it pushing, hope you’re okay.",False,False
