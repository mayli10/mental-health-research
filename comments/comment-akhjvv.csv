I’ve had bad trips before so I know how the acid-induced thoughts can feel so intense and can last for a while even after the drugs wear off. Take some time and try to calm down, keeping in mind that these intense feelings are not permanent.  Right now you’re telling yourself that the version of you that you saw and felt disgusted by on acid is how you really look, but that is not the case. You know how all your friends’ faces looked weird and disturbing? That’s because hallucinogens distort your vision. That includes how you see your body.  It’s going to be okay. If you need to, maybe hide away for a while and take care of yourself. Try not to freak out too much and just give your brain some time to rest! ",False,False
