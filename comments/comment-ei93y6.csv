My Dad was like that with me years ago. I used to buy all of this low fat low calorie stuff back in the day  He was angry about my ED, now he's got one. He has dementia. He can't turn on the TV and he has delusions, thinks I'm out to get him. He's paranoid about his bank account  He's been on and off diets his whole life and he's had a disordered relationship with food for years. These days I prefer junk food and I restrict to manage anxiety and have a host of other ED related issues  I rarely ate junk food as a teenager bc of my ED. As a child I was fed bland healthy food constantly. I dislike it as an adult",False,False
