What stops you from valuing YOURSELF as a completely human being? How does another person’s genetics affect your life in any tangible way? It doesn’t. It’s only your own sick jealousy and insecurity that’s poisoning your life.   Eventually you get older and realize it’s pointless to compare yourself to other women. Being the prettiest and skinniest friend in the group isn’t an accomplishment or anything to be proud of. What’s the point? More male attention? Men be fucking goats out in our world. Male attention is worthless. More jealousy from other women? How does other women feeling bad about themselves in your presence improve your life? And there’s always going to be someone prettier and skinnier than you. Even if you’re declared the objective beauty of your entire global generation, ten years down the line, the next generation will produce a greater beauty. It’s pointless. Vanity is boring. Get a hobby and find some way to measure your self worth other than an arbitrary number on the scale.",False,False

I didn’t choose her for her looks, but my late best friend was easily the most gorgeous woman I’ve ever seen in real life; she looked like Anne Hathaway with the body of a runway model... so stunning that I think even the most confident woman would feel painfully inadequate in her presence. But she had body dysmorphia &amp; was harshly critical of her looks, had suffered a lifetime of abuse and trauma, and recently passed away from a heroin overdose.   I’ve worked with lots of beautiful women who struggled with intense self-loathing, and I know several who channel all of their self-hatred into improving their looks. I used to feel like a shell of a person and focused on decorating my shell with the belief that if I were prettier I’d finally be deserving of love. It hurts less to blame my unhappiness on something that can be “fixed” rather than acknowledge the emptiness I feel inside.",False,False

Often I can actually let go and have some fun for a few hours. Then when I get home I try my hardest to remind myself that they are projecting their best selves out there (just like I try to do). Everyone has hidden shit behind the scenes, skeletons in their closets, worries and fears and relationship issues that I don't know about. It's hard to be rational about it, but repeating that over and over has helped me cope. My worst anxiety about it comes before we hangout, but once I'm actually out the door and socializing w people, I can handle it.     Also I realized that attempting to cope with my insecurities to hang out with them occasionally is probably healthier for me than isolating myself and wallowing in my issues alone at home.      Of course all that is invalid if it's a toxic friend group - you've gotta be selective about who you keep around yourself. Do what's best for your mental health and keep people around you who are open-minded and supportive.",False,False

I certainly still notice the many women who are more physically attractive than me, but it no longer causes the existential angst and anger that it did at age 16.  Some of it is about self-acceptance (or maybe carefully cultivated resignation). Some of it is about learning that physical appearance is only one aspect of personhood. And as we get older, we become...more. More backstory, more baggage, more joy, more pain. How we look still matters but it becomes a smaller fraction of who we are and how we value each other. Or at least, the people I’m around live that way, and I’m grateful for it.",False,False

They may be prettier and skinnier but we all have one brain cell, and we all have have to share, because I'm also a complete dumbass. I think that they're human, just like I am, and have never experienced the mistreatment you get when you're overweight, so on that end I'm probably mentally stronger than they are.",False,False
