I have no plans to lean on her with this. Maybe I can do that/that will help? Maybe it's a pipe dream because when you are close to someone you can't just say to yourself ""but not this part of me"". Guess I'll find out.",False,True

The recovering one will need their own support and a lot of determination not to let it set them back. Honesty, frank discussion and boundaries help, and also small doses sometimes both parties need to give each other space.  Maybe it’s different for someone who’s fully *recovered*, as opposed to still *recovering* but for the latter ime it’s challenging to say the least.  Good luck!",False,False

Honestly she is not nearly as triggering as my husband, so I am kind of meh about that for me at this point. I am more worried about my struggle causing her to relapse.",False,True

We’ve definitely triggered each other in the past. The key is open communication about boundaries; what’s off limits, how do you know when it’s time to change the subject, how do you signal that it’s a bad day to talk about it, etc. Understand that there are some conversations that are best saved for therapy sessions rather than for each other. And be prepared to need to take time away from each other if necessary, especially if one person is in a downwards spiral and being triggered by the other.",False,False
