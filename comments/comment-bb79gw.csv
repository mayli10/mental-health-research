I feel like my mental illnesses have overwhelmed any personality I have. I am at the point where Iâ€™m truly just tired or suffering.,False,False

Harsh reality deserves more than reflexive positivity that feels empty when it comes from a complete stranger. ""It'll get better"" isn't something I can promise you even if it's completely true.  How you feel now doesn't erase the person you've always been. It's eaten years of your life, and it'll probably devour more of those before you look back from somewhere better. Nothing this entrenched could evaporate quickly. It didn't arrive in a day, either.  I hope that as insidiously as it crept into your life, it'll dribble out of it again if you wait and don't give up. I hope that gradually, your life becomes full again with parts of it that you love, and people who love you.  Those people are still here, even across the chasm. They don't know how to make it over to your side, but they want you in their life. Your friends are still your friends, even when all they know how to do is give you personal space and worry for you.  We all died someday. I could be gone tomorrow. But I hope that you get to exit on your terms, after winning this battle. You are so much more than this.",False,False

You're loved and loveable. Never forget that Ed is a liar. Don't believe it when it says you can't recover.   When I hit rock bottom I would have written something similar, only with more suicidal thoughts about finishing quicker what the ed started.  I asked for help - I asked for help because my heart failed and I realised I didn't wanted to die.  Now I take meds everyday and I like them. Recovery is fucking hard but is worth it. My pain is not as bad. I think about suicide 3 times a month instead of 3 times a day.  Please don't give up. It can get better. You won't be alone.",False,False
