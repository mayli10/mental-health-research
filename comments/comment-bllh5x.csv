Med changes and just meds in general are really tricky. If you still see a psychiatrist, I would recommend bringing up with them your eating disorder past, and explain that you want to lose weight. Acknowledge that the goal you have set for yourself is not healthy, but that being obese isn't healthy either, and that you would like to get some help with finding a good balance, and trying to lose weight healthily.  I know how strong the temptation is to turn back to your disordered habits, but just try to hold in your mind that your life will be happier and healthier if you can maintain a healthy weight and get there sustainably. Obviously, you will be far less likely to cycle back to overweight if you become a healthy weight than if you restrict and purge back to underweight.  I know it is unlikely that my comment will inspire you or change the thoughts you feel, but I hope it at least gets you thinking about it and considering fighting it. Good luck",False,False
