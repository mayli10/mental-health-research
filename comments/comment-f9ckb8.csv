I know it feels like 5lb will take forever to lose but it might be partially water weight. Not, of course, that you probably need to be at that LW to seek help...but I know what you mean about needing to look visibly sick to communicate the seriousness of your problem to a therapist. It's like the downward spiral can continue as long as we have this set point in the future when it will be ok to ask for help, right?    Idk what to say, I'm in a very similar situation, but I need to lose *a lot* more before I can use my chance of asking for help. Otherwise I feel I'm just saying I can't cope. Which is true, but still...  I'm bad at checking my PMs but if you need to talk, I can listen even if I can't help. Take care.",False,False
