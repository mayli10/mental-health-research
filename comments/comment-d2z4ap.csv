What’s the worst that can happen? He can either be the amazing man you think he is and support you and guide you to health or he can be a douche that doesn’t deserve you and leave...and who wants to be stuck with someone like that. I did this and I have never been happier in my life. My boyfriend is so amazing. I have never felt so much support and understanding in my life. I haven’t relapsed in well over a month (I don’t count as it’s a trigger). Yes it’s scary but It might change your life. Trust me on that.,False,False

With all my mental issues letting a kind and loving guy into my life is the best decision I have ever made. I spend time with him even when I am on my period and bloated and I still have fun. If anything he will distract you and you'll be feeling less bloated soon.,False,False
