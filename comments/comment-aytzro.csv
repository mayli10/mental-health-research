I've noticed I drink less soda when I'm making healthier food choices. Or maybe it's that I make healthier food choices when I drink less soda. Idk. I kinda want Taco Bell today.

It doesn't cause me to gain weight, but it just makes me sick in other ways.

Thats along with increased hunger/appetite, and making your food taste better.      I find that everyone experiences diet sodas/artificial sweeteners differently though, and that people with EDs are usually so devoted to diet sodas/artificial sweeteners that the placebo effect is strong in them and it doesn‚Äôt affect them negatively.      Me personally though? I find that these studies are true. For me its usually Diet Pepsi since I lived with people for a long time where one of them was diabetic so the house had a large amount of Diet Pepsi 24/7. I cant lose weight as easily, I always feel hungry and get strong cravings when I drink it, and sometimes Ill even use it if Im trying to eat a larger meal (AKA not starve or restrict and instead try to eat a healthier meal) cause I know for a fact that it‚Äôll make my food taste better and make it easier to eat.
