It’s true that once these ideas are ingrained they still seem to hang around even once we’re “recovered”. The best we can do is catch them and shut them down before they take control of us in the form of relapse",False,True

I have run the gamut of anorexia, bulimia and BED. Sometimes all mixed together. I'm a few years away from my last relapse now but I do remember what it is like. I still have thoughts sometimes. Probably always will.",False,False

Good on you for getting help. I hope you can find the strength to keep recovering. There may be set backs and doubts but don't listen to those thoughts and if you do entertain them as soon as you realize it try and push them away agian. Best of luck to you.,False,False
