I really thought I was doing better and communicating, being in the moment, staying calm, etc. We don’t fight, feed off our depression, isolate ourselves from our friend group. He basically lived with me rent free and it was bad but we were in denial. I was really bad to him and he just went with it. I e realized what I did and have tried to make steps to change I just have these thoughts now because of how it’s turning out and shifted. I’ve been so happy because of how it’s going and I feel fooled now. I’ve been on the right track this year but I feel like I’m starting to slip.   I’m just unlovable and only good for sex and my adderall script. I don’t get why else he would start things back up with me. For now I’m just going to stay quiet and bottle up my feelings because I don’t wanna loose what I have. I have really strong feelings for this guy and I’d rather keep what I have then try to take a step back fix myself as crazy as it sounds. I mean as in end things. Idk I hear what your saying and I know it’s what I should do. I’m just too fucked up in the head to do it. I just needed to hear it from someone else. Thanks for taking the time to tell me. :-(   I didn’t sleep till 5 am and this morning everything is back to normal with him...things are fucked up man.",False,True

No hate to you, but, if you really like him, you should consider how your reactions would affect him. Theres nothing wrong with being sad from bad news, or angry if he says something stupid, but, if he's worried that you'll kill yourself, you are not in a mental place to be in a relationship.  This is not me bashing on you. I have been there more times than I can count. I know the pain of heartbreak + suicidal depression. I really do. And that's how I know that if you want to be with this boy, you gotta at least work on these depressive issues to have a healthy and open relationship.  Just my two cents. I'm sorry you're going through this, though. Nobody deserves to feel suicidal.",False,False
