To be honest with my experience, restriction is basically hell. I was still able to do all of my academic stuff (I'm a student) but I hated every day.  However, even if restriction was never really bearable for me, it got better when I didn't want to lose any more weight and I could start eating more. So eventually it could get better, even if restriction itself might not get better.",False,False

I'm a student, I restricted pretty heavy (under 1000 cals) all throughout the month of may and I had a lot of exams and stuff. Even if I was tired, I felt so disciplined, got my tasks done perfectly, I guess you could say I felt high and excited because I was doing ""a great job"" being controlling af.  Nicotine for breakfast, btw. That kept me from falling asleep in class. Not a tip, just saying.  Stay safe.",False,False
