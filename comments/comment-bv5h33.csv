Negative things that happen and negative feelings aren't coming from Him. I know that I personally try to keep these things in mind when I want to ask Him why things happen to me. Just know that God is a rock of love that you can always lean on. :)   As for my life, my bf and I are struggling financially and it's taken a toll on us. We are normally so happy together and are best friends, but I feel like our recent finances drove a wedge in between us. We still love each other, but this experience has been a really rough one for the both of us. We're a month behind on rent and about to be two months behind on rent come 4 days, we already lost our car, our gas is off, and our electric and water are due in a week. But it's looking up! I got a job nearby and he has an interview this weekend for a really great job I think he'll actually enjoy.",False,False

Ever since I had surgery about six weeks ago, I haven‚Äôt been able to physically eat (sounds nice, right? It‚Äôs not, because it is so painful all the time) I‚Äôm very sick but don‚Äôt know why. My relationship with my Bipolar, Narcissistic alcoholic husband is what you would expect... almost nothing, but I can‚Äôt leave because he is the only one who does actually take care of me when I get very sick. And he calls me a twig, soooo.... that‚Äôs a compliment I guess lol. But he is three weeks sober; I‚Äôm crossing my fingers things will get better. My doctor called me a week ago, and I might have cancer, so I am getting a biopsy to determine that/how bad. Then the same day, my stepmom told me my dad had a stroke. Fuck everything. I am trying to work as well, hopefully I won‚Äôt lose my job because I‚Äôm so sick and have so much pain. Blah. Sooo, that‚Äôs my life. Sorry if it‚Äôs not really what you were looking for, I guess I was venting a little too.",False,False
