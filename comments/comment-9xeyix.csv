I'm really not coping well with suddenly losing my support system and I feel like I've put so much energy into scouring other subs and commenting about the removal of pro/ED and just honestly feels like I'm trying to argue for the right to exist against a faceless monolith.  I was coping well enough and then the news hit and I've just honestly been consumed by anxiety.",False,False

I'm bad at having emotions and worse at expressing them. It seems weak, like I should keep it to myself.  proED helped me. I was healthier because of it.   Reddit might as well tell me to kill myself. They picked the worst possible time to do this. My birthday is next week and everything is just reminding me that I'm old and don't belong anywhere.",False,False
