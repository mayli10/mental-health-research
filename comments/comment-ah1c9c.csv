When he walks, he has to lean really far back to counter balance his prodigious gut or he'll topple over.  Sweetest dude but seeing him is easy restriction fuel. Every time I see him eating something from the cafÃ©, it's like he's taking a bullet for me because that's something I know I'll never want to go near again.",False,False

See I've always struggled with eating and work, cos my colleagues are food obsessed and there's always so many snacks. Also funny cos I join in with all the food related convos like a normalâ„¢ person, and even am known as the one who's always up for food cos I can't say no ha ha ha......ðŸ˜­ But actually I should use them eating as fuel not to eat....just let them put an that food and calories and fat in their bodies.
