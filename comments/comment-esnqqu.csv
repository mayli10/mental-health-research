The post-fasting 5 liter one is a bit concerning, because I've probably done that, but I'm less panicky now since it does seem rare.",False,True

Stomach was hugely dilated with a perforation on the anterior wall of stomach at fundus near greater curvature. ([Dewangan et al, 2016](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4843317/))  &gt; Eight litres of fluid and undigested food were removed from the peritoneal cavity and stomach.
