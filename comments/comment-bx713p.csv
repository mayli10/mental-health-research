If you don’t believe me just search whatever you think you are (ie. fat,skinny, short, long, wide, narrow, just about any assumed flaw or whatever) in any porn site and there will be thousands of videos and people looking at whatever you are or are into.",False,False

I’ve never been underweight, and my father won’t let me forget it. Even when I was down to the lower end of normal he would constantly comment on what I was eating, what I was wearing, how much I weigh, how much I exercise, etc. It feels wrong to say that he’s the cause of my ED, but he’s definitely the biggest contributing factor to it.",False,False

Telling you ""your nose is too flat, I'll pay for your rhinoplasty so you look like our white neighbor; your eyes are too small, I'll pay for your double lid surgery; your freckles are ugly, no boy will like you; you're too dark now, what are you black?!""  I'm very Americanized, but my mom's gotta bring in that culture of self hatred and racism up. Having a Dad that waa more interested in other women's tits that his own wife's certainly didn't help. My ED has got to be a coping mechanism the amount of negging I grew up with (and they continue).   ""iM tELLiNg yOU tHIs foR yoUR oWn GOOd"" I guess my own good is self loathing and a fear of bread now lol thanks",False,False

The best one I've heard was ""I've accepted I'm not getting any grandchildren"" from my mother. My father still tells me I'm fat to fuck with me even though I haven't been overweight in over a year.",False,False

Unfortunately, it signifies two of the defense mechanisms that people have: either projection of their own insecurities (you mentioned they were overweight) or they are trying to “scare you off” of the consequences of having an ED (very frequently, parents do that when they find themselves helpless and lost in the face of their child’s mental issues). Remember: don’t take it too close to your heart. You need to think of yourself and your own sustainability. It’s not your fault they say that.",False,False
