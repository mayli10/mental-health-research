The third year we became much closer friends and at one point we were circling around the topic of EDs and she told me she had gained 40 pounds over the summer (we’re in college, so I hadn’t seen her during the summer) and went from underweight to a healthy weight. I literally had not noticed AT ALL and I was still comparing my body to hers for thinspo without realizing. Made me realize how messed up my perceptions are tbh",False,False
