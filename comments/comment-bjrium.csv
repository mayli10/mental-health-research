I certainly never take sleep for granted now. It was a rough time in life. I ended up in a mental hospital because it got so bad.

I've tried prazosin and it had no affect, not sure what else is out there though. Hopefully something will help. Waiting on a referral to go through before I can see a psychiatrist. But it is a hell of a lot better than it used to be. I used to get under 2 hours of sleep every night, in 10-20 minute increments.
