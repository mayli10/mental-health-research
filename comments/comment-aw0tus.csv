They use psuedoephedrine but they work the same as ephedrine tablets for appetite suppression for me, and then I wash them down with black coffee. It's less expensive and less suspicious PLUS they have aspirin in them already! However, in abusing ECA stacks, I have lost the ability to restrict low without them. Buyer beware. I don't recommend starting it, it's not a fun addiction (and it IS an addiction, not just a weight-loss supplement). Stimulants are dangerous.",False,False

For where I buy it, it depends on how desperate I am but the three I listed above are the most common stores people get them from. For use, it would not be appropriate for me to explain how to safely use these products, and I guarantee I'm more of an *abuser* of them than a *user* and should absolutely not have my footsteps followed.",False,False

We don't have Bronkaid itself. ",False,False
