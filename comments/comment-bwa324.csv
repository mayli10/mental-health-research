I've always hated the fat on my body and since boobs are pure fat I hated them the most. For me, I love the feeling of having smaller boobs because it makes me feel more free, more light, less restricted. You don't even need to wear a bra, you can just be super free and much, much smaller if you just wear a bralette or pasties or something lol.
