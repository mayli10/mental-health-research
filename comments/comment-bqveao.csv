Before it and during the early years I really wanted to travel.  I've never even left the country.  I struggled through my degree but two months after graduating the disorder sent me to hospital for the first time.  Never used the degree and when I've been able to work it's minimum wage shitty jobs.    This is why I can't go to places like mpa.  Eating disorders are glamourised so hard and the young members WANT to ""become"" anorexic/thin/whatever they think is amazing with an ED (there is NOTHING amazing them), and I wish they'd look at me and see what happens when they take over your life.    I'm even too embarrassed to discuss menopause with a therapist or doctor.  Do I get one?  How will I know?  I haven't had a period for yeaaaaars.  Are the side effects from long term malnutrition a kind of menopause, with the fucked up hormones??    This week I felt amazing because I allowed myself to eat some sugar free licorice I found in the supermarket and it tasted so good.  That's sad when eating sugar free licorice is the week's highlight.  I still have hopes of improvement and I want to work on it.  It's just difficult to get the motivation when I've been in remission in the past and fucked it up.  You're not alone   X",False,False

That’s a hard one to answer because I’m not entirely sure the answer. I believe that, at least in part, I am hardwired for this. My mother also has had eating disorders for as long as I can remember. There is increasing research showing that eating disordered behavior is contributed to by genetics. Secondly, there were a number of environmental factors in my life they gave me very poor self-esteem. I wrapped up my whole self-worth in it being thin because this is what I felt able to do. I felt hopeless at everything else.  And if I’m being totally frank, I think I am simply addicted to being treated a certain way for being extremely thin. Society rewards it.",False,True
