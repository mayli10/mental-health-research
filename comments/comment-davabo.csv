I don't really have any close friends, I don't have any family, and work is just one huge trigger. So I guess what keeps me going is knowing that eventually....eventually it's all going to end. That helps me to keep going, and it's ironic as hell. I'm sorry for this comment, it's really sad. I hope you find some light.",False,False

I accidentally told my friend about my eating disorder when I was drunk, and she's been worried about me ever since. She didn't handle it very well at first, but I told her what not to say to trigger me, and she's better now. Yesterday, she really wanted some ice cream, so we went to get some. She asked me multiple times if I wanted any, and even though she wasn't pushy and didn't bring up my ED at all, I could tell she was sad that I kept saying ""no, I'm good."" It made me feel bad.   My boyfriend and new mom don't know about my ED, but my boyfriend is a really low weight because of his mental health problems. Me starving myself feels insulting to him. Like the fact he is starving and thinks people don't need food to survive because he's schizophrenic makes me feel like an idiot. I know people need food to survive, and I willingly restrict the same way he does.   My new mom cares so much about me, and has done so many things for me (such as letting me live in her home, buying things for me, and giving love I never got from my bio-mom). Starving myself makes me feel like I don't care about her, even though I know I do. It feels like an insult towards her love for me.  Hope you can find your thing!",False,False
