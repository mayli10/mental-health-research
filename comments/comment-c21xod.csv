But i get you I feel like laughing at myself is the only thing that plays down how serious it can be to me.

About a year ago I was hoppin' around the city when I realised that I was hungry. Serious hankering for some McDonalds. So, spent the entire trek to Mikki Deez convincing myself that if I just got a Happy Meal it'd be no biggie and it would be nothing to freak out about. At this point I was in recovery and had made some pretty decent progress (which is debatable considering how strict I still was with what I would allow myself to consume). This was the first junk food thing I'd had outside of a binge-purge scenario. Anyway, brought it home, ate my nuggets, ate my fries, ate my apple slices, literally an hour later I was trying to yeet that bitch back up. So after I purged I turned around, and through my tear-blurred eyes the Happy Meal toy was just staring me down with a big smile on it's face. Immediately broke my shite laughing   I realise this is a miserable story but I laughed then and I still giggle now",False,False
