Hope your insurance covers so you don't have the additional financial burden.  I've been bulimic for more than 20 years, my teeth are holding up well so far...

While I don't see the dentist just as I don't see any other doctor unless something acute comes up, I know I'm covered when it finally comes hitting down. ",False,False
