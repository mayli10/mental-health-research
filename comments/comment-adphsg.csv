Overall it went well. The program was just not working for me and I got tired of trying to find God.,False,True

I hated admitting I was powerless over drugs and alcohol. I didn't want to pray. I didn't want religion (still don't want religion). Even working the steps and being clean and sober for 6 years I have sooo much trouble applying the same method to my eating disorder. Drugs brought me to my knees, but bulimia has toyed with me for years. I'll be doing okay, then it's back, then I'll be better for a while, then it's back.. It's been so different than my experience with addiction. It's hard admit I don't have control, because sometimes I feel like I do. Eating disorders are insidious as fuck. And I really wish you the best and if you ever need to talk please message me :) ",False,False

I keep feeling separate from every one in program. They all have this peace that I dont have but I have no clue how to get it and I definitely dont want to find religion to have it. I think leaving is best for me I just needed to talk it out with someone.   I think I'm gonna tell my sponsor tonight. I've already been cooling things off with her bc of the holidays. It was also really stressful to text my sponsor everything I ate everyday. It made me obsessive. I dont want to have to write down everything I eat. I think it makes me worse but people in OA treat my feelings on this as an excuse not to work program. I dont want to pray.  I dont want to go to meetings for the rest of my life and admit I have an ""incurable"" disease. I dont want to keep having to say over and over that I'm powerless over food. I want to be empowered to change, not powerless unless I surrender to God.   OA is free and I dont know what else to do. I think I just need to suck it up, quit making excuses for overeating, and stick to my plan from my dietitian. I know how to lose weight. Dieting sucks for everyone. Being overweight is making me so miserable and I only have myself to blame. I need to take responsibility for my bad choices and change. ",False,True

The lack of open mindedness. No book or recovery method can give you that. I was forced into it by the realization that literally everything else had failed so I had to try things I didn't feel comfortable with lol while I think the steps would benefit absolutely anyone I think for eating disorders there are other avenues. Have you tried therapy? ,False,False

Like okay you just dont believe there's a God *yet.* i dont think I'll ever be open to that possibility. But today is day two of eating at a healthy deficit so at least I got that going for me. ,False,True

The steps require honesty, open mindedness and willingness. Wasn't until I was open minded enough to say ""okay fine MAYBE there could possibly potentially be a God."" that I was fully able to do the steps. Just my experience for what it's worth and I wish you the best on your recovery! ",False,False

Never got back to me.  End of my involvement in OA.  That said... experiences with all steps programs seem to vary wildly, and it's just not for some people. It also seems to vary a LOOT between different groups, so before you give it up, maybe go to another meeting?",False,False
