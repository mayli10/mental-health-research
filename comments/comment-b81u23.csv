Yeah honestly it is a little triggering.  The evil ED part of my brain is like “finally some fuel to lose weight you gross piece of shit”  I guess maybe that’s where the bad thoughts are coming from.  My ED trying to fuel itself.  Not to turn this around into “woe is me” haha I’m still a piece of shit for thinking that way.  But thanks this helped.,False,True

This is one of them.  Even though you can hide the thoughts and avoid hurting her with them, having them trigger you isn't great for your mental health either. It's poisonous. I'm sorry you're struggling.",False,False

It’s a bad personality trait that I want to be better than others at what I do.   Like I knew a girl that had a severe ED and I purposely skipped events/didn’t hangout with my best friend (who is her roommate) unless she wasn’t there.   If she was open about it or confided in me about it I’d revert back to the fear of triggering her.  I’m a mess of hypocrisy basically.",False,True

It's just if you act on them or say/do things to intentionally hurt/ upset people that there is a problem. Even one has intrusive thoughts. ,False,False
