Im not sure if your doing cbt or dbt but sometimes just getting workbooks even helps. There's free downloads online. And groups.  I also enjoy my dharma recovery groups which uses Buddhists principles  https://recoverydharma.org/  Just finding support is important. Being honest with yourself and your therapist. You've lived with shit too long. Maintaining losing gaining weight is not the make break signs of recovery. Your spirit cares nothing about a number on a scale. Numbers that oppress and dictate your life.   I wish you power and courage in your continued fight.     If 12 step isn't for you and you you like a more science based approach Smart recovery has own book and recovery groups https://www.smartrecovery.org/ https://www.smartrecoverytest.org/local/",False,False

If you don't go get serious help now you'll be a 38 year old suffering the same problems with no true sense of self and a slave to your behaviors because you haven't dealt with the underlying psychological problems.  Seek out help now.  At least join some support groups so that you can get positive people behind you rooting for you to take control of your recovery on a proactive manner. You need to do this.,False,False
