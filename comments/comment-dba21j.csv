I feel so puffy today, the cheeks but especially around my eyes, that I could barely stand to look people in the eye at work. It's almost 6 pm and it's only barely gone down since I slept. I've also ""gained"" like 1,5 kilos and feel super bloated and haven't really registered much hunger all day. Next time I tell myself ""Just eat whatever today, it's been a social and foody weekend already and tomorrow is a fresh beginning"" I'm gonna remind myself of this feeling.",False,False
