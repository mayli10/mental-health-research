If you do the same thing before bed for years, your brain associate sleep with that thing. As I suffered from bad insomnia, I started conditioning myself for a few years, doing the exact same things before bed and reduced my time to fall asleep from 3+h to 1h.  To this day (about ten years later), I still need to go to the bathroom right before sleep or I can't sleep. It's TOTALLY normal and it's a safe behaviour for the brain. You need to slowly get your brain used to change. You might not be able to sleep initially. But eventually you will. And you have to do it EVERY DAY. You can't skip a single day. At some point, you'll be tired enough to fall asleep without trying anyway.",False,False

The only thing that works for me now is just by waiting to eat until dinner, because I know the late snacking is inevitable, and I'd rather eat those calories later in the day than early. The other thing I do is eat half my dinner and save the other half for later.",False,False

A fruit or végétal sometime just not doing it.   A soupe work fine but it need to have like noodle in it. Like a ramen soupe.   I wish I could just loose that habit,False,True

Warm liquid soothes this need for me and thankfully it’s winter so it’s even better when it’s cold outside!,False,False
