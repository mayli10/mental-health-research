I reduced my calories slowly and it got easier to eat less over time. Now my Too Much gene doesnt know where to stop lol,False,True

Having control over our eating but also not having control because it's done due to trauma. That's kind of profound.,False,True

I didnt have as tragic of an upbringing, but my dad was and still is a binger. He would take my brother and I (age 9 and 6 respectively) to mcdonalds every day before and after school. I use to think it was because he wanted to make us happy but in reality he was using us as a buffer to feel less guilty about going through the drive through.  My mom was always a great cook with lots of veggies and lean meat, but I didnt appreciate that until adulthood because my mom was thin and pretty. She had control over her eating and I resented her for it. My dad would also shit talk her after the divorce, leading me to be incredibly sensitive to comments my mom would make on my food intake. ""Shes, bullying you, tash.""   No dad, she wasnt. She wanted to help. As an adult I'm spiraling out of control with restriction and numbers.",False,True

I was overweight and I hated myself sooooooo much. It didn't help that I went to a small private catholic school (with a scholarship bc we were poor) and everyone was rich and cliquey so I had no friends. The only food we had at home was junk or I could eat donuts I'd buy from the gas station when my drunk mom would make me walk down the block to get her stuff with the food stamps. I remember constantly obsessing over what I was eating, knowing it was terrible, and being trapped in the fact that i was too young to do anything about it and I was just hungry. It was stale bread or nothing.   I would sometimes stay with my grandma for a few days (my only bio relative who I'm still in contact with after going into foster care) and she would feed me like a real human. I remember I would vent to her for hours about how i hated my body, about how much I loved the food she made because I never got vegetables at home. I remember one time distinctly, when I must have been 9 or 10, I was over at her house and I sat down and wrote out a diet plan in my journal because I was going to lose weight. I was only going to eat the salads that came with school lunches and then ask my mom to buy me vegetables for dinner. I was so set on it, but even in the moment i knew it would be impossible. My mom wouldn't do jack shit to help me, and no amount of love and body positivity from my wonderful grandma could help me when I wasn't with her.   So now I'm 21, and analyzing how the complete lack of control in my childhood reflects on my unhealthy relationship with food today. Now I can shop on my own, buy my own food, be vegan, eat only cucumbers when I want to, have a bite of ice cream and call it quits for the day if I so choose. it's really just about the fact that I have control now, which I love, and I love not answering to anyone, but I'm still often very sad for my past self, who wasn't really even that overweight but just really really out of place. Wow vent over. Thank you if you read all of this(¬¥-Ôπè-`Ôºõ)",False,False
