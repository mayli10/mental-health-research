Of course guys may be attracted to women like Ariana Grande and Emily (forget her last name, the model), but in my experience these are ""unrealistic"" attractions.

Multiple times I've liked a guy but refused to humor them because I wasn't as skinny as possible yet. Then they naturally move on and it's always with a girl that is just...normal. I always hold myself back because for some reason I see everyone but me as beautiful and worthy  So yeah, guys don't understand what underweight really is and they often have unrealistic expectations.
