I've been through lots of therapy and rehab even.  At my worst, I was diagnosed with AN B/P and PTSD and went to rehab because I was physically addicted to alcohol. I needed the therapy. 30 days every day therapy was so good and having the medical attention too was necessary at that point in my life. I was coming out of a seven year abusive relationship, and before that I had a very abusive environment (mainly due to one person in my family) so basically my whole life I've been putting up with abuse and alcohol was a coping mechanism to a dangerous amount.  TWO YEARS at least of therapy and naltrexone at my worst helped me climb out of that hole.  I now enjoy a couple drinks at social events and I do not enjoy getting drunk alone. Before I was drinking 2 bottles of wine a day while underweight because I basically didn't want to be alive and that gave me Oblivion.  It's not who I am.  I'm not saying you are not an alcoholic.  But it can also be a coping mechanism you can overcome.  Even if you can never drink again, that may be the best solution.  Whatever is best for you, THERAPY is pretty much required if you want to heal.  I went to therapy drunk. I went to therapy underweight. I went to therapy right after a binge and drunk.  But I kept going to therapy because that in itself is a step to heal.  Though I still have issues, having one less issue is amazing and I highly recommend it. Having all the issues and going to therapy is still useful.  Wherever you are and wherever you struggle, the label doesn't matter as much as where you don't want to be anymore.",False,False

If that makes sense. Which is why I don't feel like an alcoholic. I just *want* to drink- expecially around my dad and my extended family.",False,True

Yes, alcohol makes me more pleasant too, but I'd rather eat food than drink my calories (except coffee, coffee is everything) and I don't mind being a cranky bitch, keeps people away.",False,False

I'd say it becomes alcoholism when it starts to impact your life negatively, losing a job, financial hardship, straining relationships, etc.  What I definitely don't go by is the AA definition, which goes something like ""if you ever wonder if you are an alcoholic, you're an alcoholic."" By that definition everyone that drinks is an alcoholic except for the most hardcore alcoholics.",False,False

I took it and when it came out “get your ass to treatment” I changed my answers until it said I was (mostly) fine. Lol. (Ultimately I ended up in outpatient and it was a positive experience.)  If you drink regularly for the primary purpose of getting drunk, if once you start drinking you have difficulty stopping, you *may* be alcoholic. But it’s something every person decides for themself. The people over at the stopdrinking sub and IRC are very friendly and supportive if you’re interested in trying sobriety.",False,False
