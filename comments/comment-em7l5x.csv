I just have to eat my “big meal” in the evening - also saves you from bloating during the day lol - or save some calories for a light snack before going to bed, otherwise I can’t sleep and start to wake up at 3 am which leads to even shittier feeling during the day. Warm carbohydrates are my fave, like small porridge or toast.",False,False

Like wtf am I supposed to do at 3 AM with 2 hours of sleep and no hobbies that don't involve food or eating food lol. Thankfully it does get better (for me), just takes a while for things to get back to normal.   4 AM of day 4 for me. Seriously congrats on 21 days. Shit's hard to stop.",False,False

I usually need/get 7-8hrs. The past few weeks I've been high restricting at a net 1300-1500cals (I'm very active) and I sleep like crap. Hey wake up before 4 a.m. to hunger pains and can't go back to sleep. Getting about 5-6hrs of sleep, which sucks because I need my brain for work. I feel you.",False,False
