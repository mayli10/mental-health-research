If it takes me just as long to lose the pound of water weight as it would a pound of fat, and my clothes fit tighter due to bloat, they seem the same to me!  I suppose the fact that itâ€™s purely cosmetic is the main difference, right? As in, thereâ€™s not a new pound of fat surrounding your organs. ðŸ¤”  Again, I realize this is annoying and a terrible attitude to have about it. ðŸ˜… Thanks, ED brain! ðŸ™ƒ",False,True

There's no way you could gain fat from a deficit. Just drink tons of water and maybe exercise a bit so you can get rid of excess sodium and you'll be back on track!
