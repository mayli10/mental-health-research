I like to buy sf jello in the package because it's 40cal if I eat the whole container. Pudding is tempting also because even though it's slightly higher cal the sf is still decently low cals for a great dessert replacement. My problem is I'm cheap so even if I buy almond milk to make it, it won't take that much and then what do I do with the rest? I drink my coffee black and generally don't eat any dairy when I'm restricting.  (I feel like the answer is to just buy the premade/preportioned sf pudding pots tink geeeez)",False,False
