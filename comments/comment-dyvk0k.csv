I like having the fall detection and emergency SOS features for safety. The EKG capability is pretty nifty too.   But for now Apple Watch is still limited to iPhone users, and there are plenty of more budget-friendly trackers out there. There are also trackers with more features and longer battery life. Just depends on what you’re looking for. DCrainmaker has a website with *very* thorough reviews of various trackers and gps watches that can be helpful when making a choice.   I guess the thing to be aware of is whether the tracker is a net positive or whether on average it’s fueling negative choices - for me it’s often a fine line to walk.",False,False

And a wave of frustration if for a given exercise effort level my HR is lower than normal or below my “is this even exercise” threshold.   But I also want my VO2 max estimate to stay high (even though I know it’s a garbage approximation) and the first two fixations are pretty incompatible with that. Congrats to my brain for finding yet another lose-lose proposition.,False,False
