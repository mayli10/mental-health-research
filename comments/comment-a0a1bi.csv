I had just gone thru puberty and I was the only girl in my class with ‚Äúreal‚Äù breasts - plenty of girls in sports bras and 32-As but I was in 32Ds and I was only 4‚Äô tall. I got some ‚Äúpositive‚Äù attention from boys and men which made me deeply uncomfortable. I didn‚Äôt get sex ed until high school and that was abstinence only and the chewing gum analogy.   My mom was drunkorexic and orthorexic for years - her all time low was 88lbs. She blamed me for her weight gain. While pregnant with me she got gestational diabetes and after I was born and she got sober she gained and gained and gained. ‚ÄúWe‚Äù were always dieting. We were on all the fad diets together - Jenny Craig, weight watchers, Atkins, paleo, now she‚Äôs on keto. We also struggled with money issues, plenty of stresses and food insecurity. Very briefly homeless.   When I was 11 or 12 and my father was in the ICU I started eating one meal a day which I did until I was 19. Fast all day, huge dinner. Sometimes grazing. Binges. Night eating. I drank one soda for lunch. Poor people food for dinner - pasta, rice, etc. very starchy low flavor. My mom was very abusive with food. She would constantly threaten to kill herself and call herself a slave (for cooking food? And cleaning? Like a mother???) if I didn‚Äôt eat it all and then she‚Äôd pile on seconds and thirds.   After my father died my sister moved back in with her children. Too expensive, too cramped. It got worse. I didn‚Äôt eat more than dinner/binges for years. We were on reduced lunch for a while but I still felt self conscious about it. Once they made me throw out my lunch because the account was in the red. I was too humiliated to try after that. I drank a lot of my calories and gained a lot. I learned about proana when I was 15-16 and flirted with it but it didn‚Äôt stick. I remember a huge blow out fight with my mom at 16 and binging and feeling like I was gonna throw up and I just wanted to purge and purge. I didn‚Äôt tho.   I had doctors disbelieve my chronic pain and one call me fat (actually ‚Äúfat‚Äù not ‚Äúoverweight‚Äù or ‚Äúobese‚Äù). Ah yes I‚Äôll cure my dislocated fingers by losing weight. I‚Äôll cure my ear infection by losing weight. Like maybe? But can we like run a test? Maybe consider something else for a minute? To this day I despise doctors. Turns out I have a congenital collagen defect and all my problems were legitimate and not related to my weight at all.   At 17 I started strict 1500 a day and quit soda. I lost 30 pounds. I went to college and having a meal plan I was eating better than I‚Äôve ever did before (still shocked about people complaining about college meal plans and cafeteria food). I ate three meals a day. Went vegetarian. Flirted with veganism. Drank one soda a week. It was wonderful. My freshman fifteen was negative.   Then I became clinically depressed (suicidal, not bathing, apathy, the works). I also had to go home for Christmas (they forced us out for three weeks!). I started binging again. The doctors put me on meds that made me stupidly nauseous. I started vomiting after every meal. Then it became intentional. Especially after they took me off the nauseating meds. I‚Äôd learnt to flex my stomach muscles to vomit hands free. ",False,False

Not long after something triggered in my brain and I started avoiding most meals. I ate an apple with peanut butter in the morning and a Fiber-One bar after school when I finished my daily runs. Some days I would have fuller meals if my parents prepared something or I was at a friend‚Äôs house but it would usually end with crying and other self-harming behaviors.   By the time I got to high school I had gone from 125 lbs to 90 at my thinnest. I started having problems breathing and getting dizzy/faint at track practice so I begged my mom to take me to a doctor. At this point, I thought I had asthma or low blood sugar but my doctor said the word ‚Äúanorexic‚Äù and I immediately knew the monster‚Äôs name. He recommended a child physiologist but my mom threw out the business card on our way out of the office.  Not long after, a friend‚Äôs mom started packing me a lunch to eat.

My mom saw that I ate them (they were still in the baking pan when I took them) and flipped. ""Do you know how many calories are in those?! Do you know how many times you'd have to walk around the neighborhood to burn those off?!"" Absolutely furious at me for eating so many. I was a kid, I didn't understand what calories were. But in that moment I understood that eating a lot was a bad thing to do. I was so scared and so startled. That moment is seared into my memory.   My mom has never had a very positive relationship with food (or me for that matter, my brother is her golden child) even if she pretends to. She's always making remarks about how she should eat less, following basic diet tips but eating poorly, and yoyoing between the same five pounds. It's worse when she's gaining and her jeans are getting poorly, it's all anyone will hear about. Because she's kind of a narcissist, she expected me to have the same views and concerns as her. So I did to please her. I don't think I've ever been happy with my weight.   I've never had a good relationship with food either. My mom would obsess over having sweets but not too many, so I thought that was how you approached food you wanted but couldn't have. I've always been possessive over my food as well, as if I didn't eat it or lay claim to it immediately it'd disappear. I'd get so anxious about whether or not someone was going to eat my food, as if I never knew where my next meal would be from.   My first diet was when I was about fourteen. I remarked to my mom how much I hated my weight, so she put me on weight watchers. I lost a few pounds but not a lot because I wasn't honest with what I ate. Again, too possessive over my food to give it up. A lot of the time I'd wish I could just stop eating, but I never could muster the willpower.   Both of my parents liked to comment on weight. My dad would make fun of me when I was a teenager because I was overweight. My mom liked to idolize anyone who lost weight, saying how much better they looked and how proud she was of them. She'd do the same thing to me if I lost anything more than five pounds, which was one of the few situations where I'd earn her praise.   In college I finally had complete control over my food, so I binged. Constantly. I gained like forty pounds. I couldn't seem to get out of it. When I left, I found a little bit more control after a few months. I finally snapped and just. Started eating less. I couldn't take being fat anymore. I couldn't take it knowing how much control my binges had over me and my emotions. I couldn't take knowing how much better I'd be treated once I was skinny.   Worst part is, I was a psychology major. I know what I'm doing to myself and I know it's shit and a bad idea. I just can't stop it. It's a train ride where I can see the crash at the end but I can't jump off.

'ugh, so sugary'. like okay bitch let me eat some fucking barley and oats then shall i? how about we skip starbucks and just go to some field and consume dirt by the handful. then she got herself a medium hot chocolate with whipped cream and a chocolate pastry. what the fuck?  i wish we ate like we shat. if you hear someone in the cubicle next to you having a lil struggle what do you do? do you call that bitch out saying 'WOW i wish i could have such satisfying bowel movements!' or 'that sounds like a big one!' or 'i can smell it...'?

I never cultivated much of a hunger drive because for a long while I never expected I would get a reliable meal, so it was easy to just be ‚Äúpicky‚Äù even when I was getting reliably fed. So I used that as an excuse not to eat. I was under 100 pounds my whole life until I was 23 and I was proud of it. Everyone seemed to comment on it, whether in jealousy or in concern.

I was thinking about this the other day and realized that my eating disorder wasn't a matter of ""if"" but a matter of ""when."" My family made fun of me, growing up, for having normal baby fat. They told me that gaining weight was inevitable and when I'd be an adult, I'd become fat, since everyone else in the family was. When I was 15 (at my HW, a couple pounds below the overweight BMI), I went shopping with my best friend and my mom while wearing shorts. I was walking in front with my friend when my mom stopped me to tell me, in public and in front of my friend, that the cellulite on the backs of my thighs was ""absolutely disgusting."" Meanwhile, she was (and still is) well into an overweight BMI, so I don't know why she thought it was appropriate to criticize *me* for being chubby. Throw in some feeling out of control with school and I just snapped. Started liquid fasting and surrounded myself in pro-ana content from tumblr, instagram, etc. A couple years pass and here I am. So yes, I think I was also ""destined"" to have an ED.",False,False

They weren‚Äôt there for me, but they were there for responsible adults to take action on.  I had a very bad early childhood.  My grandparents lived next door to my parents and babysat me and my siblings while my parents worked.  My grandpa was emotional abusive as long as I can remember.  He always compared me to my older sister (he called her the Queen) and made jokes about me being fat.  I was a bit chubby, but not even overweight.    He then started doing more serious emotional abuse, forcing me to disembowel a deer that he hunted when I was 4 or 5 even though I was crying and scared.  My dad was there and didn‚Äôt think that was appropriate for a little girl to do, but when his father insisted he just stood there and watched with a defeated look on his face.   From there it turned to grooming for sexual abuse and eventually sexual abuse that went on for a few years.  There were many more opportunities for my mom, dad, grandma, or a different family member to see that something wasn‚Äôt right but they weren‚Äôt paying attention.  People walking in the room when my hand is in his pocket, no that‚Äôs not suspicious at all!  6 year-olds routinely reach into adult‚Äôs pants pockets!  I‚Äôm sitting on his lap in a dress, someone else walks in the room and he shuffles me around and zips his pants back up, nothing to see here!  The whole time weight seemed to be a thing because he always made disgusting comments about my body.  He started sexually abusing me when I was 7,  but the way he talked about my body and made me feel like it was much more mature.  That‚Äôs about when my parents split up.    Things got a lot more serious when I was 11 and became friends with a girl who had some problems at home like I did.  Her mom was an alcohol and hit her.  My friend was really skinny and always took her lunch and cut it up but never really ate much of it.  I started doing the same.  I ate a small breakfast at home, no lunch, and a small dinner.  But I didn‚Äôt count calories.  Eventually I stopped bothering with taking the lunch just to disfigure it.  My mom only noticed when she got a refund check from the school for lunch money that was unused, but she didn‚Äôt seem concerned.  I learned to purge after a family dinner when I was 14 when my mom, who had always been critical of my weight, yelled at me for taking the last pork chop.  She told me I was a greedy, selfish pig, no wonder I was getting so fat!  I was my current height of 5‚Äô3‚Äù and maybe 110 pounds.  I could say more but then when I decide to write a book in the future I will have told all the stories already.  The warning signs were there to both of my parents.  But they were blind.
