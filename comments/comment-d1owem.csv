On the other hand, it's helpful for those who are just starting out to hear that even though they definitely lost fat as part of their 10-lb loss in 2 weeks, at least half was probably water weight, so they shouldn't get discouraged when it slows to the normal 1-2 lbs a week and think they need to cut back further. In any case it's the same as treating a gain - you can't have gained 5 lbs from one day of overeating, most of it is just water weight",False,False

It didn't help me much :/ I look totally different and if I keep eating it ain't stop gaining too like at one time I eat a lot for a week and the number kept raising, like first day +2.2 k.g. Well I guess my body ain't use to food, it's normal. 2 Day another +0.8 kg. Ok, I guess.... 3 day +1.2 Ehhhhhh, 4 day +0.4 Wow maybe it'll stop now. 5 day +1.4, 6 day +0.3, 7 day +.0.8. How can I not freak out. Is this even water weight :/ seriously. And I no way eat 10,000 cal a day, even I binge all day it's probably just ~2600 top! which only one day in that week. And cause I freak out I fast for 6 days and my weight went the same as before I binge....    I really don't think it's a water weight (How many kg. can considered water weight anyway?) I don't know. I feel like I'd keep gaining if I don't stop eating...",False,False

I binged for 5ish days straight last week (back to restriction... woo?) and it was fucking painful moving afterwards.  You know how your breasts get tender and heavy when you come onto your period? My entire body felt like that, and my stomach was jiggling which at my BMI theres no real reason for.  Now I've managed to shift the water weight and can start to undo the binge gain I can jump, even, without feeling like I need to support my stomach for the landing.",False,False

For example I always struggled doing contour makeup because of that technique everyone uses: ""1. make it dramatic and ugly, 2. cover with foundation and/or power for subtle effect."" One day I just realized... what if you just make it subtle and pretty from the beginning, instead of using another layer of makeup just to cover it...  Anyways, that was sort of off-topic. Water-weight gain and loss is the bane of my existence since I got my own scale. Restricted for a week and gained 600 grams, then had a weekend of a fairly normal calorie intake and lost 2 kilos. Most likely the first instance was added water weight, while the second weighing was deceptively low for the same/opposite reason.",False,False
