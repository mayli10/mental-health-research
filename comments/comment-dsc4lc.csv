Your ED took up a lot of your mental space before, and now you are noticing it more. I can totally relate to feeling like that, it almost becomes like a hobby. One day you will be free of this",False,False

Like I canâ€™t wait to get out of lecture just so I can obsess over food again and I am supposed to study tonight for my midterm but I am scrolling on reddit seeing if anybody else post something relatable.,False,True

It does take a long time, not just for your body to get used to it, but recovery also means a lot of mental shifts and changes in your thought patterns. For example, your thought patterns of having to ""earn"" food will start to fade as you go through the recovery process, and other thoughts like that. ED takes up so much of our mental space, it is a lot to unlearn. It's hard work and its scary, but it's so worth it in the end, keep going.",False,False

It takes a lot of guts to even contemplate recovering so the fact youâ€™ve gone this far is awesome.,False,False
