I currently like (and pretty much only eat) babybel light cheese wheels, Luna bars, mini kind bars, lower sugar oatmeal packets, corn thins with salsa, eggs, 647 bread, fiber one brownies, triple zero yogurt cups, grilled or pan seared chicken breast, oat milk, outshine fruit pops, lunch meat turkey slices, frozen veggie steamer bags, and ensure max protein shakes (I use them as coffee creamer for extra protein)",False,False

Makes absolutely no sense, but to me, I feel safer if I know I'm eating 500 calories than if I ""guesstimate"" that I'm eating 200.",False,False

Like plain popcorn, steamed broccoli, cherry tomatoes, kale, those are all things I can eat in bulk and I'll be full before the calories associated stress me out   Or things like Halo top, which I don't like that much but can eat a whole pint of and be okay. I never do because I don't really like it but that way I can keep ice cream in the house and satisfy my rampant sweet tooth.  ""Fear food"" I think is the opposite. Things I will binge nonstop and eat until I'm ill.  Pasta, rice cakes, auntie Annie's vegan mac, baked lays, etc.  I'm the person who buys the food she doesn't like because I'm pretty broke and it basically keeps me from ordering junk or buying snacks.",False,False

I feel like shit when i'm bloated or gaining weight, but those feelings don't come when i'm eating. It's more like i'm addicted to binging and purging and I can't stay emotionally stable without purging several times a day. It's not that i sit and think about the food that i haven't purged, i just get in a really bad mood and I do a complete 180 after i purge. So technically I don't have any safe foods, because I purge everything.",False,False

For example, I eat toast with cream cheese a lot (even though carbs and cheese are fear foods for many people) and that's a safe food because to me it could pass for what a 'normal person' would eat.   Same with store bought pre-made sandwiches. I can eat a sandwich and diet coke and be done and pretend for a while that I don't have an eating disorder.",False,False

Foods that after binging on I just go ""Well that was really stupid"" instead of purging. It's usually low cal stuff that I've memorized the calories of and that doesn't need to be weighed out and can be counted as ""healthy"", but sometimes it its also just completely random. It's mostly really specific stuff and I tend to get upset when the store doesn't have some of them.  Rice cakes, babybel cheese (only sometimes), those little seaweed packs, Campbells ""italian vegetables with farro"" soup, chocolate chex, harvest snaps, over easy eggs, and a few specific granola bars",False,False
