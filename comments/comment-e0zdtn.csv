It sounds like you worked to make the best call for yourself in this moment and that’s awesome.   As far as the walk, I kinda suspect raising $$$ is objective numero uno. But also on their website:  &gt;NEDA walks are a celebration of hope and strength  Just as we don’t have to look a certain way to be struggling with an ED, we don’t don’t have to be perfect chicken-soup-for-the-soul Instagram stories to be part of recovery, or advocacy, or hope.   You still being here, still trying, still being open to recovery and working to find your way...*that* my dear is the deepest embodiment of hope and strength. &lt;3",False,False

Just because you're still struggling, doesn't mean you shouldn't encourage other people to get better. I don't think anyone would've judged you for not being better, and if they did, THEY'D be the dicks, not you!",False,False
