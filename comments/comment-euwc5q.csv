At the point that I slipped back into my restrictive eating patterns I was at the BMI line for obesity. I think it added a lot of cognitive dissonance and made it easier to lie to myself that what I was doing was fine...even good. I'm *supposed* to lose weight, right? I really relate to not being able to see the weight loss and to actually getting more upset about my body even as my weight is going down. Like, what? This is not what I was promised! I guess that's part of what makes this shindig disordered. Thoughts and perceptions get pretty distorted. It can be really hard and lonely and overwhelming.  I think for me the idea of breaking the fast is sometimes more overwhelming than actually breaking the fast? In that situation I tend to find the sensation of fullness extremely distressing, which can trigger compensatory behaviors. So, for me, breaking the fast with something small and gentle on my stomach is the way to go...just ease into things. Sometimes talking about it with my SO can help, if I first explain the ways I'd like to be supported. (He's a food normie and so doesn't get my fixation on numbers or my distress around food/eating/weight so his instinctive response can sometimes be unhelpful.)
