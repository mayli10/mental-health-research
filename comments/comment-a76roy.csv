High waisted bottoms.  Hems should always hit the skinniest part of your body - ankle length pants, tops that end at the right length at your hips, 3/4th sleeves.   I pretty much look at models off duty styles and focus more on the fit and length of their outfits.  ",False,False

A bra should bring your breast tissue into the centre of your chest and lift it. This makes you look narrower as most people have breast tissue extending to the sides of their chest. The key is to â€˜swoop and scoopâ€™ - put the bra on, bend over, and scoop your breasts upwards and inwards into the cups. You may find that your bra seems too small, it probably is. When I discovered this method I went from a 34B to a 32DD but my boobs look the same size or even smaller in the 32DD. This technique also helps if you get armpit fat/bulges caused by your bra.",False,False

I have birthed a small human and it's cool to think of my body in that aspect. I know some people like the hips and boobs so I do feel appealing to SOME people. Not most but some. Every girl in my family is very small and it's hard for me not to think about it during the holidays. Everyone prefers smaller and I use to feel confident being the youngest with the fullest chest and butt. I wish I still felt like that. I was 210 not long ago so I still feel 210. I guess all I want is for people to like me. And I know its not important and nobody will even notice I cut off 8 inches in my hair so I am just doing it for myself anyway. ,False,True

Even if you feel super frumpy and gross, there's a certain beauty to having breasts and full hips and thighs that, even if it's not what you want, may help you to focus on the positives of the current version of you and enjoy this little time of year when you should be able to give yourself some slack on your self-image. I know how it feels to feel like a ""sack of laundry"" because I've only recently stopped feeling like that after years of working to lose weight, but trying your absolute best to be kind to yourself along the way actually makes it way easier to keep up the energy to work towards your goals. Literally wear whatever makes you feel your most fabulous. Maybe a sparkly dress. You'll look beautiful no matter what xx",False,False

Usually more tailored looks will work well (as opposed to lose or baggy clothes) to make a curvy body look as small as it can.  I also have big hips, and I think pants that are in between regular rise and high waist make my legs look the slimmest (high waisted pants emphasize wide hips, as do low waisted, whereas pants that come up right between your belly button and hips will flatten out the lower belly area and balance the hips). Dark bottoms, of course, are more slimming than light-colored bottoms. Going with a nice blouse instead of just a plain t-shirt always makes for a classy look as well. For dresses, just anything that's structured to give a shape (not necessarily tight) instead of something flowy would be best :)",False,False

Itâ€™ll depend on your personal style and where you carry weight. I carry all my weight in my tummy, boobs, arms, and back. So my go to is a cardigan (not tight, but not loose enough to make you look bigger), a relatively tighter shirt so it makes my boobs a focus (lmao a distraction from my disaster of a body), some sort of skater skirt (something that has a thick waist band to define my waist but flairs out the bottom to hide my small butt and tummy.

For example, I carry my weight in my hips/butt/thighs and my waist is the smallest point of my body. Also, even though I have a fat ass, my legs are comparatively longer than average. I'm tempted to wear baggy trousers and a cardigan to cover my body, but then my clothing would hang from my largest areas (hips and bust), making me look 4 sizes larger than I am.  Instead, I wear short skirts that cinch at the waist with a top tucked-in. This shows the narrowness of my waist. And if I wear dark colors on the bottom (like a black skirt and black tights), it detracts from the size and gives the illusion of length.  &amp;#x200B;  Not sure of that helps, but I'd say be aware of the lines you're creating with clothing to emphasize and de-emphasize as you wish.",False,False
