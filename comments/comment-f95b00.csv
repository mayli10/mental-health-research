Idk man it seems like more of an evil especially since it literally doesn’t even promote any weight loss :/,False,False

You’re losing water weight.  #2 I don’t care if that causes a breakdown because you can get permanent organ damage and a permanent distended stomach by abusing laxatives. I’m not kidding. Those will fuck You up more than you realize. Stop using them ASAP and CERTAINLY stop using them multiple times a week unless told to by a doctor.,False,False
