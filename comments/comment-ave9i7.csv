I had exactly the same thing happen, and I thought it would never stop. I would binge every single night to the point where I was crying, shoveling food that repulsed me into my mouth. And oh god, the night sweats...  I thought it would never end. I started self-harming again. I wanted to die.   But you know what? It *did* end. I got back to a healthy weight (BMI 21), and it stopped. Food no longer had that all-consuming (geddit?) allure to me. My eating normalised, and my BMI went back down to 20 without any conscious effort on my part. It's stayed there for 6 months now, and I eat regular meals with my boyfriend every day. I don't panic about it anymore. I'm happier.   I know it's impossible to believe other people's accounts of recovery; I certainly never thought that it would work that way for *me* - how could it when I was such a stupid, greedy, fat pig? But it did.   I learnt that I am no different to anyone else going through anorexia recovery, and I *promise* that you aren't either.   I'm so sorry to hear about your abortion - this is going to be a difficult time for you. Please be kind to yourself, and know that we are all here for you if you need us.

Then I realized I was still eating when I‚Äôd had no hunger cues, but by this time I also had no ‚Äúfullness‚Äù cues, and bingeing had become a compulsion, so I could no longer stop eating until I was in physical pain...
