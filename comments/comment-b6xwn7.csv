You’ve never had multiple servings at thanksgiving or like a birthday dinner at some place like the Cheesecake Factory? A meal and a slice of cheesecake is about 3000 calories.   Yeah if we’re talking “normal” people then I can see them never binging but that just means they’ve never been out of control. I don’t think many people realize the calories in a lot of foods.,False,False

For instance I follow this fitness girl, Brittany Lesser, and she did some Q&amp;A video a couple years ago and someone asked how to get over binge eating and she was like ""I don't know because I've never binged. I don't think I've ever even eaten 3,000 calories before."" Like...wat girl. How??",False,True

I have no idea what it might be like.   Actually I've never purged. I was too scared. I always just binged and starved.
