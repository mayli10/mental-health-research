If I try anything, make up, jewelry, girly clothes, I feel like I look so fucking awkward, so fortunately I'm too broke to go beyond the thrift store. I just wear black, blue and grey colors and off brand sneakers. ",False,False

I learned on there that it's now fashionable to put emphasis on your waist and ankles. Like doing different tucks with your tops into high waisted bottoms, cuffing the legs of your jeans etc  It was highly out of my comfort zone at first (I live in jeggings + oversized tops lol) but I have a broad upper body too and doing the ""tuck"" actually gives me the illusion of a waist!",False,False

Especially the ones I buy from the little boys section at Target. Over all I go for a mixed vibe of Grunge and vintage with a splash of European fashion. So for example the aforementioned black turtleneck, a large antique pendant, my black Chelsea boots, and one of those black sailor hats, and plaid pants or boyfriend jeans, anything high waisted and flood length really. It’s basically the only thing I feel myself in and I have about 5 variations of the same look. ",False,False

I always had chubby body parts. Is it so bad I kinda want to look like those bony skinny goth looking models you use to see all the time in Hot Topic? I'm talking before 2005. Like at first I wanted to be all ""phat"" but yeah after I lost most of my weight the first time, my boobs shrank and look like deflated balloons when I bend down. My butt had some shape but nothing to toss a dollar at... So now I'm like ""ahhh I guess I'm suppose to be the tiny looking kind"". I don't know.",False,False
