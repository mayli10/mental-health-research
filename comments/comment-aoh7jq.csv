I like the challenge of putting more calories in his meals. We do a lot of stir frys as well, and I’m not vegetarian but here are some options:   Omelets- you could have an egg white omelet with veggies &amp; make him one with whole eggs/meat/cheese  Pasta- I’ll make my portion mostly zucchini noodles &amp; add meat to his. we both love the Banza chickpea pasta, it’s high protein &amp; tastes like the real deal  Pancakes- I love the “2 ingredient banana pancakes” &amp; since they are quick and easy I can make him normal pancakes. Kodiak Cakes are also awesome and have great macros, you could make yours with water and his with whole milk and eggs  Tacos- I use ground beef but you could probably use a veg alternative and just mix with cauliflower rice, taco seasoning and salsa, I have it as a bowl &amp; make tacos with cheese for my bf  (sorry these are mostly ED foods and not actual recipes lol)       ",False,False

Throw in a potato with his and you can stick to more nutrient dense veg like zucchini, beets, carrots.  Veg chili is a good option. Look up a low cal recipe and serve with rice and cheese on top for your bf   Spaghetti! Squash. Honestly I'm just loving this right now and everyone should be enjoying the deliciousness that is spaghetti sauce on a squash.   Stuffed peppers. Stuff one with meat( if he eats meat) bread crumbs (think turkey stuffing) and some rice. In yours stick to mixed veg and beans.    Crepes for dinner! I'm not joking you can make this work fairly healthy. I found a recipe for low fat crepes where they work out to 57 cal each. Let him load up whatever toppings he likes and you stick to just a few and load up on your favourite fruit. You can also make savoury crepes as well. ",False,False
