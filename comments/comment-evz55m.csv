I feel like portions are built around the traditional Sunday Roast (meat, potatoes, veg) but that’s probably the only normal meal that is segmented in such a way.   Completely leaves out cultural differences in eating habits and I think portion sizes for the most part are stupid, but I guess it’s more ‘healthy’ than teaching kids CICO or whatever",False,False
