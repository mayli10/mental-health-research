Does that mean they are not allowed to have a community? Sites like MPA allows people with eating disorders to help each other and talk about their struggles. But communities like these would probably trigger almost anyone into a relapse - because it is a support site for everyone, not just those in recovery.  There will be people who look emaciated, challenges, people who think eating 500 calories is high restriction, etc.   Of course ED sites isn't something for you if seeing these types of things would trigger you into a relapse. But does giving a community to a group of mentally ill people mean that it is dangerous? No. In fact, having a community for any group of people is always good.  MPA is not toxic nor dangerous. **Letting us have a community does not mean that the site is dangerous.**",False,False

It's not just about EDs... there's so many other forums that you could surf and not even touch anything ED related. The mental health forum and abuse forums are especially helpful, as they are topics that most people don't feel comfortable disclosing IRL.   To say that the environment is toxic is way off base. I know you're not comparing OGMPA to Pancakes, but I've been attacked on OG MPA multiple times (once for saying I was going to give myself a break for a holiday and someone told me I was fake because someone with a real ED wouldn't do that.) Sure, there's thinspo, meanspo, challenges, etc. But this is a sick community. None of us need to be told it will be triggering if we wander into these forums; we know and welcome it anyways. It's part of the illness. The competitions are 100% optional and you don't even have to go into that forum if you don't want to. Even if you decide to take part in a challenge, no one is forcing you to complete it. You can quit and that's your prerogative. I was in a challenge recently and decided it just wasn't working for me. I dropped out and all the other members were understanding and so sweet when I told them I wouldn't be participating anymore. You may have had a bad experience with some rotten apples on Pancakes, but please don't paint the entire community in a negative light. Pancakes has become my one safe space, and I'm sure a lot of other members would agree.",False,False

People deal with eating disorders in very different ways. I'd have honestly expected every single person in this sub to know that already. **Those ""challenge"" threads and group chats are 100% optional.** They were in separate areas of the site, that you have to specifically go to if you want to see their content.  Sure, they do exist – and I'm not about to pretend that's just fine and should be ignored – but they're not out in the open for any random person to just stumble into by accident (iirc, MyProAna hid the entire challenges subforum behind a wall – you not only had to be a registered member, you had to have a certain number of posts too), and they're certainly not the central content of the site.   Like proED, these sites mean a lot to people. There's not always someone around that you can talk to about your struggles who understands what you're going through, and isn't just going to be like ""this is SO BAD FOR YOU, YOU NEED TO RECOVER RIGHT NOW"", and these sites, while obviously not the most wholesome thing on the internet, are a safe place for people to just vent, or chat about things lightly that other, non-disordered people would make a big fuss about.  If you're going to go all in on the challenges subforum here, it's worthwhile to also note some other subforums: ""The Happy Place"", ""Games"", ""***Recovery***"", ""Media &amp; Art"", ""Peer Group Conversations""... the list goes on. They talk about the news, TV shows,  fashion trends, and play dumb post-based games just like every other forum out there. They're *friends*, many of whom don't have other ways of connecting to each other, and almost all of whom have a barrier (their eating disorders) that keeps them from interacting as genuinely with the people around them. I know you're worried. I am too. But don't take that away from them.",False,False

Pancakes is more supportive and wholesome than ever.   Mods just took down several very toxic threads and a member who was promoting toxicity was permanently banned. It’s just having it’s fair share of drama HOWEVER the drama is still very insignificant in comparison to the amazing, supportive people on there. In many ways it’s pro-recovery, it’s just also a safe space for those unable to recover or those who aren’t there yet.",False,False

It does, of course, have its dangerous aspects, such as the Challenges &amp; Competitions forum you were referring to which can be triggering. But even so, I wouldn't call it extreme.

They had “mandatory challenges” where everyone had to exercise every day, and if one person binged, everyone in the group was required to burn off the one member’s entire binge in exercise. One day some girl managed to binge eat like 3,500 cals worth of junk food, and the group leader said “ok ladies you all have 24 hours to burn 3,500 calories” ... that may not be dangerous for the binge eater herself, who had a BMI in the low 30s, but I explained to them I would literally kill myself trying to burn 3,500 cal in 24 hours at a BMI of 18.

It can be a comforting place to discuss things with people who get it and won't push recovery, but you're so right about those challenges.
