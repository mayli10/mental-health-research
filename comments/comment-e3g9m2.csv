Absolutely everything that you said resonated with me because I went through the exact same feelings and still do. On the bad days, I still feel reluctant/scared to tell him what exactly is going on because I don't want to make him sad and dump all my negative feelings on him. I think it's totally normal to feel this way and it's good that you care about his feelings as well, and not only dump all the crap on him 24/7 and use him as your personal therapist. But it's definitely accepted and even good (imo) to share negative feelings and issues with your SO. But I personally try to find a balance where I tell him vaguely what's going on like ""yeah it's the eating issues flaring up again"" or ""I've been feeling kind of bad about my body and eating lately"", but don't go into details because I know that he isn't an eating disorder specialist and he won't be able to help me in any way, so if I tell too much he may just end up becoming really concerned - without any way to help me - and that would suck. So I tell him my general state of mind, but spare the juicy details for therapists or other professionals. It has worked well so far because he gets an explanation for my behaviours and moods on certain days, without getting sick with worry.  I'm very happy that he reacted the way he did by the way! He sounds like a supportive boyfriend, and that's good :) I don't have anything more to say but just know that I'm often feeling the same way you do and yeah. Just make sure to communicate your problems and feelings from time to time and let him have some space to tell his emotional worries/problems as well (so that the entire relationship doesn't revolve about you and you and you and you), and I think that everything will be alright ❤️",False,False

I just don’t want him to associate me with sadness. He deserves good things and I want to be happy and kind and idk. His response..idk cuz like he asked a few questions because he didn’t understand some things but he says he’s not mad or w/e just sorry that it’s happening and to please continue to work on it with my therapist. But he’s also a therapist lol so I’m he doesn’t think mental things are bad but I feel bad when my mental things show up cuz I feel like it’s unfair for him, you know? Cuz I’m I didn’t ask for it either but I did it to myself so I can’t blame anyone else really but for him more unfair cuz obv he didn’t ask for it either but now it’s like I’m dumping bad feelings on him and yeah..ok that’s how relationships are supposed to work and you should share things with each other which is why I told him because I don’t ever want to start lying to him but idk..I’m just sad about it all and mixed feelings and that, you know?",False,True

I believe that honesty is the way to go in relationships, and if you want this relationship to be serious, it's important to be honest about your ED, especially if it influences your mood and your behaviour a lot. You did the correct thing, and if he hates you for having a mental illness, then it tells a good deal about him as a person. He might become upset. My boyfriend did when I told him all the truth, and it's expected and understandable, and even good - because it shows that he cares for you.   BUT, and this is important, if he reacts very negatively to it and does not accept that you have a mental illness/makes fun of you/does not take you seriously in any ways, I'd personally try to end the relationship. A supportive boyfriend was what pushed me to become healthier and better and more happy with myself. He is my confidante and I tell him about my problems and on the days that I'm sad Nd have problems with food, he is the one who comforts me and hugs me and kisses me and tells me that everything will be alright. I can't imagine being together with a man who isn't supportive and kind and understandable. Maybe it could work out, but I'm so so so so grateful that I found someone who doesn't judge me and doesn't hate me for being the way I am.  I hope that he reacts in a good way, but if he doesn't, it's up for you to decide in the end. But just know that you're not a bad person if you make him sad or if he starts to hate you - what you have is a mental illness and it's NOT your fault that you have it.",False,False
