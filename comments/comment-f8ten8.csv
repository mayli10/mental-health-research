The manga artists probably don't know the measurements of any real life person, and just look at what measurements pre-existing manga characters have, and add a bunch of inches to then when creating an overweight character. This results in average measurements, because the baseline is so unrealistic.   I hate it when measurements or weights are mentioned in fiction and they're completely unrealistic. I think people should bother to spend the 1 minute it takes to google what measurements a character could really have if they want to say the character's official measurements.",False,False
