I’ve been doing this 5 months so far, and I think the toll it’s taking is getting worse. I know your right...I just can’t bring myself to stop. But I am in therapy and we are going to work on my concerns regarding eating, so that might help.  Thanks for the comment, I appreciate it.",False,True

I attempted suicide after six months of eating 800 calories per day. And I'm still not skinny. I'm overweight and I hate my body... But I refuse to ever go through that again. It was torture. Please consider increasing your calorie intake for the sake of your mental health. You can't diet if you're in the psych ward.,False,False
