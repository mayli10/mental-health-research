It sucks SO hard. I used to exercise purge with a stationary bike - I still canâ€™t bring myself to use one now and that was years ago, itâ€™s just ruined for me. I took up running and fell in love with it - especially because there was a specific plan I was following that kept me from overdoing it! Unfortunately I have injuries that will keep me from running for the rest of my life. And now whatever I move on to itâ€™s the same shit, I get obsessive.   Is there anyone you feel safe having as a gym buddy? Someone with similar running goals but who isnâ€™t crazy obsessive who you can run with and stay sane? Iâ€™m so sorry this happened to you - I hope you can find a way to enjoy things again ðŸ’•",False,False
