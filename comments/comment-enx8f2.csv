If so, I would highly recommend a tincture/RSO oil with high CBD and a small amount of THC. I currently take an RSO oil made from an indica strain that is in total 644mg CBD &amp; 27mg THC and it works good for me. I have found CBD products derived from hemp with trace amounts of THC or none at all to be ineffective.",False,False

Start with a mg and slowly increase if you find it‚Äôs not enough. You can also get it in a spray which is fine but I don‚Äôt like how it hits the back of my throat. I don‚Äôt personally like taking it in foods or candies so I‚Äôm afraid I can‚Äôt really give any advice re: the gummies. My SO prefers to vape it because it works fastest this way.
