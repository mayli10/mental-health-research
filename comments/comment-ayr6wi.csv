He at one point even lost 2kg while still eating like this. It also doesn't help that when he DOESN'T drop in weight, he actually starts looking skinnier from just losing body fat ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­",False,False

My partner isn't disordered, but is a small-framed 5'2"" woman and eats to maintain a healthy weight, so even if I ate the exact same as her I'd be below maintenance.  Even so, she *does* still randomly forget to eat and not think about it, or will eat the occasional huge sushi takeout or something, and just doesn't care.  It's unfathomable.",False,False

When I gamed, I used to forget about eating and I lost so much weight without realizing it that people wouldn't stop commenting on it. Now I think about eating every second of every day.   My boyfriend eats less than me most days, has whole uneaten containers of ice cream that he forgets about for weeks (HOW??), but can finish an entire medium pizza in one sitting because he loves pizza, and he'll still have abs. I've never had abs. Why is life so unfair.",False,False
