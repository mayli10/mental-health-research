I refuse to quit at this point or I've wasted like 5 years. I am prepared to carry on until I have a complete mental breakdown. I'm also just stubborn enough to not let them tell me what to do- it needs to be my choice or it's not going to work.,False,True

You should fight to stay there and refuse higher level of treatment. Yes, your health should be a priority, but studies are also a priority and your life is a priority. Having a stable system with classes, a nearby therapist you can access easily as well as friends is part of reaching a normal life.  If I were you, I would absolutely not let them remove their responsibility. They are therapists and they didn't even try to treat you.",False,False

It just sucks because I am very guarded and I finally felt comfortable sharing this part of my life and they burned me.   It's fortunate that I have my own insurance (which covers mental health), but I'm a graduate assistant and I need to keep my position to keep my insurance.   I'm in a fairly populated area, so it is probably possible to find someone, but I've had a bad experience with another therapist before and I'm scared that will happen again. Even so, getting to the therapist will probably take a bit of travelling since 5 miles takes like 40 minutes here.   I also have other mental health issues (which I think is normal with EDs) and I thought I had made good progress with my current therapist.   I might try going to some free group therapy in the area and attempt recovery on my own if I'm referred out.   It just fucking sucks because I get that its ideal to snip behaviors quickly and more support is better. But realistically- we have lives to live still and interrupting our routine can be detrimental.",False,True

I sought help from the eating disorder services on campus, and they immediately said I needed a higher level of care and didn’t give me a chance to try outpatient. It was my first time ever seeking treatment. They forced me to apply for residential (seriously, not even letting me give PHP or IOP a try?).   I also wasn’t convinced any of it was worth it, I don’t think they were able to determine which level of care I needed given that they didn’t give me a chance, and I didn’t think the higher level of care would be helpful given that I didn’t think it was necessary. The higher level of care would also have caused a bunch of problems in my personal life (I had no money for it, I didn’t want to medically withdraw from school, and my parents didn’t even know about my eating disorder and they still don’t know). Those outside factors (especially the issue with my parents) caused a huge increase in my anxiety and suicidal thoughts. And, as soon as they said residential care was necessary, they stopped making appointments with me, so I was left to deal with the stress and unknowns of the application process all alone.  Then, my health insurance cut off and I 100% could not afford it. I made another appointment with my campus doctor, and she told me and I quote her exactly, “I don’t want to deal with the liability of treating you.” She’s a fucking medical doctor. It’s her job to treat medical conditions. I told my cardiologist my campus PCP said that, and she was outraged and thought it was inappropriate behavior. My campus eating disorder service completely terminated treatment with me and said they refused to treat me until after I went to residential (which they knew I couldn’t afford). I don’t understand how no treatment is better than at least some treatment (even if not ideal from their perspective).   I felt extremely depressed after this because I honestly wanted to give recovery a shot, but this experience was so awful and cut me off from all treatment options. My campus service is one of the only ED services in my state (other than the treatment centers, which I can’t afford), and one of the only affordable ones as well. But, I kept calling up therapists and I finally found an ED specialist that offers sliding scale. I see her twice a week now and she’s not forcing me into the higher level of care. And, she said that if she ends up determining I need it, she’ll be with me throughout the entire process and help get me funding for it.   Basically, don’t give up on treatment. I don’t think university campuses are equipped to handle most eating disorders. Call up other therapists and inquire about sliding scale, if cost is a concern. It worked out for me eventually, and I think it can for you too.",False,False

Why do you need to find a new therapist?   This must be soooo disappointing and totally NOT ideal when you do a Scary Thing and ask for Help.
