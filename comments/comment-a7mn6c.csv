If you can't get a sports drink, adding some salt to your water covers sodium but you'd still need potassium and there aren't any 0 calorie sources that I know of. Start with this and see if it reduces the nausea after 30-60 mins.  If it doesn't, then it might be blood sugar, and the only option is to get some sugar into your body. There's about 16 calories in a teaspoon of sugar so you could have a couple of those. If raw sugar seems too daunting, fruit (peach, grapefruit, strawberries, and watermelon are all absurdly low in calories) or honey (20 cals per teaspoon) are also full of sugars.  It's really hard to take care of ourselves when it requires food, I know, but right now your body is sending you an SOS signal. Sugar and electrolytes are the medicine it needs to keep you alive. I hope you can give your body just a little bit to help it stay healthy and safe.",False,False

I’ve been drinking lots of water (about 4.5-5 litres a day) and not eating much, which I know isn’t good. Is there any way to stop feeling so sick without eating? ",False,True
