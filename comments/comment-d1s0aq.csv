Do you have an HR department? If so, it's time to start recording these comments with dates/times, to establish a pattern of behavior.   Either way, the first step is to go to your boss and speak to him privately. Describe the types of comments that make you uncomfortable, and make clear that your body and diet aren't joking material. If he's a decent and simply misguided boss, he should apologize for crossing the line, and lay off. If he's a dick, he may get defensive or even angry, in which case, if you don't have an HR dept to consult...it's probably time to look for a new job. Because the comments won't stop, AND he may start treating you worse in retaliation.   I'm sorry you've experienced this. I really have no patience for male """"""comedians"""""" of this ilk, who - whether or not they're decent at heart - get away with bullshit like this bc they assume their employees won't dare talk back.",False,False

That’s legit horrible and I don’t understand why people let him speak to them that way!!  The next time he makes a joke like that you should tell him it isn’t funny. Maybe he really just doesn’t get it, in which case ew but that puts it on you to tell him he’s making you super uncomfortable",False,False
