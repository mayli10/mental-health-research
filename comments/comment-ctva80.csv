You know the reason restaurant food tastes good? Fat and salt. Homemade mashed potatoes are never as good as restaurant because no self-respecting stay at home mom would ever think to use a ratio of 1:1 butter:potatoes. I‚Äôve read that in many (if not all) fast food franchises, they deliberately add a shit-ton more sour cream, butter, etc. to their recipes, so their calorie counts listed are off by hundreds probably.   Sometimes I hate going out to eat. (It‚Äôs a fun ‚Äúcheat meal‚Äù though so I mostly like it even if I do always pick the healthiest and most low-cal option)",False,False

Packaged food when weighed is way often a different weight than listed so different calorie count- that's eating from stores.

Friend or Family cooked food can either be tampered with (extra butter, oil, salt) to try to sneak you lipids and calories, they obviously won't directly tell you any of the brands of food they use and wont have weighed them so you have to heavily guestimate what the total count is and end up hating yourself more that what was probably 260 cals of sweet potato fries was 579 of fried sweet potato fries with enough sodium to kill you- that's eating socially.
