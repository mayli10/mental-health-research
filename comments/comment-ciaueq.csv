But if it would cause more problems than its worth, maybe find a way to politely redirect the convo to show them that you don’t want to discuss your weight? I’m usually pretty blunt with people when it comes to this stuff for that reason.   Ugh people are horrid. I hope you can find a way to get out of there or manage it better soon!",False,False

I’m so sorry you have to go through that. Have you tried having a conversation with HR? I don’t know how often or intense/intrusive the comments can get, but harassment isn’t okay! Of course, this depends on whether you think HR would actually help, I know they’ve let me down a few times with other similar matters. :(",False,False
