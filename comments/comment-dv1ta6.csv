I had 2 children, went on to have another. All with a husband who later divorced me as I had “traumatized him” it all started at 14 but before that a childhood Of neglect and abuse. But very relatable... not sexual abuse or any particular event. But I lived in survival mode for 19 years... I had 4 brothers and a sister. I was 3rd out of six... I have gone through way too much all at once. 3 years had felt like 15.",False,True

Fair warning. I’m sure lots of books have the same title but it just reminded me of that.  As for the book, I think what the other commenters have said is helpful. Make sure it’s about more than just wanting to be thin for “vanity” like a lot of things say. And not glamorized — I would like it if a book showed the really dark and dirty parts of having an ED.",False,False

I hate the movies/books about eating disorders that make it seem like the person with the ED “just” wants to be skinny....to get to this level of illness it’s so much more than that. It makes it seem like people with ED’s are conceited/superficial when there’s so much more psychologically behind wanting to be skinny or even wanting to look good when it comes to motivation for an eating disorder.,False,False
