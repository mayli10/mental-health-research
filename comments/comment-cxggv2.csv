Try and find a way of working with it. When it’s stuck in your head you will tend to over think it.   Sometimes you have to get it out of your train of thoughts. Stop and catch the thought before it spirals.,False,False

I mean, peas, out of everything, are a really great choice of food to eat after not eating for a while. They have almost every vitamin and mineral that the body needs. It's actually really impressive - not many foods are like that.  And protein, which helps your hair! They're like tiny little balls of nutrients. Your organs are probably really happy. So you've made a good choice, even if it feels terrible. You've done a good thing!",False,False
