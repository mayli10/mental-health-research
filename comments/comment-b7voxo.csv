I started recovery before I got underweight and I’ve maintained that weight. I eat if I’m really hungry. But I still fit into all my small clothes and I don’t really want that to change. I stopped seeing my nutritionist. I’m definitely happier than I was when I was at my worst, that’s for sure. I never thought recovery would solve all my problems though, so maybe my expectations are different than yours. I just wanted to be able to stopping obsessing about food and pushing how long I could go without eating, which I have. I still don’t eat as healthy as I could. I’m probably still in danger of relapsing if something really bad happened. But 100% I don’t regret recovery. Life is so much better. ",False,False
