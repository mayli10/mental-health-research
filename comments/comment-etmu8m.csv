No doubt she legitimately did, but isn’t it a coincidence that she stayed thin while it was stylish then recovered once being ‘thic’ became a thing? I think this is great for her publicity and that she will profit off of her decision to speak up. While she was sick, she was probably one of the most idolized women in the western world. She was glamorous, beautiful, successful. This is NOT the case for most of us suffering from an eating disorder. For her to say she ‘exercised but didn’t eat’ is an extremely broad generalization catering to the stereotypes of anorexia; it would have not been physically possible for her to go on if that were 100% the case. I feel like now more people are going to view us ED sufferers as those who are trying to be thin and glamorous, like the our new spokesperson Taylor Swift. She never brought up controversial issues like how she would effectively hide food while attending social events (I’m sure she had many), debilitating self-hatred, purging, body dysmorphia, obsessive control, fainting (although she did state a lack of energy performing) basically what she said was just that she didn’t eat in order to cater her image to the public eye (eg they called me pregnant at 18 cause the way my stomach looked, I was commended for fitting into sample sizes).  The thing is, it worked. She did not become famous at her current size. The way she has come out about her disordered habits caters to what viewers want to hear, it doesn’t challenge any preexisting stereotypes about eating disorders and perpetuates the stigma. I’d go as far to say that it might even inspire some to divulge into disordered habits, as coming clean about being sick and not ‘naturally skinny’ will make people think it is not possible to stay slim in a healthier manner. I find it hard to honestly believe she did not have a dietician, personal trainer and doctor monitoring her health so she could pursue her career at a very small size.",False,False

She was sick. I’m glad she’s opening up but it really wasn’t a surprise to me.,False,False
