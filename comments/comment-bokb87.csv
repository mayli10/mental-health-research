I too used to be able to starve myself relatively easily and I'm pretty much disgusted with myself at this point because why is it so fucking hard to do anymore and where tf are all these binges coming from. My stomach is growling and all I can think is shut up you fat piece of shit. Went to the store today and bought a bunch of 0 calorie beverages for fasting, gotta buckle down and do this shit cause I feel like a land whale.
