I used to be really guilty and think the calories would ruin my fast but then I looked into it on the zero app and like ? When theyâ€™ve done like studies on fasting they didnâ€™t even do it on like fasting as in not eating/in taking calories at all; they define fasting as intaking less than 25% of the calories normally needed to maintain normal function (aka their tdee) so basically the reasearched benefits of fasting are just benefits of like eating less than ~500ish calories a day.

Iâ€™ve been fasting but last night I ate a few bites of cake and I feel like technically itâ€™s ruined but I know it didnâ€™t have enough impact at all to count as breaking a fast. :\ I usually donâ€™t have a problem with relaxing a little and not counting something like a drink or a few bites as breaking it, but since I downloaded an app itâ€™s way harder for me because I feel like Iâ€™m being dishonest now :(",False,False
