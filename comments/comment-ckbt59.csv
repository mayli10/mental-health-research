It's worked incredibly well, and made it possible to start addressing the uglier bits of stuff. It makes me calmer, more productive, and just plain happier. It seems to kick in much more quickly than it should, too often to be pure placebo.  But I do feel like hot dogshit if I ever can't take it for a day or two.  No weight gain or loss last time I checked. My appetite's been pretty nil lately, but idk if that's a med thing or a me thing.  See if anyone in your family has tried it. Relatives are going to be more likely to have similar effects than strangers, iirc.",False,False

It has definitely decreased my baseline anxiety.  I didn't experience any kind of fatigue, although I have had a very small amount of nausea on it.    I gained weight on it initially, about five lbs, but now the appetite/weight effects seem to have leveled off and aren't impacting me anymore.  I was freaking out about it initially and kept telling my doctor I wanted to change meds over it, but he wisely counseled me to just hold on until I reached therapeutic levels, and he was right.",False,False
