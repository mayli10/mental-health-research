I want to be strong, and powerful, and train the way that I need to train for my body and mind to be well, and it's so hard to feed myself adequately to allow for that.  But it is possible, and you're killing it!  Keep going.",False,False

I especially love no cheat days because you eat what you want each day. I'd suggest following natascha oceana (I probably spelled that v wrong) on YouTube. She used to have an eating disorder but now is very athletic and seems genuinely recovered. She doesnt have rules about food except a loose 80/20 guideline that to fuel training, 80% comes from whole foods, 20% from whatever she wants. She doesnt count cals.  However lately she's been posting a lot about increasing metabolism and losing fat while gaining muscle so if you think that may be triggering stay away.  Anyways good luck. This is very helpful for me in case I decide to recover after all. Thank you a ton &lt;3",False,False
