You make a handle and can post ur thoughts, blurbs, pics, etc and ur friends can like and comment. If you search “peach” on EDA there is this who master list of everyone on there and you can get added and find others handles. That’s how I started adding people last night but I’m looking for more! Idk if I’m explaining that last part right but if you just search peach on this sub it will come up and it will explain way better than I did.  But add me if you make one! I need friends 🙃(scaredyk4t)",False,True
