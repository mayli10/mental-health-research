I can see my tooth wearing away. ALSO, after I purge that tooth hurts, bad. 2.	‚Å†my heart is fucked - I now have heart palpitations and chest pain, I‚Äôm on medication for my heart now. I don‚Äôt feel like I have to even elaborate on that, that should be scary enough. 3.	‚Å†my gag reflex is so fucked that I can‚Äôt brush my teeth without throwing up. literally, I cannot brush my tongue because I will throw up, then I have to go the rest of the day with puke breath because you can‚Äôt brush your teeth after throwing up, because you‚Äôll just ruin your enamel even more than you did from throwing up! 4.	‚Å†my throat is always in pain - always. as you could imagine, shoving your fingers down your throat is not the most comfortable thing to do, and it does quite a bit of damage to your throat. you are so welcome, I‚Äôve thought of couple other reasons why you shouldn‚Äôt do it 5.  it‚Äôs addicting - on my BEST purging days, I I throw up a minimum of nine times, after ONE meal (because you can‚Äôt just throw up once and everything is out). on my worst days I purge upwards of 30 times (9 times a meal times three meals) 6.  I‚Äôve wasted SO MUCH money - that one is pretty self explanatory. 7. I‚Äôm always dizzy - purging throws off your electrolytes pretty badly, which causes you to get really dizzy all the time",False,False

But it never burns to purge something that's been sitting in the stomach for +30 mins after daily purging has been happening for a while. And if you purposefully want to keep something down in a b/p cycle and only purge +6 hours after eating it, the majority of the food you wanted to keep down is still there. ",False,False

It severely reduces stomach acidity, which in turn delays digestion when you eat again and leads to bloating, feelings of fullness, and other such uncomfortable sensations that make us inclined to do it again.  3.5) You'll be hungry when you're done and probably end up binging and thus purging again.   4) You deserve every single bite of food you have eaten. You are worthy and beautiful and valuable. Every living thing is entitled to health. Seize that right, even if only temporary. Give our body a break. ",False,False
