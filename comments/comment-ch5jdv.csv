No. Do I feel like a terrible person for it? Absolutely.  But maybe if my best friend when I was growing up didn’t complain about her “disgusting, fat” (completely flat) stomach growing up, I wouldn’t be this way. Or maybe if my mom hadn’t tutted and shook her head and said “I don’t understand how people let themselves get that way” at really big people.   Or maybe if anybody treated me the way I did when I lost weight while I was still fat I could have been healthy about it but instead I was pretty ostracised in school because I was overweight so I snapped and starved myself skinny, and everybody loved it when I dropped 70lbs in eight months and just encouraged it.",False,False

So many people have internalized hatred for fat/overweight people that it's ridiculous. When my ed first came around I was obese. It wasn't until I had reached a 'normal' weight range that I had begun to realize that my diet was out of my control and that I couldn't control my obsession with thinness. I approached my psychiatrist with my concerns about having (at the time) ednos and he laughed and just told me to keep up the hard work. Two months of starvation later and I had developed neuropathy in my arms and legs so badly I couldn't function and my window of willingness to recover had closed. It's been 7 years of disordered eating now.,False,False
