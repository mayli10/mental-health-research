Also isn't the ocean like, hella cold compared to my suburban shower? Not picking at you, just curious how much of that effect can be replicated by us.",False,False

And if youâ€™re chronically cold it can be extremely dangerous because your body may seriously struggle to get itself back to homeostatic conditions - potentially causing tissue death or other irreversible damage.",False,False

So, yes, it does burn calories, but itâ€™s not worth it. Itâ€™s not worth risking getting hypothermia. But then again, thatâ€™s why deep sea divers burn 400-700 calories an hour â€” itâ€™s cold.  Just my take on it, though.",False,True

That does not make cold showers worth it, though. I spent two years taking cold showers and sleeping under an absurd number of blankets in an attempt to overheat myself (bc for a while, there was a trope in ED communities that heat also speeds up metabolism...again, maybe it's true, but it isn't fucking worth it!).
