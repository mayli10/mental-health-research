Underweight LOOKS like normal weight to people because of what we are used to seeing on women. So messed up,False,False

Now I’m average weight and b/p often and still no one cares. My friend walked in on me shoving my fingers down my throat and just walked away.  Point is- it’s not that you aren’t skinny “enough”. It’s just that people don’t know what the fuck to say lol,False,False

Now, when I tell people about it, I think half of them think I’m exaggerating or even lying!!! It’s a struggle for sure, but hang in there.

If you wanna talk about it with someone you can PM me, as your friends are being unsupportive.  My friends don’t take it seriously either. So I break out because of dairy and sugar, so my skins gotten really bad recently due to my recovery efforts (I decided it’d be best to not restrict myself from any foods, seems like that didn’t help me recover anyway since I’ve relapsed). One of my friends brought it up and then I just basically got attacked with several different viewpoints. One of my friends was like, “well why don’t you just stop eating sugar and dairy again like you were doing before and then your skin will clear up again”, despite me telling her several times before that I was trying to recover and not restrict myself from anything. Clearly it goes through one ear and out the other.  Another was like “your skin can’t possibly be connected to your diet because mine isn’t” and it’s really fucking annoying because she always fucking bases everything on whether it worked for her or not. If it didn’t work for her, can’t possibly work for me! That’s unrelated to my ED but annoyed me too. I think I would know if it affects my skin after I’ve gone sugar and dairy free 10s of times as a form of restriction and my skin unexpectedly cleared up.  Another was like “is it seriously so difficult to recover and also eat dairy and sugar?”, literally word for word. That felt very demeaning considering   This particularly upset me because I thought that my friends listened to me and understood my struggles with my ED but this made it blatantly obvious they never fucking listened. I got attacked for my skin and my ED out of nowhere. I never talk about it anyway because they don’t understand and I didn’t want to have a conversation about it and they made me very uncomfortable.",False,True

I’m very underweight according to my BMI and no one cares. They just think I’m naturally skinny just because my mom is skinny too (she also has an ed) my parents don’t care and think I’m healthy,False,False
