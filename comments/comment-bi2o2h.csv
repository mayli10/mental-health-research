These are my absolute, can't live without teas.  Cold 911 by David's Tea, even when I don't have cold. I find the mint and eucalyptus flavours really comforting. They also have a eucalyptus flavoured tea, who's name I can't remember, that's also really nice.   David's Tea Just Peachy. Peaches are gross, but I like this tea for some reason.  David's Tea Midsummer's Night Dream. I can't describe it. It's fresh and kind of minty, kind of citrusey, kind of sweet and sour.   David's Tea Mother's Little Helper. It has valerian root in it, so it can help you sleep.",False,False

There's a Korean supermarket round the corner from me and I bought some Barley tea and some green tea with rose on a whim. Barley tea hits a lot of the same notes as coffee imo but it's caffeine free, so if anyone is looking to cut down on coffee/caffeine but wants the same sort of taste, I'd really recommend it! I think it's especially good cold, with a couple of ice cubes thrown in. The rose green tea is amazing as well (does contain caffeine due to the green tea though), it has a lovely but not too strong rose taste and is a cute pink colour as well :) Flavoured green teas are my jam at the moment!",False,False

For replacing coffee:  - I‚Äôm obsessed with the Starbucks London fog tea latte (earl grey, milk, and vanilla) so I make it at home with earl grey and sugar free vanilla coffee mate (~20 calories instead of the ~200 from Starbucks). It makes me feel super full in the morning, I don‚Äôt know why.  - Matcha is caffeinated like coffee and it‚Äôs great with coconut milk but it‚Äôs not a safe food for me.   For other things; - I love throat coat which tastes like licorice but keeps my vocal cords in top shape (I‚Äôm a teacher and I don‚Äôt like to yell but I do ALL THE TIME lol)  - Plain black tea iced with lemon ‚ù§Ô∏è üçã  - Chamomile is good for helping me calm down. - Traditional medicinals has a tea for water weight but I haven‚Äôt tried it yet! - green tea with honey and fresh lemon slices! Hot or iced it‚Äôs a great pick me up or ‚Äúsnack‚Äù that helps me feel full before or after I eat",False,False
