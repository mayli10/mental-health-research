I can tell you the bfp counts on those are very inaccurate. And for OP, I’ve used online measurement-based BFP calculators also and I’ve gotten results all over the board from the same or similar measurements. I’ve also had a proper body comp scan done so I know my actual bfp - none of the other sources I’ve mentioned have been accurate.",False,False

I just got a fancy new scale that measure body fat percentage, bone weight etc. And according to bf% I’m obese even though my weight is “healthy”. To be honest, I’m not surprised but it’s still hard to have confirmation :/   But in your case I would say that those calculators are WILDLY inaccurate and don’t take it too seriously at all! You were literally just estimating — not sure how it’s possible for it to  give you an approximation that you’re 10 pounds over what you said you are so I really think that you shouldn’t give this whole thing too much merit, just try to write it off as a stupid inaccurate calculator bc unless you actually get measured a doctor it’s literally impossible for them to be accurate. I hope this helped a bit. Please don’t let this derail you, I know it’s hard though bc I’m feeling the same",False,False
