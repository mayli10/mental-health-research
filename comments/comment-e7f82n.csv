It's similar to my frustration with my friends when they want to order pizza for movie night or give me a bag of chocolate for a birthday gift. I'm not actually going to say anything because they're not being rude. But sometimes I wish I could bring it up nicely because it's hard to go through it knowing you need to keep quiet. I wonder how they'd change their ""chit chat"" if they were aware that it was a sensitive topic for some people.   I mainly get pissed that the store doesn't have a self check out. Some stores have purposely not added them because they want the ""personal touch"" but damn it makes me so uncomfortable.

But the former cashier in me seeks consolation and reassurance from the ED in me by knowing that it's really not something they mean anything by when said.  Personally, my bosses made us do the idle chitchat thing where I worked because it's retail, it was a busy place in a large city with a lot of tourists and good customer service was necessary to represent the company in a good light. If it helps you feel any better, most of those cashiers have probably been at that register for 6-8 hours at that point (excluding breaks) and are trying to make flippant conversation to just pass the time. I can tell you for a fact that I never really paid attention to what my customers had- not to the point of judging them, I mean. I genuinely could not care less because I'd be too busy thinking about my own shit, just trying to grind for that paycheck and get the day over with so I could clock out. Retorting something like that to a cashier won't really change anything since it's not the cashiers fault, it's more the fault of the company itself and corporate. Or certain pushy managers.   On the other hand, self-checkout is fire, guys, I'm telling you.",False,False
