I know the weight gain is soul destroying but it's the trade off for actually living and enjoying life. In time as well the weight gain would probably even out and possibly even come back down as your body and metabolism heal from the restriction and start functioning more normally.  Ultimately I think the only way you ever really recover from a restrictive ED is to learn how to put your self worth and sense of achievement in something other than your ability to lose weight - easier said than done though I know.  Stay safe ❤️",False,False
