I like the mini-loaves you guys do particularly, and I do get them thin-sliced. But I find that I don't eat bread often enough to finish it before it goes stale, even a mini loaf, and it seems like BD bread goes stale REALLY fast. Any tips lol?",False,False

I'm so jealous of your low-cal bread options in the states ðŸ˜­ WHY hasn't it caught on here??  I'm sorry for the sucky accident!
