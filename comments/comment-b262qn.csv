I called my mom and told her how I feel about the whole ting. She was very understanding, also when I mentioned the fact that she probably isn't capable of helping my sister alone. It sounds like my sister isn't interested in getting professional help, and my mom thinks it will be best for my sister to accommodate that and not go to a therapist. I disagree, but I agree in the fact that my sister has to be willing to get professional treatment.   For the next couple of weeks I'll try to connect to my sister daily and ask her about her life, starting out with smaller things and just chatting with her. Hopefully, she will open up to me eventually. I think right now it's all about getting her to know that i'm here for her, and that i'm willing to listen and understand without judging her. Next week, i'm going to take some days off and spend some more time alone with her. I realized that she opens up a lot more when my mom isn't around. I've borrowed a car for next weekend and asked her if she want to go to the museum she's been talking about lately. She really loves art, and when I asked her if she want to go she sounded SO excited and happy, so i'm really looking forward to do something with her that she enjoys. Also, i'm going to Virginia to study abroad for five months in november, and I feel so bad about leaving her. So i've decided to invite her to Japan for a couple of weeks this summer. She's been talking a lot of about japanese culture and anime shows, but none of us in the family understand any of it, so I guess it's a good way to get to know a bit more of what's going on in her head. I just got a new job and don't have any student loans, so I think I can manage it, and the money couldn't be spend better.   She doesn't have a father or contact to any of his family, so I think this is just something I have to do for her. People tell me it's not my job to be like a father to her, but I will regret it to the day I die if i don't help her. I'm finally in a place in my life where i've managed to cope with my own problems, so I just *have* to do this for her.   Thanks for listening everyone, and thank you for your advice. It feels good to vent out my feelings about all this.  &amp;#x200B;",False,True

I'm concerned..."" but it might be that I don't want help. Maybe that feels and sounds different if someone does want help.  She's lucky to have you. Being available to her to listen, and not judge, and not force, is a huge deal.",False,False

Many people suffer from it at a normal or high weight and suffer similarly.    For many of us an ED is a coping mechanisms for things on our live that are affecting us, (previous anxiety, depression, abuse, trauma, etc). She is very young and will need a lot of support to cope with her problems. I would say she needs professional help, asap. If she has multiple psychological issues she must work on all of them. Try to talk with her about those, they might be triggering the ED.    I know you life far, but try to make her feel you are present, text her, send her funny things that makes you think about her. I know I appreciated that from my older brother.    Maybe she can open to you, but I don't know how good confrontation is for her at this point, it can back fire in some cases. But addressing issues you have also experience and encourage her to go to a therapist for that might ease the triggers and hopefully she can address the ED signs to the professional.",False,False

Even if it’s just a phase- that phase could last for the next 10-12 years of her life until she’s older and fed up and scared of dying.   I would highly recommend starting to talk to her more frequently. Just chat with her. Maybe that’ll help her open up to you about her deeper feelings.   This is all very concerning so at the very least- keep tabs on her. I know you said you live far away but maybe try to FaceTime her sometimes just to check to see if she’s lost weight in her face.   A pretty universal trait of an ED is self isolation so if she starts to never ever be able to connect with you or your family then it’s most likely time to get some help. She’s honestly at the best age for treatment. Missing college sucks. Missing work and getting fired sucks. When you’re a teen it’s definitely a scary experience to have to leave home to seek treatment but it could honestly save her life.   Also- please don’t wait for her to be emaciated before thinking it’s a medical problem. She’s developing physically and I know for a fact that the “phase” of my ED in middle school and high school messed up important functions of my growing body.  ,False,False

Unfortunately, mental illness is a different experience for everyone so there's no one-size-fits-all solution. If at all possible, I would recommend just trying to spend more time with her.
