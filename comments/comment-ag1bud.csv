Be kind to yourself. You deserve that, especially after a tragic event. Take a walk and witness the beauty that still exists in the world. Make some coffee or tea. Take a long shower. Keep your hands busy if you can. That always helps me hold off a binge. Draw or write or play with a piece of string. You're going to be okay, even if it doesn't feel like it. You're getting tag-teamed by grief and PMS and that's just supremely horrible, but you have got this, dude. Hang tough. ",False,False
