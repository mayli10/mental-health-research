Not sure all the brands but should be easy to find at any supermarket. It‚Äôs like straight potassium. 1/4 tsp is around 600-something. Also check out the keto subreddit, they always talk about ‚Äúketoade/ketoaide‚Äù and there‚Äôs a bunch of recipes for electrolyte-packed low cal/no cal drinks! Just super important if you do go that route, sip at it throughout the day. Too much potassium at once is both a waste cause your bod won‚Äôt absorb it all and also may cause bathroom issues xP (Also awesome info about electrolytes in general on that sub)",False,False
