Exercise always seems to help push the scale in the other direction for me. I am in the same boat right now. A few weeks ago I lost around 6 pounds through restricting and exercise and felt on top of the world. And because of that I started eating like crazy and gained it all back in a matter of 2-3 weeks. I feel like complete and utter shit. But I swore to myself I will get through this little hiccup and get back on track,False,False
