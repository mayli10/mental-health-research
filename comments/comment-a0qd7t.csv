Sugarfree/low fat chocolate jello is quite good too. Made with unsweetened nut milk it's super low.   Additionally, you can make ok hot chocolate with unsweetened coco powder and splenda. For it to be decent, you need to have at least a tablespoon of coco powder (10 calories for the lower cal brands) and 2 of splenda (also 10). ",False,False

Chocolate mix (80) + skim milk (40) + sugar free sweetener = a chocolatey drink I can sip for an hour.  Hope this helps ðŸ’–,False,False
