I especially notice it occurring whenever I eat out no matter how healthy or unhealthy the food is. I'm not sure why this is, maybe it's the way they prepare the food or there is some type of oil or ingredient that my stomach has become more sensitive to since I generally am used to certain portion sizes/types of food. Sometimes I find a heating pad on my stomach to ease discomfort a bit if I am having sharp abdominal pain. Usually when I have that throw up sensation I just try not to move around much and wait it out until I feel better. Sorry to hear what you were experiencing, I hope this lessens for you in the future.",False,False
