I work in a Mexican restaurant where all the food is loaded with oil and people are constantly commenting on what I do or don’t eat. I get hungry working long shifts on my feet but I’m always anxious to order food because I don’t know how many calories are in it. I know it isn’t easy! sending you good vibes❤️,False,False
