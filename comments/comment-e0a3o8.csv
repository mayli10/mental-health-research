I just was watchful of my intake in the first couple of months until my body adapted to it, and I didn’t gain anything.  It can’t just add weight out of the air, it just makes it initially easier to eat mindlessly, which I believe is the case for most ssri that can cause weight gain.",False,False

Interesting cuz abilify, lamictal, and lexapro are from three different categories. FWIW, I didn’t experience weight gain on any of them, and I thought lamictal in particular was known as weight-neutral.    Going down the rabbit hole of googling med side effects can be iffy, but sometimes you can find actual statistics on what % of people gained/lost/maintained weight. It could be that enough people had weight changes that if had to be reported as a side effect but it was only like 6% of people, or gaining only a very small amount or something. I so hope one of the meds works well for you! Living with suicidal depression is really hard.",False,False

I've been on Wellbutrin XL, Abilify, and Lexapro btw. No weight gain/loss on any but I had trouble with the Abilify at a moderate dose because it actually made my OCD worse, but I've only found really sparse anecdotal evidence that that is even possible, so who knows.",False,False
