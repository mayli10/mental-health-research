If you eat a lot of sodium your body holds onto the water you drink and stores it instead of letting your body pee it out. It can take days for your body to ‘release’ this water. Since water is heavy it looks like we’ve gained weight which can be really scary and frustrating.   Just always stay really hydrated! If you’ve had a lot of salt drinking lots of water can help your body release the water faster, but it can be dangerous to drink too much water in one sitting. ",False,False

Basically when you eat more carbs, your body has increased glycogen stores, which increases your energy stores. Storing more glycogen  simply requires more water.  The seemingly “extra” water in your body is really just the fact that your body is retaining more of it than you may normally be used to.  Even if you’re not drinking extra water or liquids, your body is already full of water- so eating can cause you to retain (hold on to) more of that water than if you were, say, fasting.
