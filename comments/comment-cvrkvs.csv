You need some fat to help in the control of insulin and other hormones related to your menstrual cycle if biologically female and other body mechanisms.  Without enough fat those hormones go as haywire as with too much. Of course with illness there are issues but even with perfect health you will face struggles at even an 18 BMI not faced by those with a 20 BMI.",False,False

Being at a 25 BMI is technically  not ""healthy"" but you'd be hard pressed to find any real health effects. 30+ BMI and the bad health effects start to pile on from heart disease, loss of optimal organ function, hormone balance(as fat does control it's own set of hormones), and a multitude of others. The same goes for underweight BMI but at a much faster rate. While it takes about 5 points above a healthy BMI to introduce health issues you can find these very same health issues for overweight in underweight BMI but at a loss of 2 or 3 points. While being at exactly 18 BMI may not be bad for ur health it's a lot more effort to make sure your body is getting all the nutrients it needs because there's so much less wiggle room in your diet to make up for it and with so little excess anything being stored, the body starts to eat itself much faster. A down tick in calcium uptake in someone who consistently eats enough to maintain their 20 BMI will likely not have effects but for the BMI of 18 it would likely result in the body stripping the needed minerals from bones leading to osteoporosis. So while technically  no it would  not be harmful if you maintained a PERFECT diet, the likelyhood of nutrient deficiencies is high and so are the consequences.",False,False

I couldn't eat for a week, because the pain was so bad. I was just a little underweight, like around 18-18,5 BMI and my wounds didn't heal properly. It took twice as long and it was awful... just because I didn't consume enough calories for my body to function properly.",False,False

Also ask yourself if you lose more will that be enough? Will you work hard to maintain your weight or will you be compelled to continue to lose?   Granted, orthorexia isn't a great option but when you eat very little you have to work very hard to get enough protein, fats, carbs, fiber, and vitamins to support yourself so your internal organs can function. You especially you dont want to stress out your heart.   When you dont eat enough and have no/minimal fat reserves (and I'm talking about healthy/normal fat reserves, not being overweight) your body will start breaking down protein for energy which includes your heart and other internal organs. This is where it gets dangerous for your life.   Now imagine you have I adequate fat reserves and you body is breaking down your organs for energy. Then you get the normal flu. For a healthy person this is no big deal. In an unhealthy situation the flu could turn into pneumonia and kill you.",False,False

A common example is cancer - patients tend to lose weight and if you're already small it could get worse. You need the basic amount of fat for your body to function and fight disease.",False,False
