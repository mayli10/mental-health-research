It's really normal to have ups and downs and I think they'd appreciate that you trust them enough to say you are having a rough time.  Agree with the above poster, it might be helpful to show them this post. Otherwise, what I do is keep a note on my phone with the most relevant things I need to talk about this week.",False,False

Youâ€™re in therapy because youâ€™re struggling. Your therapist isnâ€™t going to be disappointed in you, theyâ€™re there because you need help and thatâ€™s what theyâ€™re going to do. If you were fine and okay there would be no need to see them so thereâ€™s no reason for you to pretend to be okay when youâ€™re not.",False,False
