I work at a restaurant, and we don't do our own laundry. What we do is, we put all napkins, as well as towels we the cooks use, into a laundry basket, and ship it back to the company we got them from where they launder them en-masse and ship them back to other restaurants cleaned. No one saw it, and no one touched it. You're safe.",False,False
