I recommend listening to an interesting podcast when walking because it feels like you are learning something new. I like podcasts on history - anything Kennedy related or politics (Slow burn on Monica Lewinsky was amazing).   You could listen to some light fun gossipy podcasts so it’s like you are walking with a friend or true crime keeps me walking because I want to solve the crime. I don’t think I would walk as much without podcasts and tea / hot cocoa. I’m in canada (Vancouver) so it’s cold but thankfully it’s not snowing! ,False,False

Running is so good for my mood but my anorexia doesn't want me to run because then I'll have to eat more not to mention I'm so tired and exhausted right now AND it's cold as fuck now and I'm not in the mood to turn running into punishment. So I just do a basic morning strength routine and I try to get to the climbing gym once a week. I'm gonna try getting a walk in on my lunch break at work but work is so busy sometimes I can't do that. Or I'm too exhausted. Either the depression or the Anorexia is going to make me convert to fat lol ,False,False

Then, well, this part changes from time to time, but today I did 3 minutes of dead bug, 3 minutes of push ups, 3 minutes of downward dog except I'd bring my leg to reach my arm, and alternate legs.  Then 30 mountain climbers, 30 reverse crunches, and 30 dead bugs (it's an ab workout, which isn't as disgusting as it sounds).  I do those same 3 videos every time, but the final video, I have 3 ~10 minute choices, an easier all around workout, a harder all around workout, or an ab workout.  I chose abs today because I was especially disgusted at my stomach.  I ran in place for 45 seconds, did 20 seconds of Russian twists with a 4 pound medicine ball, did 10 standing diagonal crunches, 10 seconds of plank (it's usually 3-4 minutes earlier on), 20 planks where I'd bring a knee to an elbow, then get back into plank position, 10 sit ups, 10 attempts at trying to use my abs to sit up from lying down, and 30 seconds of boat pose.
