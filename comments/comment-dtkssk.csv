I mean the cracker would become a protien heavy chunk of meat, and the grape juice would be waaayyy less sugary, but idk about the calories in blood.  I personally don't follow those beliefs, so my view is that since it doesnt transform, the calories dont change, but ed s are very mental, so that doesnt matter. As long as we think the calories are there, they might as well be there, ya know?",False,True

That is disordered talk, there. I've the same paranoia about calorie math and wish it didn't end in binges most times.",False,False

Either way, I hear you, and wish you peace.  *For anyone who hasn't heard of this, it's the (belief in) the transformation of the bread and wine into the actual body and blood of Christ.",False,False

I had a moment of ""how much will this wafer and tablespoon of juice be in calories"" just last weekend.  I try to mentally separate that from the rest of my behaviors. Like those calories if any dont count.",False,False
