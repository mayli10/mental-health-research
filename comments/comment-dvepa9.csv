Pros and cons of acting on the urge. Pros and cons of using healthy tools. Usually the pros of my acting on the urge are all very short-term. That doesn’t really diminish the urge much but it gives me the impetus to at least try something else instead.    I keep a list of like 30 distraction and self-soothing activities that I like and pick a few off that. The internet has infinite suggestions too. (For me it usually takes several small activities in succession to get through the urge. Which angered me at first. But now I’m used to it. As long as it helps in the end I’m on board.),False,False
