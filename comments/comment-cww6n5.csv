I feel so accomplished when I eat under a certain amount. You‚Äôre battling against that eating disorder voice in your head.  Also, it would be very hard for you to gain five pounds in a week! It‚Äôs probably fluid retention and food weight. I ‚Äúgained‚Äù three pounds in one day this week and it‚Äôs probably because I ate a bunch of salty stuff and drank a lot of caffeine. The best thing to do is paradoxically enough, drink more water to make sure your body doesn‚Äôt hang onto water when you‚Äôre dehydrated.",False,False

I'm in early recovery and although I'm still not eating a lot, it's already much more than when I was restricting the most and it feels strange. My hunger cues are back so its hard to ignore them now and I need to eat. But sometimes I feel uncomfortable after because my stomach is not accustomed to being full so it feels kind of wrong. And although I've been doing really well this week and eating much better, I feel like I need to restrict over the weekend just so I don't put on too much weight. My mood feels better and I have more energy since eating more but I still feel the urge to restrict. I guess it's a normal part of recovery. But just so you know, you're not alone. I have a group chat on here with a bunch of really nice, supportive people who are dealing with the same things. If you feel like you need people to talk to, just let me know and I can add you to the group. You can rant as much as you like and get things off your chest and you will be listened to, supported and understood. Let me know üíô",False,False
