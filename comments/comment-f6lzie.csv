Your weight can fluctuate daily 2lbs easily and 5lbs wouldn't be unheard of with water retention or your bowel retention.  No one should weigh themselves more than once weekly and take that in stride. Really try and disassociate from it. Make it a major goal to work towards. You already know how much your mood is attached to these numbers. Try keeping a mood journal with sleep patterns, stressors, things your grateful for and goals. Trying to deliberately see yourself as a person apart from a number will really help your mental state. Also stress relating to your weight may actually make losing weight harder so taking a break from being so attached to the scale as a measurement of success may inadvertently help you lose weight and hopefully let you come to a deeper realization over time a particular weight aspiration is not the abject meaning of your happiness",False,False
