Pour 1/4 cup dry cereal on a napkin. Fold half of the napkin over the cereal &amp; use a cup or rolling pin to crush  2.) Combine cereal, oats, and milk in a bowl and mix enough to integrate 3.) Let sit for a bit so all of the milk can be absorbed 4.) Use your hands to form it into a ball/patty 5.) Microwave for 30 seconds (maybe you can skip this step, idk haven't tried) 6.) Make it like a pancake over the stove 7.) Huzzah  One of these is approximately 94 calories (less if you don't use whole milk like i did, also depends on what cereal you use)  If you wanna make more than one the conversions are really easy:  (Makes 4) * 1 cup of your favorite cereal * 1/2 cup milk * 1/2 cup old-fashioned oats  Initially i was gonna try and make these with berries but was too lazy to defrost the ones I had in my freezer (plus I didn't want to waste my time if it didn't turn out) and used oats instead. I might try berries next tho. Idk, you can probably use any type of milk/cereal and trade the oats for something else, whatever's accessible for you at the moment, so there's a lot you can do and I'm excited to experiment more tomorrow with breakfast.
