I started to lift weights and I'm not sure about my tdee. How did you find out? Online calculators say it's about 2200 maintenance calories for me but I'm very suspicious. It sounds too good to be true.,False,False

I work 9 hours a day on my feet and if I donâ€™t eat at LEAST 900 calories I canâ€™t function. I eat between 900-1400 on days I work.

I know they can be really intimidating sometimes but itâ€™s really good for trying to not snack or binge, super filling ( like one filled me for my 8hr shift, on my feet) and at 180 cals? Ok. Then protein shakes. Good for in the morning as a breakfast. I have a Carmel one that goes at 160. You need nutrients. Protein. And make sure you drink water because itâ€™s underestimated how much of a difference it makes. Try spreading out your calories more. Not eating at all through the day and then getting home to eat increases my chances of binging on some stupid shit. I have my shake, a protein bar, a coffee when I get to work, a snack, and when I get home a small dinner. And I still stay under 650 a day. And although Iâ€™m always tired, cause, well yk, Iâ€™m noticeably less tired than I was when I was b/r.",False,False

I high restricted and binged a lot for the finals I just finished. I got really sick towards the end though.  Good luck! You'll do well, and know that it's hard but be proud that you're taking care of yourself the best you can so you can get through exams.",False,True
