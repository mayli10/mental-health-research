Broth or a light soup would be easier on you.    During a fast, your body is eating...*your body*.  And what is your body made of?  Fat and protein.  If you break your fast with more fat and protein, your body doesn't have to whipsaw back to carbohydrate metabolism, doesn't flood you with phosphate and insulin, and doesn't result in waves of nausea.",False,False

Sip a cup of nice warm broth slowly and it will perk you right up. Then start adding foods that are gentle on your stomach, not too cold, not spicy.   I practice intermittent fasting (for the health benefits, but also because, you know ... ) and this works best for my cranky stomach.",False,False

I never had any trouble, I guess it depends on your stomach, I broke a 96h fast with a veggie wrap and some fries and I felt great lol It's kind of personal, start easy and work your way up to more complex foods",False,False
