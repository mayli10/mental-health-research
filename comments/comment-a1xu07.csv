She’s a recovered anorexic but doesn’t talk about the illness. Instead she focuses on self love and self care and healthy eating! It’s a super relaxing channel to watch. Lots of recipes, yoga, and natural things to make yourself feel nice! She’s also vegan but you don’t need to be a vegan to watch the channel! There’s other stuff too :) she is a bit thin so that can be triggering I guess for some people but not for me. She’s very glowy though and obviously takes care of herself and eats so it gives me hope that I can be thin AND healthy! ",False,False

She’s mixed race (japanese and  venezualan i think) and i love how she just speaks so honestly about everything.
