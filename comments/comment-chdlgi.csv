Thanks for the tip! And thank you for your kind words. Taking a bite of something only to be immediately disappointed is super relatable right now. :c",False,True

Lost the love of my life to brain cancer just over a year ago and I still remember the days when a half a cup of Easy Mac was a victory.   Or thinking a food sounded really good until you put it in your mouth and you feel like, ""Ugh this has gone rotten or something.""  There are grief boards here on Reddit that are super helpful.    All the love in the world, lovely.",False,False

I didn't find out until after he died that apparently he just turned back into the person he was before I was born. :( It sucked to find out that the man I grew up having so much fun with was horribly abusive to my mom and her mom for most of their lives.",False,True

It is so difficult to lose a parent no matter how your relationship was. My dad died 3 years ago. And even though he was an utter ass 98% of the time my whole life, losing him to dementia and Parkinson’s long before losing him to death was hard to watch. No one warns you about losing a parent. No one prepares you. It’s something I wish people talked about more instead of hiding away as a secret. Not that I talk about any of my feelings except annoyance. That sounds like I’m making a joke, but it’s true. I don’t have any advice, but know that I truly mean it when I say, feel free to DM me if you need an ear to listen.",False,False

When my boyfriend died suddenly a year ago I stopped eating. I lost 10 pounds. A few months passed and I started binge eating as a coping mechanism and gained 15 pounds since then.
