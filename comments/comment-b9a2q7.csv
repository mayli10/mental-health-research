(Over-exerciser here, I've tried for years....doesn't work.)  It does ""shape"" your body though, and can help so you don't get skinny fat when you do get smaller.  I find walking is best and lifting weights.  If you want to lose weight and ""get smaller"", it's diet.  ",False,False

I wasn't swimming / in a bikini for years but last summer I started to go swimming in an indoor pool (less people), twice a week, around 1-2km each time. At first it's exhausting, but after 3 or 4 times it's way easier.   And Yoga helps too..    ",False,False

You'll have a much harder time gaining muscle than you think, but it raises your BMR, keeps your heart healthy, and you'll look fit, not big.",False,False
