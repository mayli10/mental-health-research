For me, what worked was:  1) getting out of a bad relationship (reducing major, major stress)  2) getting a cat (helps me relax)   3) and a lot of will power for the first 3 or so months while i broke the habit aspect of it. also tried to make new habits not just NOT doing the thing.  That worked for quite a while  I still b/p occasionally. It's not a compulsion, it just WORKS for reducing stress. I have complex PTSD, chronic illness, not much social support, etc, and my baseline anxiety and tension are pretty high. I return to it at particularly stressful times because it works better than other ""stress reducing"" things I can do on my own. If I could get cuddles on demand... I think that would cure it. But, ya know, that's not real life.   If you haven't tried DBT, I think this is the best modality for dealing with eating disorders because it teaches a lot of emotion regulation and distress tolerance skills.   Anyway, if this doesn't resonate for you, maybe the take away is: why do you do it? What does it do for you? You keep doing it because it works in some way. If you know what that is, you can work on addressing that need in other ways.",False,False
