Your parents‚Äô attitude would make anyone feel awful. I feel cute and happy, but I chose this for myself. I wasn‚Äôt a candidate for Invisalign either, so I have full on metal and colorful ligatures, too. The lingual braces someone else mentioned are a really good idea ‚Äì if your parents are pressuring you, maybe they‚Äôll pony up for those, or for the ceramic kind that are harder to see against your teeth.   No lie, having braces has sometimes messed with my head around eating. I lost a fair bit of weight and halved my dose of adhd medication this month to plump up a little again.

Someone else mentioned that you can get braces that go on the back of your teeth rather than the front though, so hopefully I can do that.  And an update on my appointment: the dentist said I need to go somewhere else (a specialist or smthg, idk I‚Äôm a lil drugged out rn) to get braces, but I‚Äôm going back in a few weeks to get fitted for a mouth guard so I stop clenching my teeth in my sleep.
