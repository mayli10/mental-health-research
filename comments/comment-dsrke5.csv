I also obsessively squeeze different spots so much that I have constant light bruises in those areas (like the bottom of my rib cage I love to push my fingers under it like beneath the ribs themselves....hip bone indents, etc.). The worst is the body checks that involve other people. I just can‚Äôt help myself. I‚Äôll look at an object, like a chair or something, and see how much wider that person is than the item then compare my own self to that item. I get so self conscious and paranoid that I‚Äôm staring at people. I just can‚Äôt help it. It‚Äôs like a weird, sick interest of mine. The worst was when a random cashier at the drug store by my house (which I frequent for Red Bull and bottled water) asked me if I was PREGNANT because of the way I always hold my stomach. Lol nope just killing myself slowly because of an completely warped self image and relationship with food!",False,False
