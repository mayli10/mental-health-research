I would just do your best to ignore her comments and keep at it as shes obviously not helping.  I definitely felt myself slipping back to my old ways and even argued with myself about actually feeling good for once and not stressing about food or weight, Yet I still went back. I journal daily and the thing that helped me stick to recovery the longest is the reminder that I wasn't actually happy when I engaged in behaviors. That I was only nostalgic to go back because I didn't actually remember the shitty times. Now that I'm back in it I'm nostalgic for the recovery times. It was nice talking lunch at work and just enjoy food and just relaxing for once. I didn't have to try and figure out macros or calories I just ate because it's what my body needed to keep me sane and productive.  I would try again as restriction will only bring suffering even though it may seem like the more familiar / safe path. If you can fully recover you can be done with all of this BS and just live.  In recovery your going to gain weight and that's what your body needs to fix the damage you've done. It would be good for your mental wellbeing if you didn't weigh yourself. You don't need to know the number as it doesn't matter anyways. If your not restricting you have nothing to worry about, your body will bring your weight to it's optional point when it feels it's not going to be starved anymore.  For some people who have a more positive view on recovery, give these channels a try.  kayla rose kotecki https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCGV3pXwwGVoXu0cqZPI16Kw  Tabitha Farrar https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCa7G1P5WQopVMc9qTSP_lgA  Megsy Recovery https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCey1WBhNthBx0vDy-pHe9uw  I specifically like this video of hers for motivation. https://youtu.be/ZAXnC2AgfSs",False,False
