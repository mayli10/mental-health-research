October was a clusterfuck for my mental health and I ended up having to ask for one on a midterm paper, and it GREATLY helped my mental state to have a little more time for that and thus some other stuff. A lot of professors are pretty understanding, even if it's terrifying as hell to try to talk to them about it. I can reply with the contents of the email that I sent if you want to try asking and would like a template.  Also, does this class say anything in the syllabus about having a drop grade for an assignment or anything like that? I know a lot of classes will at least have 1 drop exam.  You can do this. You are not a failure just because your brain is making some stuff difficult. Freshman year is hard, especially when you've got problems like this. Luckily, even if things go a little funky this semester, you have a lot of time left in college to make up for it. Please try to take care of yourself. Sending love and support, PM me if you need anything, okay?",False,False

Just go in and talk about how horrible you've been feeling, and then take the note and use that as a way to get an extension on your work if that's what's stressing you. I let my grades slip in hs and I failed like three classes, but now I'm in a top uni in a program I love! There's nothing wrong with needing a bit more time. You're sick and you need help because it's very hard to do this alone. You will get through this. ",False,False

Cut back on the caffeine and get your sleep schedule in order. Seriously, sleep deprivation is not something to be taken lightly—I've hallucinated a few times due to lack of adequate sleep. It's not as much fun as it sounds.   &amp;#x200B;  You're going to be okay. Hug your mom and tell her you love her. Sending you virtual hugs &lt;3",False,False
