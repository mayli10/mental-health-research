I understand completely.   I went through motions forced by my family to recover but I just absolutely cannot let go yet. I’m not ready.,False,True

I got to a pretty low weight 5-7 years ago and got scared someone was going to stop me so I've been faking recovery ever since. I've mentioned my ED to my husband maybe twice ever?  I've basically been going back and forth between bingeing and restricting most of my 20's to keep suspicions down,False,False

Everyone around me hates what I do to myself to the point of losing respect for me; but I just don’t want to let go. I have such an attachment and comfort with it. I don’t like myself without my disorder. I don’t like that loss of control.   But obviously, they want me healthy. I know they’re right for wanting that and wanting me to actually, fully recover. It’s absolutely logical and reasonable. But I just. Don’t want to.   I mean. Even if I did “recover”, I’m always going to have one foot in my ED. I truly do not think I can ever fully kick this. So it’s like... I can’t make that promise to them. I’m not going to get better because even deep down, I don’t want what comes with “better”. I don’t want to be like everyone else and be content with eating spontaneously and without limit. I don’t want to risk gaining. I don’t want to be “okay” with my body.   I like the satisfaction of my numbers being lower and lower and the triumph of telling my natural urges to fuck off.   But I do also love those I care about, so it does ache, a lot of the time, that I feel this way. Despite all of the above and how much I rely on being anorexic to direct my life; I do hate how much control it ends up having on me. I’d like to at least be able to maintain at some point. I’d like to be someone they can trust and love again. But I can’t have both.   It’s really just a pain in the ass. I thought once I hit adulthood everything would make sense and be so much easier. Well I was fuckin wrong about that. Lmao",False,False

I’m going through the motions of recovery and fueling my eating disorder silently in this kind of quasi-fake recovery. I know people around me are fed up so I need to get it under control enough, but I’m not really ready to let go of it.",False,False
