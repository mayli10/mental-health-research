Unsweetened tea from sbucks is really good. I don’t recommend this because A. It dosn’t get rid of actual weight and is really dangerous if you are already very dehydrated but if you are within 6-7 pounds of your goal and all you care about is the number there are methods of “sweating yourself out” that boxers use to cheat weigh ins where they sweat out any retained drop of water in there body by basically wrapping themselves in 20 towels soaked in hot water or put yourself in a big trash bag full of hot water. Again you can do more research on this and do it at your own risk but it does work if the number is what matters. ,False,False

To lose 20 pounds you need to accumulate a deficit of about 20 × 3500 kcal, that's a deficit of 1750 kcal every day for 40 days. So not only would you have to stop eating altogether, you would have to stay relatively active, too. I don't think anyone could pull this off (and not die).",False,False
