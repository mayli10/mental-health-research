I can't keep a lot of snacky foods around or I'll binge. BUT, I don't use my dishwasher , so I store semi-nonsafe food in there and I'll forget about it until I need it (like protein powders, PB Fit, granola bars, etc.. Or I will hide things behind other things in the bottom of the fridge, like my maple syrup behind a box of opened instant rice in the bottom of the door. ",False,False

Yeah everyone in my city panicked over the snow and went crazy shopping yesterday. I would have gone out and picked up a few things but I failed to check at all so this is what I get haha.   Thankfully I have my top ramen that‚Äôs a second safe food and I have so much on hand but woo-ie I‚Äôll have some salt retention for sure. ,False,False

When I went shopping yesterday (In the afternoon!)there were only a few cartons left, my city went a little crazy stockpiling.    Are there any services where you live that would deliver a carton of eggs? It can be a little spendy, but that‚Äôs my current plan if I run out of something I obsess over....",False,True

My place is tiny, so not that I can think of :/.... Binging isn‚Äôt a huge issue for me so I‚Äôm not overly concerned, and moooooooost of what I‚Äôm stocked up on is pretty low calorie. There‚Äôs also a decently high chance that this storm was blown way out of proportion and the city-wide panic was all for nothing üíÅ.     Won‚Äôt lie though, I feel almost guilty about having so much food on my house? Along with disordered eating I have a lot of financial anxiety (like... to a crippling extent), and even though I know they‚Äôre not the same I have a tendency to equate buying food with consuming it",False,True

Or anything too much over your TDEE?  My dad would get bags of (super unhealthy) junk food and to stop myself from binging I would kinda throw everything up this sheltered roof thing (where it would still be dry, clean and safe) but I'd have to put in a lot of (humiliating) effort to get it back. That kept me in check, kinda. Can you do something like that? ",False,False
