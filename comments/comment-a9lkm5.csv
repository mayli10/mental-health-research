Especially when it comes to buying convenience foods that aren't ""pure."" For example, I love protein bars. The ones I get are often coated in chocolate. I weigh those bad boys because you better believe they vary package by package, and they're really calorie dense so it does make a difference to me if it's off by 3 or 4 grams. But sometimes when they're off by quite a lot, they're not off... proportionally?? If that makes sense? Like, maybe those extra grams are purely extra chocolate coating, or maybe those extra grams are just more filling? And I feel like that changes how much the calorie count goes up/down. And when I weigh my soups from a can, maybe this one has more potatoes whereas this other one just had more broth. I have no way of knowing.  But if I make my own food, I'm in control of how much of each thing I use, and I'm better able to fine tune things. I realize it's really nitpicky but inaccurate numbers bother me and I try to minimize error as much as I can.",False,False

I prefer weighing my food and planning/cooking my meals because the ritual of it is very calming and reassuring, but I can definitely live on pre-packaged stuff if I have to. Years ago when I was in college and my ED flared up I only ate frozen/microwave grocery store meals that had all the nutri info on the back.   EDs manifest differently in everyone because our brains recognise patterns and rituals in different ways. If eating pre-made stuff is what makes you feel safe, and calms down the never ending panic in your brain that is disordered thinking, do you. (I mean, donâ€™t. Donâ€™t have eating disorders, but if you have to have eating disorders, do you ðŸ˜‚) ",False,False
