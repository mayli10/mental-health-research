There are people who do total fasts, either medically supervised or not, for months on end. The jury is out on if there’s a medical benefit to doing that (some studies suggest week long or more fasting is good for your immune system and health more generally), but it shouldn’t cause negative effects as long as you’re not underweight and are monitoring your vitamin levels, electrolytes, and hydration. That said, fasting can quickly lead to very negative behaviours in people with EDs, so be careful.",False,False

I did the same and was like ""I'll stop at xxx weight"" but I couldn't, I felt addicted to the weight loss. Eventually I entered refeed mode and gained the weight back quickly so now I'm at a smaller deficit and much happier + still losing weight.
