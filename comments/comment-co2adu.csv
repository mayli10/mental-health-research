My boyfriend is oblivious to what is happening in that regard, he doesn't know about my past and I'm not ready to tell him yet. The thing is his parents are the sweetest people and I know they mean well, they just don't know how those comments fuck with my head.   I managed to dodge the comments, explaining I run a lot because I'm so stressed so that's why - and I think they bought it. I kept my cool but my insides turned upside down. Now the first round of family meetings is done I can finally calm down a bit. This weekend will be a battle, but struggling only makes you stronger in the end, at least thats my mantra for the time being.   Thanks again for the kind words ‚ù§Ô∏è",False,True

I recently went to my brothers engagement party and his fianc√©e family is huuuuge compared to mine. I was FREAKING OUT on the plane.   If they say anything you can say:  -work related stress -new medication causing lack of appetite but you are trying to switch it up -some stomach issues so you are cutting out certain foods which has been causing weight loss   Have you talked to your bf about it? Maybe you can make a plan with him and come up with something to say together?   It will totally be okay. I was away for a week and ate stuff I never ate and came back maybe 1-2 lbs over but it went away within the next few days. I was so upset but it really turned out fine. And I‚Äôm saying this as someone who freaks out over 5-10 cals.   If you need to talk just pm me!!! I have a lot of time to myself rn so I‚Äôm available!!! You got this!,False,False
