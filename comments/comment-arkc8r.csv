Eating will make the insomnia better. Insomnia and poor sleep also promote weight gain in the long run, anyway. ",False,False

I kept waking up in the night but I didn't wake up exhausted which is a win. Otherwise, I can't sleep until I'm completely exhausted while restricting. If something like that is safe and available to you maybe it could help",False,False

If I fast for to long my dreams get to some really extreme vivid levels. Like waking up in a panicking sweat from a dream of me eating. I'll end up weighing myself cause of it. It feels so real I can see everything, feel everything and taste everything. It's so real that i'm not even sure if i'm even dreaming in the first place till I notice 1 tiny detail out of place. Then I normally spend a while trying to wake up by waking up into another dream??? If that makes any sense. Kinda of off-topic but does anyone know of a way to trigger sleep paraylisis? My normal ways of doing it are not working very well anymore. I know it's weird but I love the rush.",False,False
