Also, that ""impostor syndrome"" is so fucking real when you go to therapy. Try and keep up that momentum. If you're unsure, just tell the therapist what you're telling us here. Also, I think it's very human to feel like you have to ""win"" at therapy by saying what they want to hear or by successfully pretending you're fine. Communicate this if you can. I had trouble when I was in therapy for something not ED related. I had little things I had to do in between sessions, and a few times I just lied that I did. I couldn't face the shame of failing again. (which only fueled the BadFeels™ more). So idk, what I'm saying is try to be as candid as you can.  Any therapist worth their salt will poke through the thin bubble of perceived normalness lol. Good luck ❤️",False,False
