Feeling lonely can be one of the worst things ever. It can also make you feel like you're not worth a lot and that can make you so much more prone to relapse, but remember that you deserve recovery and a healthy and loving relationship with yourself no matter what. Reach out to the people who are still close to you, although I know it's hard when they're far away physically.   I'm sending you all my love &lt;3",False,False

My ED has isolated me so much from others, and at times that I feel like you do now I try to remember that it’s a necessary part of this fucked up disorder. Your ED has to distance you from friends or it can’t survive. You haven’t done anything that makes people distance themselves from you, your ED has been distancing friends so it can continue, whether you realize it or not. So depending on where you are in recovery, you can look at it a few ways...you either decide to be healthier and kinder to your body and make an effort to do ‘normal’ aka food based interactions with friends or you can realize that if you are hiding your intake and hiding your body you have probably pushed people away. Either way the ball is in your court. I know it’s so hard to be the one to initiate but this ED life makes it a necessity. Go get coffee, go on a hike, and try to remember that this thing effects us in ways we can’t see until later. I’d give you a hug if I could!",False,False
