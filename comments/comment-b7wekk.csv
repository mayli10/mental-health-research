When i wrote the post initially I didnt think to use the right language, I guess. I'm still learning about how to use the right terms for these things but I do want to learn! But i wont make that mistake again, and have edited that part out of my post. I did mean that they hadnt started to transition, i just didnt know that was the right way to phrase it so thank you for letting me know that.  It did kind of seem like you were blaming me, though! But its okay, I know its not my fault for having these thoughts, its my mental illness.",False,True

I wouldn't blame somebody for having a mental illness. It certainly isn't nice to call women men though. OP could have just said the person hasn't started to transition yet if that's what they meant.",False,False

Please don’t take this the wrong way because don’t mean to sound accusatory! No one is right or wrong in this situation, but I think the emphasis should be on the extent to which an ED can make us possessive and slightly delusional. I’m sure if we’re posting/commenting on this sub, we can all relate to the irrational fear of being replaced due to our body size or behavior. That’s what we should focus on, imo.",False,False

I didnt mean to be offensive to trans people or my bfs friend by referring to her as a ""biological dude"". I was just trying to express that she is a trans girl, but is biologically male because she has not yet undergone any hormone therapy.   But this is an eating disorder support group. Im not bringing anyone down or bashing anyone but myself. I am expressing the grief that my ED gives me for making me have bad and delusional thoughts, and seeking support for it.   ",False,True

And that's especially true if your boyfriend's friend started her transition before she turned 20. Personally I started at 18 and saw major changes really quickly. At 21 I'm still noticing changes on occasion. In my case my hips are smaller than what's average for a woman of my size, but they're also bigger than what's average for a man of my size. That's entirely possible to happen to cisgender women though. There are plenty of cis women who have smaller hips than I do, even if they weight more and are about the same height. But I also have smaller than average bone structure in other areas such as my chest. You're probably aware that men tend to larger rib cages than women, so the fact that my own is smaller proves that it can be a result of natural variation. Of course, I can't speak on this girl's appearance since I don't know her, but the way you described sounds pretty similar to me, so it's likely that she looks similar and assuming she is I would guess that any variation in her appearance is completely ordinary for somebody who grew up under such conditions and that you're falsely attributing those variations to the fact that she's transgender. Things that I can tell you for certain have nothing to do with being trans are her body fat and musculature. Hormone treatment in trans women changes literally everything besides solid matter (bones, teeth, etc.) to be more like that of cis women. As your body's cells are replaced they're regrown based on the current properties of your body. Fat and muscle are replaced very quickly in your body as they're burned for energy and replaced by the food you eat. If she started taking hormones young she almost definitely would have also experienced bone growth typical of women rather than men. Her low body fat is entirely a result of her health. Her body likely eats up both fat and muscle in order to sustain itself because of this problem which would also lead to rapid muscular degeneration when compounded with the muscle shrinkage that would already occur because of her hormones. I'm not familiar with the causes of all GI problems, but I know that estrogen therapy is listed as a possible cause for some of them and so it's likely that her hormones are making the problems even worse for her. Considering that transgender people are also at an increased risk of developing eating disorders, another potential cause for developing GI problems as well as something known to make symptoms worse, I wouldn't doubt that she also has one she just hasn't told you about. After all, plenty of people with GI can experience all of the symptoms you might expect nausea, abdominal pain, inability to process food, and still be at a healthy weight or even overweight. I know that my mom has IBS which commonly causes weight loss. As long as I remember she has been somebody who hardly eats anything. She's still big enough that her weight is a health concern. Before certain other health complications she also used to play softball, so she was hardly eating and exercising yet was still the same size then that she is now. With all of this in mind I can only imagine that this woman you know is suffering far more than you're aware of and it's absolutely important for your own well-being that you don't romanticize that in any way, even unintentionally. It would also be horrible if you unwittingly allowed her problems to make you treat her different, especially if the reason was just because you didn't know better or don't considered how something you might say or do in the future could effect her. I don't have anything helpful for you since I've never been in your situation and can't relate, but hopefully this information at least helps you understand her a little better so you can be a good friend. Maybe it will be even be a little helpful when you start feeling jealous again at any point in the future.",False,False
