She kept buying sweets even though I asked her not to and stopped only once she realized she was binging on them too. She kept storing food I didn't want in my fridge, and I cried every time I had to throw yet another container full of rotten food. Of course she berated me more than once for having a fridge full of expired food. People fucking suck sometimes.",False,False

I didn't realize the issue was that you thought that an academic ""him"" meant to automatically assume the unknown person was a male.  It's kind of similar to ""mankind"". ""His"", in this case, is gender neutral and does not mean to assume that the person in question is a male; they could be either or.  The silly part is, if it is confirmed that the person is female, the pronoun used must be ""she"". And if the gender is unknown, one can't use ""she"" because it's understood that the person in question HAS to be female.  I can see why people are upset with this in our current social climate though. Unfortunately, it's just the way English evolved.  Anyway, people DID disagree with this, and do try to push for a singular ""they"" pronoun, but it kind of is a grey area right now. So it really depends on the institution whether or not this is correct, as language is subjective and always evolving after all.",False,False

But in upper-level academic writing, it could count as a mark against you, depending on how traditional they are.
