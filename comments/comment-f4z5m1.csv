Thanks for that though, I'm feeling great today, I just got hit with a wave of sad. Hopefully the next wave takes a while since I won't make the mistake of being late to the gym on Sunday in the future.",False,True

Usually I just lay down, vape (I heard nicotine curbs hunger), and browse Reddit when I'm feeling down. RN I'm feeling waaay better, it comes in waves of feeling like crap. Having not eaten today and planning on working out makes me pumped that I could have a net negative calorie gain today, like insanely thrilled.",False,True

I just want you to know that you're not disgusting, you're not a terrible person, and you're not alone. I'm here reading this sub right now because I'm having a bit of a meltdown myself at this moment. I hope you find peace soon.",False,False

Your worth as a person is not measured by your weight, body fat or looks. You are valid no matter what. you are not a bad person.   I wish I could just say that and make things better, wish you could believe in my words, because they are the very truth.  But I know that, like me and the others in this sub, you are not just gonna instantly feel better. Our Ed brain - our sickness, will prevent that.   I know that frustration bites hard sometimes. I cannot begging to stress how tiring this disease is. The desperation builds up.   I will suggest that you try to do some self care for now. Some things I like to do when I’m spiraling is beginning by taking a long shower, doing some treatment in my hair and skin, avoiding social media and looking for some memes. If I can I try to meditate. Watching series and reading books also helps get me back on my feet. These are small things but they can help boost my humor. Is there anything you can do to take care of yourself now? Small steps go a long way.   Is it possible for you to go see a therapist?   I’m sending you love and I hope you feel better soon.",False,False

It sucks.",False,False
