Going gluten free helps too, but with my Ed history, doctors tell me I'm full of shit (which I quite often am, lol) when I tell them that being gluten free and dairy free helps. So I try to avoid gluten, but will eat a little bread each morning.   I've found the Jarrow EPS probiotics (made for IBS, specifically) to help! But after being on them a few years, I've noticed that my symptoms are rather getting worse, or that they are decreasing in efficacy. I went to a GI doctor about it, but she doesn't seem to know anything about POTS, and seems to think that I just need more fiber, and to avoid sorbitol (which I'm getting ready to do....).  it's hard, when medicine doesn't have answers, I'm sorry you are in the same boat!",False,False

I occasionally take laxatives when my stomach gets really backed up but even those take a few days to work and they make my poop look really thin and weird. I also take a lot of bloating and gas relief medicine and try to eat a lot of foods in probiotics. I also try to avoid dairy because I think it triggers me.,False,True

I only recently have had bouts of diarrhea, but I think they are reactionary (from my colon trying so hard to redirect the water, and over-shooting lol).  Stomach problems are super common with POTS - and they are almost always first diagnosed as IBS, or symptoms that fall under the IBS umbrella! Not getting consistent and healthy, reliable blood supply to your stomach does some wonky things when it comes to your digestion.  Have you found anything helpful for our IBS? I just got a sorbitol/breath testing done, and my digestion was basically non existent, according to a 3 hour long test. :( I use probiotics but they don't help much anymore.",False,False

I'd always just assumed it was because I'd distended my stomach the day before, so it ""shrinking"" got mistaken as emptiness/hunger ... but now that I think about it for a second it doesn't make any sense for the brain to send hunger cues based simply on how much food is in the stomach and not on stuff like nutrients/glucose when I already knew you can get fed thru an IV and not feel hungry LOL.
