I even tell myself ""alright lets make this binge WORTH it, go get something that's actually tasty!"" no, still eat trash just to eat.  the best (worst) binge i had \[TW\] &gt;!was when i whipped up a fucking barrel of pancakes at 1am. so damn good. pb and jam with a gallon jug of whole milk omg!&lt;  also, i suck at purging, it worked well in the beginning, but after a while not even the toothbrush can do it, my throat was literally bleeding from toothbrushing, i just gave up. i fail at being ED too :(",False,False

The last 2 weeks have been hell with my cravings, nothing low-cal satisfies them and I can't stick to a good consistent number. I'm technically undereating, but just getting bloated and the scale is going up. I need a binge to deal with these cravings and get a new start. I'm so so bloated and uncomfortable.  I'm thinking Chinese food lol",False,False
