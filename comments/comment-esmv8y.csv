The only thing in life I really can control is my weight.   One thing that keeps me eating when I'm on the verge of relapsing is my workout. I lift six times a week and already can see some changes in my body so this is very motivating and holds my ed in line.  But yeah... The moment life gets harder you go back to your ed for comfort because it's the only thing that gives the illusion of having control.,False,False

And maybe for a bit I do have it. But one day my ed overtakes me and makes me do crazy stuff. You don't even notice.",False,False
