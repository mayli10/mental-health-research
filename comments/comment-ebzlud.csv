I honestly restrict so much during day to day life but when I go to a fancy restaurant i will get my hearts desire and eat as much as i want (like once a month). I come off as a food critic/snob a bit more i think, because my spiel is that “i love food but half the time im critical of it so i eat to live but if its a meal that is worth it then i will indulge”. So people think im just extremely snobby about food. No, i like a lot of foods but sometimes its not worth it so i have indulgent days where i eat very rich high quality good i love. Whoever posted that anton ego thing here about “i love food, if i dont love it, i dont swallow” literally summed me up so well",False,False
