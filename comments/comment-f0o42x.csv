My chest has been hurting tonight for some reason. Iâ€™ve meal planned for next week. I have a dance competition next weekend. Iâ€™m extremely stressed because I wonâ€™t be able to cook my meals. Any suggestions? And a Iâ€™ll be around of a lot of people. ðŸ™ƒðŸ˜¬ TW numbers  Iâ€™m still losing ~1 pound/two days. I just feel like itâ€™s never enough.

Going to a birthday party tomorrow where I definitely will have a lot of stuff but what Iâ€™m looking forward to is hanging out with people and I know some foods that are gonna be there already and I love a good coleslaw and I would like some ice cream to be honest. A fresh burger sounds nice to me and Iâ€™m gonna try and eat what I want without worrying about it. If anyone wants to give me heck for refusing a burger bun they can fight me. Only delicious foods allowed tomorrow and no guilt. If I gain I donâ€™t need to punish myself or cut down too low as a result, my body may need some gain to be healthy again and I need to come to terms with that and work on it  This most likely wonâ€™t be the only food based event this month and I donâ€™t know what it says about me if I need someone to cheerlead me in having a bowl of vegetable soup of all things but this is where Iâ€™m at  Iâ€™ll be ok Iâ€™ll be okay Iâ€™ll make it through and be fine  Everyone here can get through it  I wonâ€™t lie and say Iâ€™m not scared of my body changing , the way my stomach might feel, and calories and food but I love food and thatâ€™s what got me here, itâ€™s because I like to eat and food that I have been this way as well but there had to be an answer that works for things thatâ€™s not unhealthy",False,False

I met a nice lady in the hall and chitchatted for a bit then parted ways. Once I was in the kitchen and done with my plate of waffles, juice and syrup, I ran into the lady again and she goes ""oh, you must be bringing all the food up for your family, huh?"" She didn't mean anything by it because she assumed that the food was going to be shared since it was a lot. I laughed it off but it stung and it still stings.",False,False

Just made it through 31 day of exercise. Every single day I ate a little and worked out a lot. The scary part is how easy it has been. Yes, there are things I miss eating but the comfort of my safe foods outweigh any fleeting satisfaction. It has been too easy and so it doesnâ€™t seem real.   Whenever I miss eating a kind of food that is not safe, I add it to a list. The list grew a lot at first but growth has plateaued since I have always been the kind of person to stick to the same things I like.   Iâ€™m playing around with the idea of eating a meal from that list. But Iâ€™m deathly afraid. Itâ€™s almost like I am being ungrateful for how easy this has been for me. And that the universe will punish me for my ingratitude by taking everything anyway.   So itâ€™s been 31 days but am I ready for this to be the rest of my life?",False,False
