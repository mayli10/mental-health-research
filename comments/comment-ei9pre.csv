If it helps, you can write a note to her, literally everything youâ€™d like to say, how she hurt you, heck even that you miss her. Then, light it on fire and remember she doesnâ€™t deserve it. She doesnâ€™t deserve your time and thoughts. A mantra i tell myself: why would I want to be with someone who doesnâ€™t want to be with me?   You deserve someone who is understanding, compromises, and is not toxic. You deserve someone who loves you unconditionally. Use this year to better yourself for yourself. ðŸ’œ",False,False
