Last shift I swear to god this is what we had at the front - a giant Chick-fil-A nugget platter, 3 boxes of donuts, and a cookie cake. I can go over 1200 in a second. Especially when having a shitty day. It just sucks , especially when all my work friends congregate around the food.",False,True

I am not able to restrict. What helped for me was only eating at work on the days that I worked.  So I would eat (usually) 1200 calories worth of food in my 8 hour shift and not eat anything once I get home.,False,False
