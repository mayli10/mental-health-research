I should maybe calculate my grades) but I've been an A student (with like 3 Bs) for my entire life so this semester is.................. something. Thank you a lot, I hope I can get through the last final. I hope you can get through any you have left, if any.",False,True

I've been panicking and crying because my brain just...won't work anymore. I'm usually an A student but I failed two classes this semester. I just feel broken down and awful.   I hope you can get through those last few finals!!!,False,False

Try to keep that in mind, if possible... Know you’ll have plenty of time to obsess about food and exercise after Saturday, if you need to. That’s what I’ve had to tell myself during my exams. I can always lose weight later, but I can’t re-write these tests. Not that my brain fully accepts that, of course, but try to be as gentle with yourself as you can food/exercise-wise.   And academically—push through. You got this.",False,False

Unfortunately that has also made ED brain say that 15k steps a day is now required, or 10k at the very least. Thanks, brain.  I do appreciate the advice. I'm trying to remember that it's okay to have a little more calories (in a not-chaotic-bingey sort of way) and having someone remind me of that really helps.",False,True

Super fun. I'm praying I just pass at this point.,False,True

I'm so sorry :( I understand how frustrating it can be to want to be motivated so bad, but feeling like you just can't.   And finals made my ED flare up too :( ",False,False

I know you feel like you need to exercise and/or restrict, but you also need brain food. You don't need to binge, or even hit your TDEE, but you need at least something with carbs and proteins to keep you going. If you struggle with bingeing, I'd suggest only buying small portions you can eat all at once. You need to watch your water intake as well, because dehydration can cause brain fog and many other issues like weakness and fatigue.  You might think losing is the most important thing right now, and I've been there. But I promise, if you just give yourself a week at maintenance or at a 500 deficit while you take/prepare for you finals, you won't gain more than water weight. So put off losing for just a week, and then when you don't have to worry about school you can pick it up again. ",False,False

And any sort of motivation has been completely lacking recently, I am so emotionally/mentally/physically exhausted and I fucking hate it. But thank you. Gonna at least try to do the thing.
