You’re right- I certainly didn’t eat THAT many calories. But it wasn’t a great number either.   Either way, I’m gonna be patient and keep hydrated. Can’t do much in the way of eating normally tho- Anorexia and all that. But I’ll do my best! Thank you again!",False,True

Remember that you have to eat an extra 3500 calories over your TDEE to gain one pound so unless you ate like ~20000 calories AND kept it all down, that weight should go away soon enough with staying hydrated and getting back to a ‘normal’ diet. Don’t let your anxiety about this to get the best of you, I know I like to see results fast but sometimes it’s helpful to be patient and keep your mind occupied with other things than the scale. :)",False,False

I haven’t felt empty in days. This bloating is insane despite my empty stomach. Im not sure I can believe more than 1lb of it is hitting the scale tho... ughhh ED brain is evil,False,True

But it’s so hard because I really just want to know what my post-binge damage is and it’s impossible if I’m bloated?? Maybe all of the extra weight is all bloat, maybe I really did gorge 5 extra pounds in 3-ish days. I can’t tell and it’s driving me insane",False,True

Can gain up to like 5 lbs of bloat. As much I love the empty feeling of a post purge and laxative use, the best thing you can do is drink lots of water or teas to continue flushing out your system. For me, I usually have a flat tummy like 2 days after doing this.",False,False

I’d say most typically people bloat 1-5 lbs, lots of factors that affect this. Don’t worry about it",False,False
