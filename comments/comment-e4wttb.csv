They‚Äôre not always ‚Äúskipping a beat‚Äù feeling. They‚Äôre also largely connected to over exhaustion, stress, anxiety, etc. having them while fasting is not at all uncommon. Especially if you exercise while fasting and consuming caffeine on an empty stomach. Heart palpitations are generally not too concerning unless they‚Äôre paired with things like fainting or seizures.   I get them a lot when I start combining fasting and exercise- usually not when I‚Äôm actually exercising. They‚Äôre oddly the worse when I‚Äôm lying down and relaxing. Doubly worse if I‚Äôm drinking caffeine- even something like Diet Pepsi. They‚Äôll literally feel like my entire body is palpitation, like a freaky full-body hiccup with a weird twinge of pain at the end that steals my breath.   Otherwise, obviously I don‚Äôt know shit, but if you‚Äôre super super crazy wanting answers, you can always push to see a cardiologist. If your insurance covers it and you want it enough, you can finangle your way to getting other scans and such. Especially if your gut is telling you something is wrong. Always trust your gut.",False,False

Im not as active as i used to be basically due to having no energy bc i dont eat much. when i do excercise it can sometimes flare up a little but most times it generally fine, which would seem odd for something cardiac to me.   I have a diagnosed anxiety disorder so im stressed a lot of the time, but it seems to happen even if things are going great and im completely relaxed. initally it freaked me out a lot but now i can generally ignore it unless its particularly bad and persistent, it starts to stress me out a bit again.   doesnt seem to have much of relation to diet but it tends to happen most on the days im doing total fasts except coffee and whatnot, so mostly sugars i guess with a bit of salt here and there.    only a bit of a fasting heart rate and the -feeling my heartbeat throughout my body- kind of palpitations, not the ""skipping a beat"" kind   Thanks for your help!",False,True

Is it like a sharp feeling that catches your breath? Or something akin to a cramp? Or an odd pounding?  How painful is it? Is it something you can ignore and move on from, or does it take all of your focus and make it hard to function while it‚Äôs happening?   Where is the pain located specifically? On a certain side of your chest? Is it the same area every time?  How long does the pain last? Does it get worse the longer it‚Äôs happening, better, fluctuate?   How long into your fast does it typically happen? How soon after ingesting caffeine or any sort of medication?   What is your activity level like? Do you exercise? Is most of your time spent sitting?   What is your stress level like? Are you often stressed? Or only periodically? How high is your stress when you do feel it? Is it enough to cause panic, influence sleep, etc? Or is it mild?   When you do eat, what are you eating? Is it more fruits and veggies, more protein, more fats and sugars?   Are there any other symptoms that come along with it? Light-headedness, blurred vision, numbing of the extremities, ear ringing, nausea- anything else?",False,False
