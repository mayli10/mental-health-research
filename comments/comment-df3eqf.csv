Pre-drinks, aperitif,  wine with entree, booze in my coffee......it took me all my will power not to hurl the $250 meal we splurged on and it's a wonder I was able to walk out of there. Suffice to say I went straight to bed and spent the rest of the night drunk texting randos.  Now that's relationship goals /s",False,False

I plan like this too and eat most of the meals I have with my bf. He doesn't like his food too warm though so waits for it to cool, eats very slowly and it makes me so anxious. Like, I'm not mad at him, those are totally reasonable ways to be but I'm so frustrated with myself everytime. When I plan what I'm going to eat, I want to eat it fast so I don't have to think about eating for longer than necessary.",False,False
