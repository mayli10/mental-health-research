Over here we’re just aware of how far past the line we are.    It definitely sucks to go through weight loss subs and see how insanely disordered their methods seem. (esp. r/fasting) BUT I think the difference is that these *methods* have less damaging intentions. More “let’s get healthy” and less “how small can I get.”  Also probably less body dysmorphia.   (Also note: I’m referencing to the GENERAL intentions of these groups. I’m sure there’s a few EDs hidden amongst the crowd),False,False
