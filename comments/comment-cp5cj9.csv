My limit went from 1200 to 800 and I feel absolutely disgusted with myself when I go over it. I do 2 48 hour fasts a week. Idk how this happened. What triggered it. I've struggled with disordered eating before, but it was not this extreme. I didn't do extended fasts. I just restricted to only eating one meal a day. Now it's like the only peace I get is on my fasting days because I'm not taking in calories.. so I don't have to worry about them.",False,False
