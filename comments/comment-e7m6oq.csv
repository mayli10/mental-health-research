Iâ€™m a psych major with the intent of eventually treating anxiety and, who knows, maybe eating disorders somewhere down the line. I currently just keep telling myself Iâ€™ll be fully recovered by then. I almost got there too but relapsed last month and have yet to find my footing again.   I think itâ€™s okay to acknowledge and accept that there are health professionals and mental health professionals who struggle with disorders they treat and that this doesnâ€™t have to limit them. I mean, Iâ€™d rather optimize my brain power and body by not starving but I also think I could effectively treat someone despite this illness.   Itâ€™s complex. I get the mixed feelings youâ€™re experiencing for sure.",False,False

Itâ€™s not like I teach health or anatomy or medicine but I just feel so like...dirty that they think Iâ€™m knowledgeable and respect me but I still think about myself and my body like Iâ€™m 15",False,False

Iâ€™m more EDNOS these days than bulimic, but probably not the person who should be teaching other people about health. I really did think that pursuing this sort of work would force me to get healthy, but it just made me really good at pretending Iâ€™m healthy.",False,False

Iâ€™m an artist and I think the human form is beautiful. I love the look of fat, I think itâ€™s graceful, soft and elegant. Fat people are like flowers or like clouds, so gentle in their form, no hard edges.   So why do I hate it on my own body? Uhhhhhhhhhhhhhh",False,False

I work in humanitarian health, so Iâ€™m sometimes in conflict settings, refugee camps, very inaccessible rural areas, etc. Iâ€™ve worked on malnutrition projects where Iâ€™m taking malnourished children measurements. I donâ€™t have any advice or answers other than Iâ€™m always available to talk about this stuff! It causes me a lot of guilt sometimes, but EDs are legitimate mental health conditions and your experience will make you a more understanding provider one day!",False,False

Yet I starve my body as if Iâ€™m not aware of how cruel it is and all the negative consequences it has. Seems so wrong but somehow my ED ass rationalizes it,False,False
