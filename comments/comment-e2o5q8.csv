My case I think it's a bit different because I often restrict on regular food in order to enjoy a special meal with friends but this has been just lately. Recently I eat when i'm around other people who eat, when not eating would require explanation I don't want to make up.  I'm basically guessing the hungrier the better, but I still eat at least 1-2 meals a day to tranquilize my family and boyfriend. Man sometimes I send around pics of meals I don't actually eat, for appearence's sake.  At least I'm out of purging and overexercising for now.",False,True

Confidently striding into the fucking tempest.   I straight up told someone I care about, deadpan, that I frankly don’t care enough to even begin to stop and tbh I felt powerful. (Not the most helpful or productive thing but I’ve been on an emotional roller coaster and at least that was a more positive emotion to feel.)",False,False

Also when I'm restricting/fasting, I have absolute control over my life, no one can tell me to do shit, I'm the motherfucking captain of this shipwreck and I'm full of confidence. When I'm trying to be normal and have my moments of recovery, I'm so easily pushed around, for some odd reason. I really have no idea why I'm like this. It's life my personality completely changes and I definitely like myself better when I'm relapsing.",False,False
