Like remind yourself that you have to eat 3500 over your TDEE to gain a pound of fat. Your TDEE is at the very least 1000 sedentary, even if you are short and underweight. Anything under that won't cause weight gain.   You can weigh out every gram of food and mathematically be certain you won't gain weight. Tell yourself over and over. ""I can mathematically prove this won't make me fat."" The other thoughts are your brain lying to you because it's caught in an anxiety loop. You have to break the loop.   Then self-care through the resulting panic.   It sucks really badly, but it's the only way this gets better.   (Also, if you eat closer to 1000 and suddenly gain weight, remember it is glycogen, water, and food waste. Keto dieters lose 10 pounds their first week -- it's the water and glycogen in their muscles that gets flushed out as they enter ketosis. You might be in ketosis right now from restriction.)",False,False
