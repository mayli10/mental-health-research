When you have been restricting hard its next to impossible to control your intact. Humans are just naturally wired to naturally intake and eat more sugars, fats and carbs during or after a period of fasting.       What you have is two strong forces in your mind pulling in different directions. One side saying, “oh low energy levels, thirsty, intake” and the other side saying “fast, concentrate. Maintain control.”   Think of it as a wheel turning through 360 degrees. As one side falls the opposite and proportionally equal side rises.   It’s exhausting cause both thoughts take up so much energy and reduce your Cognitive skills.   Think of it as traveling over different terrain. Working across hills and valleys. Where different thoughts, times of the day and energy levels equate to terrains that can be traversed at different degrees of difficulty. Exhausting muscles with each step.   Take some comfort from how aware you are of your triggers and mind traps. It takes time to unlearn learned behavior and build a resolve.       As a man in his 30’s. Anger and rage as an outlet never helped. Talking at group, keeping a journal and learning to forgive myself &amp; others did.   Most emotions you feel at any given moment are chemical. Though memories are incredibly strong and person forming they also illicit a response more geared to a person’s emotional past then present.       It took a lot of strength to write what you did. Sorry to hear about your Father. I have had my own issues around my mother’s mental health and suicide attempts.   Sorry I couldn’t do much more then reply to your post and encourage you keep righting and expressing yourself. Hopefully you will find your peace.       PS Alan Watts has helped me a lot. Especially “Uncarved Block, Unbleached Silk.”",False,False
