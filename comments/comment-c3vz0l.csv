Lamotrigine was loosing/weight neutral Lithium was the odd 2lbs Quetapine also 2lbs  The rest were pretty much weight neutral.   It’s annoying AF that they affect us all in different ways in terms of weight because you’ll never know until you try them. Plus they may actually help your mental health so they’re worth a try :),False,False

However these were antipsychotics and at really high dosages, I wouldn't worry too much but if it's a concern mention it to your psych and ask to have your weight monitored. They should take it seriously if you start gaining and try to switch it up.",False,False

I think it's possible for some people to not gain on the medicine so don't be too afraid.    Psychs are aware that people don't want to gain weight from their meds (my psychiatrist is at least-he said people switch off meds that work for them because they gain too much weight). Unless you're really underweight right now I don't think mentioning this concern would raise any red flags.",False,False

If your weight starts going up you can get off them because you ""blow up"". They also start you on a really low dose and slowly go up so you aren't going to get slammed with heavy side effects.",False,False

But not all meds even run the risk of weight gain.   I have type 2 and take a non typical mood stabilizer lamictal. Never had problems with weight gain, actually never had a doctor mention it as a side effect.    Also remember that seeing a psychiatrist doesn't mean you have to take any meds they recommend without vetting them first. Definitely be up front with who ever you see about your concerns. If they're a good doctor then they'll take your concerns into consideration.",False,False

Some people lose weight, some people maintain, some people gain. For example: being hungrier = eating more = weight gain. You won’t take a pill and gain.

Maybe it would be lower if I wasn't, but it hasn't made me worse. Someone close to me was bouncing from mood stabilizer to different mood stabilizers for like half a year and gained about 5 pounds total. I think the effect of each med is really different for different people so you should try them out. Worst case scenario, you could always just go off them.",False,False
