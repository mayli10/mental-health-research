I know what it is but i don't think i struggle with it because it's not like i see myself as comically large or anything or see fat rolls that aren't there.  My body image can change drastically based on several factors that influence my mood, like if i overate and have too much time to reflect on the fact and nothing else to pull me out of the headspace and stop me from ruminating (even though it's ultimately a choice and up to me, akin to procrastination). Like i see the same thing in both good and bad moods, but how i process it is way different. Which still isn't good to struggle with, body dysmorphia or not, but yeah.  Yesterday i wore sweatpants all day and for some reason it triggered the fuck out of me because i could feel the fabrics rubbing together and in my head i visualized these anatomical flaps of skin between my thighs. But then i took them off to go on a run and was like, oh, my thighs aren't actually touching and my legs are normal.  Whenever i go to the gym midday, in front of the mirrors, i look good, alright? But i just base how i process my appearance on my emotions. So if i feel lousy waking up (every day), i don't dress my best, and then i continue to feel lousy because of the way im dressed, then i change into my gym clothss feeling self conscious until i see my reflection and then suddenly im at peace with myself and the rest of the day is great and i usually wind up staying in my gym clothes.  I just wish i had the post-gym perspectice when i wake up first thing. The solution is probably to fake it until you make it and allow myself to ease into it in order to overcome the insecurity/self-consciousness, but idk. Easier said than done",False,False

It was in bed, I was wearing a nightie and the mirror was far away. I didn’t recognize myself. But then by the next day I felt fat again. It didn’t last.   Now that I’ve gained I’m repulsed. I don’t look at myself until I know I’m between 110-115. Im definitely above that so currently hating myself. (I’m 5’8 for reference)",False,False
