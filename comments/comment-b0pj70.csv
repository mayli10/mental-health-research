The weight fluctuations are so crazy, especially when you’re short.

I've gained 10 pounds from a single day of bingeing before...I was thinking of faking my weigh-ins..only issue is blood pressure :/,False,False

My weight can fluctuate up to 20 pounds or so from a binge, it’s really absurd thinking about how I can go from a mid-16s BMI to a healthy BMI and then back again over the span of two weeks.  There was one day where my weight went up to 105, so my mother must’ve spoke to the psychiatrist and said my weight was somewhat stable. ",False,True

I gained 5 lbs over the holidays, and instead of losing them right away like I promised myself, I've slowly put on 2 more since the 1st of the year. I think the next thing I'm going to try is going hard on caffiene. Stimulants and distractions for the win, I hope? ",False,False

Yeah 20lbs seems pretty average for a binge session that long, and its only been 4kg because i've been inconsistently restricting as well as walking lol.

My weight has had 20-pound fluctuations just from two weeks of binging, only 4 kg is quite impressive. That aside, I know it sucks. Fortunately I don’t have a scale with me so I think I’ll just fast a bit, and hope the Vyvanse works its magic like it did last time. ",False,True

So I'm currently 78.5kg and I'm currently hour 24 into my unknown length fast, So i'm actively avoiding the scale potentially for rest of the month...when I start eating again I'm gonna try and not set a daily cal limit as it just encourages me to binge so I'm forcing my body to revert to my old 2016/2017 full blown ana days of just trying to eat as little as possible lol.      So i'm gonna try and eat around 1000 cals a day or so when I start eating again and i'm sure I can remove this binge weight but a fast definitely kills binge appetite for me.",False,False
