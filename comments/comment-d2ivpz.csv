A-list celebrities are truly not like us, especially in the modern age. Of course I understand the temptation to compare yourself against her, but just for starters, remember she has professionals who keep her looking exactly that way. Not to mention high end makeup/hair stylists...I mean don't get me wrong, she's beautiful, but like, a lot of people could look stunning if they got that kind of professional attention.   Also, cosmetic work has gotten increasingly common among young stars, especially female ones. The work comes in varying degrees of subtlety, of course, and Ariana's is fairly noticeable to my eye (especially the brow lift).  This is not meant to invalidate your feelings, btw, but to assure you that if celebs look too good be true...that's because they kinda are, you know? :)",False,False
