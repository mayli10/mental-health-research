I know that sounds shitty, but coming to terms with that will help you take the pressure off of weight loss. You can do this. Late last year I went to Hawaii at my highest weight ever. It helped me a lot to make myself be okay with being fat in paradise lol and I had a great time. And I came home lighter than I was when I left.  Then you should turn your focus towards health and nutrition. Focus on what you SHOULD eat, not what you shouldn't eat. Think positively not negatively. Make positive goals like eating x servings of vegetables today, drinking x cups of water, getting x grams of protein.",False,False

Pair it with intermittent fasting and exercise you'll get even better results. Just be wary of your eating disorder. I went from starving and binging to orthorexia. Goodluck!,False,False

I am sorry.   Believe it or not but there is a huge margin before you can call something or someone ""fat"". Yor definition has been messed up due to the ED.   I don't have any advise about how to deal with the reoccuring ED. So proffesional treatment would be the best opition.  You are doing great, keep yourself healthy. And love yourself",False,False
