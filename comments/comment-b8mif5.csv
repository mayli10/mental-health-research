When I started to recover though and was just coming into the healthy BMI range, one of my friends pulled me aside and expressed how happy he was that I looked alive again and how scary it was always seeing me look blue, tired, and just kinda... dead. After that I started to like the way my face looked more full of life, and I realized how skeletal I looked. That was one of the big reasons why recovery stuck for me for a long time. I hope you find your peace.",False,False
