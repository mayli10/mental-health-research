I would go on weeklong fasts with brief 500-calorie days in between in addition to working out. This time around I thought I wasn’t that sick or so bad because I was eating 500-700cal and not fasting and only doing gentle workouts. That’s not how the professionals saw it...,False,False

Maybe challenging this fear would be good for you (even if it’s just an interview or a check up, not necessarily setting up long-term therapy sessions).  Ofc I have no way of knowing what happened in your past to make you feel this way, and I’m not a doctor just a hangry moron on reddit. But that would be my 2 cents.
