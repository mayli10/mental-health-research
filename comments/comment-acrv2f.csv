I have no idea of knowing if it's actually correct, but I do try to order things that look lean or small on the menu.   If it's something like an all you can eat sushi thing, I just log the remainder of what I'm allowed to eat on MFP and be done with it. Yes, it's just tricking myself, but it makes me calm.   Obviously my methods don't really work if you eat in restaurants every week, I understand that. Sometimes I'm thankful that I don't have any friends or money to go somewhere to eat lol. I go out to dinner about 6-10 times a year.",False,False
