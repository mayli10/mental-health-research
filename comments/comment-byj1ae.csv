That's 330! You could eat the whole 660 and be a-okay, no weight gain AT ALL even if you ate 1000 more calories that day. So 330?? Dont sweat it!

I can promise you that this one, high calorie cookie isn’t going to make you gain 50 pounds. It won’t even make you gain one pound.  You can restrict for the rest of the week, month, year, whatever. But you’ve been looking forward to trying this, and you’re going to be so sad you didn’t after you leave Chicago and don’t have the chance.  Nothing bad can come from sharing this cookie with your SO.   Eat the cookie!!!!! 💕",False,False
