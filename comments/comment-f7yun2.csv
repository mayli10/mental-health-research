I chew them up and swish then around my mouth to neutralize the acid. It must be effective because I've been doing this for years and my teeth are still very much intact. (Though please note I've read some indicators that too much calcium can manifest depressive symptoms).   I also recommend water loading before purging to dilute the acid before it comes up and also make the whole process easier.,False,False

Donâ€™t brush your teeth for at least a half hour after purging.  Use a fluoride mouth rinse; they come in both a daily and a weekly strength.  Drink acidic drinks with a straw and avoid letting them touch your teeth as much as possible.",False,False
