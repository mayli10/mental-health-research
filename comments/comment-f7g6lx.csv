Also consider switching from stimulant laxatives to magnesium based or Miralax/Colase. Stimulant laxatives are the ones that can kill the nerves in your colon. And maybe pick up some pedialyte for when you do this, that helps keep your electrolytes in check and is more hydrating than water",False,False
