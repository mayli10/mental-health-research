You will most likely have some water retention tomorrow but remember that it WILL go away in a day and you will be back to your normal self. So don't panic (I always do) it will go down.   &amp;#x200B;  Honestly, since starting to EC stack last spring, without my bronkaid I get ravenous and just want to eat everything. It will just hit and I will get so confused as to why I am so hungry...binge....then realize ohhhhhh!  I think due to being used to taking it, when I am not and I actually feel true hunger my brain freaks out and realizes I am hungry and makes me eat so much!   &amp;#x200B;  I am sure your doggie will be happy with the pizza!!!  &amp;#x200B;  I am sorry you are feeling so upset right now!!!!!  tomorrow is a new day : )",False,False

I ended up spoiling the pizza instead of giving it to him. He's smol and only needs about 500 calories a day (or 1/2 baconator, in words he can understand haha).  Somehow he hasn't turned into an absolute unit even though he's spoiled af. He gets plenty of exercise, though!",False,True

Dogs need waaaay fewer calories than most people realize, so things like pizza add up really quickly!  I just read the bit where you ruined the second pizza, but it's something to consider if you like feeding your pup food you shouldn't or don't want to eat.   Doggos aside, I hope you start feeling better soon! And try not to be too hard on yourself for one day of binging, your body is punishing itself hard enough, I'd say. ",False,False

I couldn’t imagine going thru what you guys go thru. I’m so sorry! Also Kroger sells a really good GF pizza for $5 if you’ve never had it. But it’s best to eat that with other people so you can’t eat all it yourself cuz I totally would it’s so good. ,False,False

Every once in a while (try like twice a year) when I feel the need to binge on something I would normally be repulsed by, I make sure it is glutenous. That way, I am swiftly and thoroughly punished with pain for my poor decisions and for binging and also it shoots right through me. I’ve done this since I was quite young. It’s super not healthy, particularly the mental process behind it, but on the other hand I really don’t do it frequently. Plus because of it I’ve never felt the need to abuse laxatives (guess that’s a bright side?). ",False,False

My fiancé turns a sickly shade of green and can barely speak he’s so sick 30 mins after eating any gluten. ",False,False

You didn’t mention anything else, so I assume all you’ve eaten today is pizza? You’ll be fine... minimum BMR is at least 1200 and you’ll have used more than that just to walk around.
