Melatonin doesn't help me either. This sucks so bad because I got drunk last week to force myself to sleep, which didn't work, and hangovers on no sleep are not fun. I'm moving back to my parent's house this week though, I think it will help a lot. Good luck with your sleep too &lt;3",False,True

I’ve been having nightmares/super active dreams for almost a month now and it’s ruining my ability to sleep!!! Melatonin and sleeping pills don’t help very much either. It suuucks.    I hope you get some peaceful sleep tonight ✨,False,False
