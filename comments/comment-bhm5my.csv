My understanding is that addiction is very similar to eating disorders in how they effect a person's brain. I'm no expert of course, but from what a lot of people describe and from my own experience with anorexia it does seem that you get addicted to feeling empty. A lot of people with bulimia who I've talked to have said that it's like they're addicted to purging. They hate being full. I suppose binge eating disorder would probably be different because you don't get the empty feeling from BED, but my understanding is that it presents itself either as a coping mechanism for other problems or that people binge eat because their body can't handle how much they're starving themselves.  Perhaps it might help if you can try to relate to her by your experiences with alcoholism.",False,False

You seem so genuine, I'm sure that the effort you're putting in will do some good!  Compliments can be awesome, and they make me personally feel really good (although some people hate any comments on appearance).  I tend to feel my best when I'm doing things that don't revolve around food, like going out with friends to explore/shop/see a show or just playing a board game, etc.  Although I don't feel great most of the time (so I'm not the best to give advice on this lol) I do notice that if the people around me seem happy and are engaged with me, I feel better too.  Anything that takes the focus away from my body!",False,False

Not her fault, but also not an excuse to punish your partner! It’s good to know it was just a typo haha.   Let me tell you one thing, while I do feel like I wanna look “worthy” of my SO, being with him and having him in my life has improved my sense of self worth and my relationships with food and my body by orders of magnitude. There may be little quirks here or there where she feels like she’s not good enough for you but I promise just having your support is worth so, so much more to her than those moments of self-doubt.   You sound like a really emotionally intelligent person and more than equipped to handle this battle. Remember to take time off for yourself so you don’t get burned out (because that won’t be good for either of you) but honestly don’t doubt yourself. You’ve got this.",False,False

I always say it is not my fault, but clearly I must be blaming myself a bit to mistype that :P will probably have to analyze that a big more. I think that partially I blame the relationship for putting more pressure on her to feel as though she has to look good for me, but she has been doing great at trying to see me even when her ED is telling her no. good catch on that and appreciate you reaching out but on the surface I really did mean to say I know it is NOT my fault",False,True

I started my anti depressants and seemingly have worked through a lot of my issues and my partner has been helpful with helping me even more. We are both trying to work through our issues together and out number one concern is being positive for eachother instead of feeding into issues.

Personally I've struggled with a lot of mental health problems over the past seven years and it's really exhausting to always be working on self-improvement. In my life it seems that whenever I fix one problem a new one shows up. Sometimes I get so tired of trying to recover and I just need to take a break for a few weeks. I've found that the process is always the same though. You figure out what your problem is, you figure out where the problem came from, you think further on how the problem is effecting your daily life, then you figure out ways to get better. The ways you get better tend to involve mostly combating intrusive thoughts and avoiding triggering situations. The first two steps are a lot easier to get through if you meditate, but if you're like me, a person who has literally only relaxed once in her entire life, meditation isn't something to do daily, so you have to take it in increments. Step three usually involves a lot of research, mostly into the APA's DSM-V journal.",False,False

And you are absolutely right. I dont blame myself and i definitely dont put too much on myself to ""fix things"" but I always want to learn more to see what I can do better.

I definitely was too pushy this morning because she was saying she would not eat for the next two days and I was not in the best mindset myself and tried to explain that it wont help and will continue the cycle instead of just letting her vent and waiting for her tunnel vision to pass. Luckily, she sees her counselor today and that will hopefully help her mood today. I think that she is doing great working on it but she cant see it.

I work hard to do points 1-4 but I think i do often try to solve things too much instead of allowing just open venting. I think that when she struggles it just hurts to see her in pain and I know it is my fault I just wish I could take some of the burden off of her. I always tell her she is pretty and we are working on having her stop responding with comments negating that, but some days are worse than others and I give her space when she asks. We are very communicative and vocal about our boundaries which helps but I just find that sometimes I wonder if I am doing enough or if my presence causes her pain because she is more self-conscious. I think that you are right though and that the ED wants to be the primary relationship and I see that in her when she gets dismissive and isolates. But she always comes back in a couple of hours and I make sure to go over those moments and try to break her tunnel vision when she is in them.

Let me give you a brief list of things my SO does that I find helpful:  1) Compliments me. Not just when I’m feeling bad about myself, and not always in a meaningful way, just casually throwing out “you’re beautiful” or “you’re so cute” etc - normalise it.   2) Lets me vent. He doesn’t always try to “fix” the problem or talk through solutions with me, he just lets me talk about it. It’s really cathartic.   3) Knows where it’s okay to touch me, and where it isn’t, and never crosses those boundaries. For example, I’d pass into the afterlife if he touched my lower stomach.   4) Lets me bond with him. Anorexia is going to fight to the death to be the primary relationship in her life. Both you and her need to work to make sure that doesn’t happen.   5) He’s my reality check. Anorexia comes with a lot of distance from reality, whether it’s dysmorphia or having a Level 87 breakdown over eating 300 calories. Gently reminding her that she can’t trust her own judgement on this and then being honest with her (don’t lie - if she finds out, her disorder will make it harder for her to trust you next time) about the reality of a situation will ground her and stop her from spinning into a fucked up ED fantasy nightmare.   Good luck OP, you seem like a really great partner.",False,False

Eating disorders aren't just about people being self-conscious over their weight. Eating disorders are a kind of mental illness. Just like you can't stop a person from experiencing hallucinations or mood swings you can't stop an eating disorder. A person suffering from an eating disorder either needs professional help to get better or to will themself to self-improvement. It takes great self-control, self-reflection, and a genuine desire to get better. Sometimes a person just isn't ready for the stress recovery will cause and it's better for them to focus on preparing mentally so that in the future the will be. The best that you can do is to support her and to remind her that she's not all the terrible things inside her head. You can't fix her, but sometimes all a person needs is somebody to lean on and when they have that they can do much more than they ever could alone.",False,False

The reality is though, the disordered mind does not see what you see, regardless of the truth. Stating facts about what is/is not healthy is definitely not the answer, and may even do more harm than good. She might be triggered to engage in ED behaviors if she thinks you view her as unhealthy, etc. It's so difficult to know how each person will react to seemingly harmless, well-intentioned comments.      The best advice I can offer, and what I have appreciated most from my boyfriend, is just the offer to listen without judgment. Make sure she knows your opinion of her is not altered by anything she cares to share with you. Sometimes getting shit off your chest, having a good cry in the arms of a loved one, is the best feeling you can hope for. Let her know that while you may not understand what is going on in her head, you support her and will help her in any way you can, always without judgment.",False,False

I'm not sure exactly what you mean by ""telling her what is healthy"", but I can pretty much guarantee that she knows/knows her behaviors are not healthy - that's not the problem.  The issue is being fully aware and not wanting to/being able to stop.    Helping her focus on other qualities than physical things is a good approach. Unfortunately there may be nothing you can do to make her change, it's a mental disorder and extremely complicated stuff.  Seeing professionals is the best route, and if she's not doing so already maybe bring it up and help her find someone, but again, don't push.  Don't blame yourself for not being able to help, and try to remember that small comments that mean very little to you can have a big impact (try searching for some of the 'my boyfriend said...' posts on here, they'll give you insight).  It's awesome that you want to help her, just be supportive overall.  It's hard to give specific tips since the nature behind each person's issues vary wildly - maybe even talk to a professional yourself who has experience with eds and can give you ideas based on what your/her situation is.",False,False
