My advice would be to weigh yourself tomorrow, see the minor bump in weight (mostly water weight as well), accept the tiny setback, and move on with your normal routine. “Making up” for a shitty day is extremely stressful and often leads to a binge in my experience. If you really feel the need to compensate for a cheat day (which you really shouldn’t), it’s best to eat healthier/leaner in the days leading up to it rather than punishing yourself after the fact in my experience",False,False

While you (and me too ooof) are feeling some massive stress from all the shit you had today, it’ll pass. You’ll hurt yourself more and be at way higher physical risk if you take extreme action. Stick to what you have been doing!   Even if you ignore everything else, please just be safe!",False,False
