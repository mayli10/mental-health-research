I fooled myself for a long time thinking my bradycardia was fitness related, but honestly my HR of 40bpm was probably more due to the stupid shit I was doing at the time.  not that I don't still do stupid shit but at least I'm semi-self aware ha",False,False

My ED caused me to get orthostatic hypotension though, which means that when I go from lying to sitting or sitting to standing my blood pressure plummets and my heart rate increases to compensate. My RHR is usually averaging 60 but I‚Äôm overweight - it‚Äôs dropped dramatically since I became orthostatic. I know when I‚Äôm laying down/at night it‚Äôs gotten as low as 48 bpm because I‚Äôve checked in my fitbit app. And tbh if my psych knew this she‚Äôd probably want to send me back into treatment!   Also, side note, idk if anyone here is on beta blockers (like Prazosin) for PTSD but if you have a low BP those meds drop it way lower. I was blacking out every morning before we realized why!",False,False

Oh my gosh, grade 10 science our teacher made us measure our heart rate and raise our hands anytime he hit a number that was ours.  I was 160 lbs I think, or 155 and 5'6 and my ""resting heart rate"" was like 90.  Now it's more like 60.  My blood pressure is also 110/63 so I'm not too worried much.  But anywho, mine was 90 ish and the girl next to me was also 90 ish.  Except she was 5'3 and pretty overweight.  He just looked at us 2 and said ""well it really differs between people, lots of factors go into heart rate"" because we were the only 2 in the class with that high of rate, majority of everyone was 70 or below.  I was feeling nervous that day and often fidget, but man I never felt more ashamed about myself then.  This was 2 years ago, so numbers are foggy.",False,False

Though I know a low number is indicative that my body is shutting down and using as little energy as possible. I want the proof I‚Äôm doing something significant.   The rapid jump to a high HR with minimal exertion is actually typical of folks dealing with EDs. It‚Äôs another sign the heart is struggling. It‚Äôs why you can‚Äôt BS a competent doctor with ‚Äúoh, my HR is just low because I run a lot‚Äù. Endurance athletes do have low RHRs but theirs don‚Äôt jump to hummingbird status when asked to stand and walk across the room. Their hearts beat slow from strength-efficiency, while ED hearts beat slow from struggle-exhaustion.",False,False
