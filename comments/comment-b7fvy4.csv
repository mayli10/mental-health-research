Time went by quicker then I wanted it to, and every time I take them I tell myself ""this is the last time"". But it's never the last time I take them, I'm dependent on them now.  I'm fatigued all the time, if I don't take them I get so bloated I can't even fit my clothes or do anything. This is seriously the worst thing in the world, I can't even describe how much I would like to just have a Normal working digestive track.  Never, ever start doing Lax kids. This shit fucked me up for life. ",False,False

I know that‚Äôs said about every Ed habit, but laxatives honestly have ruined my life.  I was taking 20+ Stimulant lax pills a day for about 8 months. It got to the point where my body started rejecting the pills and everything else. Throwing up nonstop for hours and explosive diarrhea and stomach cramps that made me feel like i was giving birth. I fucked up my heart muscles more than they already were, and i did permanent damage to my disgestive system. I stopped cold turkey the day that I got my current job, so I‚Äôve been officially hard-laxative free for just over 7 months.   Now I have to take huge doses of miralax to even have a semi-normal colon. If I miss a day, I gain a ton of water weight and am in physical pain for days.   I understand the empty feeling but please listen when i say don‚Äôt do it. It‚Äôs so not worth it.   ",False,False

Calories are absorbed through your digestive track, but not expelled through it. I'm not going to get into the details, but basically energy which has been burned is expelled as carbon dioxide when you exhale. I know that feeling of emptiness can feel good either way, but if you're taking the laxatives hoping to undo the ""damage"" of your binge you should know that they won't help. The only way to undo the amount of calories you ingested is to burn them off through exercise.",False,False
