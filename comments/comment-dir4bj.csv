If I’m happy with the number I kinda don’t want to ruin it by eating and it all seems worth it, but if I’m disappointed then I feel like it’s pointless and it’s not even working and I don’t give a shit so I just inhale the entire fridge.",False,False

But I’ve been in a spiral of eating way too much since April when my fiancé told me I looked like I was dying (he rly was trying to be helpful and had justnhad enough of my shit... can’t blame him for the rude comment)  Gained about 7 lbs from April til now. Today I was only up +4 from my April weight and haven’t been eating like a psycho for like 5 straight days so I’m feeling great so seeing the scale kept me motivated to not eat just bc I wanted to eat,False,True

Whenever I see a number I'm happy with, I wind up in a binge purge cycle for the day.  I don't know why my brain is like this. I'm really not out to sabotage myself.  This actually happened to me this morning.  I could have been at my goal weight by next week but I'm fairly certain I ruined it today.",False,False
