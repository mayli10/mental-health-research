It's essentially the same damn thing.  The medical complications and treatments differ though, if the patient needs weight restoration or not. So I can see how the distinction between diagnoses is necessary, although yes - mentally the disorder is the same.",False,False

Last time i got bloodwork and all that medical stuff done it came back fine exept for low(er) blood pressure (lower end of normal) and a slower resting heart rate which at this point in time hasn't caused me any problems. I'm not even underweight either.  I used this as an excuse to think that i didn't actually have an ED but one day i magically realised that it's the mental side of it that determines if you have an ED or not.   *Technically* you do have to be underweight to be classified as ""anorexic"" but honestly that is bullshit and anorexia and atypical anorexia should just be grouped into one. It's essentially the same damn thing.",False,False

For a long time I dont think I actually knew of others, but thats because I was actually taught about anorexia and bulimia in HS (which is kinda interesting).
