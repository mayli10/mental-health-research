When I was around 10lbs underweight my hamstrings were so tight I had pain walking, running, sitting. I think it has to do with muscle loss, which can put a strain on other muscle groups and tendons. Just my best guess lol",False,False

I have no urge to stretch, and when I do, it feels difficult. I have this general sense of being unwell when I'm restricting and I think it manifests physically for me. also my joint crack a SHITTON but it doesn't hurt.  as far as strictly weight concerns, I guess it depends on the degree of underweightedness? if you are severely underweight, your muscles and joints are gonna suffer. actually most of your body will. I don't think being underweight will make you inherently less flexible but it will make you much much more prone to injury. so anticipate going slow and being gentle.",False,False
