You could just say that you‚Äôve been getting the urge to eat non-food stuff lately and want some help to get rid of that but you hurt your body. They may ask about your food history a bit, but they also might not.      Theres also stuff like soap flavoured gum, and cilantro, so maybe you could even trick your brain into thinking food is non-food. Might even help you to eat a bit more as well without as much guilt since its ‚Äúnot food if it tastes like soap‚Äù ",False,False
