A few days ago I woke up with an overwhelming urge to binge on sugar. I felt so out of control walking to the store numb and debating what I was going to get. I walked between the bakery section and cookies and baking supplies a few times. Chose and put back 3 types of cookies. Decided on frosting. Then frosting and cookies. Then I felt like I didn't want to be here at all. Put the frosting back. Bought a pack of carrot cake Oreos. 150 for two. Got home and ate 10. Then a little while later the other 10. The whole pack. 1500 calories.   But that was a few days ago and I'm trying to take better care of myself and not punish myself with temporary sugar hits. I'm sorry you had a rough moment. It'll be ok though just keep trying to move forward.,False,False
