I’m gonna enjoy it while I can - I just dread the inevitable 5+ lbs of water weight and bloated belly.   Plus there’s always this underlying fear that THIS time I won’t stop when planned, continue binging for weeks and gain 20 or more REAL pounds before I know it. It’s happened before.    Deep breaths. Thanks for the encouragement and good luck to you as well. ",False,False

I have to eat tonight and tomorrow due to a work trip - but planning on salads and the most minimum possible food. Then back to fasting Tues and Wed.   Then it’s a free for all Thurs - Sunday (out of town at family’s all 4 days and lots of dinners out). I’ll probably have to fast for a month after to make up for it. And next thing I know it’ll be Christmas. God I hate the holiday season sometimes. ,False,False

Going to try and stay at 1500, because I suspect that’s my TDEE. Otherwise, for the rest of the week try to find filling, high volume foods to eat. And keep up exercise, maybe do the Turkey trot challenge on Strava. Really looking forward to that.",False,False

And then Tuesday-Saturday I’m with my family. I’m going to try to restrict below 1,000 calories on every day except Thursday and secretly workout in my room. Thursday we do our annual morning 5k and then for dinner I’m just going to eat one normal plate and hope to keep it below my TDEE. I just feel like it’s not worth the drama and stress to restrict on Thanksgiving. It’s also one of my favorite holidays. I am also confident I can lose if I gain once I get back home.

Ive gotten into a routine with my meals and this is scary.  Luckily I have to prep all my food for just myself ahead of time (only vegan in family of people AGAINST veganism) so I have pretty decent control!!!

The actual day: I am going whole hog (with my hog body) on salad that I am making to fill up. Then I will let myself have a small portion of turkey and all the vegetable based sides (no rolls!!!!). Because festivity! I'm expecting to eat 1200 or so for the day.   I'm also doing most of the cooking so I can decide how much fat and shit to put in things. And it's a great coping strategy, because no one really checks to see if the cook is eating, haha, I can participate socially that way.   Then I'm going to try to fast Friday and Saturday.   Good god, if anything messes with this plan, I will actually freak out. I already had a disaster with my scheduled refeed earlier this week and actually didn't eat 2/3 of the meals I had planned and had a panic attack and then ate a bunch of chocolate.",False,False
