Exact same for peanut butter it’s crazy I used to hate hate hate it &amp; now I literally wake up in the middle of the night &amp; want to go binge on it.... also I’ve become obsessed with bread/baked goods too! So much so that I have gotten really into baking &amp; I now have a sourdough culture (which is super satisfying because you have to feed it twice a day to keep it healthy!) I do get a little sad because no one in my family ever wants to eat what I bake &amp; then I end up eating all of it/throwing some away :(,False,False
