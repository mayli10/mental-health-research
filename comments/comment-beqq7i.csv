You don't owe them anything except a ""yes, I am capable of fulfilling these responsibilities"". Unless of course, you really feel that you won't be able to, but I suspect that's not the case since you decided to apply.  It's sort of the same trap as when employers ask ""do you have reliable transportation"" - they are trying to find out whether you own a car, but legally they can't ask this. If you say ""Oh I ride the bus, but it's usually reliable"", you've fallen into the trap. All you need to say is ""yes I do"".  They're looking for you to volunteer information they aren't allowed to ask for directly. Don't give it to them. If you're healthy enough, just sign it!",False,False

Will having an ED/depression/anxiety cause you issues in reaching that goal? If not, I doubt they'd have grounds to rescind the invitation even if they knew about it.",False,False
