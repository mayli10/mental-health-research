My logic was basically just that I needed a highly effective BC without any room for user error so that I couldn't get pregnant. I felt like condoms alone were not nearly effective enough. I wouldn't be able to take the pill cause my depression got my sleep schedule crazy. Went for Depo and the rest is history.   I ended up getting a hormone free copper IUD and haven't had any issues with it yet other than round the clock cramps. It cost $800 USD up front though :(  It has made me really weary to start other meds just for mental health. I def have something fucky with my brain chemistry but if you can respond *that badly* to something nobody made a big deal of like Depo well I feel like I can't trust anyone about it now.   It's really scary to venture in to the unknown like that since we can't know what chemicals are messing up where in your brain or how you'll react. It's brave of you to take the chance.,False,False

I have endometriosis and through my research I've only heard bad things about Depo. Jesus, I'm sorry it was so bad for you. That makes me sad. How long were you on it for?  I'm also terrified of pregnancy. What is the logic behind the med and fixing that anxiety? Have you gotten on any new meds or did that ruin it for you? The first med I got on in my adult life was Effexor. I was terrified because I heard it called the Devil's drug. It was my only option at the time and I'm so lucky that I made the decision to take it. I was also put on Haldol for some mood issues and it was absolutely terrifying. It was the first time I realized that I could be permanently messed up from a medication. It took a week to get back to normal and I was only taking it for a few days.",False,True

Whenever I take it I wake up the next morning feeling very much like a bottomless pit. Like 2000 cals in granola bars before I'm even awake. Shit sucks, but who needs sleep?",False,False

Not only did I gain 60+ pounds in half a year, it put me in an endless mental breakdown, I started self harming again, I nearly committed suicide on several occasions, it made sex really painful. Just unreal how badly it fucked up my life, ruined relationships etc. It permanently changed me as a person.  If it actually improved my life and did what I was taking it for, which was to relieve crippling anxiety and terror of getting pregnant, I bet the weight gain wouldn't have been such an issue. But I just couldn't handle it on top of the mental instability. If I started taking antidepressants that actually fixed my depression then I wouldn't be nearly as fixated on my weight/appearance I don't think.",False,False
