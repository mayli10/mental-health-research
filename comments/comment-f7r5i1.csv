I own old clothes that fit at my current size, I just can't stand the idea of being on display like that.   My workaround has been leggings + oversized cardigan. And a bulky scarf. That hides everything down to the knees while using existing pieces of clothing.   If you can muster up the energy to go thrifting, cardigans and roomy sweaters should be easy to find.",False,False
