If he‚Äôs been doing it for a year and a half and hasn‚Äôt stopped? You‚Äôre underweight and struggling with an eating disorder and he knows this so he‚Äôs clearly doing it on purpose. He‚Äôs not going to stop doing it, so your only options are to deal with it or break up with him.   Idk about the rest of your relationship, but imo this sounds like just the tip of the iceberg:( hope that you find the respect, support, care and love you deserve some day &lt;3",False,False
