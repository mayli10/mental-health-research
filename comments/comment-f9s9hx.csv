I hated puberty, hated how much attention they got me being an early developer. Suddenly my body became a sexual object.   The ED hates them because they're just useless bags of fat.

And now, I just hate them because I'm not happy having female secondary sexual characteristics full stop. I wear binders but I still have to see them in the shower. I still have to buy bras.   At my apparent set point BMI of 22-23 they're around an F, so not bad enough to need a reduction for health reasons.
