I know that their only attraction to me is my body whereas with people I have a crush on are because I like who they are as a whole and not just judging by first appearances.. like with strangers I feel it reflects on my looks and with people I know I can put my weight aside.. i know its fucked but?,False,True

There’s a difference between what this post is saying and something that’s more along the lines of “I’ve noticed all the guys hitting on me are in larger bodies. That’s upsetting me and I wonder why.” Because that’s about self and not about others and that’s where the support should be. But I also think calling people out on fatphobia, racism, heterosexism, etc. is supportive because it gives opportunities to identify areas of growth. EDs are so pervasive and we all know they can really affect our relationships with others. Pointing out things like this can help you notice maybe how your ED gets into the way you relate with others and if the ED is influencing how you view people in larger bodies, I think that’s important to be aware of. And maybe these conversations should be approached in a different way, but we need to be having them in order to support each other",False,False

It can be triggering to overweight people to see this. It’s still an ED-based thought though which could potentially be discussed. I’d like to assume people on here arent against a particular group of people so maybe a trigger warning would’ve sufficed.. i dont think we should be completely blocking off someone’s thoughts. Everything is already pretty fucked up for all of us. But yeah no i agree for sure. Love and support eachother all the way. Much like we should support OP :),False,False

It’s saying “Only men of size hit on me, and that’s bad, but it wouldn’t be a bad thing if these guys were in smaller bodies.” Like, that’s fatphobic. And I get ED thoughts are fucking rough rough. I get the focus on weight can leak into other areas of your life, but it doesn’t mean you have to be fatphobic. Acknowledging that bias and working on it is a good first step. Even if you don’t believe it for yourself, don’t project internalized fatphobia on others. Because the thing is, there’s people of all sizes everywhere and people of all sizes on this sub. For this to be a truly safe, inclusive, and supportive space fatphobia has to go.",False,False

And being hit on by someone of a bigger size for me could reflect as oh maybe im overweight too. ED thoughts are weird. Doesnt mean anyone’s fatphobic.,False,False
