It's gotten to the point where I straight up tell people it's an allergy (kinda lying but I really will have a miserable time if I eat it). Makes people a lot less likely to keep bringing your weird food habits up/commenting on everything. ,False,False

Of course its nice to have less symptoms. But i feel so fake. If someone is offering me something to eat and i say i cant eat it because 'xxx allergy' it feels like i am one of the fake Gluten diet girls. Do you know what i mean? I am never ill. I am strong. I just feel like shit Everyday which nobody can 'see'. So i get bitched at '*eyrolling*just say youre on a diet' 'dont lie' 'taste it before you deny it'  And now, one more thing i have to think about. Basically a friend asked me a few days 'what the heck do you even eat'   And i feel awful because of that. But Yeah, i will stick to it. Thanks for replying! ",False,True

Also I forgot to add: If you can afford it, Health Food stores are your new BFF. Loads of natural and special diet options, and you won't look out of place reading food labels, everyone there is prolly a little disordered lol. ",False,False

I ended up having to cut out a lotttt of safe foods as well BUT I started feeling 7394% better. You haven't lived life until you have gone one (1) whole day without an angry stomach and immune system.  Additionally, as I cut out the problematic foods from my diet, I had way more energy to study and work out, and I developed some healthier, lower-cal safe foods.  Every once in a while I'll freak and eat alllllll the forbidden foods, and the hell i go through for the next 72 hours are enough to stop me from doing that again for ~6 months.   It definitely sux and it may feel impossible at first to find something you can eat, but it gets easier!!  And it's totally worth it to start feeling just a bit healthier again! âœ¨ ",False,False
