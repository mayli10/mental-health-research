Like that's still a moral judgement but maybe a slightly more understandable one? Lol?",False,False

It's not even weird to throw up at a bar bathroom. Ppl are drunk. Ppl puke when they're drunk sometimes. I don't even have to be super drunk, 2 glasses of wine makes me nauseated.           Don't worry about it OP. She's just a bitch.",False,False
