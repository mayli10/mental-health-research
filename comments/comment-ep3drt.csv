It has some funny moments and definitely explores some interesting themes re: mental illness, death/grief, sexuality and gender. So that’s neat!  The aforementioned protagonist ends up in a huge age-gap relationship though. I really like her partner’s character overall and how he’s handled in a lot of ways, but he’s supposed to be like...22...while she’s supposed to be like? 45?  They are both adults of course (and it’s portrayed as a really wonderful relationship), but I feel like there’s still a lot of development happening for most people in their early twenties (??). And I feel like that’s kind of glossed over or something, which doesn’t sit well with me personally :/ I don’t know.  It’s also not super plot-driven—and there are a lot of sporadic flashback scenes, like time jumps around lot. It’s done pretty well so it’s not hard to follow, but I still can’t decide if I like that or hate it, haha.",False,True
