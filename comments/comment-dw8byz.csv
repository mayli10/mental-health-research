I had a cardiologist appt last month where I wore a holter monitor for 2 days but !! Ofc !! Nothing !! Happened !! During those 2 days !! No palpitations, chest pains, NOTHING.   I’m fine I think, I’ve noticed that after long hours of exercise my palpitations come back but since I took 2 weeks off (trip), they went away 🤔 Either way, I think you’ll be ok!! If I were you, I’d try to set up an appt again, fuck what ur family says bro. This is your HEALTH we’re talking about",False,False

I’m not even underweight so I think I’ve hacked it. But I eat like 1500 cal a day so I don’t think it’s bc of restricting.,False,False

Like, with hard core endurance athletes, RHRs in the 40s is not uncommon. The difference with ED people is that when we’re asked to stand up and walk across the room, HR will jump way high. Cuz the endurance athlete’s RHR is low because the heart is strong+efficient. ED RHR is low because the heart is riding the struggle bus. And that can happen at quite a range of weights...not exclusively at super low weights.   Anxiety can also have powerful physical symptoms. I don’t have panic attacks myself, but I’ve talked to folks who have, and quite a few of them went to the ER because they thought they were dying. Physically, it’s “just” a panic attack, but the experience is not “just” anything. It’s a lot to deal with. I’m diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder...so basically a low-grade anxiety attack a big chunk of the time. I found some help from buspar (unlike the benzo meds which are taken as-needed in crisis, this one is non-addictive and taken daily to build up in your system) and have found lots of help from therapy (slowly).",False,False

Been to the ER twice, two ekgs and everything is “fine”. But I look at my Apple Watch and it says my resting heart rate is 55 bpm and my lowest for the day is 48. Every day I wake up convinced I’m going to die, I stay by my moms side 24/7, I don’t even sleep in my own bed anymore. They put me on anxiety meds but said they’ll take 6-12 weeks to kick in “but since you’re so small it’ll probably only take 6.” I’d recommend making an appointment with a PCP and just get checked out to put yourself at some ease. I hope you feel better soon, it’s a terrible feeling to think every day is going to be your last.",False,False
