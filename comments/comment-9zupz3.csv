I really can't, but lucky me I don't indulge in eating even if I think about it. I just find techniques to not be near food.   I stay in the bath for HOURS just to avoid going to the kitchen. I stay in my room instead of in the living room. I go shopping or stay at work late.   Brushing teeth somewhat works for me, even though you can do it only 3 times a day before it starts to damage your teeth.   Cleaning, exercising, tidying. There is just so much to do to delay the time you'll be eating. Imagine, if you get hunger signal every two hour, but then you don't eat for another 3 hours you can delay it more and more with training.   Another solution is to actually eat when you want to. A very small portion. Eat what you're craving. But just one bite. Then do the delay thing again. This is for snacks, try to eat your meals at regular hours, so your body will be used to eating at those times and not in between :) ",False,False

Something that requires all of your brainpower/focus AND both hands, so you're not tempted to munch while playing. For me, that's Civ 5.   A healthier call might be to just get away from the food for a little while, if you can. Go for a walk or a drive, and don't take your money/cards with you.",False,False
