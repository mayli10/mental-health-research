Gaining might make you want to restrict again, and lowering your goal just makes this continue. I think being at maintanence will give you a change to assess your body, relax your eating and see how you feel about it all.",False,False

See if it makes you feel different mentally. I know I did that and it seemed like my hormones kicked back into gear and I felt great.,False,False

I hit my lowest weight about a month ago and then started on this insane period of binge eating that has made me gain 10 pounds in the last month. Even though I know that it's only 10 pounds, I FEEL like I'm as big as I was at my highest. I know that it's just my body in survival mode right now but I've literally been praying for the ability for the hardcore restricting to return. It's an awful cycle and I wish you peace.",False,False

But i was so frustrated that in the end I gained weight to 115lbs... But when I looked back at photos of myself with 94-95lbs, I saw a slim figure and just wished I'd stayed that weight. Now I am 101lbs and slowly trying to reach 95lbs again, but even though I see that I lose weight, I'm (again!!) not happy with my body and won't be at my goal weight. It's ridiculous   This downward spiral just sucks and I feel you.",False,False
