So the longer you go without washing your hair, the more it will look like you're losing when you do wash it. Case in point, once the weather got colder, I shifted to washing my hair less often and at first I was like 'Holy shit I'm going bald!' but then I realized that I'm kind of 'saving up' all the natural shedding and washing it out all at once.   It's totally normal but also terrifying.",False,False

Honestly when I don‚Äôt wash my hair or don‚Äôt brush it for a couple of days (curlyish hair fml) I loose SO much when I do wash it. It can be completely shocking so please be kind to yourself when you do hop in the shower.

It's partially depression or whatever but honestly I'm just lazy and I notice no terrible effects.   Anyway sorry about the hair loss, please consider tinkering with your vitamin/mineral sources.

Try to be kind to yourself lovely. Brush your hair before you shower to minimize shedding in the shower. Prioritize protein when you do eat to give your hair some nutrients. Spend some time massaging your scalp while you apply shampoo to help stimulate hair follicles.   I have waist length hair and I've lost about half of my hair volume twice (once because of an iron deficiency and once because of a medication, but both times my bmi was very very low). For me it did grow back. Yours can come back. And it always felt worse for me than it looked. Remember some shedding is normal. ",False,False

I'm sorry you know what it is, it hurts. And being anxious about also must hurt.   It's unfair particularly because one also forgets how good a shower can feel. Clean. Fluffy towel. Fresh face. Everything a bit more free and certainly less greasy. You deserve this. You deserve the best, post-spa, steamed and warm and cared for and safe and calm feeling. Everything candlelight.   Please try it. Light some candles in your bathroom, put on some music, make sure you're using a new towel, bust out all your stash of products. Have a really gentle and caring clean. You deserve peace and gentleness ! I send hearts üíï",False,False
