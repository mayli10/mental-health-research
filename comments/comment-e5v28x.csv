But tbh, i am at a point where i am willjng to do that if it guarantees me being skinny for the rest of my life  Idk if that really helped u, i wish i could cheer you up but i am having a highkey terrible day (cried while walking my dog who dis) But honestly tho; if you are really having suicidal thoughts i recommend reaching out for help.Yes, i dont know you and i have never met you but i really dont want you to die. Stay save, hoping that both of us will feel better about ourselves soon",False,False
