Because their potassium was too low.  See a doctor! Get some blood work done! (RN with ED here so sorry if Iâ€™m lecturing haha),False,False

Itâ€™s especially bad in my ribcage and happens when I lose weight really rapidly.  I have a genetic connective tissue disorder tho (Ehlers Danlos Syndrome) where my body codes crappy collagen essentially. Idk what low restriction does alongside that, but yeah, joint pain galore.   (Any way of determining if yours is more muscle pain or more joint pain? More potassium, if itâ€™s muscle, is a good bet. Are you getting enough salt and other electrolytes?)",False,False

Has happened with my lowest weights for 10+ yrs. I can always feel it at night. Ironically it's a sick way I know I'm at a 'safe' (mentally) weight.,False,False

Even if you don't get enough calories getting all of your required nutrients is a must. My first thought is that your potassium is probably low. Only 5% of people get enough potassium in their diet so while restricting you almost definitely don't get enough. Potassium is important for brain and muscle health. A quarter teaspoon of potassium citrate powder might be enough to help, but you should be careful when taking any supplement. Make sure that you need it before you buy any.",False,False
