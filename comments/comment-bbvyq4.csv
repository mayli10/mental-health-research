The owner was so proud of him and at one point she said ""it's all about taking big goals and breaking them down into tiny steps"". And for some reason that is resonating with me so much. I don't need to fix everything wrong with me all at once. I can't expect to wake up tomorrow and just have a healthy relationship with food. It's okay to take small steps, just like that hardworking lil pup  The irony is not lost on me that a weight loss story is inspiring me to better my eating issues lmao",False,False
