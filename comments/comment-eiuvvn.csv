It sounds like your normal pattern right now, at least most of the time, is 'eat a normal meal then binge.' So although the thoughts are annoying, feel strong, and feel awful, they are just *thoughts*. It IS possible to create new neural pathways in which you eat a meal and don't think about bingeing. I've been trying to stop bingeing for several years now and I still get the thoughts too --- but with some practice they will happen with lessening frequency. It really is the first few days that are the hardest. So distract yourself now until they go away.",False,False

I can't take your pain away but I can relate to the painful words that you heard. I have 2 stories to lament about with you:  1) A few years ago, a guy I was seeing ""guessed"" my weight (I honestly forget how we even got on the topic.. or why anyone thinks it'd be a good idea to guess someone's weight), and the weight he guessed was almost 60 lbs higher than what I weighed at the time. I was a healthy weight, on the low end. I chalked it up to complete idiocy on his part, but I still think about it to this day and I still don't trust what I look like at times.  2) I was also overweight as a pre-teen, and my mom has this one picture of me from my highest weight as a magnet on her fridge. I hate it but she loves it, so whatever. Her boyfriend saw it one day when I was over at her place, and said ""Wow, you used to be a *lot* bigger."" Like yeah, thanks.
