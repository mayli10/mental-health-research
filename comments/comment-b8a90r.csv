I honestly find it hilarious watching the bodybuilder *men* struggle when I can hit 10k in a fraction of the time it takes them. Like Jeff Nippard's 10k Challenge he was struggling so bad he started adding coconut oil to his milkshakes to ""sneak in"" extra calories and it took him well into the night to hit the mark.

It‚Äôs scary to think that I could probably crush 20k if I added in alcohol and lots of high-density sugary things AND peanut butter. Plus maybe some deep-fried Chinese food items for good measure. And a couple pints of Ben and Jerry‚Äôs.   .....why does that actually sound like so much funü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è and this is why I need to keep up my no-binge streak. ,False,False
