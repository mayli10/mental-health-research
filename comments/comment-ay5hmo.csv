Idk, some people like to keep it secret, and I mostly do too, but when I am in a bad place it feels good to talk to my partner and I know he wouldn't get it unless I straight up told him what was going on and that it was serious, just because he doesn't know what it's like.   If you're feeling this low and you already feel like you want to talk about it, I think it would be good to straight up tell your partner and also clarify how bad it is making you feel. Mine is also clueless and even if I was like 'oh I'm not eating today because I feel fat' he would just be like 'ok whatever you want but there's food if you want it' unless I actually sat him down and told him it was a restricting problem and I was having a serious issue.  I feel lonely a lot too because I also have a permanent wall up but I have been trying to talk more to people lately and it is scary but totally feels good, even though I feel bad when I say something stupid sometimes.
