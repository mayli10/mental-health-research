My weight is up by a couple pounds, but my body fat is down and my muscle mass is up. I keep trying to remind myself about muscle being denser than fat (ie I’m technically smaller) and that I actually prefer how I look now (abs for days) but the attachment to the low number is fiercely strong.",False,False

Also the weight gain might just be water retention in your muscles (healing those micro tears) if you’re new to working out.,False,False
