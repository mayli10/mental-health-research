I don't know why, but Taurus in general seems to get the short end of the stick in any kind of astrology meme??   And honestly, I can't even enjoy astrology as a fun game anymore, bc where I live there is a large subset of people who take it really literally, and will straight-up say things like, ""You're a Scorpio? Fuck you,"" and not in a joking way. I don't want to reinforce your fears or anything, but some people really do stereotype others based on star sign, and it completely sucks. My main solution is to avoid people who might do this (although of course I can't avoid my own mom).",False,False

I'm also a Taurus, and I literally get freaked out by this too.   But at the same time, I realize that the obsessed w food is kind of true because now I'm literally so obsessed with eating as minimally as possible? Like I'm constantly stressed over calories.

I'm also a Taurus, so whenever I see posts associated with food, I always get so fucking triggered. It's ridiculous because if you actually are into astrology, you know there's more to the sign than those stereotypes and there's also the whole astral map to consider, however I can't shake those thoughts away and the shame that takes over me whenever I read those posts. What I would advise you to do was either try to mute all posts about astrology or dive into astrology and read your whole chart - you might identify with some other placements better/learn more about your sun sign, beyond the stereotypes. Stay strong!",False,False

But if astrology was real then I think Geminiâ€™s would have a DUALITY rather than two facedness. A duality being there are two clear strong parts within Gemini but neither of them are necessarily negative. Kinda like Troy Bolton where heâ€™s a basketball player and a singer and everyone was like â€˜woah you canâ€™t be both those things how unexpected!â€™ And Troy was just like â€˜babes Iâ€™m a Geminiâ€™ and everyone was like â€˜ohhhhhh!

You are your own person, and you get to own your own life. I know it's not amazing advice, but I hope it helps. All the best to you, OP.",False,False
