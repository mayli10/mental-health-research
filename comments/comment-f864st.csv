Literally all the comments were like ‚Äúomg! So proud of you!‚Äù and anyone saying that it might be unhealthy got shut down. I really feel like the people that are overweight on there can get praised for some really unhealthy shit as long as they‚Äôre losing weight.,False,False

That definitely makes sense that that‚Äôs a number which makes sense for you based on your experience you shared. I think my big quip with that subreddit is less that it‚Äôs not valid necessarily but that I think it‚Äôs bad for people who are taller like you said. :( I mean for me I just wanted to start a diet and LoseIt gave me that number and then I spiraled into an eating disorder.   I will definitely hear of like 5‚Äô5‚Äù women on there and that‚Äôs definitely too low for them and some people definitely under estimate their activity levels.,False,False

With my sedentary lifestyle my TDEE is 1200 (if we‚Äôre high balling)   That being said, the majority of the population is nowhere near as short as me! For you, 1200 is definitely most likely low restricting. For people like me, it‚Äôs borderline normal CICO eating.   I don‚Äôt think 1200 is even for obese people or normal sized people. It‚Äôs designed for very petite women who have sedentary lives. Not all women or female presenting people can sustain themselves on 1200 a day. Most women need much more than that.

Struggling with those things doesn‚Äôt mean they have a lifelong or chronic eating disorder, but unhealthy and overly restrictive dieting is still.. something. Like I legit see girls who are UW or extremely close to it and honestly unhealthy looking being gassed up on weight loss subs. Even when they admit to basically starving to lose weight. The line between normal dieting and disordered behaviors is basically nonexistent just based on.. certain popular diet subs.
