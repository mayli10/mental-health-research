I made a plan for a pretty big breakfast (yogurt, oats, walnuts, and fruit + meal replacement shake) which is like 60% of my calories for the day then I have a smaller meal later (&gt;30%) and maybe use leftover calories for a beverage. Although I did this because I just started taking amphetamines and they suppress my appetite",False,False
