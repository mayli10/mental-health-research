When I was in middle school, a ‚Äúpopular‚Äù guy came up and asked me out. I hesitated for a moment, because I didn‚Äôt really like him romantically but I wanted to be nice. I ended up saying ‚ÄúYeah, sure‚Äù and smiling.   He starts laughing hysterically, and goes: ‚ÄúYou really thought I‚Äôd ask you out? Why would I want to date somebody as fugly as you.‚Äù And then walked off, back to his mates who were also laughing.   Absolutely destroyed me and I‚Äôve never really recovered. Before that, I didn‚Äôt think about attractiveness or how that correlated to my value as a person, but I certainly did afterwards.   I now cannot accept compliments, and always believe there‚Äôs an ulterior motive such as: wanting something from me, or trying to pull some sort of joke.",False,False
