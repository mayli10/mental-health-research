I'm not saying that a sympathise with a sadistic murderer, but if I hear one more guy congratulating me for being a 'woman who actually eats' while meaning 'a woman who can look like I stuff my face with burgers and pizza all day without every gaining weight' I am going to go live off the land in Wyoming and never speak to another soul again apart from my chickens and maybe a lizard or smth.",False,False

Which is great if that's what you want but a lot of people don't understand that not everyone wants that. I'm tall and my natural body shape is not curvy--it's very straight and that's okay. I don't look good when I do workouts meant to enhance/tone curves. Never have even before my ED.  Just because it's in style to have a small waist and big hips doesn't mean it's bad to do workout that minimize hips. I noticed this because I've started doing some workouts meant to cut down on your hip/thigh measurements (after I noticed my thighs getting bigger from other exercises). The videos get a bunch of comments shaming the girls for being boxy etc! They fail to realize that not everyone has a curvy body and is not suited to one either. It's okay to workout to increase your curves and it's okay to workout in ways that avoid bulking like that. One is not better than the other,False,False

He admitted it‚Äôs true! Guys like the fit tiny body without knowing how girls get there. They don‚Äôt want the mood swings from starving or seeing you cry over your weight.. they just want you to look like that. Knowing this used to trigger me but it doesn‚Äôt anymore.

I‚Äôm just starting to realize this myself and be honest with the people who I trust and it has gone totally not how I expected.  For example: last night my friend who I haven‚Äôt seen in a while texts me asking to hang out soon. I could have done as I usually do and said an excuse about this weekend but instead I said ‚ÄúI haven‚Äôt been feeling social lately bcs I‚Äôm on a diet for Costa Rica‚Äù.......after I hit send I was like oh no oh no ... wth was I thinking? But all she said was make fun of me that my boyfriend can see me now ..... it was no big deal at all. And it felt amazing.   I think to change the diet culture we need to be able to be honest with those around us first. Barring anxious worried people, those people around you who you trust can handle your truth and if they can‚Äôt...ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è maybe you need new ppl around ",False,False
