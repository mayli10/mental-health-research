Iirc PMS is caused by the hormonal instability caused by your testosterone spiking. Hormone instability is definitely something I'm familiar with from when I first started taking hormones and my body had to adjust, but I'm not sure that the symptoms would be the same because I was experiencing lower-than-average testosterone for the time while cis girls during PMS are experiencing higher than average testosterone. I believe that crying a lot easier is a symptom you experience whichever way you're going, but that's the only one I recall which would occur in both cases. From my understanding of sex hormones I believe that you can potentially have a large enough spike in testosterone to experience PMS while not meeting the conditions for menstruation, so it does make sense from my outside, non-expert perspective that it should be possible.",False,False
