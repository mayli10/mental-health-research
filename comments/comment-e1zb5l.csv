I also like roasting root vegetables or veggie-packed pasta salad for meals. I get low blood sugar and pressure really easily so I gravitate towards carbs. I also need lots of fruit and vegetables for potassium cuz I purge daily.,False,False

I feel like going out of my way to eat an easily logged breakfast muffin would be a bit much/too off of my usual routine for me, but I tend to subsist off of toast or ‚Äúsandwiches‚Äù (2 slices of bread = 200 calories, plus toppings or fillings, rounds to a good 300!) or fruit, or rice thins. I‚Äôm vegan too and like 90% of my diet is carbs. My main safe foods that aren‚Äôt just carbs would probably be protein bars or shakes tbh lol. Also vegetables are pretty safe but weighing them out to cook something low cal is stressful! I also actually eat PB!!",False,False
