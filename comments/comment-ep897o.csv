Literally the only item i remember someone buying in my entire time being there was the man who bought forty-seven jars of cookie butter. Upon a bemused look (unintentional on my part) he said they were for his underground bunker.   Anyway, the moral of this is- they likely remember you because you're friendly and you're often there, not because of the things you buy.",False,False

So that's probably what they remember about you - that they like talking to you while you're going through their line.   They seriously don't care about your eating habits.
