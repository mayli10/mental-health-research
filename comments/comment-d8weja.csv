I tell people I'm on keto (which I usually am 99% of the time, with a cheat day 2 times a month) which thankfully lets me hang out with them without having to order any food. Lying about being vegan also helps for people you dont know super well (like study groups), but it might not help if seeing the food is triggering for you.   Also, super unethical protip, but if you have ocd like a lot of ed people (including myself) and you're terrified of ordering non-sugar/non-carb drinks at coffee shops, just tell them that you're type one diabetic and also get blood sugar spikes from artificial sweeteners. It's super shitty of me, and I feel really bad, but it works so Â¯\_(ãƒ„)_/Â¯",False,False

Itâ€™s so hard when every social event seems to revolve around food! Maybe joining an activity or group would be fun? I know, there will probably be social eating even if you join a yoga or book club, but at least it wouldnâ€™t be the main purpose?      I feel for you though, this time of year is difficult anyway (Halloween candy all over the place already). Hope you feel better and get more comfortable as you settle into the year",False,False
