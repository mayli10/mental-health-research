It will take her some time to get used to her new body, but I’m sure she has a bit of body image issues considering so many influencers are tiny and shredded.",False,False

Nobody maintains a healthy weight at such high calories. 3000 is totally reasonable yes but 5000 no way. She's so hungry all the time because she still eats shit food with little to no nutrition. She needs to find a more balanced diet with the occasional treats/junk. She lives off carbs which arent actually essential because the body can make it through protein and fat which are essential.,False,False

It is VERY obvious that she had disordered habits.   This ""all in"" she is doing .....is eating disorder recovery. Her calling is ""all in"" really baffled me because she refused to call it what it really was.   Maybe she genuinely doesn't know, or is just in denial. But her boyfriend knows a lot about nutrition science and I think in their FAQ they did together....you can see on his face that he really knows the truth.   I'm happy that she is happy now but I really wish she wouldn't have tapped dance around what was really going on.",False,False

She also talks about her feelings very often on her IG stories and made it pretty clear in her update videos (remember the clip of her crying because of the bathing suit? It was one of her first videos on the topic). I find her journey inspiring and brave. I used to follow her but stopped watching during recovery because her physique was so lean and perfect it was extremely triggering for me, making me want to relapse- I started following her again after she went All In because I was extremely curious about the whole process. If you’ve ever been obsessed with how you look, whether because of an ED or because you competed in body building shows ecc it takes so much courage to intentionally gain weight and look at yourself in the mirror every day acknowledging that. I could never do it.",False,False

Like she probably ate 5000 cal for a couple months but is back down to maintenance. Hyperphagia is well documented in recovery from EDs.   That is what recovery from an ED can look like. It’s not all quasi recovered skinny legends becoming skinny legends with bigger boobs. She looks like a healthy, normal weight woman (which takes many forms). And yeah, part of recovery is sort of faking it because it’s a motherfuck.",False,False

I don’t remember if it was the same Q&amp;A video where they discussed it, but Jeff told about his feelings relating to food and it sounded like it could’ve come from my mouth. It was honestly incredible, and in a way SUPER validating.",False,False

So idk what it was” and in my head I was like ???? Not saying she’s secretive or sneaking to eat food, but I live w my husband and he has no idea when I’m eating in secret. Like he could be sleeping, showering, just not home etc so Jeff really wouldn’t be 100% certain she wasn’t. But yeah, she definitely has ED tendencies but will never admit to being restrictive then binging.",False,False

I think the smile is fake only in the sense that she has to be strong bc it’s a difficult process and she’s trying her hardest to be positive. I am forever in awe of her, I can’t imagine gaining that much weight and not only documenting all of it but showing it to potentially millions of people. She’s trying to stay positive for herself and all of the people watching and going through something similar. Almost like saying, yes it’s hard, and look at how my body is changing, but I am still choosing to fight and be happy. (I also think her bf is an amazing support system and makes her happy)  I think she’s brave for doing what she’s doing. And yes, eating so much seems at the other extreme end of the spectrum but in a way i think it’s good mentally. We so often put this idea of good and bad foods and amounts and it’s like she’s breaking all rules, saying yes to all foods and any amount. Might not seem like the healthiest thing in the world but I think mentally, one will get to a point where things balance out. Hunger is often a mental thing as well.  I don’t think I’ll ever be as strong as her, but in a way, I watch her with amazement and fear bc she live out what i could only dream of doing, not giving a shit about anyone or anything and doing what feels right.  She’s very intelligent. and i think she’s trying to do this in the most healing way possible. she’s talked to experts, turned to scientific studies, etc. I think she’s better off than she was before.",False,False

Eating as much as she wants to restore weight and fix her reactive hunger.   I personally think she looks amazing right now. Hard to see her talk about feeling like a beached whale when to me she looks strong and healthy. The fact that she gained 40lbs and looks great shows how bad and underweight she was before. I hope she learns to be comfortable in her new body.,False,False
