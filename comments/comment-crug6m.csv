When she first came down with it a couple years ago, I scoured the internet for as much information as I could find.  I ordered the two small books I could find online. Sadly, there didn't seem to be much definitive, concrete info available.  I did read several case stories, and even a physician written paper/thesis.  Anyway, several people had shared the nightmare cases of loved ones who were denied SSDI after receiving a WKS diagnosis. I guess since the majority of WKS patients got the disease as a result of thiamine deficiency due to chronic alcoholism, it wasn't covered under SSDI. I am not an expert on WKS by any means, but I can tell you there are several horror stories of insurance denying claims and disability claims being denied to WKS sufferers. I would hate for something similar to happen to your friend, so just a heads up, something you might want to look in to before trying to get her officially diagnosed with WKS.  My sister's doctor who handled her paperwork never actually wrote down an official WKS diagnosis, lucky for my sister/ our family so she hasn't been denied her insurance/ disability.  Again, not an expert, just someone who has seen how bad WKS can be, and would hate to hear about another person denied benefits because of a WKS diagnosis. Best of luck to your friend and to you.",False,False

If she has been not eating enough for a long time that will also lead to critically low thiamine levels. Which then leads to korsakoffs as well. Very sad but it looks like this is the case. Guide her into finding help,False,False

If she is shy and reserved, I imagine she'd feel very intruded upon if you confront her with your non-professional diagnoses. Her memory loss could be caused by a number of things, but that's for her to discuss with her doctor. I think it'd be fair to bring up SSDI, but making other assumptions when she hasn't opened up to you would be crossing a line.",False,False
