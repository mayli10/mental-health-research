I've been thinking of you and I'm really grateful you took the time and energy to reply.   I completely understand your concern about the ambulance being called. That's definitely a valid. Have you heard about the Samaritan group? They offer confidential support via phone and their policy for connecting authorities is a lot more relaxed. They are based in the UK and have a few independent branches in the US.   I also know of an online confidential support chat at www.IMAlive.org. They have limited hours but I hear they also don't contact authorities.   Generally, national hotlines will not contact the police or ambulance unless you state that you are in immediate danger or are planning to kill yourself presently. Feeling suicidal or having a future plan will not warrant a call immediately. If you state that you just want to talk and are not in immediate danger, they should let you chat without contacting authorities.  I hope one of those options will be helpful. The fact that you've considered calling at all is respectable (as  are your concerns). Again, thank you for responding and if you have any other questions or want to chat, I'm here. I'm not a professional, but I do care about your well-being, so I'll do the best I can.",False,False

It's so disheartening that we are inevitably bombarded with internal and external ideas on how to acquire ""worth"", but it really is true that we ultimately don't owe shit to anyone or need to prove that we deserve to be treated with kindness and respect.    The difference between someone you deem worthy and yourself may lie mostly in the fact that feeling worthless can both unable us from seeing that we have some of these ""worthy"" traits ourselves *and* stop us from developing more traits that make us like ourselves better.   I know it's repetitive, kind of contradicting and something you've probably heard and thought countless of times before, but in the end, our feelings about ourselves or others don't prove an inherent worth or unworth, and I hope reminding yourself of that can lessen those difficult feelings a little bit. Just being alive and going at our own pace are truly enough.",False,False
