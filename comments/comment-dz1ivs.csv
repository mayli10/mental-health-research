My husband has gained a lot of weight over the past few years...he is weight lifting and seems to bulk a lot but never cut. I wouldn't say I'm repulsed by him, but it does trigger me just how much he eats and how okay he is with gaining weight. He will complain sometimes that he is looking chunky, but he has no interest in counting calories or watching what he eats. It's just maddening. I'm 5'1 and currently obese, and I gained all that weight from eating way less than he does. Now I feel like I want to teach him the science of like...eat less, lose weight, not complain about weight gain. It's a weird thing that I know is more about me than him, but it still triggers me.",False,False

Eating disorders greatly distort our perspective which can lead us into thinking thoughts about our loved ones that we'd never, ever want to feel normally. Your ed is working against you and damaging your relationship, you both deserve to feel loved and safe.",False,False
