Like I know my face is pleasant and symmetrical, but I wish I was super tall &amp; skinny slender delicate or if not that - skinny enough with a *very obvious* hourglass figure or something. Or I wish I had super shiny blowout hair or striking eyes or a bee-stung mouth or just anything **exceptional**.",False,False

Back at the old sub after I lost 40lbs I was starting to get confident! My face that I thought resembled a potato was a lot more defined and decently pretty. However now i‚Äôm at my highest weight ever. Knowing how good I COULD look is what motivates me :(,False,False

When I had Instagram, it was almost comical how just about all of my selfies were the exact same angle, only showing my face, nothing more. I‚Äôd rather die than post a full-body picture of myself.   And also, this is hella relatable. Like even if I don‚Äôt like my body or what I look like, I think I‚Äôm conventionally attractive, and I too dream of the day that I‚Äôm not hidden in layers of fat",False,False

I think I have so much potential to be q bombshell. I have nice cheekbones, decently tall at 5‚Äô7.5, and I‚Äôm currently a size 2/4. But damn if I cleared up my skin, got jaw surgery, and became a size zero it‚Äôs game over, I‚Äôd be so hot I don‚Äôt know what I would do with myself. But currently what I see in the mirror isn‚Äôt how I wish I could see myself as. That definitely contributes to my body dysmorphia. I‚Äôm trying to love myself more everyday by confronting what‚Äôs actually in front of the mirror, not obsessing or avoiding it. My reflection doesn‚Äôt fully encompass me and I know when people meet me they see me for my whole being not just a flat personality or a skinny body (which btw I don‚Äôt even think I‚Äôm skinny anymore).",False,False
