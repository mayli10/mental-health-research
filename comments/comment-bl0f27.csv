I have the mentality of an anorexic but I haven't relapsed in years. I want to but I don't let myself and I hate myself. But then again I have BDD.,False,False

It doesn't matter what kind of food you binge on or how many calories it totals, it's the lack of control, feeling like you can't stop. You can binge on salad. Conversely you can eat 2k kcal worth of cookies and have it NOT be a binge if you consciously choose to do it.  I feel like this sometimes too, but I remind myself that I'm not here saying I have this or that specific ED or claiming experiences or identities I don't have. I am here to find support and coping mechanisms for my own disordered/binge eating behaviours and reading about people's similar experiences and what helps them. Neither of us are claiming anything, we're just responding to our own patterns of behaviour, and this is the community that best understands them.   Honestly, I feel like most users here with diagnosed EDs would be thrilled to think other users who don't have ""full"" EDs yet might come here and be encouraged not to go down the same path as them.",False,False

Some days I understand this and it makes me realise I should try and seek help. Other days I don't feel 'skinny enough' or 'ill enough' so I totally feel invalid in this sub and don't feel like I can ask for any professional help.

The most important part is the feeling that you don’t have control over it. My most recent binge was a tub of pineapple. it was a completely normal amount, but i couldn’t stop myself from eating it so i considered it a binge. you may not feel like you are binging because it doesn’t seem like what other people are doing, but that doesn’t mean it isn’t. you do you boo.",False,False
