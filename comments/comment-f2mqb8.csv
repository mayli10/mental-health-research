My logical brain tells me that if I eat a reasonable portion then but only can I stay within my goals for the day but also can enjoy delicious thing for several days.  Then my stupid brain chimes in and points out that if I eat it ALL right now, then I will save those calories in coming days and don't have to think about that food any more.  Stupid brain usually wins.",False,False

But then I'll still give in later and buy MORE binge food... which if it's too much to finish continues the cycle.  OR I'll think hmmm I'll throw the rest out because I know myself and I'll binge if it's around... but even if I throw it out I'll buy more so just save it this time to save the money and I promise I won't binge for a few days...

I’ll buy packaged foods that I love, but have no intention of ever eating, and I’ll just hoard it? Like a dragon or something, I have whole box full of candy and stuff in my room bc having it around is super comforting to me, even though I’lol probably never eat it. I guess it makes me feel in control or something",False,False

Right now I have a box of low calorie ice cream sandwiches in my freezer and there are 3 left. I’m gonna try to only eat one tonight but I definitely get it in my head that it will be better to finish it all now so it won’t be a problem tomorrow. Except that I will probably buy another damn box once it’s gone, thus repeating the cycle. Make it make sense.",False,False
