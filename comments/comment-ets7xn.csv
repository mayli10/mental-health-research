My Male colleague told me he tried to fast for 3 days because on Sunday morning he would meet his family on a brunch. Or the other girls in my school where I went saying ""uh, I can't eat this. It's way too oily"". You know, what I mean? Some of them will get an eating disorder, some not. I just mean, so much people are trying to lose the weight they got from eating after Thanksgiving or Christmas (just water weight! You can't get 3 lbs of fat in 2 days!!!). Or the fitness industry trying to sell us ""more healthy"" things like protein/low fat chocolate milk or just protein shakes. The whole diet shit made so much people eating disordered.",False,False

I noticed Taylor was especially thin in her 1989 era but I honestly didn’t make the connection. At the time I used to idolise her street style so much. It didn’t even occur to me how thin someone would have to be to look thin from all angles on camera.  I only realised when my cousin became a news anchor. She’s 5”2’, and in person she’s extremely thin, like she’ll blow away. But somehow on camera she looked ‘normal and healthy’ (for lack of a better description). It was so trippy.",False,False
