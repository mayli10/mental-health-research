If I'm eating I want to be alone so I can focus entirely on the food. It's selfish and I hate it, but I don't want unwanted distractions.",False,False

I would see people eating like a sandwich or apple or something while walking down the street on their way or in the middle of doing something...and I’d be like “why?”   I can’t believe I didn’t realise all the conditions that have to be right for me to actually eat something.,False,False

As an anorexic, you view food as scarce. You see it as a commodity to be cherished and celebrated when it's around, rather than simple fodder. You have limited calories available and you don't want to waste it with food you don't like or doesn't taste good - if you have little food, it better at least taste great.  I used to eat pretty much anything that was edible before my ED (except melted cheese, ugh) and now I am an absolute princess around food. I hate it.",False,False

If I’m gonna eat pizza it’s gonna be from the best local Italian restaurant. Nachos? Homemade from scratch including the chips. Chocolate? Handcrafted truffles from a local chocolate factory. If I’m gonna eat, it’s gonna be fucking manna straight from heaven or I’ll pass, thanks.",False,False
