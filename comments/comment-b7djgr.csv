Maybe wheelchairs are just even more expensive where you live.  I'm definitely going to be living with new people soon since most of my roommates are graduating and none of them renewed their lease here (I also did not renew my lease here because I was hoping things would go smoother for me), but I haven't actually found a job yet so I don't know that I'll be able to move into the place I want any time soon.  Also, I wandered into the kitchen just now, completely forgot why as soon as I walked in there, but I noticed that my roommates actually cleaned all the stuff on the counters and did all the dishes in the sink! 😮 I mean, the table is still completely covered and nowhere else has been clean, but this is still an improvement. I think tonight, before they all wake up, that I'll clean the dishes I've been keeping in my room and then bring them back in when they're dry. Two of my plates were in the dry rack, so I'm already up a couple pieces of clean dishes :) I just have to make sure I remember to bring them back into my room before I leave for class, probably even before anyone gets up. It's already 4:40 AM though, so it would be best if I did that like right now.",False,False

I use a cane currently but I can’t make it far on the cane itself, a couple blocks is usually pushing it.   And I’m glad that you’ll soon live in a much better apartment with much better people! I have issues like that with my meds too, super frustrating to be given a medication that’s supposedly gonna help with something in my life but have to go incredibly out of the way to get it. That time itself is taxing on the body, it shouldn’t have to be this hard.   Yeah that’s also what I mean with the food. It’s also the planning that goes into it, Like what you wear and the setting and the people and how you’re feeling that day, etc. But especially messing up food, I just get pissed at myself and only cause more damage to my body, but it’s not like it’s super surprising that my EDs solution to fucking up is to fuck me up",False,True

I can't believe something so basic and so absolutely necessary for a lot of people with physical disabilities can cost so much. Like, at my worst I could hardly manage to walk from my bedroom and up a half-flight of stairs to my bathroom, but it's not like I couldn't just push myself to do it. I couldn't imagine not even being able to walk. That would be just ultimately frustrating.  You're definitely right about how everything just compounds together. Between my physical illness, my eating disorder, all of my other mental health problems, and even my allergies (dust and grass) things just get so difficult to manage. I've come a long way over the past few years, but lately I just feel like I can't do anything. I used to try to keep the house clean at a minimum, but my roommates are pigs. I clean the house and then two days later the sink is full, the dry rack is full, the counters are covered in dishes and garbage, the stove is covered in pots and pans, everything needs to be scrubbed down, there are empty cans and bottles of alcohol all over the place, the furniture in the living room is all messed up, all the shoes are in a pile by the front door instead of neatly placed onto the shoe rack (including my shoes which I put on the shoe rack for some reason), there's garbage all over the place, the garbage and recycling bins are overflowing (with the recycling bin it's almost always stacked high with pizza boxes), and despite there being dishes all of the place I somehow can never seem to find *my* dishes which means I can't even wash them and put them away in my bedroom for my own use. Of course, washing them isn't even a possibility with the sink being filled, so it's not like I could do that anyway.   I just want to move into this nice apartment building my friend lives in downtown and be done with all of this. She's not like a close friend, but we are both close with this one girl who was visiting from out of town and the two of them invited me over one day recently and I would flourish if I was living in that place. A two bedroom apartment costs $2500 per month plus utilities, but spiting that with a single roommate I could afford it with just $1 an hour over minimum wage based on my expenses. There's a dishwasher in each apartment, two bathrooms so I could have my own space and not have to worry about a roommate making a mess, there are rooms with gym equipment that residents could use, a pool and hot tub just for adult residents (I assume there's a separate pool that kids are allowed to use, but idk), there's a grocery store in the basement, and the area it's in would seriously boost my happiness. I love spending time in that part of the city, plus I would be much closer to this girl I like who lives on the opposite side of the city from me. A 2.5 hour trip would become under an hour. I would guess 30-45 minutes. Plus, she loves going downtown too, so we would probably mostly be meeting each other in different parts of the city, so like probably 15-20 minutes of travel for each of us. And it would be really close to the train station, so visiting my family in my home town wouldn't be such a hassle and I could visit more often. Even accessing health care would probably be easier. My current doctor works as one of two doctors in the health center on campus at my college and she only works two days per week because she also works at the other campuses. I attend the biggest campus though, so she's usually really busy on the days I can see her. There's also the fact that all of the specialists work downtown, so visiting them is a hassle. It takes me an average of an hour and a half to reach any of the offices I've been to. I also take a medication which isn't mass produced anymore (really not sure why since it's widely used for a number of common medical conditions as well as a few less common ones) so I have to go to a compounding pharmacy to get it. The pharmacy I go to called all kinds of places for me and apparently the only place I can actually get this medication is at one specific compounding pharmacy downtown. It takes me at least 45 minutes to get there from my current address. It's downtown, but near the edge of the downtown area and on the same side of the city that I live on, so fortunately that's not as huge of a hassle as it could be. It's hard to find work when you're a student with very little work experience though. I've been looking into entry level positions, especially ones which I could make use of skills I've already obtained in school, but most of them want somebody who has already graduated or they just have better candidates available because there are so many people downtown.  Oh, about what you said how you feel like garbage when you make food and it doesn't turn out right. One time I was really craving enchiladas because I haven't been able to find a good Mexican restaurant since I moved to this city that sells them, so I decided to make some of my own. I found a recipe online, but the ingredients were pricey so I substituted some cheaper ingredients that I like. I messed up every step of the process and knew that they would turn out bad, but they ended up being so much worse than I expected. I literally cried when I tasted them. I didn't cook for myself for over a month after that. It's been at least a year and I still think about it when I consider trying a new recipe, especially ones that require baking.",False,False

I have a lot of physical disability stuff going on, chronic pain and the infinite others, it really does effect EVERYTHING. I unfortunately am 99% bed bound until I can afford a wheelchair and also a car, so maybe never lol. But hopefully with the help of a new doctor who hasn’t actually agreed to take me on yet, I might be able to go back to work soon which is something I really desperately need.  My last couple rounds of roommates went very poorly. Probably something I shouldn’t really get into here, but it’s on a similar note. I totally understand that frustration too. With everything, my physical diagnoses, ED, mental, I like to have things preprepared and under control and when the people around me won’t allow me to have that, I just kinda break. And the kitchen thing, ugh. I have so many horror stories. Especially since I also have food allergies so it feels like they’ve contaminated my entire life. I also personally feel like garbage when I preprepared something and it doesn’t go how I planned it, so I break again. Sometimes it’s more noticeable than others, but when you’re already dealing with difficult shit, each blow is pretty hard ",False,True

I'm more comfortable with it now that my anorexia isn't so bad anymore, but sometimes I still prefer to eat alone. I've actually been trying to gain weight lately so I could be at a healthy BMI, but it turns out that I developed a problem which causes me to not absorb food properly so I just get sick and can't actually gain weight. So it's always a choice between being sick and having horrible abdominal cramps or getting migraines, feeling lethargic, and not being able to focus. If I focus on eating just when I'm hungry I typically end up somewhere in the middle, but that just means mild headaches, low energy, and nausea. Those symptoms aren't so bad on their on their own, but together they can still make things difficult. The only consolation is that at least they're not debilitating to a point where I can barely leave my room. At the very least I can go out and do some easy work or run errands. Hopefully in a few days when I finally get to see my doctor instead of a walk-in clinic doctor she'll either be able to help me get better or refer to me to a specialist who can. If I have to see a specialist it will take forever though. The wait time could easily be over a year. I'm kind of just hoping that I could get a job soon so I could move to a place where I don't like with 5 guys who leave the kitchen a constant mess and so I can start eating foods that are actually good for me and aren't hard on my system that I prepare myself. I have a meal plan which I would like to stick to that would give me 100% of my daily recommended nutrients with an amount of calories that I can manage without losing weight (possibly even gaining weight if I'm right and this doesn't aggravate my illness), but I literally don't have the counter space or clean dishes to prepare the foods in this meal plan. I don't even think I would have room in the fridge or the cupboards to keep all of the ingredients I would need. As is I have maybe 7 or 8 things in the fridge, a couple frozen dinners in the freezer, and some spices in one of the cupboards. We have 3 fridges and yet they're stocked completely full. And most of the food is no good anymore. People throw stuff in the fridge and then never eat it. The smell at times genuinely makes me feel like my own food isn't even safe to eat just by being left in there with all the rotten stuff nobody is willing to deal with. Like, even though this meal plan is kind of expensive it would probably cost less than eating fast food as frequently as I do and it would pay off in health benefits. I'm just not in a situation where it's possible for me to eat that way. I feel kind of stuck right now because it doesn't seem that any of the things I need to do to get better are in my control. I absolutely hate it.",False,False

I’ve been in similar situations, especially with migraines because mine also get really really bad when I don’t eat. I had to eat in front of someone yesterday (because obviously I negotiated with the nonnegotiable)  and it...did not go well for me. It’s really hard to be in those “have to eat now and there are very few options”  AND have that be in a public setting. Part of me thinks I must look ridiculous, but I’m also scared that some random person is going to notice the behavior or something. At the least it makes it much harder to eat with people or even just around people. The whole “ accidentally calling attention” usually goes to tears pretty fast, and probably worse honestly ",False,True

One particular day I was on campus and I hadn't eaten at all that day, but I was in class. The only thing I knew of that was available on campus which I wouldn't have to wait for was pizza, so I went down to the cafeteria and grabbed a slice then went back to class. I really like the prof I had that day, but he made a comment about the smell of the pizza while he was doing his presentation and it was one of the most uncomfortable experiences I've ever had during class. The entire class's attention had just been directed to me eating by the prof and I wasn't even eating something healthy. I felt like I had to justify it by mentioning I was getting a migraine from not eating, but that was really uncomfortable too. I just hoped that my classmates assumed I didn't eat because I was too busy or running late and not because I was trying to starve myself.",False,False
