That's super rough, and I'm sorry you've had to put up with that :( it always hurts when people insist you look good in a photo that you feel awful about.

My dad does this too and it really pisses me off.  I was visiting my aunt once and as soon as I went into her kitchen, I came across a picture of me on her fridge. Now, I hate my appearance and think I’m hideous and hate most pictures of me, but there are occasionally photos where I actually look ok. And there are a lot of photos where I look like absolute shit, but oh well. But this particular picture was beyond. Like, I literally physically recoiled when I saw it and ended up crying over it. It was horrible, and quite possibly one of the worst pictures of me that exists (I fucking hope).  My aunt saw how upset I was and I asked her to throw away the picture, or at the very least take it down, but she refused because she said she loved that picture and insisted I looked so good in it. I called my dad to ask him why the fuck he would choose that picture to send to her, and he told me he picked it because it’s a beautiful picture. And that he likes it so much, in fact, that he’d also sent a copy to literally every other aunt/uncle/some of the cousins. The best part is that at the time, the picture was a couple years old already, so that means my fuck ugly face had been on display for god knows how many people to see. Years later, she’s still got that fucking picture.  This is why I get pissed at my dad whenever he takes my picture now, and anytime I catch him doing it I immediately take his phone away from him so I can go through his camera reel and delete all the particularly bad (I’m sorry, ~beautiful) pictures of me before he gets the chance to distribute them.  (And even if I’m crazy and they’re right and it’s really a wonderful picture, that’s not how I feel. I hate it. I hate it so much that it brought me to tears and they know that. So why can’t they just respect the fact that I hate it and take it down and stop sending/displaying photos of me without asking first? Like how difficult is it to be considerate of my feelings and just take the fucking thing down?!)  /rant",False,False
