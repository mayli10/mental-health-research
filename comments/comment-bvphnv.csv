He doesn’t control things but is understanding if I can’t eat yet encourages me to. I’m super happy you were able to trust and confide in your man. It makes things better having a support network who cares about you. Sometimes this disorder can make people feel lonely so it’s nice to be able to open up. It’s great in a relationship when you can trust each other emotionally.,False,False

That’s a really tough discussion to have, but have a good support can be so valuable, especially if you decide you want to try recovery. I didn’t have a huge conversation with my boyfriend at first, bu I told him bits and pieces for a while before I finally came out and said it. It definitely makes it harder to use behaviors with gun around now that he knows, but I’m in treatment and working towards recovery now and he’s been (for the most part) great about everything",False,False
