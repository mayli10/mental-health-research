I thought I wouldn't have to go through that because I'm not into weddings at all and was planning on just eloping/having a lowkey party but me and my partner have been talking about it and he kinda wants a wedding so now I am pre-stressing about all of this stuff too. Events with photos normally suck, but an event where most of the photos are specifically supposed to include me and I can't just hide out of range?? No thank you!!",False,False
