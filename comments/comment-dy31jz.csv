People do not understand how isolating and humiliating this kind of disorder can be. We need some place to talk to people, and talk to people who understand this hell. Leave us alone. What do they think is left when these subs are banned? Pro ana forums and forums that are too censored and trigger-free. Neither of these are very helpful in my stage of ""recovery"".",False,False

Imo it's probably from the whole moral panic about the pro-ana communities on the internet (see: starving in suburbia), which was bad tbf but now every ED space on the internet is characterized that way because no one can be bothered to see for themselves what's actually going on.

As I'm sure our male members can attest, the world at large views EDs as a girls' and women's issue, and therefore it is treated very paternalistically.  We can't *possibly* be trusted to discuss and manage our own shit, we need authorities to save us from ourselves.",False,False
