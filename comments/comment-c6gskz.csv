Either way I have only experienced it anecdotally and don't really plan for it to occur. As always it's best to just follow a healthy overall diet but thats easier said than done :/",False,False

A lot of people, myself included, experience a rapid drop in weight shortly after refeeding when restricting for a long time, which is what I would assume is happening. People call it a woosh.      I'm not a medical professional, but it doesn't sound like you're in danger aside from the fact that laxative abuse is really unpleasant long term.",False,False

It’s also possible that you’re overestimating how much you’re eating and are actually under your TDEE. That tends to happen to me if I don’t count calories—I believe I ate a lot more than I did so get in the scale expecting an increase and see that I maintained or lost despite eating “so much”,False,False
