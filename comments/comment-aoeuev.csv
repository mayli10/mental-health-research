If it comes to it I’ll tell him to pretend like he never saw anything, but the fact that somebody even *knows* is terrifying and it’s not in his nature to ignore something if he thinks he can help it somehow. Thank you for the advice and for sharing, I really appreciate it.",False,True

Just kidding. Do not do that. Write him an e-mail or note? You could explain all your feelings there. Having all your stuff out there like that is terrifying! ..write down how you feel then wait a couple days, re-read the note you wrote and then decide if you should give it to him.  Ask him why he told you about finding the account. The whole point of Reddit is to be anonymous.. Is he just worried about you?",False,False

It’s MORTIFYING. To emphasize I had a failed recovery prose set to the fresh prince of bell air.   He told me he found it by saying hey how does the opening to fresh prince of bell air go? Then broke it to me. At work. I just kinda said “ya know, we aren’t gonna talk about this. Pretend it never happened” he was cool and let it slide. He also stopped bringing me doughnuts which is nice.   sorry you got found out, while you’re embarrassed boys are dumb and he’s prolly not even gonna care. Posts here have meaning to us, other people just kinda say “oh she just wants to lose a few” and shrug it off. ",False,False
