I know that seems like a big number, but it's the very least anyone should be taking in to avoid malnourishment, and staying nourished is crucial for your brain to function effectively.",False,False

If you are restricting, your thoughts will progressively become more and more likely to fixate on food.  You will also have less energy to spend on expensive mental processes.    A healthy person's brain consumes ***20%*** of their calories on average, meaning that a brain needs around 400-600 calories a day all to itself.  Someone doing lots of studying and thinking through complex topics will need even more than that.  When you're restricting, you're placing a physical limit on the amount of complex thinking you can do.",False,False

Your brain requires the most energy to function, and if you're restricting, then it has less energy to work with and therefore won't be at optimal performance. Not only will you find it hard to focus, but your thoughts will also wander more to that of food, which is your bodies attempt to get you to seek out sustenance.  If you can, try to have a snack on hand so if you're struggling to concentrate, you can give your brain a boost. Your grades will likely suffer if you restrict, but your mental health comes first, education second. There should be a counsellor at your college, so if you do find yourself struggling, don't be afraid to reach out for support.",False,False
