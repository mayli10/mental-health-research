It's taken me years to find that sweet spot. Turns out if I eat what I see as a reasonable meal at 7, I feel full until about 830/9 when I get a hankering for a snack. So then I eat something and I don't even have to try not to binge bc I'm honestly so full after I have it, I can't stand the thought of food again until much later the next day. It has completely eliminated my night time binging and mine used to be BAD. This does not work if I eat earlier or later than 7. I have no idea why this is my sweet spot, but it is.",False,False
