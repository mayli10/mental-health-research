I decided to get a latte from a convenience store i frequent. It tastes different depending on who makes it. I ask her to add whip. She says okay. I get to my car- no whip. I swear every coffee shop i go except starbucks NEVER adds whip when i ask. Im like whatever. Trying to get over my overreacting rage. Too annoyed to go back in and ask for some. I take my gum out and try it. I think the gum made it taste bad. Nope. Tastes like fucking diluted coffee water. It was so bad i couldnt even finish it. So i wasted $6 and 100 calories 🙃,False,False

It was awful. Now I don’t worry about that because I don’t eat anyways. If you looked at my portion of the fridge all it has is white monsters and Powerade Zero’s. Tbh it’s one of the few perks about Ana. Not having to worry about grocery shopping. Most people would stop their entire day to get food but for me it’s like “I’ll get around to it in a few days I’m fine with nothing untill then” ,False,False

I know it’s kinda scary and intimidating, but TRY talking to her. Let her know that you’re an adult and are making your own life choices, and that includes your diet. Maybe make a deal that you don’t eat anything she buys and she doesn’t eat anything you buy. It can make you seem really mature if you frame it in a way that makes it seem like it’s just the next step in growing up and that you still love and respect her (even if you have to say it all through clenched teeth).  I’ve gotten it to the point where my mom will look out for what she thinks are healthy options for me whenever we go out to eat. She’s off the mark 98% of the time, but she now respects that I want to “take care of my body” by “eating healthy”. ",False,False

Maybe you could try keeping a fruit vase in your own room - it wouldn't look too weird and your fresh food would be safer there!",False,False
