It needed to happen, he couldn't help me and couldn't watch me kill myself. I remember it made me so angry, I felt so abandoned and it felt like it was so unfair, because I didn't choose to have an eating disorder. I remember my initial reaction was very similar to yours - I'll just starve myself, take that, ex-boyfriend! And a very good friend of mine, who also had an ED, told me that ""you can't ""look what you did to me"" to him"". I don't know if that makes sense, but it did to me. Because these actions only hurt yourself and further fuel this self-hate spiral you're in.  I don't know. For me it helps to remember that life is up and down, and happiness isn't a goal, it's a transient state. Happiness isn't an always or nothing emotion, it's a sometimes emotion. You feel sad and angry and down now, but it won't last forever.   Hugs.",False,False
