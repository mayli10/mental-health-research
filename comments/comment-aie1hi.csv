I have a useless degree and I feel completely lost in what I want to do with my life so I can’t find a full time job and I don’t even know what to look for. The idea of going back to school to learn something new sounds like torture and I have no money for it. It’s scary and shitty and terribly depressing. I feel to depressed to even look for work because I feel so stupid and useless. It’s really bad and I’m not sure how to pick myself up. Eating is the only thing I have control over and I fuck that up too. Just know that you’re not alone and we’re gonna make it out some day I hope.. we can’t give up ,False,False

Been looking for a stupid job since September but since I’m 17 and have no previous experience, it’s a no from them dawg. Doesn’t help that I live in a small, crappy city and there’s hardly any place to work at.   Can’t drive either :)))) And I have no one to vent to about this.   Life is great ☺️☺️",False,False

I feel pretty empty and abandoned rn too. Sometimes people distance themselves from us when we really need them. I know it sucks. Idk if this helps but I kind of think about everyone who must feel as alone and alienated and awful as I do this moment and we're all just sitting by ourselves in our misery. It sucks that we feel this way but it helps me feel less lonely... ",False,False
