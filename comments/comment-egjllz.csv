I woke up with a black eye and didnâ€™t even remember what happened because I was so drunk (xanax doesnâ€™t help either with memory loss). I fell asleep on the couch and my so slept next to me after covering me with a blanket, he doesnâ€™t know either how I got it but I think I hit myself while opening a kitchen cabinet.
