Maybe to lift themselves up and show how tiny and cute they are? Maybe to make others feel inferior for being hungrier than eating a small portion? I don‚Äôt know.

I tallied up my exercise hours per week (excluding the additional hours of my physical retail job and copious casual walking) and I burn way more than I thought, which is why I was passing out.
