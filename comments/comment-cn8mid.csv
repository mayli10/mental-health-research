Today I tried to eat more throughout the day but I just ended up emotionally binging at night because I was sad about work lol",False,False

You might be better off eating more frequently but smaller amounts. I just made a new plan last night that would have me eat about 200 calories for breakfast, about 300 for lunch, about 500 for dinner, and about 110 for dessert. I would also at some point have a 220 calorie meal replacement shake. All of the foods in my meal plan would also be pretty soft. Breakfast is a smoothie, lunch is scrambled eggs and sweet potato home fries, dinner is spaghetti with tofu, and the snack would be an ice cream bar. I'm certain this will help me with bloating and abdominal pain. It's going to be hard to eat that volume, but I believe that with time I'll get used to it and it will become easier. Something similar might be a good plan for you. That's 3 small meals and 2 snacks.",False,False
