I’m a cheerleader and jump rope is part of our regular warm ups. Usually it’s something like 600 forwards, 300 backwards, 150 on each foot, 75 doubles forwards, 40 doubles backwards, and then 10 attempts at triples (hardly anyone can do those). Keep in mind we’re on a sprung floor so doubles are easier than on the ground, but it’s still a crazy cardio and calf workout. And it’s satisfying to see the improvements in endurance and speed over time.",False,False

It's pretty easy to figure out how many jumps per minute you do to get an idea of speed to make the calculations more accurate.",False,True
