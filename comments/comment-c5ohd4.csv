It all went downhill on the way there when we stopped for froyo at this little gas station. It was an all weekend wedding so food was out at all times. Complete snackage. I remember having a full sized Italian sub and chips for dinner and god knows what else. I was grabbing shit by the handfuls and snacking all night. Cue bloat...the next day was the wedding: appetizers (cheese and crackers), chips nd salsa, candy, trail mix bar, etc. I had NO filter. I was constantly eating. Dinner rolls around and I ate probably 4 personal pizzas to myself, 3 plates of Brussel sprouts, plate of wings, and then back to the appetizers that were still out. Dessert was 2 huge ice cream cookie sandwiches and an individual big bowl of ice cream. I ate my bf's dessert too. Still snacking on the trail mix btw. The following morning was a waffle breakfast bar, quiche, TRAIL MIX, some fruit, bagels, &amp; donuts. To this day it makes me sick to think I ate so much. I know the calories were in the tens of thousands. It's still a blur. I'm pretty impressed with myself, but fuck the stomach pains were the worst in my life. I dont purge so I dealt with my consequences ðŸ˜– it took a long time to get that shit flushed out, but I really didn't gain a ton surprisingly.  Tldr: went apeshit on the food at my bro's 3 day wedding",False,False

This is a pretty upscale place and the food is really good. I ate more than everyone else at my table combined, as a 5' 3'', 125 pound girl, and this table included two bodybuilding guys that weigh like 180 pounds. I also finished their desserts and was completely stuffed and in pain afterwards.  Then we got home, and I lied to my partner saying I wanted to go on a walk. Instead, I went to a grocery store and binged on a jar of peanut butter, two pints of ice cream, a bag of nuts and granola, and several cookies/brownies/muffins from their bakery. I did the math, and it was probably something like 13000 calories in just that ~4 hour period",False,False

I had a 6000 calorie day in which I had two normal low calorie meals and then proceeded to eat half of a vegan delivery pizza with vegan ranch, Oreo cookie thins w/ PBfit, sugar wafer cookies, a pint of halo top AS WELL as a full fat pint of Ben &amp; Jerryâ€™s non dairy ice cream, plus some dark chocolate, and then regular Oreos with regular peanut butter. Moral of the story, donâ€™t purge. I still lost weight the following week.",False,False
