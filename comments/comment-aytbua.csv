Just wanted to say that you’re basically my twin right now. I’ve been binging for about 2 months straight, went from BMI 19 to now 21.5. It doesn’t seem like a lot and it’s not a 12 pound difference, but since I’m short, all of it shows and last night I experienced my first comment on looking “good with the extra weight.”  Honestly I have no proper advice since I’m just trying to cycle off of the binge. I do an EC stack which helps some but I acclimate to it quite easily, however yesterday was my first successful day restricting. That being said, my most successful is when I eat very very little during the day and save my calories for right before bed, since that’s normally my binge time anyway. Coffee helps during the day. Tons of water. Keeping busy. You can do it. Just know, you’re definitely not alone. ",False,False
