This of course assumes you have some degree of medical/scientific literacy, and enough privilege for doctors to even consider listening to you. I am scared to know what it would be like to navigate the medical system without those things. It's bad enough as it is.   My favorite thing is when the doctor goes from ""No, you're fine, stop reading JAMA, LAYPEOPLE HAVE ZERO RELEVANT KNOWLEDGE STFU!!!"" to, ""Oh shit something really was wrong. Good for you for self-advocating!""   Although my favorite situation is still where I had one doctor sneering at me for questioning him at all, and another literally telling me, ""You sound smart and like you're good at using google. You probably know more about this than me, ha ha!"" Yeah, both those reactions were SUPER comforting.",False,False

They get used to seeing random symptoms of things that don‚Äôt result so they start to ignore flags until it‚Äôs ‚Äúbad enough‚Äù.  Happens with all kinds of illnesses not just EDs. My mums pneumonia got ignored because even though she had symptoms she didn‚Äôt complain in the way someone is expected to so they didn‚Äôt put it all together and brushed her off as just having a bad chest cold until it got so bad it spread to her heart (she‚Äôs okay now this was years ago, has a dicky valve tho because of it)",False,False
