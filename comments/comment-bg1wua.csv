Literally I have been ""recovered"" (ie healthy weight) ever since I had a seizure that totally broke me (psychologically). I thought it was cuz I wasn't eating, but then I had another seizure literally out of nowhere. Do you think yours are related?",False,False

It's bleak and depressing. I shift from being OK to flat out popping pills and fasting. It's this  pendulum that I haven't been able to permanently shake for decades.   ❤️,False,False

What would you tell your past selves? I guess is what I’m trying to say.    I’m currently 21 and I’ve struggled with ED since my teens. I’m about to hit actual adulting once I graduate in a year.

Up until four or so months ago, I was stupid proud of my new jiu jitsu bod and newfound strength. Thought something out of my control warped me into shape. Nope. One or two shit weeks and wooooosh right back in.

For me it was a negative change, losing my job and my husband leaving so, my life feels like it’s totally out of control. Hence, of course I must not eat to bring my life back in line!

I just turned 35 (ick) and have relapsed pretty bad the past 6 months after 7 years of being “recovered”. It sucks. I hate the grip that EDs have on their victims.
