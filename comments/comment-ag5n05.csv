I love green beans so much, my favourite way to eat them is to just basically cook up a tomato sauce (chopped tomatoes, olive oil, salt and pepper, garlic and basil) and then when that is reduced add the green beans and simmer them in the sauce. Really simple and just a bowl of veg basically, good hot and cold too!!  [This is a salmon recipe I love too if you like salmon](https://www.seriouseats.com/2017/04/how-to-make-one-pot-salmon-curried-leeks.html)   Keep it up, cooking is so fun! ",False,False

I used to cook and bake as self care and honestly I forgot how much I love the process of it.   Iâ€™m pretty sure salmon is my new favorite safe food. Delicious, low cal, high protein, and easy to make? Sign me tf up! Aldi sells it for $9 a pound and what I made was preseasoned/marinated with Mediterranean seasonings and hot damn it was delicious ",False,True
