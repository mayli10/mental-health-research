Eating a bite of something makes me feel the way someone feels after they eat a portion meant for a family. idk if my stomache has just shrunken to the size of a pee or my body is doing that as a way to tell me not to fuck up further ,False,False

This happens for me even if I take a few bites of something. Non ED people would think it would feel physically good to eat after starving for s long period of time but itâ€™s very uncomfortable and painful in reality. Yes me not eating is definitely decided by my ed and the mental gymnastics my brain goes through to overcome survival instinct but it being painful on top of that is another reason I choose not to eat ,False,False
