I’m struggling so badly at the moment and I don’t want to put on any weight on top of everything else going on. Sweets are unfortunately my comfort food and my mum went out to buy me “pick ‘n’ mix” to make me feel better. Which it did, until I’d logged my food for the day. :(((",False,True

I know ED might be a trip, but it helps to remind yourself that objectively speaking this probably wouldn't matter in the long run at all.   maybe you can try to distract yourself? reading/working/talking to people in general help me a lot. also I love watching ED recovery youtube videos to try calming myself down -- Tabitha Farrar and Megsy Recovery are great if you want recommendations hahah  wear something loose and comfy as well, that doesn't draw your attention to your body.   stay strong friend :( &lt;3",False,False
