I wanted to tell her how jealous I was that she was eating something that smelled amazing without a care that it was dripping in fat and she looked so genuinely happy anyways. Thatâ€™s something I want and to me, sheâ€™s lucky she has that. But perspective is a hell of a thing.   Iâ€™m sorry youâ€™re still suffering. I hate this disorder and what it has taken from me so much. Stay safe. ðŸ’™",False,True

Iâ€™m glad that youâ€™ve taken the first steps towards recovery and opened up. Itâ€™s so helpful to have people you can look to for support when you feel like youâ€™re drowning. Good luck to you. ðŸ’™,False,True

YESSSSSSSSSSS.    &amp;#x200B;  At my worst, my brother was so sweet. He'd been away and came back after not seeing me in 3 months and I'd dropped to my lowest weight. He said that I needed to get better...and think of all aspects of health and do things that are good for my SOUL. He listed all these different things, and said 'and cake is good for the soul' (I didn't go and have any because he was kind of ignorant, but the sentiment was there).   &amp;#x200B;  My psychiatrist was asking me about my foods and what I ate. She was always trying to think up ways of getting me to eat more and expand my horizons. She tried the 'if you're not going to eat much, you can do better than carrots... be a film star, have flippin caviar on  blinis if you're going to savour your food'  Newp, did not work.   &amp;#x200B;  One day she said 'and you should try including some forbidden unhealthy foods..who knows, one day in the future scientists might discover a couple of things about them that are in fact, healthy for you! I said...well my brother says he has found the thing, he says they can be good for your soul.    &amp;#x200B;  I dunno why I shared all that but it was just a point on your food and the soul lol",False,False

I have a couple of overweight cousins who justify their obesity by saying it's their build and that I'm a 'small frame'. But apart from that, I get a lot of 'good discipline' comments. I'm an unusual weirdo in that I have a history of some kind of orthorexia (complete with spreadsheet to ensure I have got all my nutrients in)  in public, and anorexia 'if it fits your calories' style  in private. No dears, I don't have iron will...I'm an actual robot who just doesn't do anything off plan lol.  &amp;#x200B;  But put it this way, I'd rather have the 'small frame' or 'lucky' comments any day that being accused of having an eating disorder (and in other words, not having my shit together).",False,False

I tried not to be creepy but like she was sooo skinny. Perfect flat stomach, which was my holy grail. And on top of that we were similar in what we study/want to do but she was more successful with professors and stuff so I was hugely jealous of her. There was one particular outfit she wore with shorts and some sort of crop top that I literally cried over at home lmao.   Then like a year later we studied abroad in the same place for a semester and became a lot closer. In the interim she had gained weight, on purpose, and in talking I learned she definitely struggled with an ED.   Felt so stupid after that lmao. I lived with roommates when I was restricting hard and told them it was just a healthy diet for some not-unhealthy vanity weight loss to get that flat stomach. And like I told myself that too, really. And would think of her and my boyfriend at the time, both of whom had perfect flat stomachs, as like validation that it wasnâ€™t a crazy goal. Both were underweight bmis turns out, and she was struggling. Oops",False,False
