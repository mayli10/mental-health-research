My binge-ing stopped or I'd just make myself a bowel of fruit salad or a big salad and logged everything as you mentioned. The more I logged the more I wanted to keep logging less and less each day. 1 month later and i've lost 1st 7lbs. Probably too fast tbh, but i'm now slowing down my weight loss so it's not too unhealthy, and going for a healthy 2lbs loss per week from now on.  &amp;#x200B;  Thankyou very much. ",False,True

I'm from the UK, but our stats aren't too far behind Americas. I knew I needed to stop eating so much, which is why I was looking for tips, I have problems with food probably because when I'm depressed I eat. Which is a lot, which means I eat a lot. I have that app it's pretty good, since I wrote this post I lost 10% of my body fat and joined a weight loss group, earned slimmer of the month after just two weeks of being there lol. I guess i was too depressed about my weight to actually eat, so I switched to healthier foods. I haven't started exercising yet, so that's my next step. I appreciate your reply but ""stop eating so much"" really is a stupid thing to say to somebody with a binge-eating problem. It's like saying ""just eat more"" to an anorexic, but maybe you'd say that too who knows.   But anyway, I am changing my lifestyle, and am actually eating more, in terms of food, less in terms of calories. No thanks to this site. All down to me :)",False,True

The average American woman who doesn’t work out needs 1300 calories or fewer to maintain a healthy weight. An average man who doesn’t work out needs about 1800. If you’re saying you’re obese or close to it you need to stop eating so much food. It doesn’t matter if you switch to healthier foods, or continuing the same eating habits but adding in gym days, the only thing that will make you lose weight is to stop eating.     Download my fitness pal app and try to log every single thing you eat for just one day. That includes Starbucks, snacks like fun-size snickers, all of your meals, and your sodas. I bet it adds up to over 3000 calories a day.     If you want help losing weight is literally the easiest thing to do. It’s all about calories in vs calories out. Just stop eating so much.
