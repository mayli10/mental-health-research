First of all, feeling like a fraud is super common in eating disorders‚Äîthe idea of a non-disordered person feeling concerned that they're faking an ED seems very strange to me.  Everyone's experience is different. Different things make different people anxious. I hope your increased intake pays off in terms of studying, and I think it's good you are taking care of your health.",False,False

Half of me thinks it‚Äôs a win to skip my run today (so I‚Äôm not burnt out by early afternoon) and having a larger breakfast and snacks when I‚Äôm studying, and then the other half of me just tells me I‚Äôm weak and not really sick. Like if my ED was real, I could be this incredible, smart, productive skinny girl who could go for an hour run, drink coffee, concentrate for 8 hours straight and ace that test, no food needed. I have to constantly remind myself that restriction brain hits me hard even at like 1000 calories or so.",False,False
