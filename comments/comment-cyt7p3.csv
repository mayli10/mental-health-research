I went through mechanical engineering for 5 years and it was the same. The only advice I have is to fight back. You might be seen as the bitchy girl, but seriously its the only thing that works when you're in that kind of field. It doesn't change when you start working too...",False,False

I am an engineer too, and have been in the workforce for over five years in male dominated industries. Like, only woman in the room. It got even worse for me after I graduated because I felt like I couldn't be confident or taken seriously in a room full of men unless I was attractive and thin. And thus started relapse after college was a major weight gain period for me. And the WORST part is that I DID DO BETTER once I was thinner fueling it even more.",False,False

I'm required to take Title IX and sexual harassment training every year as a student worker and most schools policies expand to any activity that happens on campus",False,False

So, I definitely understand just letting things go because it's more trouble than it's worth, has the potential to bring about a shitstorm, etc. But I just want to emphasize that this is profoundly inappropriate. It's sexual harassment, and a reportable offense in any legitimate university setting in the U.S. *Especially* if this person was any kind of supervisor or superior (but no matter their position, it's harassment).   Like I said, I 100% understand why you would choose to let this go. I just think you deserve to know (if you didn't already) that you have the right to file a complaint.  Very sorry you've been enduring all of this. I have friends who dropped out of STEM for this reason.",False,False

The skinny girl. The pretty girl. Because I'm the only girl.  And maybe if I lose enough, I'll disappear and finally, no one will  notice me.  Hhholy fuck hello twin.  I had some dickwad comment about how being a woman in our field means I can ""let myself go"" because there's not many options and that being in CS means you have an innate +3 attractiveness because of female scarcity. Boy howdy is this fucking field an absolute disaster with garbage humans.  Just let us fucking work on our projects and stop talking about how we'd make great front-end graphic designers.

The best was probably when a longtime colleague who‚Äôd never met me in person saw a picture of me, and commented ‚Äú*I always assumed you were fat!*‚Äù  Like... cool, dude.    Or a few years ago, when I had what I now realize was a relapse and lost a lot of weight, and a (male) colleague I‚Äôd literally never spoken to before walked over from the development pod and asked me (admiringly) how I lost so much weight.  Like, no preamble - just a cross-examination.   I‚Äôm a lot further away from the worst of my eating disorder than you - for me, it peaked in the late 1990s - but feeling like an object, and feeling like my body was being scrutinized like some sort of public park that I‚Äôm held responsible for keeping beauteous, is extremely infuriating.  Now, I‚Äôm pretty secure in the knowledge that the problem is them - all the various presumptuous creeps sprinkled in among my colleagues.  My attitude is a relatively chillaxed ‚ÄúFuck them.‚Äù, but that‚Äôs easier to maintain now that I have an established career.    I‚Äôm sorry you‚Äôre having to deal with that bullshit.",False,False
