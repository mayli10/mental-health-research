Talk about feeling invalid, haha (just a joke, but I seriously don’t feel like either of those).      My mother started mine I believe. “Stop eating so much.” “Why are you eating so much?” “Your eating/wasting all my money.” “I don’t care if you don’t wanna eat, your not allowed to go until you eat it all.” So I stopped eating during the day. Id starve myself all day, and then come home stoned and/or a bit tipsy and Id eat.      Then I became homeless, and was using a certain drug (I wont say which atm) so that I wouldn’t have to worry about sleeping or eating. It made me less worried about passing out and getting robbed/raped/beat up. I also didn’t have any money, so I wasn’t able to buy stuff like food. So when I was high, I didn’t have to deal with extreme hunger either. I someone always found someone willing to give me the drug as well. I never had to pay for it, never had to fuck or suck someone for it, never had to do anything more than spend some time with the person.      While I was homeless, I ran into this guy that I had known 2 years ago who was a total creep those 2 years ago (he would make comments like “nice panty shot... if your even wearing panties” to me when I was 16 and he was 27 and had a GF), but he seemed a lot nicer now. He bought me a few necessities (which I later found out wasn’t even with his own money, he used his dying grandmothers money on me), and stayed with me at his friends place (a couple. Man and woman, plus their 5 year old son) for a week while feeding me a dangerous amount of drugs (drugs as in more than 1 type) till the point that I had a mental breakdown and watched him and the other guy die horrible violent deaths over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over. By the end I thought I loved him.      That started a heavily mentally/emotionally, sexually, financially, and at the very end physically abusive relationship. Near the end, he had me super drugged up so that I was basically bed ridden and couldn’t leave him. I couldn’t go back to live with family and escape till I sobered up, but I couldn’t sober up until I left because he wouldn’t let me.      He was constantly sneaking strangers into his sober living home, and it was a basement suite so there would be people randomly banging on the windows trying to get in as well. It wasn’t safe to sleep due to the risk of something happening to me and/or my stuff, so I had to stay high to stay awake. That also meant that I couldn’t eat though, since taking even the smallest bite that you can imagine was literally like doing the cinnamon challenge. It was physically impossible to swallow it even if I tried washing it down with water.      I survived for weeks at a time eating nothing and just drinking water and chugging back a nasty Ensure or 2 every day. After I left him, I still couldn’t sleep or eat even once I sobered up. I had no desire to eat cause I was so fucked up, and I was having trauma nightmares so I would sleep for maybe 1-2 hours, stay up for 24+ hours, and I wouldn’t go back to sleep until my body shut itself down from exhaustion. Now I can sleep and eat a bit better, but I still have disordered eating habits.    So mine started due to an abusive mother putting me down for eating. I wasn’t trying to go on a diet, get healthier, or lose weight. It may have been a small factor, but it was mostly caused by my abusive mother constantly put me down for eating anything. Then it got worse due to drugs and even more abuse, but this time from an abusive, narcissistic sociopath, possibly a pedo, druggy, asshole. ",False,False
