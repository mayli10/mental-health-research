We were co workers in retail last last christmas season. It was kinda trippy because we both knew it but it was unspoken. Like we would sit there awkwardly eating lunch together, both kinda obscenely small and like lowkey ED food. See salad with no dressing and plain grilled chicken and veggies. Then a candy bar and diet soda on a desperate break.   We were both obvi underweight and it was just kinda uncomfortable but also comforting at the same time if that makes sense.",False,False

I still don’t tell people but when the second one told me I opened up a bit.

She’d talk about how she was down to 80 lbs and had to be hospitalized and do inpatient. I wanted to say I’d suffered from an ED too but I felt sooo embarrassed and invalid. I’ve never been underweight or hospitalized. I felt like if I piped up and said “I’ve gone through an ED too” everyone would think I was lying or attention seeking or didn’t have a real ED compared to her or something. So I never said anything. It was a strange feeling, though, sitting there and pretending I couldn’t relate when she’d talk about EDs and mental health issues haha. Internally I was screaming “YES!! I CAN RELATE!!”",False,False

We have been open with each other about these issues in the past, but its not a big part of our friendship.

I wasn't as close with this girl but she started posting questionable stuff on social media and eventually opened up to me about becoming anorexic. by the time she opened up she was getting help though. I'm not sure how much she's improved, she seems kinda sick to me but I don't interact with her much because she triggers me.

My best friend from when I was 17 to 19 and in my worst relapse was also AN. We were sooooo close, he was the first person I could truly be myself around re my AN but in retrospect we were so bad for each other, we triggered each other so much. It was around 1998-2000 and I’d never heard of pro-ana and I don’t even know if it was a thing back then but we were definitely it. We were so comfortable and accepting of each other not eating anything and I even used to c/s infront of him. We were also heavy drug users and though at the time we were both gay (he was male, I’m female) we had some questionable encounters together. I was a messed up kid back then, and i think I was so bad for him, he was messed up too and i think i must have messed him up even more, I wish I could apologize but we lost touch. I hope he is well now. He was such a beautiful soul.",False,False

One had purging anorexia and the other was a bulimic. The bulimic was the tough love type that made me uncomfortable once they knew for sure I had an ED, and like you, I kind of regretted telling them anything. After the two comments they'd made, I felt they were judging me in silence. I never told the one with anorexia I had an ED, but over time I watched them gain weight they were proud of and stop purging and their rise in happiness made me wonder if it was something I should do. It was a very small amount of curiosity, though. It's very vulnerable, because then you wonder if they're connecting the dots and increasing the amount of attention they pay to you. ",False,False
