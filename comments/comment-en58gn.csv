Sad times lovely ! Super sad times!   You're perfect the way you are and the universe/your Angel's think you are beautiful and can see the pain and sickness that is to come if you keep this up.  You dont need a number to tell you that you are beautiful you need YOU to tell you you're beautiful   And then you need to believe it when you say good things about yourself   If you believe it when it's bad why wouldnt you believe it when its good   You have to love yourself as you are because even if you get to the number on the scale you crave to see you wont see it or think it's enough until you love you for who you are not what you look like.,False,False
