I have a crush on a guy who has also lost a substantial amount of weight and is self conscious about his loose skin, too, but it doesn't bother me at all on him.   I know it's irrational but it's so hard to not get caught up in the belief men are only attracted to looks, and especially a certain kind of look, that it's nice to be reassured that there are plenty of men who are less focused on physical appearance.   I'm working on the ED part, haha, and I am feeling a lot better after a good cry, taking my meds, and reading the kind comments people have left. I still have a long way to go, and I still want to starve to death a little bit, but thank you for letting me know my story isn't so abnormal.",False,True

I carry no missapprehension that my first time will be story-worthy or even exciting. I prefer the mundane and even the boring, at least someone found me desirable and patient enough with my neuroses to be intimate, yeah? But I can't help but wonder how many people flat-out lied and are still in the same embarrassmed boat as I am, since you've pointed it out.",False,True

My first friend in college was a very, how you say, sexually liberated person. The topic of losing virginities came out and when I said I had never had sex she treated me so different from there on out. Like I was a baby. Anytime a movie or TV show mentioned some vanilla kink she would explain to me, unprompted and at length what it meant. I stopped being friends with her. But I have a friend now who does something similar. She makes sure whenever the topic turns to sex or sexuality, especially in group settings, to say ""Well, not like synedchdochee would know."" (Which has only happened about 3 times but... still). Coworkers and acquaintances make passing comments about ugly or unlikeable people obviously being virgins. It seems every day I am reminded in some small way that I am behind my peers, ugly and/or unlikeable, and immature.   Thank you for your reassurance on vulnerability. It gives me a lot of hope, and settles my nerves. I don't talk to a lot of old friends because I realized I was just there to be the punching bag. I am becoming more comfortable with opening up to people it's just... scary, like you said. But a lot more people have reached out to me here and I feel a lot better than I did yesterday about it, already. So, thank you so much for your kindness.",False,True

I struggle with being hyper-critical on myself so I sometimes drop hobbies for months because I didn't feel like I was good enough at it, or I wasn't progressing at it, or I saw someone who was way better than me at it. But I am getting better at it, so your suggestion is warmly received- I'm going to start trying harder to overcome not existing exclusively for the validation of others.   There's just something... not as satisfying? I guess, about working at being good at those instead of losing weight. People will GUSH anytime you lose a substantial amount of weight. Call you pretty. Say they're jealous. It's addicting. I guess that's one of the causes of my ED- being addicted to outside validation.",False,True

And I promise you can get sex if you wanted to, you can have a relationship if you want to. I hope that you can work on yourself mentally to allow someone into your life romantically or sexually. For me I would only do anything sexual with the help of alcohol, but I met someone and I fucked him sober and it was nerve wracking. That didnâ€™t really work out, but it taught me that I can find someone who I can give myself to. I completely get how you feel, it was really hard for me to allow myself anything sexual or romantic &amp; it still is, but Iâ€™m learning that my body and my appearance isnâ€™t the problem, it was me closing myself off to those types of experiences. I thought that my body would disgust people, but I know thatâ€™s not true and I know itâ€™s not true for you too. I still have a lot of work to do &amp; I hope you can find a way to let yourself have these experiences. Iâ€™m sorry this is weighing on your mind.",False,False

A lot of us focus on losing weight, and you also seem to sometimes focus on your virginity, which is also 100% a body thing. Maybe you should find a new hobby and work on getting good at it (painting, poetry, gardening, writing) and just keep it for yourself or only show a few people. Like, dont do it for the validation of others, just find something you'd enjoy even if nobody else knew you did it",False,False

It sounds so cliche but the relationships that ultimately last are between people that GET each other. It's when you can talk for hours about random crap with the other person or sit in each others company but in complete silence. It's not just about being boyfriend/girlfriend but also being best friends. It's about having that one person that you want to tell your biggest news but also the tiniest uninteresting thing that happened to you.   And as I always tell my friends who are single and lonely, it usually just starts off by being friends with someone and when you're least expecting it or looking for a relationship.   Don't give up. Just do the hobbies you love or try new things and you'll meet people along the way ðŸ’•",False,False

Where everyone talks about their first time, their first kisses, the funny anecdotes of parents or roommates have walked in. And I am the only person in the room who can't participate. It makes me feel like I'm not normal. Like there's something wrong with me.   I know how you feel and what you feel is valid. I'm 14 years removed from where you are and I honestly do not know what someone could've said to me when I was you to make me feel better and change. I'm going to say something to you that is true, but I don't know if or how it could help you feel better:  Every person in that quoted text is lying or embellishing. There is no truth in that group sharing circle. if when it was your turn, and you said ""lol I got drunk and dont remember. he was some band nerd"" they would all believe you and the story circle would move on to the next person.  You will never know the full truth about what people share to a group. they only share things that they think will elevate their position in the group. If someone during the group sharing says that they pooped the bed literally and don't remember what happened after, they are only sharing it because they think it will make the others like them more.   it could be false could be real, no one knows. all you can know as true is if the group laughs and pats the storyteller on the back.   If someone tells the truth and says their first time was boring and uneventful, everyone else will politely smile and nod. Everyone after that is lying because they have seen that telling the truth is boring and gets them nowhere.",False,False

I promise you nobody else is putting as much thought into your inexperience as you are, and whether or not youâ€™ve had sex or been in a relationship  is not a measure of your worth at all.   I also think itâ€™s good that you recognize you want someone to just reassure you. For a really long time I just wanted a sense of validation, and I thought having sex would bring that, but it didnâ€™t.   Finding someoneâ€”even if not romanticallyâ€”who recognizes your worth and who you can be vulnerable with is a thousand times more rewarding. Iâ€™m really sorry people have treated you so badly in the past, that does make it really hard to open up to other people later on. When I was in high school, boys would ask me out on dares and it just totally destroyed my self confidence. I took a chance when my ex asked me on a date and even though we arenâ€™t together anymore, I learned so much from being in a relationship with him.  I know itâ€™s hard when youâ€™ve been made to feel like somethings wrong with you, but there are people out there who clearly see your worth!   The next time someone you might be into expresses interest in you, you could always just go for it and go on a few dates. If itâ€™s too overwhelming or if you donâ€™t feel comfortable with them itâ€™s totally okay to take a step back! Or if you do really like them itâ€™s okay to take things as slow as you need to, and the right person will respect that!!!",False,False

Grew up obese, had really bad acne especially under my arms. Girls would dare other girls to talk to me. I'd binge eat a lot to try and feel less depressed. Ended up not only having really bad disordered eating/depression but also got diagnosed with social anxiety disorder and took meds/saw a psychologist.  I'm 30 now and it actually did get better for me. I have loose skin and feel really self conscious about it but I did end up getting a gf and losing my virginity with her. She was also overweight and my loose skin didn't bother her. I also personally wouldn't mind if I was dating a girl that had loose skin especially since I'm used to it.. it just doesn't bother me at all, same for stretch marks, scars, etc  I just wanted to say don't give up hope, I think there are a lot of people more understanding than you might think. There are a lot of guys that wouldn't mind it and personally my sexual interest in a girl is a lot more than just her physical looks. Also, it might sound weird but personally when I was really romantically interested in her she sort of became ""my type"", I loved her soft chubbyness, her moles, etc. Idk.  Please don't feel that way about wanting to starve or believing you're not worthy of love because you're good enough as is. Please remember to be kind to yourself and don't beat yourself up :( I hope you feel better",False,False

I don't know too many people who are so-called ""late starters."" All of my older brothers have had girlfriends since early adolescence. I have some friends who haven't been out of a relationship fir more than a few weeks since they started middle school. It's nice to hear one's body isn't overanalyzed during sex, it's... a scary prospect to say the least.  It's just so odd to sit out the conversations.

It makes me feel like I'm not normal. Like there's something wrong with me.  I feel a bit stupid because I can recognize people have tried to pursue me romantically. But I just can't do it. I shut down and start avoiding them and I can recognize half of the problem is my own fear and insecurities. On the other hand, I have been insulted and bullied. Called horrible things. It's hard to be willing when everyone you've been vunerable in front of has insulted or made it very clear how disgusting I am to me. I think maybe it's not sex, or even physical intimacy I want. I want the reassurance nothing is wrong with me, that I am hitting the same milestones as my peers, that my horrible body isn't the thing holding me back.

I was worried about being inexperienced, and there were a lot of things I was deeply insecure about that he didnâ€™t even notice.
