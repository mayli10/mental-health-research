It's not a hunger really, just an irresistible *urge*. And when the binges start it's almost like a weird blackout. I know what I'm doing, but I just can't make myself stop. Even if I become physically sick the urge is still there. I'm literally an addict. It's terrible and embarrassing.",False,False

Think of the strongest drive you have.....it's like trying to convince your body that you're not horny, or trying not to shit when you have diarrhea, or trying to stay awake when you're extremely drowsy.  It's like that but with food- a consistent voice saying ""eat it. You know you want it. This craving won't leave unless you indulge it. ""  until you finally eat to get it to shut up. ",False,False

It's very trance-like, and it feels like I'm not in my own body. It makes it possible to ""get away"" from reality.   There have been times were my body is bingeing, and my brain is like ""wtf, you fatso, please stop. Why can't you stop?"". But more often than not, I'm not really thinking about anything.  My mom caught me bingeing once and freaked out because she said my eyes were glazed over, and it looked like I wasn't there, and it was a scary sight for her.  I think it's mostly psychological, but after almost a decade of bingeing, there is definitely a physiological component engrained in me as well.  It's just very hard to control your own actions when your body is on autopilot, and you're not in your normal state of mind to give a fuck about anything.",False,False

The taste and texture of food is just too tempting to resist and all I can think about is how I just want to taste it more, feel it more, chew it more.",False,False

Like sometimes lll take the long way home or drive around longer then it really takes to get home because I don’t trust myself at home.  It starts with very subtle things that come into my mind, like say I’m watching television and there’s a scene with food, and I’m like wow that looks good. Then I say that I can eat a little bit but only enough that will meet my daily goal. Then after that I’ll say I can have a little more because I’ll still be under my TDEE. Then I’ll say I can eat TDEE because I need to keep muscle or gain it as I lose weight. Then it will be today is ruined because I ate maintenance might as well eat more. And more and more.  It’s not that process every time but it’s just my body using my brain to trick me into eating more because that’s what survival, and my genetics want.   ",False,False
