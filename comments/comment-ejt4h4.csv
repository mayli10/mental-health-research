I have notebooks full of embarrassing attempts at poetry/lyrics. I started just jotting down clever lines I would think of here and there instead of trying to slam out a whole poem. I tend to start with a strong line or idea and it goes down hill quickly if I put too much effort around it so I'm hoping if I just keep jotting ideas I can eventually peice together a decent poem haha",False,True

I think drinking was a big mask for my emotional issues. Adult coloring books are super fun haha. I have creative outlets like painting but I only paint landscapes, which doesn't really help to show people how I feel. I play guitar and wish I could just write songs about my feelings but I am just no good with words, I wish I was a poet but it just never comes out right.",False,True

I told someone once I'd quit drinking and smoking and they said, How do you relieve stress? And I was speechless, haha. I still don't know. I'd like to be more creative but the most I do is use adult coloring books.",False,False
