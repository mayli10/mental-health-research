But I'm so confused too.  I understand that just because you have disordered eating it doesn't mean you hate food, but it looks like she has no problem with it.  She doesn't mind going out for lunches with friends, she snacks constantly (well used to during school, we're on break).  I cant help but think this is her trying to one up me, like a competition just like I said before that I take part in too.  She has no problem letting others know she loves food or eats.  Its especially weird how constantly with me if I ever mention not feeling hungry she says ""yeah I dont feel hungry these days too"" and yet in a grouochat with other friends she's like ""so hungry, I've been hungry these past weeks, like really scary hungry, food is love""  She is going through a sort of depression however, and I think this might have an effect on her.",False,True

EDs are way more common (and often, far more invisible) than people realize, so if she's agreeing with you when you make certain disordered statements, it may be possible that she's going through some issues, as well?   In either case, it sounds like the whole thing is upsetting you and driving habits that cause you pain, neither of which are optimal. What are the odds that both of you would be willing to have a conversation about the stuff that's getting to you? If nothing else, you'd gain some outside perspective and be able to plan the best next move.",False,False
