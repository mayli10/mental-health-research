I just got done planning a binge for tomorrow and what I was going to do today and the rest of the week to make sure my daily average stays under 800. It's ridiculous the amount of time I spend planning calories",False,False

I’ll add up the number of calories I need after the binge to lose however many kilos/pounds, then divide that by the number of days left in the week and use that as my new daily deficit.  Except this week. I binged yesterday (a total of 1517 calories I think, was still in deficit), but today I went ahead and decided to allow myself to eat a regular amount of food. But I also rigorously exercised about 1k calories to make room which is a problem BUT I usually do that without more than 600 calories so I think it’s a step in the right direction.  I’m probably gonna die this weekend though. Can’t not eat with my mom unfortunately, so I guess I’ll make up for it Monday!  I hate my life.",False,False

I used to try to compensate the next day by overexecising without eating but that usually lead to another binge. Now i try to compensate for a binge during the rest of the week. Just restrict a bit more every day or exercise a bit more on multiple gym sessions and by the end of the week or two weeks  it'sike it didn't happen. ,False,False
