My best advice would be to try to communicate with your support circle or social group and don't isolate yourself if you can help it. Going out doesn't always have to involve food. Suggest meeting up at a park for a walk or a hike if the weather is favorable. Coffee is usually fairly safe. Its very easy to fall into a ""me against the world"" type mindset. Take care of yourself as best you can üíõ",False,False

I think the last time I felt clear like this I restricted too low because I ‚Äújust wanted to be back to where I was comfortable‚Äù (~110 lbs from 117üôÑ) and ended up back in brain fog before I knew what hit me. And once you‚Äôre there you don‚Äôt really care what brought you there or where you‚Äôre supposed to be going, ya know?",False,True
