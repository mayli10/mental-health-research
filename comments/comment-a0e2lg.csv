My parents and family are amazing and so kind. They are currently trying to get me to recover. You're very young, so I really really hope you can stop this before it gets too entrenched. This disorder will take so much from you, things you could never even imagine. Almost everything you love right now will be shoved out of the way by obsessive thoughts about food and weight.   I'm in university for creative writing. Before my ED got really bad when I was 17, I was writing all the time. I had written 4 books of 180,000 words (quality was low but passion was high). I now struggle to write anything, and have given up on the idea of getting published. My social life is gone, and I stopped doing theatre because the people in that world constantly told me I wasn't good enough. I'm in constant danger of having my phone and car taken by my parents and being forced to drop out of college because they want to lock me up in a facility. Worst of all, I'm terrified to spend time alone with anyone in my family because every single conversation I have one on one is dominated by my ED. I have not had a private conversation with my mom that didn't end in tears or an argument in months. I used to love shopping with her, like you did, just tagging along to target for the hell of it, because even picking out toilet paper feels special when you're hanging with someone you care about.   But now I'm so scared to be alone with her I will get up and change rooms if we're ever alone together.  I love my mom and she loves me, but our relationship has been destroyed by this.  I know it's hypocritical of me to tell you to try to leave this mindset, when I am violently rejecting recovery myself, but I hope my situation gives you some perspective to make a more informed decision. Please choose recovery, and please stay safe. Your mom loves you, so do it for her. ",False,False

Looking back on pictures from that time now, I realize that I wasn’t fat at all. Take care. ❤️",False,False

Everything you don't eat now is gonna have an impact on your entire life. Remember this. Do you want to be brilliant and go to the college of your choice? Have a successful career and make people proud? Remember your long term goals and you surely need a brain to do that. Your brain needs food. Make sure that you take care of yourself.   Being this young and restricting this much is going to hurt you a lot. Bones and eyes problems are going to start very quickly... ,False,False

I know that both my parents would freak out if they found out, and my mom was the one who pushed me to eat and drink water today at target. It’s kind of a weird situation because I hear that a lot of people here don’t have the best family life, but that’s not the case for me.",False,True

What's happening at home that you're on this road? ❤   You'll never get away from the demons by trying to disappear. It only gives them more space to crowd around you trust me I know. Be loud take up space. Don't be afraid to get your needs met. You are good you are enough you are important. ,False,False
