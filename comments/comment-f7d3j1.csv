I don't mean that in the sense of ""losing excess water weight"" (although you might be doing that, also).

Thus, pee.** Please don't make me ELI25 and smart; I'm tired and sick...and I think I need to pee again.  *or, if you are ill, unlucky, or generally doing it wrong, muscle stores as well. :(  **and sometimes sweat, and more humid exhalations, iirc.",False,False
