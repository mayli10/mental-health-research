He hears me purging, and he makes me hot tea. He notices I hadn’t eaten in a few days, and he buys a lot of Gatorade Zero to make sure I’m hydrated. He sees me eating TONS and never says it’s too much. Just holds me when I need him, stays away when I need that.    Idk if it’s because I know he likes skinny girls and i’m borderline, but it’s kinda comforting.",False,False

He thinks I eat more at work and school than I actually do, or I have a 900-calorie OMAD and pretend like I regret eating that much.

It sounds like he suspects but your relationship will be much stronger in the long run if you tell him rather than him having to confront you. I know EDs want secrecy, but your SO may feel hurt, like you don't trust him, if you keep this a secret from him and he confronts you. I can understand that you want to continue losing weight and maybe are not ready for recovery, but you may risk losing a relationship down the line for this eating disorder so you really gotta ask yourself if that is something you're willing to do. Good luck &lt;3",False,False

I told him I have problems with food and issues about how my body looks. I also told him I don't want him to push me to eat things that I know will trigger a binge or that I feel uncomfortable with. It's a lot easier like this than trying to hide things or lie about why I'm not eating chocolate. It also puts me at ease which means I'll be less stressed and we can have a happier life, for example he knows I don't drink sugary soda so he will get me a diet one if we have movie night instead of me having to feel anxious and sip on sugary coke and having a breakdown later that night.",False,False
