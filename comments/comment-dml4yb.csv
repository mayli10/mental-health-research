When I first started, I would take home a bunch of pastries that went out that night to binge on. Gained like 20 pounds. But now I’m so sick of everything we serve, Ive been losing again since I’m constantly running around and only drink black cold brew if I get anything",False,False

My current job only gives me 15% off so it's easy to avoid the food since I'm trying to save money, but when I worked at OG it was impossible. I binged on breadsticks in the back whenever a guest was rude lol. But I only worked there 3 months or so, you get tired of work food quickly.",False,False

I get free food but it’s too much of a hassle to get any. Bc I’m so thin, and have lost some since I was hired, I feel like if I put anything in my mouth my coworkers would applaud me. They always express how thin I am and how I should eat. Sometimes, when I work in the back, I made homemade tortillas. I’ll allow mtseld one glorious tortilla with black beans if I feel up to it. Usually the only thing I eat in the day anyway.",False,False

I work in an office that has catered lunch every day and free snacks and drinks. Actually I was concerned I would gain a lot of weight, but it's just the same food all the time, so I've gotten bored of it actually. For the past few months I've been bringing my own lunch and snacks. Sometimes they also bring in pastries, donuts, and waffles, but I've been able to resist most days (or I'll eat half of one!). I think you'll be ok. I'm sure you'll get tired of the donuts if you're always around them!",False,False

My first week there when I was training I was able to take one free meal a day and honestly just after that I was totally done with pasta for a long time.   The kitchen was always clean and well maintained but that kind of food started grossing me out. Probably because I would see it half eaten in the trash and I’d be scraping it off people’s plates or cleaning up things left on the table cloth or that had fallen on the flood.  I think I was also offput because the smell of Italian food started reminding me of being at work.  So I wouldn’t be worried with your new job. :)",False,False

Mine let us have any food/donuts/drinks for free and oh my god did I binge. Towards the end of me working there I got absolutely SICK of their fake ass food.   Their chocolate and strawberry donuts make me vomit , If I think too hard about a vanilla bean colotta I start to feel sick lol. I would definitely recommend saving 300/400 cals for work if you believe your gonna wanna eat the food that’s there. Also each swirl is roughly 50/60 cals each pump and only the mocha is vegan.",False,False

I also worked in a deli for a few months and after having to slice meat on the slicer I lost my taste for a lot of the food there lmao.",False,False
