Blood DONATION? Definitely don't even recommend attempting without eating something a bit more substantial... Most people get dizzy enough to need to take a snack even when not restricting when giving that much blood.",False,False

Maybe bring a Gatorade (even a Gatorade zero) to drink in case you feel dizzy or faint, too. A snack would be even better!",False,False

Either way Iâ€™d bring a snack just in case,False,False
