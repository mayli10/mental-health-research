I went back to classes in the Autumn and the prettiest, skinniest girl in my class told me “You’re so skinny now!”   Have not yet been able to recreate the orgasmic feeling I had in that second 😂   I’m now at a different school, and had gained 30lbs back before moving there. I’ve got 3 months before I start class again and I’m hoping to recreate that moment with my new friends, who have no idea I was skinny before.",False,False

In general, I get treated better. not sure if it’s the confidence (that I still don’t have, let’s be real) or the actual weight loss but people approach me and talk to me now. It’s weird.",False,False

I'm not even particularly attractive but i can't just ""be invisible"" anymore. People start conversations with me in elevators. They hold doors open for me. Men are in my DMs. People are genuinely interested in what I'm saying and not trying to get away from me as soon as possible. People don't recoil in disgust when I put a hand on their shoulder or arm. I get a lot of unwanted hugs. It's absurd. I get really bitter anytime someone is out-of-the-blue nice to me now bc I know damn well they wouldn't have when I was fat 😒.",False,False
