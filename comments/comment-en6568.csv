I'm enjoying how effortless it is, cos I'm in such turmoil that my stomach is constantly churning. Plus I like that I'm no longer accountable to my husband- No1 to see me naked so I can go as hard as I want. Well, he's actually constantly complaining about how skinny I've got, but with my clothes on he doesn't know the extent of it and has no proof. Plus it's easier to get away without making dinner now. I can give the children theirs and make myself busy tidying up while they eat, and it's much easier to slip under the radar.",False,False

I think up until that point my eating had been disordered, but that’s when it started shifting towards an actual ED. Sometimes I wish I could be that depressed again so I could fast without effort like back then. There’s nothing like that feeling of emptiness unfortunately",False,False

When both my grand dads died I think my heart broke,98% sure it still is but I embraced the whole too sad to eat thing. My heart just hurt too much. Until my nana started fussing and telling me to eat some scones and bread because I needed it. That first scene was the end of me and I started sad binging.",False,False
