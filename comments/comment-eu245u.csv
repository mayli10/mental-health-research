And before I loved it because I was so excited like yes eating my fat cells away autophagy go go go and now I’m drinking all the water I can and have to lay down and be alone and remind my self to breathe and eat lol I grew up comforted by food, then grew to be comforted by the absence of food and surplus of exercise, and now I’m in a bit of a limbo... like I almost wonder if I could channel the hate and hyper sensitivity to pounds on my body I had before I could subside these “silly worries” but I also have to acknowledge this may be a true product of recovery being more concerned for my life than the weight of the body I carry through it. I just can’t shake the feeling and honestly embarrassing romanization of my most sickly form floating carelessly and taking up so little space yet some how feeling so powerful and unstoppable. Maybe it’s missing that discipline I had over myself. But the more I have grown and learned it’s like I simply can’t convince myself to safely fast anymore... I think it’s partly due to 2 separate occasions of fainting in public that have mortified because I researched the causes of those instances as intensely I did the equations and rules I set for my self to lose weight. Sorry for the word vom lol",False,True
