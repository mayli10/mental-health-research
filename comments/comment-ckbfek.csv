Just like some people with anorexia still restrict but eat junk (the idea of why waste calories on foods that don't taste good?). So yeah I guess I'm obsessed with the health of it. I often plan and replan my days to see what foods can hit my protein goals, are good fats and low net carbs.  Veggies are still on my safe list (mostly) and my real fear with fruit is more the idea that sugar is poison and so even the fibre isn't enough for me to trust them.",False,False

I’m definitely considering changing from very low carb (less than 20g daily) that I’m on now to moderately low carb (less than 75g daily or something) at some point. My SO is using keto as a weight loss tool and still has a ways to go so I’m sticking to it since it’s easy to eat the same stuff.  Potatoes, sweet potatoes, carrots off the top of my head are naturally unsafe. All fruits are unsafe, only berries+strawberries are relatively safe. I would die for zucchini, broccoli, cauliflower, cucumbers, eggplant and bok choy.",False,False

Remember, carbs are good for you and have the lowest calorie per gram ratio (technically tied with protein). Fats and protein require so much extra processing to be converted into energy. And 0 fiber in animal products.   What do you consider an unsafe veggie?",False,False
