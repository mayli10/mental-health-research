I’m in a similar situation at the moment, so I kinda understand how you feel. I don’t know if this'll work for you, but what’s helped me has been to put together a list of what I’ve missed/need to work on and setting aside time to do those, even if it’s just five minutes at a time. I also find that my mind goes completely blank if I don’t eat enough beforehand, so I make sure to at least have something before I start.  As much as I’d like to, I can’t tell you whether or not things will get better. I can tell you something some other people have told me: try to take it day by day. It'll be difficult, hecc knows it will. When things get hard, I try to find an anchor. I find activities for myself for certain dates (like watching a certain movie or visiting a nearby museum/historical site) and I make myself hang on 'till then. Then I set another date and repeat the process.  Please don’t forget to take a moment every now and then when you can to do something nice for yourself. Listen to music, draw, take a nap, watch a movie, paint your nails, anything that makes you happy. Also, if you ever feel like you need someone to talk to, feel free to hit me up.  You are strong and awesome no matter how sh***y things may be at the moment. You've got this. I wish you the best!",False,False
