I tired not to make a huge deal about it so she would press more or snoop more but I won’t be spending time with her anytime soon,False,True

My doctor knows that I don’t want my family involved in my treatment because of how they are about food shaming and such. The office actually handled it really well, they didn’t release any info to her, because I am in an outpatient program that no one but my doctor knows about. They just listened to her rant basically",False,True

You're an adult! She literally does not have the right to talk to your doctor about your health without your express permission. And not even in the sense that it's a really shitty thing to do and she shouldn't have done it. I literally mean literally. It is against the law.",False,False
