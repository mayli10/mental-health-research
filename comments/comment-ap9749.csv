I did pretty much the same thing yesterday, first binge of 2019. Hit my lowest weight in probably 6 years and ate a scary amount of OLD pizza and cereal. I literally never eat cereal, dont like it. None of it tasted good and I couldn't stop. And then I got fast food. That I don't even like. And ate it completely. Up 3 pounds today. And while I know it's not 3 physical pounds of fat, I fucking hate myself for it. I knew the consequences and I did it.   Let's just get past Sunday? Let's forgive ourselves instead this time, because idk about you but I'm fucking exhausted with myself. I hope you feel better. ",False,False

I hope it was good and you enjoyed it at least! You can always lose again, but what's the point if you can't enjoy some amazing food sometimes?  *I'm a total hypocrite but really I hope you enjoyed it and remember the bloat will go away, and maybe you're not meant to be underweight anyway and your body needed all that good cheese and cinnamon bread. Hope you're doin okay &lt;3",False,False
