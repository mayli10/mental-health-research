One time the news was doing a report on eating disorders for national eating disorder awareness week &amp; I was praying that my mom wasn’t paying attention to all of the signs &amp; symptoms of EDs cause I didn’t want her to be suspicious but I was so fully engaged in listening to the report. Like my neck snapped up so fast when they mentioned EDs that I nearly gave myself whiplash.,False,False
