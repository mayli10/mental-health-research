I could never do that to my friends and family, but it’s nice to know that if I really wanted to, I could drain my savings, get a one way ticket to France, throw away my phone, and just disappear from this life. It’s nice to imagine that I could start over as a brand new person. Unfortunately, that isn’t the reality. I’d still be me and I’d still be sad",False,True

My true goal in life is opening a theatre company. Once I graduate college I can put that plan in motion.   I have an amazing boyfriend and friends and family in my life and I don’t truly want to leave them. It’s just that the idea of disappearing from this life and starting over fresh somewhere where no one from my old life can find me is really appealing right now. I won’t actually do it, but it’s nice to imagine that I could drain my savings right now and get on a one way flight to france and throw my phone away and start over if I really truly wanted to",False,True

My mom’s death was very sudden. She was perfectly healthy and I was talking to her that morning and then ten minutes later we find her unresponsive and blue in the face. They revived her but she was brain dead so we took her off life support 24 hours later. They said it was likely heart failure.   I hope I can find happiness again. Right now it seems as if everything that would normally bring me happiness is just hallow and worthless. It’s like why should I give a shit about any of this anymore? My mom is dead. That’s all that matters now. I hope you find recovery too. This isn’t something I would wish on anyone,False,True

For some reason I thought the best way to deal with my grief would be to make myself as busy as possible so I wouldn’t have to think about it. Now I’m too busy and don’t even have time to look for a counselor. Maybe once this semester is over I’ll be able to find someone though,False,True

If opening your own bakery or moving to France is a possibility, I urge you to start planning. Don't set it in stone, just plan. Taking a step in any direction is better than standing still somewhere you don't want to be. Take a leap towards something that may make you happy, you never know until you try.  You may want to be alone now, but who knows? At some point, you may meet someone worth being around. I urge you to keep trying, to take some risks. I wish you the best, stranger.",False,False
