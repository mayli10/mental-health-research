I used to mix it in with some oatmeal and pumpkin pie spice. But I don’t eat oatmeal anymore.  I also used to mix it with a box of chocolate cake mix and it would make the fudgiest brownies. Your way sounds way less caloric so I may try that!,False,False

I’ll happily eat canned pumpkin straight up with a spoon.   Last year my OCD latched onto canned pumpkin hardcore and I couldn’t not have at least a 1/4 a day for like 3+ months. After day 30 of canned pumpkin I started getting creative because I was so sick of it so I’ve probably tried every recipe under the sun.   Anyways I’m back on my bullshit so I’ve had 4 cans in the past month. Usually my favorite way to eat it is pumpkin spice and stevia, sometimes microwaved with egg whites to make a custards but today I wanted chocolate sooooo...I made it happen and ate it out of a mixing bowl with a spatula brownie batter style. I’m satisfied. And worried. :/   (If you add granular sugar replacement, pasteurized egg whites and protein powder it takes on a more battery texture which I do recommend.)",False,True
