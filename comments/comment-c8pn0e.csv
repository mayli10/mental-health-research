I have an aunt that started telling me that I need laser hair removal, Botox, and weight loss surgery when I was 13 or 14. After I started struggling with my ED, everyone started complementing me when I was at my LW and sick all the time and my hair was falling out and I was basically a hot mess. My mom‘s whole side of the family is incredibly vain and shallow, and all the women are incredibly thin and pretty so every time I go to a family reunion it’s a trigger 🙃. Last time I saw them, I was at my HW and I had just been diagnosed diabetic, and of course everyone was looking thin and perfect so I was super triggered and trying to restrict the whole cruise (swimsuits 😱😱) and people had to keep making comments about why I wasn’t eating... seriously... and then when we got home my mom told me that there had been several discussions about my weight and why I had gained so much.",False,False

For some reason, it seems really weird to her that I weigh more than her, even though I'm like 10 cm taller.",False,False

I don’t even wear shorts around certain people anymore because they’ll be all “where’d you get those big legs from?” “Cmon hippy hippy” omg. Or, they’ll straight be like “i would give you clothes but every time I see you you’ve gained more weight”  I have to go to a reunion this weekend and I am DREADING IT. I started thinking about my outfit last week and still haven’t decided 🙃 because they legit make me feel like shit",False,False

SOO ANNOYING  ig all you can do is try to block those comments out. ☹️♥️ hugssss,False,False
