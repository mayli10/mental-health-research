She's been exalted to some kind of holy status, people could give a fuck if some morbidly obese chick dies. I really don't believe anyone deserves the hate. Just treat both disorders equally.

It's sad that she's become a person someone uses to get attention on youtube.  I guess they must all be the same?  Whatever my thoughts about are, it's irrelevant.  If she doesn't want to recover then no amount of videos are going to get her to.  It's irritating having them suggested all the time like I want some gossip about her.  I had one come up which I clicked on because it seemed...odd.  A woman who works as a house cleaner is dishing dirt about her family via comments from someone she works with.  Looks like she made the channel solely to do that.  Someone please make it stop.",False,True

It makes me sad. People want to ‚Äúhelp‚Äù her but by mocking her and making fun of her they‚Äôre making it so much worse. In my opinion she doesn‚Äôt encourage ED‚Äôs because she literally doesn‚Äôt ever mention anything about them. I think people sometimes forget that she‚Äôs a real person reading those comments.   Okay, that was a bit off topic but I needed to vent as I was just watching/reading the comments on one of her videos today and it just made me sad. ",False,False
