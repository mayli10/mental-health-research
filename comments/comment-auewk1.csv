I could go up to 82.5kg if I ate carbs / gained water weight. So I would say 3.5kg lost in 7 days. I am not at an extremely high body fat as I’m a weightlifter and 5,9’’  But I would seriously not worry about ‘not losing as much as you like’ :) this is probably the healthiest and fastest way possible, it may seem crazy from the outside but it isn’t, much better and even quicker than doing something actually harmful like eating say 400 calories a day. You can always take a break and go again for less days at the new lower weight, which is what I will probably do.   Day 2 is the hardest, how did it go? Sorry for not responding sooner ",False,False

Three days was my longest fast, but I do IF now and get so excited when my total fasting hours rise! I love seeing how long I've gone each day, because even though its the same amount of hours each day, the total is more than I've ever fasted consistently. It just feels like a nice break from all of the food anxiety, and a breath of fresh air. When I know I'm not eating for a while, I can plan what to eat eventually a lot more calmly. ",False,False

When I know I'm going to fast it's like I can finally relax about that. So I look forward to it just as a break from that constant narrative, but I wouldn't reeally say I'm excited",False,False

If I’m in the middle of a planned binge I’ll be daydreaming about fasting and heavy restriction; if I’m fasting or restricting I’ll barely be able to function for obsessing about the food I’m gonna eat when I’m next “allowed” to. ,False,False
