I know it sounds dramatic but going away to college, although exciting, is a huge stressor and there is nothing that triggers a relapse more than being completely ripped away from your familiar routine and having to adjust to a completely new way of life. unless you decide to be completely antisocial there are definitely going to be social events with food/alcohol constantly and I know it's cliche to say but, you just have to face your fears until they become habit and suddenly it's not so scary anymore. I highly recommend talking to a specialist about it if you're scared that it may make you dip back into old habits because they can help you come up with coping skills so that you can stay healthy. this is an exciting time of life for you, don't let this bullshit get in the way! dining halls usually have a big variety of both healthy and unhealthy options btw so it's not like you're only going to have access to high-cal/challenging foods.",False,False

A lot of people have told me to embrace not knowing and feeling a little clueless, but it truly is hard to internalize. Sometimes it's easy to forget that it's a transition for everyone and it's expected to feel anxious",False,True

As far as dining halls, despite the fact that my schools food sucked booty hole, I was able to find a few meals that I liked enough and felt ok eating and ate them consistently throughout the year. (Boring but functional)   In terms of keeping food in your room, lots of people bring some light snacks, which can be a lifesaver if you’re up late studying and don’t want to leave or are sick and can’t make it to a dining hall. I knew people who had full shelving units they used like a “pantry” but I did fine just with the amount of food that could fit in a Tupperware under my bed. It’s all up to you and what you feel comfortable with!   The best advice that anyone gave me before I started college was to know that everyone is in the same boat going into the year. There is nothing quite like the freshman camaraderie of knowing nothing and nobody, and each person there is just as worried about finding friends and fitting in as you are. You’ll meet people from all different walks of life, and part of that is interacting with people who are differently abled (I.e. needing a feeding tube).   So basically OP, don’t fret, and try to enjoy as much as you can of your first year. It’s not easy to break yourself out of the worried mindset, but don’t forget to let yourself be excited about this new and exciting chapter of your life.   Sorry I basically wrote you a thesis lol. Good luck!!!",False,False
