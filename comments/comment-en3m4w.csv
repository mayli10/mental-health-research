I'm actually male, which maybe i should've mentioned in the post but just didn't think of it at the time...

That man sounds fucking vile and sick, and Iâ€™m so so happy that you were able to get out of that situation. Iâ€™m in awe of how strong you are, honestly.  His words, his actions, and what happened between you two arenâ€™t a reflection of who you are. You arenâ€™t any less worthy of love because of this, your ED, or any other perceived flaw or imperfection you think you have. I sincerely hope that youâ€™re able to seek and receive treatment that helps you heal, and that you learn to love yourself in every single way because you deserve that. While itâ€™s nice to be loved (and I donâ€™t doubt youâ€™ll find many people who love you deeply in all sorts of ways), itâ€™s important to choose to love yourself too.",False,False

It's hard to transition from having someone giving you any kind of attention to just nothing. But I want you to know that you deserve better than someone who hurts you and takes advantage of you. I'm not even into men, but I was in a relationship with an older man because at the time I felt that I would never get attention from anyone else and I was desperate. It ended up as one of the biggest mistakes in my life.   If you ever need to talk to someone, please shoot me a message.",False,False
