Be patient and don’t bring it up before the fact . If he knows what he is doing it will be far too easy to deny.   ***  You can smile understatedly if you want or be neutral but avoid combative tone or else he can make it out to be your fault.  “[Mutual Friend’s name] you know how I appreciate your *intent* to keep me/us laughing; but, I’d like to make you aware what you probably consider to be just teasing is actually something that does bother me. Now that I have enough reason to believe this is going to be an ongoing thing otherwise: I need to tell you that I’d prefer to not have extra attention brought to the unconventional way I enjoy eating anymore. Or else I’m gonna become self conscious about it — I know that’s surprising to hear but I’ve been a little sensitive lately. Thanks for understanding”",False,False

My personal perspective is that confronting someone for making rude, crude, and insensitive comments definitely does not mean their point is true. It’s pointing out that their behavior is uncool. In my book, his comments are unacceptable *regardless* of whether you do or do not have an ED. But I do hear what you’re saying, that maybe it’s just not a door you want to open right now as far as discussion/conversation. And that’s ok too. Do what’s best for you overall!",False,False

You don’t have to confront him, he’s obviously a jerk. But tell your friend you’re sick of his behavior. You don’t have to admit to anything. Just tell her that he makes you not want to hang around her anymore. Maybe she’ll get the hint and you can spend time with her when he’s not around.",False,False

I was actually shocked when he first accused me because no one else ever have.  If I confront him, it’s basically like admitting it’s true and I’m just not ready to let anyone know. If he makes jokes about me being a drug addict, I can brush it off. He can make all his remarks and it wouldn’t effect me. I am just thinking whether my friendship with her is worth dealing with him.",False,True

Like, it sounds more like someone who enjoys pestering and making people uncomfortable than someone being socially clueless. Depending on your personality, you could confront him with a very firm and withering “that is not funny” then next time he makes a ‘joke’. Channel your inner warrior...strong posture, hold dat eye contact. But, another option is to speak with your friend about it. Seems like a good friend would want to address her boyfriend repeatedly trying to make you uncomfortable. She can ask him to grow up and find some empathy and a filter, or she can go out without him. If she can’t do something like that then I’d start wondering whether maybe she’s actually caught in an unhealthy relationship with this dude. However it goes down, remember that you deserve to be treated with kindness and respect. A friend who isn’t able to offer you that...well, I think that’s about the friend, not about you &lt;3",False,False
