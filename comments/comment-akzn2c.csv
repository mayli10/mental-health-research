You can talk about what you’re comfortable talking about, they don’t psychoanalyze the way you think, a therapist won’t say “sound like you’re fucked up, it’s probably because _____ happened to you” they’ll say “why do you think that” or “how can we think about that differently.” Their job is to make you comfortable. You can stop going if you don’t like the person, you can see someone else, finding the right therapist for you is like dating, but the majority are only out for your best interests.",False,False

If you see a mental health professional of any sort (and if you don't, I highly recommend it from my own experience), it might be worth bringing up. Best of luck, stay safe!",False,False
