We have different backgrounds and circumstances, but I have had the same exact thoughts, a couple years ago. I was in the same place. I had the same plan, for christ's sake. The bridge near my house was iffy on whether or not it would be high enough so part of my fuckitall plan was to buy a one way ticket to SF and rack up my credit card there living my last days before jumping off the golden gate.  When I got to the breaking point where I had decided basically to jump in front of a bus instead because it was less work and I couldn't be fucked to execute my cool bridge plan...but instead of doing either for whatever reason, I went to my doctor.   I know everyone is different and has wildly different stories and circumstances, and obviously because I'm on this sub I'm not like ~normal~ but i haven't been truly suicidal in over a year. Things have happened in my life that I wouldn't have fucking DREAMED of happening. You cant predict the future, good or bad, but sometimes, it's worth it to hold out and see if something happens.   You are so young. You can get help for this. I believe in you. &lt;3",False,False

Possible nerve damage? Gabapentin really helped with both a pinched and compressed nerve.

If you genuinely don't care there's not anything to lose in hearing them out?  Secondly, can I just say I remember being 21 and thinking that life was basically over once you were in your 30s and ""old"". I'm in my early 30s now and holy fuck I was so wrong. I feel like I'm only just starting to fully understand myself, to be comfortable making life how I want it to be and speaking up for my own needs. If your 20s are shit (mine were - abusive relationship which gave me PTSD, suicide attempts etc) that is of course awful but there are many, many more decades to live a life you want even if that seems intangible now.

It’s often the case that we can’t see for ourselves how things could get better, but other people can when they’re looking in. I completely understand that things might seem hopeless right now, but I feel so sure that it can and will get better for you.   Are there any medical or therapy avenues that you can pursue? Charities, online support? Rather than spending the money on food and drugs, how about you try one month where you spend a little on some therapy? Whatever you can find that is affordable. Just for one month. Overall that doesn’t make much difference.   We don’t live in the same country so I’m not well versed in what you could access, but I can look online and see what I can find that might help.",False,False
