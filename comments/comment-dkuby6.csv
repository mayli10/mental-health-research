Like don't even react when she starts talking about her ""eating disorder."" If she doesn't get the reaction/attention she wants from you she'll probably stop bringing it up. This has worked for me with friends and coworkers.",False,False

Like just the other day she said “should I buy a $4 drink if I only have $10 in my account??” But the account in question was a student ID card and not a bank account, so the post was just for attention. She’s even done things like spend hours pinning up her super long hair to look like she cut it into a bob so that the next day when it’s down and looks long again and people say “I thought you cut your hair?” She can go “I have no idea what you’re talking about!”",False,True

Just because she’s not losing weight doesn’t mean she may not be engaged in severely disordered behaviors. I look like I eat fairly normally in front of my BF but I’m usually fasting/restricting/purging on the days he’s not around.",False,False

It's a hard thing to discuss because you can't really tell someone they don't have/ are lying about having an eating disorder to gain attention. But you also have to look after yourself since you are clearly triggered by her behaviour.  Space seems like the only logical thing to do here, because it means minding yourself, and distancing yourself from her so she doesn't get that attention shes so seeking, and you can just tell her that you just need some alone time to focus on your cognitive health which is totally okay and doesn't need further attention. If she retaliates with threatening/ self destructive behavior you should seek out a member of her family because you shouldn't have to take on all of that pressure, and only confirms her behavior.",False,False
