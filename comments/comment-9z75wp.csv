Recovery doesn't all mean giving no shits about your weight/appearance. I worked out way more when I was in ""remission"" than I ever did during relapses because, as you said, it makes me feel strong. I love myself way more when I'm fit and eating kinda-enough than when I'm throwing up everything I eat and forcing myself to do a little yoga every day. I also tend to care more about *what* I eat when I'm doing well. Like, in disorder-ruled days I'll eat whatever the hell I want, just in tiny portions, but when I'm actually caring about my body I'm soooo anal about what I'll eat, but not in a restrictive way- just that i'm genuinely respecting my body and want to give it good food to fuel it.
