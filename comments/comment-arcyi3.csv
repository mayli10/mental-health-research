Everyone there will be from all backgrounds/sex/genders and different ED types/stages so it’s good to hear different perspectives. You’re all there for the same reason and it’s good to feel the solidarity in the room and to giggle about the same habits and cry together over the same bullshit. Imagine this reddit community, but real life and in a room together. You don’t have to open up and talk every time but it’s realllllly therapeutic. If you have a good group of people it’ll be amazing. I hope you go and it brings you some peace. xxxx",False,False

You meet people from all walks of life- all shapes and sizes- and everyone is so understanding and supportive. There’s power in solidarity.",False,False

The fears you have are super common and something I think about when showing up to group each week, but ultimately the benefits of solidarity and reinforcing that I am not alone in this struggle outweigh the difficulties that can croup up when I notice other members are in smaller bodies.",False,False
