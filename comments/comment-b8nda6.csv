I struggle with this because I have Crohns and gastroparesis, and while going a long time without food usually makes me feel better, there’s a certain stomach pain that I would describe as “like nothing but uncoated aspirin tablets and black coffee on an empty stomach”—kind of a more acidy, miserable punched in the stomach sensation. A handful of saltine crackers will help, but that’s calories, so I’m fine ^nevermind.  Source: Crohns=entire digestive system (including stomach) chock-full of ulcers all the damn time for years.",False,False
