I‚Äôve tried a few and it‚Äôs honestly not very good in my opinion, but it might be worth a try. They sell it at Walmart and Target, I think I saw it at Sprouts but I don‚Äôt go there very often so I couldn‚Äôt tell you for sure.   https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07BLNXR7B/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_api_i_0aEqDb7RC7E2H   Other than that, I usually just use balsamic vinegar for everything lol.",False,False

Yes I was insane. I thought balsamic vinegar was tasty but I was scared of the calories (20 per tablespoon I think?). Versus, red wine vinegar is maybe 5 per tablespoon. I might be wrong about the exact amounts, this was a few years ago. But yeah anyway my ""meal"" would be 30kcal of lettuce with 10kcal of red wine vinegar. basically 3 star restaurant level cooking right there üíØüíØüíØ",False,False

(Not vinaigrettes) Whole Foods and Target sometimes have a couple, but your best bet is a local olive oil &amp; balsamic vinegar store. My favorite I‚Äôve found was Blackberry Ginger flavored and there are SO many if you find a local shop. Mostly ~50 calories per serving!",False,False
