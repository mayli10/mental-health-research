People would instantly connect the dots and it would cause a lot of concern that I could avoid by just pretending EDs don't exist.  The root cause of my ED is a desire to be accepted and seen as normal, describing how I binge and vomit foods wouldn't really do a great service for that. But it is a good topic because it's generally seen as a taboo subject and most people don't have any idea about bulimia other than it involves throwing up.
