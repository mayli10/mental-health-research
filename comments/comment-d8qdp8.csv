I am neither naÃ¯ve nor do I lack experience (mid 30's, married for almost 10 years, dated a bunch before my husband). If someone is saying shit like this, to make you feel bad or whatever the fuck their motivations are, they do not deserve you (no matter what you might think of yourself, because I know self-esteem can be a bitch)! Your partner should help you, lift you up and most of all make you feel good. If they aren't treating you nicely, then gtfo of that relationship because that should the bare minimum. Being alone, as scary as that can be, is so much better than being with someone who makes you feel like shit.",False,False

Because you're not the first one writing about that exact experience.  If he finds you fat (in a negative way, as is apparent here), why are you together in the first fucking place?

He comments on your eating habits and body in ways no man ever should, and it will hurt to leave him but not as much as it will hurt long-term to stay in such a toxic relationship. He is only happy to control and belittle you and you seem very upset in the relationship.  I hope you have someone you can reach out to and confide in IRL, but if you don't my message inbox is always open.",False,False
