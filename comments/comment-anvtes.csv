You seem really mature. I mean you're handling this tough situation really well. I hope the rest of the semester goes well and you can find a way to cohabitate with her &lt;3   It's not your fault your mom is like this. From what I can tell, you haven't done anything. Your mom kind of seems like she has some underlying issues :/ She is so irrationally angry about these things. I get coming home in a bad mood, but I feel like I learned in my early 20's that you can't take your bad day out on the people around you... Much less your children, even if they are adults.

I really _am_ grateful that she lets me live in her house for low rent, because it means I can continue with my ballet training (which costs hundreds of pounds a term) while doing my PhD. And I know she low-key does not like me, so she's making a sacrifice by letting me stay with her. Sometimes I feel so down knowing that my own mum doesn't seem to like me, but then I remember that I have lots of friends who do, and an amazing boyfriend who does, and this amazing online community of people like yourself who know the worst things about me (that I keep from my friends and boyfriend) and are still supportive and don't think I'm an awful person for hanging a mug on a wrong hook or being underweight or wanting a clean table. Thank you.",False,True

You should be grateful because she lets you live there for very little rent? What the fuck is that? Your mom CHARGES YOU RENT WHILE YOU'RE TRYING TO GET YOUR PHD THIS IS NOT GROOVY.   Also that kitchen nightmare sounds like abuse. Good Lord. You're trying to be grateful through it T.T You're so nice. I'm so so sorry OP ,False,False
