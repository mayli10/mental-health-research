You can legit die, it‚Äôs not worth it, and if you keep going the fun things you will have to look forward to include but not limited to, hair falling out, puffy face, destroying your teeth (so embarrassing looking like a meth head) bad skin, bad breath, digestive issues, nails that break, and that‚Äôs just looking at it from a vanity perspective.

I wish you all the best",False,False
