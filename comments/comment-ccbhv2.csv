Try sticking to a strict calorie goal and bump it up by 100 calories every time you binge until you get to a point where you don't binge.   For example, I eat 600-800 a day. This is the perfect amount for me because I'm still losing quite a lot and it satisfies me, but if I eat under 600 then I binge so I make sure that I don't go below that - even if I really really feel motivated to eat less. Remember that eating anything under your TDEE will lead to weight loss. It might be slower than super high restriction or fasting but it is far easier and more successful in the long run",False,False
