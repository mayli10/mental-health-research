There's no shade at all... It's just a HUGE area without anything that would provide shade. My boyfriend and friends, who go with me, have all been there a few times, but it's my first time and it's only one day.  I wanted to bring an umbrella for shade but nope, they're not allowed in the event area. And my friends already know about my circulation system (and because I passed out during the last and only concert I've been to.   Spray bottles - not allowed (not even sunscreen with a spray or pumping function - only tubes). A fan is a good idea, but I'm not sure if they're allowed and I only have one from a vacation to Barcelona and in case it's not allowed, I would have to throw it away and I don't want to lose this souvenir. You're not even allowed to bring your own water. Only empty foldable bottles to fill with water INSIDE the event area, where they provide standpipes.  With a hat I get dizzy more easily and I don't own any ""summer hats"" at the moment because of this. We'll leave tomorrow around 9am and I can't buy anything anymore before the festival. And I don't really have super breathable summer clothes that I would wear in public. And that's exactly ONE POINT I get so angry about, because I KNOW EXACTLY what I want to wear and the clothes fit... but I feel too insecure about my body and I will feel so ashamed when I am wearing this... So I have no clue what I am going to wear since I feel like a fat pig at the moment and just want to cry out of anger and not go there at all and waste those super expensive tickets.   Thanks for trying to help, but this is something I just can whine about because noone can help me with this... (or can you just take all the fat on my body and put it in the trash? and give me more blood instead, so I won't pass out?)",False,True

Make sure you eat before you go in if you can, and drink PLENTY of water. If you’re worried about the sun, I suggest telling your friends that you’ll need lots of shade in order to keep from passing out. An umbrella might be a good move! Also see if they sell spray bottles or handheld fans, those are both nice for beating the heat.  Try and look forward to it as best as you can. Wear comfortable shoes and clothes that are breathable, maybe buy a pashmina if you want to have something to cover you up. Wear a hat!!!",False,False

I mean, it's just. I don't even want to eat... but I have to eat, if I don't want to pass out in the heat, but then I'll look pregnant and my fucking ED messes with my brain :(",False,True

I have been hearing it discussed on the news some.,False,False
