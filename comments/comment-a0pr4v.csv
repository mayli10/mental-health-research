I was feeling overwhelmed for Months prior to my relapse. And then I got weighed at the doctor's office oct 19th and it's been down hill from there! I am fighting it. I'm getting together a treatment team BEFORE I feel myself slip off the deep end. I'm trying to keep myself off the deep end but sometimes I'm so overwhelmed I literally can't even care to eat even if I AM trying to eat. This is such utter fucking bullshit. I look great now. I'm very active and I was recovered for four years. I need to get a handle on this lol. ,False,False

I recognized how bad things were getting at the start of September and have been trying to move towards recovery. Every time I have a ""good day"" it's followed by panic and the urge to restrict heavily. Last week I started restricting again because I just couldn't stand the cycle of feeling like I was on the road to better, and then immediately panicking whenever my face ""looks"" rounder or when I feel bloated. I also want to get back to a happy place, but it feels so out of reach at the moment.",False,False

And I'm so alone in my suffering. Both of my best friends have boyfriends and the guy I like just got a girlfriend. I got out of a toxic toxic toxic mess with someone in the spring but ever since then I've been so lonely I've deadass contacted my abuser again just to get support from SOMEONE. It's the worst. I genuinely feel unlovable.,False,True
