This might be a substitute for asking you how you are, trying to connect, showing concern etc. I would approach this with curiosity, unless you have evidence that he disregards your preferences/boundaries in other areas ❤️",False,False

""You can not keep giving me food (if he knows about your ED, say: it's triggering and makes me feel bad/ if he doesn't, women just don't eat as much as men and I don't want the food and I don't need the food), you need to respect me, my autonomy and my body. If you can't I'll either not be around you while we have food or I'll have to reconsider this relationship.   This isn't about the food, as much as it is about your unwillingness to hear me when I say no. It's a red flag, it's dismissive, it's rude and it's unhelpful.   If you truly care about me, you'll stop, and you'll consider *me*""",False,False

Time to point out that he’s not doing what he agreed to?  It’s strange though. Especially asking multiple times during one meal. Assuming he’s not doing it to be a jerk, it almost sounds like compulsive behavior? Could it be a learned behavior from his parents or maybe a response to growing up in a food insecure household? Does he do this with other friends/family or just with you? ...Just some random thoughts.  Regardless, you’re in the right here.",False,False
