I have been where you are and to a large extent, I still am. It’s a daily battle to keep reminding yourself that there is a way out of this and a life on the other side, especially when you have lost so much and recovery feels like heading out into the pitch black without a flashlight and you don’t know what is on the other side. It’s the harder choice in so many ways.  But at the same time, I believe in you. You are not ‘the anorexic girl’. You are so much more than that and I am not saying that flippantly. You deserve to have a life and it is never too late to try no matter how far gone or how much has been lost.  I have had this disorder for a really long time now and I know it will leave a scar. In reality, I don’t know if I will ever fully disentangle myself from it. But I refuse to lose any more of my life to it. For the first time in years, I feel there could be a life out there. But it’s fucking scary.  Be brave, anorexia is an illness. Keep fighting xx",False,False

I am not sure how old you are but you still have a lifetime to pursue them. Drug addicts can get clean, they aren’t delegated to “drug addict” for rest of their life.   It will be scary but leaving anorexia is the ONLY way to even have the *possibility* for a real life. You are not “The Anorexic Girl”. You are “u/rerrerofocher” who is likely smart, passionate, kind, etc...and also happens to struggle with a mental disorder. You will always be “u/rerrerofocher”  with all those traits that define you before your ED ever does.   Clinging to anorexia as your identity will probably kill you because recovery will mean “losing you”. I speak from painful experience. The only way out is to be brave. Good luck.",False,False
