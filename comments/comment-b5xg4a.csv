This is EXACTLY what went through my head when I saw the girl. The shirt made me feel the same way it feels when someone with a little bit of a perfectionist streak diagnoses themselves with OCD. If they actually had it, they wouldn‚Äôt be making light of it because of how torturous and debilitating it actually is. Like it sort of made me feel like ‚ÄúI‚Äôll bet she doesn‚Äôt even know what a real binge looks like. I‚Äôll bet she eats a single serving of ice cream in the middle of the afternoon and then posts the empty bowl on Instagram with the caption: ugh I just binged soooo hard, I‚Äôm such a fatty lol.‚Äù",False,True

On a more serious note though, sometimes this kind of thing makes me so sad. Like these funny ""foodie"" quotes about eating a lot etc.  I have gone from long time restricting and purging to a full blown BED, to the point where I can barely control myself. I still kind of have the same mindset from the restrictive phase, but it's not strong enough, so it just clashes with the uncontrollable urge. I've hated myself before and now that I'm gaining absurd amounts of weight at the speed of light, I feel like I'm going crazy. I'm haunted by food. Binges are very traumatic for me.  So when I see quotes like this, I can't help but think how far away from normal life I am. Binging is seen as fun, being joked about. This T-Shirt is supposed to be funny, and for most people it will. However, it has quite the opposite effect on me. In no way am I hating on people who wear/like this quote or anything. It's just that it reminds me of the rapidly expanding gap between me and ""normal life""  that I'll most likely never be able to cross. And that makes me very, very sad.   I'm sorry for ruining the fun with a rant, it's just something that came to mind while reading this post.",False,False
