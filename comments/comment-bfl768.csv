Has she gained weight lately, even just a bit? Because a couple of otherwise nice friends would say the most out of pocket things about my weight completely randomly when they started gaining. It freaks them the fuck out especially if they've always been thin and they're obsessing over it in their mind so it just slips out.  That said, it was still a shitty thing to say and not even true! I hope your friend recognises that it was a bad thing to say. You can let it slide for now, but if she says anything like that again, you should put your foot down and say that it's a really inappropriate and discouraging thing to tell somebody, especially a friend, and that you didn't ask for her opinion.",False,False

On the other hand, I have recommended weight loss surgery for friends before. My mother has had weight loss surgery, and she’s at a very healthy skinny weight now. But I would never say it to someone who has an ED, I am so sorry.",False,False

Not supportive at all!  I would say just don't mention weight loss to anyone. People tend to be less sensitive with people who are overweight, a bit like they don't think they can hurt their feelings... Just say that you have some stomach pain or anything.  So sorry they were rude with you, people are cruel in general.",False,False

It sounds like a lot but because I’m bigger than average it doesn’t look like as much. She’s always been thinner than me and she’s never said anything like that so I’m just so confused and hurt rn. After she said it she proceeded to say “I’m happy for you tho” it was very passive aggressive,False,True
