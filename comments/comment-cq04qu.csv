I told my doctor when I was 16 and he never said a word to my parents. He advised that I could come alone if I want to talk about 'private stuff' and my mum would just come in for a summary of what pills I would be taking (the reason he gave her was always a vague one, and he never gave out my 'secret'",False,False

They might suggest it, but they won't try and force you to do anything. Getting a diagnosis really helped me.  They might want to do some extra stuff like a blood test or an EKG to make sure your disordered behavior hasn't harmed your body, but its much better for your future care if they know about this now.",False,False

Unless you are under age doctors are sworn to secrecy unless it comes to a point where it is threatening your life at the moment you are talking to him.
