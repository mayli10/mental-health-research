Just another opportunity for self care! Buy/make a super nice face mask for yourself. I love lush for face masks, but there are a ton of diy recipes out there if lush isn’t an option",False,False

It’s horrible, I’ve been in a binge purge cycle that I’m trying to get out of and it is breakout central over here. I’m so ashamed and self conscious because I feel like all of my coworkers are judging me and I know I’m judging myself. I feel so disgusting but I’m telling myself that if I continue to nourish my body properly, drink plenty of water and sleep, eventually it will clear up. Hopefully we’ll both get through this shitty time.",False,False

It's like in puberty when the rush of estrogen makes you break out.   It *will* go away.   It *will*.   You just have to be strong until it does.   In the mean time don't pick at it and hang tough (though i know both those things are easier said than done.)  You are doing so well. This is proof of that and that alone makes it beautiful because there is nothing more beautiful than a human body bouncing back from the brink.   I am so damned proud of you and you deserve to be proud of you too.",False,False
