It’s not mentioned in this article but several members of the “secretin super family” seem relevant to appetite/feeding behavior    &gt;There are only 10,000–20,000 orexin-producing neurons in the **human brain**...       &gt;They project widely throughout the central nervous system, regulating wakefulness, feeding, and other behaviours.     &gt;...  the discovery of the orexins to reflect the orexigenic (appetite-stimulating) activity of these peptides...  1998 paper describing these neuropeptides, they also reported discovery of two orexin receptors, dubbed OX1R and OX2R...  &gt; Orexin increases the craving for food, and correlates with the function of the substances that promote its production.    &gt; **Leptin** is a hormone produced by **fat cells** and acts as a long-term internal measure of energy state. **Ghrelin** is...  secreted by the **stomach** just before an expected meal, and strongly promotes food intake.  Note: Sometimes Leptin is called the “satiation hormone” and Ghrelin is called the “hunger hormone”  ***  &gt;Orexin-producing cells have recently been shown to be inhibited [*hindered/subdued*] by leptin...but activated by ghrelin and hypoglycemia...Orexin, as of 2007, is claimed to be a very important link between metabolism and sleep regulation  &gt;OXA stimulates glucose uptake... inhibits lipolysis and stimulates the secretion of adiponectin.  Not directly feeding or weight related but possibly indirectly related to eating habits for people with eating disorders:  &gt; Preliminary research has been conducted that shows *potential* for orexin ***blockers** in the treatment of cocaine, opioid, and alcohol addiction  Seems very important. In my head I use the acronym “goals” to remember the peptides/hormones mentioned all have something to do with each other.  Blah blah blah Insulin, amylin, Agrp, and neuropeptide Y also indirectly related to feeding behavior and appetite blah blah blah",False,True

The former is having too low of a sodium concentration while the latter is having too high of one.  Note also that in hypernatremia the “hyper” is still fully preserved and that it would be very difficult to confuse the two phonetically.,False,False
