I tried my sister's scales a few days ago and that didn't go well. So now I'm trying to wait until I go back home in a few weeks. I know I'll eventually cave.  I don't really weigh myself for the 'number' but just to see that number go down, because if it goes down and stays down then I've lost weight. I know that my scales are 8lbs above my doctor's scales, and that's the weight that is officially recorded (but she really needs a knew pair).",False,False

It's $60 on Amazon. Pretty pricey but worth it IMO if weighing yourself causes you immense stress like it does me. I was previously using a $12 digital scale that sent me down a literal suicidal thought spiral because it told me I weighed 25 whole pounds heavier than I actually was.   The expensive scale isn't perfect, but I like it because it estimates your body fat percentage and water weight. Being on your cycle, eating salty or sweet foods, exercising too much etc all cause water retention and it's nice to see that I didn't actually gain real fat after walking 5 miles and pigging out on pickles.

I'm going to edit the post and give you credit for it.  Also, I apologize, I have no recommendations for scales because it seems like no matter how many you try, none are perfect. How can one know how they truly weigh when they all spit out different numbers? Shrug.",False,True

I really got into a cycle once where, despite knowing for a fact that water weight existed and was normal, i would do almost anything to get rid of it before my normal morning weighing (laxative teas, fasting half the day before, whatever). Then found out the scale was off by about 1.5 lbs anyway and got rid of it.   Do you have any recommendations for a bathroom scale that is more accurate than the shitty $13 ones? Just for some peace of mind",False,False
