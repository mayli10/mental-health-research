SO close to my goal weight after being overweight my entire life and losing about 40 lbs almost healthily the last year so I don’t want to... but I agree, eating at least something would probably be best!!

I was contemplating the same thing but I know if I don’t eat the next two days I’ll end up binging on Christmas and feel disgusting and hate everything so I’m gonna eat around maintenance the next two days. I know I’m less tempted to binge if I’ve been giving my body food throughout the day and if I plan/prep my meals I feel guilty if I don’t eat them and it helps me stay on track ,False,False
