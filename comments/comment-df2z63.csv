I love it here but itâ€™s such a hard place to be sometimes.

And our nutritional education is shit poor and it all starts with the lunches they served us in school. It was usually chicken sandwiches, pizza, cheese sticks, chocolate milk or whole milk, a cup of fruit or veggies most kids would toss, and by middle school there was a snack line loaded with ice creams, fizzy drinks, soft pretzels, chocolate milk, etc. by high school we had off campus lunch and snack vending machines. Luckily over the course of the time i was in school they started changing all of the drinks to diet drinks and took out the vending machines with snacks.",False,False

The ingredients were always super premium compared to ours being full of things like high fructose corn syrup.  We didnâ€™t keep track of inventory so I used to c/s sooooooo much shit at the end of the night ðŸ¤¤,False,False

Every time i go visit my relatives there I end up in binge/purge cycles again, because ... well, i dunno if you've been to a run-of-the-mill Swedish (not even Swiss, motherfuckers) grocery store - their candy aisles are like goddamn HEAVEN compared to the 3 flavors of hershey garbage i find at US grocery stores.  and don't even get me started on ""Cream Ice Cream"" (GrÃ¤ddglass=Ice cream made from heavy cream instead of milk)",False,False

Luckily I can avoid most fast food because it's not conveniently located to me (I don't drive), and my city has way more local places than fast food chains. My old house used to be a 5 min walk from McDonald's and Popeyes, and it was much harder to prevent binging. I mean now I live around a shit ton of restaurants and local places, but I don't get cravings for them, plus they're at least $10-12/per person, so it's not cheap.",False,False
