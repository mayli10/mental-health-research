Whenever I want to lol myself I just think ‚Äúnot until you‚Äôre pretty/at your UGW‚Äù. It‚Äôs fucked and I‚Äôm trying to steer away from that as my only ways to counter Suicide. So I try to think about happy things like ‚Äúto be 21‚Äù or ‚Äúto see my dog‚Äù.  Last semester my mental health reached one of its lowest points and I was trapped in a binge/purge/ restrict cycle. My grades were terrible but I was hesitant to get help cuz I wasn‚Äôt at my UGW and feared the weight gain. Eventually I had to withdrawal from the semester and go into treatment.   I know psych wards suck and are very scary, but sometimes getting a break and recharge is needed. Do you have a therapist or psychiatrist to talk to about this?",False,False

My eating disorder is keeping me from killing myself for different reasons, but I get how it feels like a temporary blessing when other mental health problems feel worse.
