Massive wake up call. I stopped for a very long time immediately. And after that I only became all the more aware of what I was doing to my body. It's important to remain consistently conscious of absolutely all the side effects this illness produces to us as we willingly submit to it. I advise doing a ton of research on it. Recovery is long-ass process that takes a lot of patience with a self forgiving attitude, you will have your good days/weeks/months and so you will with the bad. Please do not give up on bettering yourself, we are all going through the same thing only with different circumstances.",False,False

I’m calling my school’s advice nurse to hopefully get some help with this (especially since I tried to make an appointment with a doctor but the nearest i could book is 2 weeks from now). I’ll try going to somewhere if I still feel it after a while or if I feel any worse.   I really, really appreciate you responding and helping me out. I’m definitely a bit calmer now (I was definitely freaking out when I first felt the pain). This is kind of my first experience with a really scary side effect of ed behavior so of course it’s terrifying. Thank you so much for talking to me and helping me out. I appreciate it so much and I hope that you are doing well yourself.",False,True

It is a good sign that I don’t think there’s any bleeding?? I tried to produce some spit and I didn’t see anything weird. I don’t really taste any blood or anything either. Is that good? The pain is coming from the back of my throat, kinda just where it connects w the back of my mouth, not any lower.",False,True
