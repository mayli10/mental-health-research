I've seen pictures of girls really close to my height and weight who very clearly wouldn't be able to fit into the same clothes I wear just because their shape is different. Sometimes it's due to having a larger bone structure or maybe a higher body fat percentage or even just carrying their fat in different places than I do. At the same time, sometimes my body shape means I can't fit into clothes that should be in my size because they're simply made for a different body shape. This biggest offender is anything that's meant to show off your bust because I have a very small chest. I often see that certain companies will expect people of my size to still weigh a lot more just on account of have much bigger boobs so my stats will check out for waist and stuff but then the bust measure will be way too big. Sometimes even when size charts say the bust measure should be fine for me they still often design their garments for bigger breasts. It's like in terms of cup size it's fine but then they expected a different shape so it ends up fitting wrong.",False,False

I literally despise shopping because my top half is so small but I have very long legs and wide hips and jeans almost never fit in both the legs and the waist",False,False

I was just there a couple weeks ago and bought a pair of pants that was a comfortable fit in an XS. During the same trip I found another pair of pants that I bought in an 8 but probably would have gotten in a 10 if they had it on the shelf tbh ü•¥ (I usually wear 4-6 in pants for reference).

She could be very short and very fit so that even with BMI 23 she is actually quite small... but then again, if that is the case, her vanity size complaint is BULLSHIT and she should shut the f up. If she is really small then it is no wonder that XS is too big. It's like when someone who is 4' 10"" says being a size 4 makes them skinny. NO, you are just short!   The others, argggg yes. I started to rage just reading  your post, even though I personally haven't come across the vanity sizing bullshitting in a while (probably because I stopped looking at the fatlogic sub so much). I get really enraged because I have trouble understanding how/why people just outright lie like this, yet it must be a lie because it doesn't make sense. So it hurts my brain a lot.",False,False

Not to that extreme but still. Sizing varies so much from brand to brand and even sometimes within the same brand.   Work pants- tried on a bunch of JC Penny‚Äôs whatever house brand they have size 4s, WAY TOO HUGE. Tried on 4s at Gap and Loft, could barely get them past my thighs.

Just because you can fit yourself into something does not mean that it ""fits"" you. There are probably quite a few stores where I could squeeze into a size small, but that absolutely does not make it vanity sizing. It just means that I've stretched the fabric to its limit and wrapped myself up like a little turducken.  On the flipside, sometimes I like the way clothing looks on people when it's ""too small"" (i.e. fits but differently than intended), just like I like how clothes that are ""too big"" can look oversized. But that's not the fault of the clothing manufacturers or labels.  Not even touching on whether these people - if they're not completely lying - are accurately measuring their own size/BMI...",False,False
