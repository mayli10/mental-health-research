I feel like the others here have already explained it quite well so I won't repeat everything they've already said. But please accept my apologies I really didn't mean it as a ""people that have found a set point are full of shit"". I meant that many make the set point seem like this magical thing that ""your body knows where it wants to be and it will find it and everything will be great"" while in reality it's more of like if you're at a weight you can effortlessly hold while feeling satisfied then you've hit a home run, that's what you're striving for. But there's no magic to it you've just found a balance where your CICO matches your life and you're also satisfied with it, that's the hard part!",False,False

It's the point where you maintain weight by eating what satiates you.  You're right that set point doesn't defy the laws of physics, you're not going to weigh 124.6 lbs exactly if you deliberately eat more or less than you burn. Set point is just the weight that's easiest for your body (including your brain) to maintain",False,False

There's a lot of evidence that supports it to some extent, or under certain conditions.  I know that no matter where I start out at (over or underweight), whenever I start to feel better and just eat without worrying about it (well I guess I always think about it a little), when i'm not counting calories and not trying to gain or lose, I tend to drift back to the same weight. Every time.  Set point theory doesn't defy physics. It doesn't mean that CICO won't work if you eat less or more calories that you burn. But it does play a role in the hormones that control appetite. So if you're below your normal weight, you'll be hungrier and if you're above it you'll feel less hungry and fidget more/increase metabolism slightly. It can change a bit over time as your body ""gets used to"" your current weight though. And I think they're finding out now that it also changes over time. Basically your body likes to maintain, not gain or lose, and your appetite will change slightly to try to reverse any short-term gain or loss.  But like I said, the research results are mixed. If you are comfortable with the weight you're at, and it helps you to think of that weight as your ""set point"", why not? It hasn't been disproven.",False,False

Set point theory is just the theory that everyone has a set weight point that they gravitate towards naturally, even if it's higher or lower than you'd normally consider healthy. I don't know how I feel either way about the veracity and tend to just vaguely go by CICO, but it's worth googling and reading studies if you want to.",False,False
