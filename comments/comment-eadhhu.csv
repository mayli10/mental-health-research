A person who eats a lot of processed food or a person who doesn't eat enough may need one, but there might also be better options. I used to take vitamin D, then for a while I took a multivitamin and calcium+magnesium, but I realized that I don't actually need the calcium+magnesium every day, only I don't get enough calcium from whatever I ate, so now I just take the multivitamin. I track my nutrition though, so I can tell if I need the calcium+magnesium at the end of the day or not. Just make sure to take the right one for your needs. Every multivitamin is different, even if they're formulated for the same kind of person. I personally take the Jamieson brand women's multivitamin. I considered One A Day for a while, but Jamieson better suits my needs.",False,False

I think the chances of the vitamins being absorbed is better and it's not so hard on the stomach. Bonus is that it's sweet and I use it as ""dessert"" to signal that I'm done eating for the day.",False,False

I had been worried about vitamins for a while but especially recently. I‚Äôve been bruising all over, even just squeezing a pimple on my arm left a quarter sized bruise üòÇ but I remember hearing that you should be careful taking iron supplements because it can be toxic   I couldn‚Äôt be bothered to look at the ingredients in every vitamin, so I just grabbed the ‚ÄúOlly‚Äù brand women‚Äôs multivitamin. Has 200% D3, 100% E, 150% B6, 150% B12, 100% Folic Acid, 127% biotin and some other stuff. I mostly grabbed it though because I‚Äôm a sucker for gummy vitamins because it feels like dessert haha",False,True

However, if your diet is lacking in nutrients, it wouldn't be anything but helpful for you to take a vitamin. Make sure you check the directions to see if you should take it at a meal time.  Fwiw taking vitamins has helped my hair and nail growth after an extended period of malnutrition and my skin has cleared a bit as well.",False,False
