I cried because of this because I was so frustrated! I‚Äôve been eating 300-500 for about two months and last week I was like, ‚Äúyou know what screw you ED! I‚Äôm gonna eat 1200 today it will be like a binge and I‚Äôll prove I can quit whenever!‚Äù But couldn‚Äôt get past 700 without feeling like I was gonna pop.

My stomach definitely can not handle volume at this point and I used to be a huge volume eater! So now when I do eat I try to focus on healthy foods only. I know at this point every calorie needs to count for nutrition to keep my body from doing *too* much damage. (not a slight at your mac and cheese at all!! I still drink wine and enjoy chocolate)  I don't know if my stomach is 'shrinking' or if my mind is just Telling me I'm not hungry, when I logically know I have to be at this point. It's the blurry line between ed brain and 'real life'. ",False,False
