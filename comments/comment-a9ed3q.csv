I had lost a lot of weight while manic (Iâ€™m bipolar) and was super excited about it. Then I got depressed and gained 25 fucking pounds in two months. I donâ€™t even know how a person gains that much weight as quickly as I did. :( ,False,False

Iâ€™ve seen a 12 pound increase on the scale over the course of 2 days.  A few days of correction eating and I only gained 2-3 pounds.  And that was maybe still with some water retention.  I hope you feel betterðŸ’•,False,False

Food weight? Gobs of greasy, gelatinous, sticky fat? Your guess is as good as mine.   Just kill me now. ",False,False
