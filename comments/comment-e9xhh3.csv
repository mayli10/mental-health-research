My mother loves to give me food gifts and it sucks because it’s all my old favourite binge foods and it’s hard to tell her to stop when I used to appreciate them for so many years.  So food gifts either make me feel excited because they’re an “excuse” to binge, as if I have no choice, or I feel anxious because I know they’re going to go bad.   Best case scenario I regift them but either way, I still somehow appreciate the thought behind them.",False,False

Food is consumed and gone.  Although, half my list is just liquor or wine gifts.  Some of the others are cheese.  But, I mean...people like food gifts.  Normal people.",False,False
