I have run out of patience with people insulting my intelligence and lived experience with their asinine ""advice"". Both for EDs and other chronic conditions. The most annoying combo of  words in the English language has got to be ""What you need to do is..."" aaaAaaaArhGhhh.   EDs=/=Diets gone wrong (tm).    The idea that we have never encountered the concept of healthy diet and exercise, CICO etc is so insulting. And tbh I tend to say as much these days. ðŸ˜¤  I've been restricting compulsively on and off forever but I've honestly never been on a ""diet"". I've never had that healthy logical relationship with CICO. I've never decided to go on a diet and lose (or gain) a sensible amount of weight. My disorder doesn't restrict my eating to make me look better on the beach, it doesn't make sensible food choices based on macros. It's not rational, it's a mental aberration.",False,False

I basically just internalized it at the time because what do you say to that? It made me really hate myself a lot more, as well as contributed to the shut down of communication between us because I no longer felt safe enough to open up.   If I could do it over again, I would maybe say something about the science of it all, and try to remain as objective as possible.   It's so triggering to hear that though.",False,False
