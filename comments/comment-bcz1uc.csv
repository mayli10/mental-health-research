Also the more oversized they are the better they are for layering sweaters etc underneath when you need to.,False,False

I have been reeeeeallly broke most of my adult life and as a result my fashion choices have always been... quirky. I feel like someone with more of an eye for personal style could really rock a system like this (::cough:: my fucking sister ::cough cough::)  I hope it helps :)  I shop at thrift stores like St vinnie's or Goodwill and  buy things I can layer easily. Things like thin tanks, plain fitted tees, and plain long sleeved shirts. This way I basicly wear different amounts of the same clothing all year round. I also buy all my clothes in the same color spectrum so things match. Right now I have mostly black/off black, grey, and striped clothing. My striped items are mostly just two colors so still pretty plain (ie white and yellow, black and grey, black and darker black lol)  On any given day I have on a tank top, a short sleeved shirt (or two if its cold), a long sleeved shirt (or two it its cold), a THIN hoodie, and a jacket as needed. You can do the same with flannel shirts in there if that's your thing. Same with cardigan sweaters. I like hoods and pockets. Because I buy thin (dead: cheap) clothing it doesnt look bulky. I also tend to wear bras that are too big because my tits take the worst of the weight swing and so the extra layers help hold things in place ;)  I find layering especially great here on the west coast where it could be 45¬∞  when I leave the house in the morning, 75¬∞ by midday and cold again once the sun goes down. I can take layers off during the day if I need to.  I feel like bottoms are easier. I have an array of skinny jeans, mostly black, in slightly different sizes. When I shop I look for Lee and I know they're number system. I will wait and look for decent pants because good brands fit and wear better. Find a brand that fits you well and buy that brand. I dont wash my jeans very often so I only have 4 pair that fit really at any time. The rest are in a box waiting if I need them.  Conversely one could buy LOTs of cheaper leggings but I'd buy them new in that case. My sister pulls this off really well but replace that crap when the elastic starts to go!   I dont like skirts/shorts so they aren't on the list. I feel like the same principles apply. I do have shorts which I mostly wear hiking or camping. They're black/grey so everything still matches and is super easy.  Dang....I didn't expect to write so much lol Hopefully someone reads this far and find this helpful. I always struggled with clothing so having a system that works for me is a big help right now.   Be safe!",False,False
