Any step towards betterment is always good. It's ironic to me too on how I know all this stuff about nutrition and muscle (lifting background) and yet here I am, eating as little as possible, eating next to no protein, still forcing myself to lift heavy and so on lol, ig disorders don't care about rationality and information hah",False,False

I suppose you could mostly eat foods which are mostly protein but sorry to say youâ€™d still need to have adequate calories to maintain muscle mass. That amount varies between people obv",False,False

You will lose muscle mass if youâ€™re eating at a very high caloric deficit irrespective of what your macros are. Thereâ€™s no way around it aside from increasing your caloric intake.,False,False
