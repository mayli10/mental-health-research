And some people might think you are referring to someone shoving someone else with their body. If this girl has never thought she had an ED and nobody in her life has thought she has an ED then for her it's normal and not shaming. She is proud of the weight she lost and is probably getting tons of validation and you look amazing how did you do it comments.,False,False

Idk. Not meant in a bad way but idk.   What is her insta though? I'd love to see what her bodychecks look like...I mean how extreme they are",False,False
