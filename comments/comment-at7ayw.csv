I heard on a podcast that every fast is followed by a binge so if you want to end the cycle you have to conclude on a binge that you don‚Äôt restrict after. ,False,False

Only today did I think I MAY have ED. All this time, I thought that I was doing - or at least attempting - to do the best for my health. Now that I noticed my toxic thoughts and these feeling of guilt and shame for uncontrollable binging, I feel disappointed in myself and where I am now.  I am seeing a counselor for a different reason that's not related to ED. Whenever we go to the area of ""Why are you not eating?"" Or ""I suggest you try to eat more calories in a day"", I would lie to her saying I don't have time. This is because I don't think she'd see fasting as a healthy method - the way I currently see it. Rn, after today's realization, I want to talk with her, but the problem is she's going to have a medical surgery soon and she's told me she'll need 4 weeks of recovery. She has offered referring me to another counselor for the meantime but i told her i dont feel comfortable talking to a new therapist.  I'm not ready to give up fasting. It's the only thing that helped me lose weight. I still want to lose give or take 30 more pounds. But I also don't want to develop ED, or if I alrdy may have ED, I don't want it to get worse.",False,True

I think it's an integral part of my life now. There are a lot of benefits I have gained transitioning from my old 3 meals a day to fasting - although now I can also think of the consequences fasting gas led to. It's something I really don't want to give up, I just want to go back to how I was before with more self-control and less distressed feeling. I do suffer from overthinking of whether I should eat or fast, and when the urge to eat wins, I feel guilt, and I'd just binge for the rest of the day thinking, 'Well I failed anyways"".  Thank you very much for your reply. I really wasn't sure whether I was just overthinking thisrnor not and the questions and signs you listed is making me realize I may already have ED. ",False,True

In all seriousness, it takes a lot of hard, admirable honesty and self-reflection to realize you‚Äôre getting into disordered territory, even when your behaviors aren‚Äôt widely recognized as such. I really commend you for that! It‚Äôs not easy.   But yeah, this sounds...almost exactly like how I relapsed into my own ED.... Wow. It‚Äôs valid, it‚Äôs a Real Thing and it‚Äôs definitely not uncommon at all.   Gah. I feel this on a spiritual level. I‚Äôm sorry you‚Äôre struggling with it.   I‚Äôve been seeing an ED therapist for a while now, and I‚Äôve (very unnecessarily) gained back like 20 lbs in an attempt at the ‚Äúregular eating‚Äù she‚Äôs assured me will help me break free from this vicious cycle, ugh. I‚Äôm not gonna lie. It sucks. It‚Äôs hard. I hate it. I‚Äôm still struggling.  But I know that at least trying to *not* fast in response to  my binges will help in the long run (maybe?), and I‚Äôm slowly starting to feel *a little* less obsessive‚Äîlike I‚Äôve definitely got a long way to go, but at least I don‚Äôt feel like Normal Balanced Eating will always be impossible now. My digestion is improving slightly. My hair is healthier; some is even growing back. Also, I have BICEPS now! Whoa! Anyway.  I would encourage you to talk to someone about this, like maybe a counselor at your school, and take it from there. Or maybe if there are any ED centers or organizations around you could reach out to, that might be a good place to start exploring the whole thing further. Best of luck to you, friend! You *can* get through this, and you will. I‚Äôm here if you ever want to talk. üíõ",False,False

You go to the doctor, and the doctor tells you that the fasting, although beneficial in moderation, is ultimately doing you harm. They want you to stop doing all fasting and eat a regular diet, perhaps with 16:8 but nothing further than that.  How would you feel about that?  Or, let's say, you are fasting and feel unwell- lightheaded, weak. You have an opportunity to eat an unplanned meal. How distressed would this unplanned meal make you? How distressed would eating it or not eating it make you?  How much do you think about food?  Does it distract you from your day? Does it seem that life revolves around fasting and eating, instead of fasting and eating simply being a part of your life? If you stopped fasting, would you be ok?  If you answered that you wouldn't want to stop fasting even if advised against it- you would feel greatly distressed by eating/not eating without a plan- if your life has become fasting, instead of fasting being part of your life- and if not fasting and losing weight doesn't seem like an option- I'm sorry, you probably are already disordered.  Frequent and persistent thoughts about food, fear of weight gain, fear of ""losing control"" when eating are [all parts of anorexia.](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/anorexia-nervosa/symptoms-causes/syc-20353591) You may not want to, but I would advise to stop fasting and restricting and perhaps seek professional help.  &amp;#x200B;  Just my two cents.
