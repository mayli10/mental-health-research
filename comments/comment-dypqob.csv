To some extent, your enamel can be made a little stronger by incorporating fluoride into its structure, but that effect is completely outweighed by the constant acid challenge in bulimia. When the pH at the enamel surface is &lt;4.5, enamel begins to demineralise. The pH of HCl, your stomach acid, is &lt;2. The layer underneath enamel (dentine, it's yellowish) has reparative properties, but often if you've lost enough enamel to expose the dentine, your teeth are probably already feeling sensitive. You can use a toothpaste like Sensodyne to help with the sensitivity, but enamel can never be regained.    You can also use harm reduction strategies but they will not prevent you from losing enamel if you continue to purge. I'll list them here:  * after purging, do not brush your teeth for an hour. Your enamel is currently weakened by the acidic environment and using mechanical force will make it far more likely to erode.  * rinse out your mouth after purging with bicarbonate soda dissolved in water. It tastes disgusting but will help speed up your mouh's attempt to rebalance pH.  * where possible, minimise the amount of contact between your teeth and vomit. This means trying to purge as quickly as possible rather than prolonging a session, and avoiding rubbing your acid-covered fingers directly on teeth if you can.  * if you binge as well as purge, or otherwise snack frequently (even if it's a small amount of food), do your best to brush and floss after eating (again, not in the hour after purging). Bulimics and people with BED are at increased risk of developing caries.    Otherwise, seeing your dentist and being honest about your disorder is the best thing you can do. A dentist can attempt to protect the tooth/ delay the loss of enamel in some cases by applying topical fluoride (high concentration products that should only be used by a professional), as well as prescribing you higher fluoride concentration toothpaste if you're medium-high risk for caries. Another reason it is important for your dentist to know about your disorder is that it will affect what treatment is best for you. The ultimate priority will be to address the ED first, which a well-connected dentist can assist with by referral and co-ordination with a therapist and GP. Without treating bulimia, any restorative work done on your teeth is likely to fail in a few years.",False,False
