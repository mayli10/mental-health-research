Holidays are life affirming celebrations. All of our holidays around this time of year have their roots in celebrating pagan festivals of harvest and the winter solstice. Of course we share food during these times, it is a time of plenty post-harvest and a reminder that winter doesn’t last forever and soon the earth will be green and providing food again. They’re basically celebrations of “yes we are alive and we have enough food to last us the winter.” Sharing food with our loved ones is a deep instinct to us as a social species. Your friends prepared all this food with love and the spirit of celebration. I sincerely hope you didn’t deny yourself this. I hope you got to eat some food and only think of how good it tastes, not the calories or how much you’ll weigh tomorrow. You deserve to celebrate life with the people you love!!",False,False
