If you copy paste this same comment in future posts without considering wording or whether OP's have explicitly solicited it, you'll get a ban. Thanks. ",False,False

I've been going around here probably contrariwise to the rules saying that the golden rule is to eat for nutrient density. Counting macros MAY be useful, but if it causes you to become anxious, don't bother counting. This sort of rule is naturally going to steer you towards things like eggs, meat, fish, cheese, liver, and nonstarchy vegetables. The calories per gram is high but you don't need to eat much to feel full because it's all protein and fat, not carbohydrate (which for some people has an orexigenic (makes you eat more) effect).  If you wind up bingeing, it'd be more of the same, with a bias towards truly indulgent things like clouted cream (place whipping cream (has to be 33%+) in a ramekin, and bake at 195F for more than 3 hours - more than 12 if the ramekin is large. It's a pudding on its own once you're stabilised on a real-food animal based diet, even if not mixed before cooking with sweetener and maple extract as I once did)  *CONSIDER CAREFULLY* (weigh the benefits of accelerating the clearance of visceral fat against the likelihood of a relapse into a restrict phase or developing A.N.) a two to three day water-and-salt (really, coffee, tea, hot chocolate sweetened with a noncaloric sweetener, anything that isn't sugary is okay) fast after eating a bit of liver and greens, to let the system cycle through a bit. Since you say you're having a hell of a time trying to sleep, your priority should be sleep, hydration, and electrolytes. If you're O.W. you shouldn't have a big issue physically with a couple day fast, but before commencing the fast promise yourself you will break it with something nutritious in a small portion (to prevent refeed syndrome) and then the next day eat something nutritious in a normal portion. **Given the history of ED you have, I would not recommend a fast.** If you think you have it in you to do it without a relapse, it can be a powerful tool for blowing out the cobwebs. However, most of the benefits can be derived simply by ensuring that what you eat is all high in nutrients and unprocessed.  The weight, if you are worried about it, is secondary. Right now you should want to focus on proper nutrition. Your brain needs nutrients to recover from damage it may have incurred.",False,False

Sorry mods.   Have you tried planning your binges in advance? Telling yourself “no more indulgence ever” might be contributing to your compulsion. I’ve planned when I’m gonna overeat, what I’m gonna eat when I do it, and how long I’m gonna do it for, for almost eighteen months now and I haven’t lost control around food a single time since I started doing it.   (If you have any questions about how this affected my weight, feel free to DM me.)  I don’t really characterise this as “binging” because for me, a defining element of a binge is losing control, and I am always in control: if I’ve eaten it, it’s because I decided to. However, in terms of the amount of food or whatever, I routinely eat upwards of ten thousand calories over the course of a weekend and because I’ve allowed myself to eat the things I want, I don’t ever binge when I’ve decided to restrict. It hasn’t only been a useful tool for controlling my ED; since I started doing this I’ve significantly reduced my anxiety, both around food and in general, and feel almost like I’ve given up the responsibility of having to fight my own urges. It’s a huge relief to not have to worry that I’ll give in to the binge impulse, because I know when I can next eat the thing that brings me joy and no longer have any panic associated with those foods.
