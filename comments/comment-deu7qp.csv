Not because someone somewhere has it worse makes your feelings less valid or less painful, please know this. And if you can tell it to your mom.   If you need someone to listen or help you I can me a fake mom.

I've also felt like I'm not allowed to express any problems I may have because other people have it worse. When I tried talking to my mom about my problems she pretty much just says that I'm lucky and should be grateful for everything I have in life.   It makes me so upset and unwilling to talk to anyone because it's almost like I don't deserve to feel that way. I guess it helps to think that even though other people may be struggling more, that doesn't mean that we can't have problems too and that they are still important.",False,False
