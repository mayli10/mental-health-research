I'm think it's a South Indian thing with the family cause when I grew up they were constantly giving me food and snacks and I HAD to finish it or it'd be disrespectful.   My brother is the same. My sister never got close to my mum so she escaped that.   Just today a friend of a friend apparently abuses laxatives, body checks all the time and is uncomfortable eating in public. This topic of conversation only came up cause my sister was telling them that I also abuse laxatives.   One tiny girl I know eats one pork bun a day because she's just not hungry. She confronted me with my ED once and I asked her back. She says she just doesn't feel hungry. I don't know, man. ",False,False

The one we only met the one time, but I was pretty good friends with the other person I met, but we both just got really busy and haven't talked in a while. But yes, we talked quite about about our EDs together but it's also because we met through ED communities.  I also have one friend who I made through my husband, and the first time I met her, my ED bells were ringing. I don't know how to describe it, but there was just something that tipped me off. Over a period of a few months, I dropped several hints about my own disorder and eventually we both opened up about our own struggles, and it's something that we talk about still, albeit briefly",False,False

But a girl I see in the gym every night is definitely anorexic. She'll often walk run and elliptical for hours a night. Another girl I suspect may be bulimic or EDNOS with purging.

We get together maybe once a week and commiserate, but a lot of the time we just laugh about it, our ridiculous behaviours, the irrational stuff, the tragicomic stuff.

One of my roommates has very very bad bulimia and hearing her throw up CONSTANTLY is wildly triggering. another of my roommates was really anorexic last semester but is closer to recovery now. i think i trigger her bc i have exercise purging bulimia so i eat in our apartment fairly often  esp when i’m high :)))) two of my friends purge through exercise and have very ortho tendencies (although one purges normally too). i see girls at the gym in the cardio room on the ellipticals for 2+ hours at a time right alongside me lmao so i know they’re probably deep into ED as well. also a huge coke and adderall abuse problem on campus so that fuels a lot of disordered eating as well. i rarely ever hear anyone talk explicitly about their eating disorder the way they talk abt depression or anxiety but i hear negative food talk from women CONSTANTLY and according to our student health center over 2/3 of women on campus have eating disorders, closer to 80% in greek life.  sorry for the essay lmao",False,False
