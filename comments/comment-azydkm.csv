The ratio of women to men is another factor..There‚Äôs a lot of stigma so it‚Äôs often untreated. If you research Jewish eating disorders there‚Äôs a lot of articles about the differences and culture around it.,False,False

I feel like shit using the religion to fuel my disorder :(   I will use obscure Halachot/Jewish laws (ex: don‚Äôt eat before you feed your animals) to push off meals, or when I ate meat I‚Äôd use waiting in between eating milk and meat to push off meals, and don‚Äôt forget we have a million fast days every year.   Idk if you specifically relate to that aspect but I do understand the guilt about the holocaust+food and feel you completely. You‚Äôre not alone ‚ô•Ô∏è",False,False

I‚Äôm Jewish as well and I feel like I barely know anyone with an eating disorder. Like it didn‚Äôt seem common at all growing up, and I‚Äôve lived in a huge Jewish community my whole life.

There‚Äôs a lot of pressure to be thin before marriage. And when Shabbat and so many holidays revolve around food it can be hard. It‚Äôs a mitzvah to eat more on those days which I try to pretend I don‚Äôt have an ED those days. But yeah the guilt gets to me too. There‚Äôs a huge difference between starving yourself and the holocaust. Try not to let something horrible that was forced to your ancestors continue to cause you pain and guilt. Then you are letting them win even more. Don‚Äôt fall prey to victim mentality all it does is keep you captive. You are strong :)",False,False

I have generational trauma from my black side. When I think about how my grandma lived through segregation and lynch mobs. My grandma was a sharecropper‚Äôs daughter during the Great Depression and when she talks about food it‚Äôs so hard. ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt eat because you‚Äôre hungry, you eat to keep from getting hungry‚Äù like hunger is a demon to be kept at bay lest it remind you of the starving times. it‚Äôs crazy to think how the hardships my ancestors suffered, the trauma and poor diet that‚Äôs passed down in my family, isn‚Äôt even comparable to the survivors of the holocaust. It‚Äôs like comparing elementary school soccer games to the World Cup.      Honestly this brings tears to my eyes. You‚Äôre not doing this by choice, really. You‚Äôre not weak. I mean I don‚Äôt think anyone is as strong as survivors of the holocaust but to live with an ED for 10 years is no small feat. I know it‚Äôs hard. We‚Äôre all in the same boat. ",False,False

I'm Jewish as well and I completely get it :(  I'm not a descendant of holocaust survivors but my ancestors did go through pogroms and struggling due to being Jewish immigrants. I definitely believe in generational trauma.  I really struggle with the preoccupation with eating and most importantly having to finish everything you eat in my family. When my doctor brought up that I could have an eating disorder when I was 11, my mom said I needed a schmaltz (literally just chicken fat) sandwich to """"""put meat on my bones"""""".      I deal a lot with being guilty for avoiding food. Like my ancestors literally did not have access to food and I'm avoiding it? what the fuck? I literally purged my seder dinner last year which made me feel like shit. it really sucks.",False,False
