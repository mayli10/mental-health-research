Sodium does make you retain water, but that's only because it dehydrates you.  You can literally just rehydrate by drinking more water. I feel like people don't talk about this enough lol.  But- this is also a reason to be careful about drinking too much water- like you said, sodium deficiencies REALLY suck and you will get a deficiency VERY quickly if you're fasting (unless you drink electrolyte drinks or broth etc).  So if you're a water chugger and/or a faster, watch out for dizziness/fatigue as a sign of electrolyte deficiency. If you're afraid to eat to get your sodium back, you can put a small amount of salt under your tongue (you absorb it faster and taste it less this way). Remember, salt is an electrolyte and has no calories, so do not be afraid of it!",False,False

First you'll sweat out your electrolytes, and then when you drink water to rehydrate, you'll dilute your sodium levels even further. This will put you at risk for [hyponatremia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyponatremia). It's easy enough to get hyponatremia without an ED, so if you're not eating or deliberately refusing all sodium, that only makes it worse.   Do not cut out all sodium, and/or barely eat, and then:   * work in the heat   * play active sports, or do intense exercise for an extended period  * take hyperthermia-inducing drugs like MDMA, especially if you're in a hot setting like a club/desert festival/whatever  Even people who don't have EDs need to be careful about this. No matter who you are, if you're going to be doing tons of sweating (running a race? long intense hike?), you should take electrolyte tablets/powder to put in your water. Or you can drink a sports drink, but they're a total ripoff imo.",False,False

It sucks at first but your body will adjust to the influx of sodium and the water retention won't be so bad after your body gets used to it.,False,False

I don’t watch my sodium at all and haven’t noticed any differences on days when I eat a lot of sodium vs very little. I am sure you’d have to be living on Lays chips and pretzels to make it have any noticeable effect.",False,False
