Eating seems like such a chore when Iâ€™m busy and all frazzled, but when I have too much free time, I kill myself eating recreationally.",False,True

Beginning of school im either calm or restricting hard. Winter I'm ok..ish. But spring im back and forth between bingeing and starving. In summer I'm able to obtain weight easier for some reason. I also eat a reasonable amount then.,False,False

Since it turns cold, our bodies signal us to get fatter and eat more. We tend to get more cravings in the winter, put on some weight, and then lose it again in time for summer. And the cycle begins again next winter.  But of course thatâ€™s not always the case for people with EDs.",False,False

I'm way better at staying disciplined in the summer since I'm wearing less clothes. It's so hard right now since it's ridiculously cold and all I want to do is eat comforting food. Plus sweaters are forgiving so there's less incentive to eat less,False,False

I have a window between November and March where I'm off from uni and I try to do most of my fasting then. But ironically, it's easier to fast and restrict in trimester because I'm a law student and have to be busy.  I'm a huge boredom/emotional eater. So time off is unhelpful despite my plans.",False,False
