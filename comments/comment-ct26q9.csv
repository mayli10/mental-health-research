If you‚Äôve been cleared by doctors it is proobably anxiety. Anxiety is crazy it can make literally every system in your body go haywire. Idk if you have a psych, but seeing if they think an anti anxiety med might help would be a good way to see if it‚Äôs anxiety and get some relief.   My most major issue even more than eating disorder is anxiety so I really really feel for you here and empathize - if it‚Äôs anxiety attacks, it‚Äôs so rough and It‚Äôs really something that coming out the other side of can make you stronger üíï I really hope you get it resolved soon and get some relief!!",False,False

I am honestly starting to think that although they are anxiety/stress related, they're not exactly panic attacks but for me more due to the physical effects of the long-term stress of not eating enough. Not even mentally but physically, after years of on and off just not giving your body the fuel it wants it probably creates some kind of stress state that we become sensitive to. It fucking sucks",False,True

I definitely feel like hearing from doctors in the past that my heart could be in danger caused me a lot of anxiety that I never had before. I will try and implement some stress reduction,False,True

But what you're describing does potentially sound like high anxiety that's affecting your sympathetic nervous system.   Like, I used to have a horrifying array of symptoms for days at a time that made me think I was dying (palpitations, full body flushing/sweating, full body hives, food moving through me practically undigested, vertigo, etc). Yeah, turns out it was work-related anxiety that largely stopped after I left that position.",False,False

There was an entire week  where my chest felt tight and my heart was racing. I about went nuts having to go to work and take my son to his co-curricular activities feelongblike i was about to drop dead from cardiac arrest.   Oddly when i resigned to the panic it started to go away.    Just wanted to put that out there as an example that not all panic attacks are short.,False,False

They don't feel at all the same to me. In both cases I'm very aware of an irregular heartbeat and also of struggling to breathe, but the sensations of these in each case are very different, plus I experience a lot of additional symptoms with my panic attacks. That's only me personally though, don't know if that's helpful at all.  That said, I've never asked a doctor about the chest pains. I've been considering it recently as the tightness seems to be happening most days now and it's quite scary tbh, so I'm glad for the advice in this thread!",False,False

I went through something similar for a couple years, and i think it really boiled down to anxiety for me. I think, because of my ed, I was always being told that I was in the verge of death, had caused so much damage to my body etc. So I would like...induce psychosomatic symptoms upon myself if that makes sense? And in general I‚Äôm a pretty anxious person. But anyway how I got over it was honestly just...accepting it and breathing through it, lol. As morbid as it sounds, I was like yknow what? If my heart gives out, it‚Äôs ok. But it never did and I‚Äôm still here, and eventually those feelings have greatly decreased. I have noticed that in times of increased anxiety, the palpitations/tightness return (ex. Rn I‚Äôm slightly anxious of going back to school; Lo and behold, they‚Äôre back!)  So yeah, if you‚Äôve been given the ‚Äúall clear‚Äù by doctors then I would say trust them, try to relax, and ignore it if you can. The best thing I ever did was unsubbing from health anxiety subs and the like because it was driving me insane. As much as it is comforting to know there are others out there, I think (for me) it also fueled the fire in a way.   Best of luck, you‚Äôve got this!!",False,False

I have symptoms like this too when I don't keep up with actually taking something to supplement electrolytes...  It could be anxiety attacks as well, those are different than panic attacks and can last longer.  If its electrolytes, regular supplements may not be enough, especially if you aren't sure of how much to take. In many forms, those supplements are not even able to be absorbed by the body very well. You need Potassium Chloride, Magnesium Citrate, and some form of sodium (most normal salt works), those are the best ones...  If you want more info, I can DM you links to buy this stuff and tell you what to do with it, its pretty cheap and you can get it on amazon or from walmart.",False,False
