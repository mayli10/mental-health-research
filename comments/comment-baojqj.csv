DW, it's not that you're/we're not disordered, it's that diet culture is becoming more rampant and being publicly disordered is more acceptable LOL.  Most people have NO idea what an ED actually is. They only have a vague idea in their head, usually of a skeletal bulimic, and anyone else who doesn't look or act like that doesn't have a disorder - and therefore, in reverse, any behavior that doesn't fit perfectly isn't disordered, either.  It doesn't make the behavior any less disordered and any less of a problem. It's just a lot of people with EDs are in complete denial, and so they all get together and rebrand it into ""healthful"" language like ""fasting"" and ""detoxing"" to dazzle normies into thinking it's in pursuit of health and happiness and not about feeling thin and in control.  Anyway, on topic, yeah I've been seeing more and more people just casually talking about fasting and it's like... is this real life? What happened to all those Saved By The Bell episodes where a character stops eating for 20 hours and everyone loses their minds? Now someone selling me water kefir is telling me that they havent eaten solid food in 9 days and I'm supposed to accept that they're healthy and mindful and doing their body good?

Itsveronica then made a passive aggressive comment about how this realitivly benign comment must be a call out to them....because  *they* don't want to be skin and bones.

Not in the way of how most EDed people do, but intermittently fasting helps with portion control and promotes your body to use its stored fat, as well as boosting your metabolism. The problem with how some might do it, is they go back to foods that caused weight gain (high carb, sugar, etc) rather than healthy alternatives. That’s where it becomes a crash diet. Water fasting, for example, shouldn’t be done more than once or MAXIMUM twice a year. There’s this one video I watched that really went into the depths of the difference between fasting and reduced intake.   https://youtu.be/APZCfmgzoS0  The intention of why you’re fasting is important too. Most eating disorders aren’t about food or appearance at all, lots of you know that. It’s about control, self esteem, more underlying issues. But you can’t use these as fuel for your fasting, that’s when it becomes scary. As someone who’s recovering (mostly because I am pregnant and gotta be a good role model to my lil bean), it’s not something I will do without my husband knowing, and until after breastfeeding feeding is done. its easy to fall back into bad behaviours, and I think you need to have self awareness before you go into this trend, as so many can take it too far. Really beneficial for your health, done correctly though. ",False,False

I found a lot of my problems with food is that I hate myself 99% of the time, but the 1% I don't is during meal times and I always over eat/make poor decisions. With fasting, the initial 3 days are tough, but after that it's minimal willpower except around meal times/when you're in front of food.   &amp;#x200B;  I think the biggest difference between ED and fasting is that fasting isn't inherently negative, or at least not as much as EDs are. As long as you're not doing it to an unhealthy extent, there's nothing about it that screams ""I'm not okay."" A large part of fasting actually centers around relative virtues. Like willpower, self discipline, and abstinence. These are all things people can come together and encourage each other with, and exemplifying them is seen as a very good thing.   &amp;#x200B;  Additionally, everyone who fasts meets the exact same road blocks and temptations. With EDs, everyone's story is completely different. You might have a supportive family, an abusive family, bullies harassing you, or just raw ambivalence, but by and large everyone who fasts has the same exact experience. Going through food withdrawals for the first three days, having weird bodily functions, having friends tempt you with food, realizing that different waters taste very different, having to hide the fact that you're fasting from other people, having near breaking point moments, and the sheer joy and excitement from breaking the fast. This builds a strong community that's able to empathize with each other on every step of the way. Additionally, one of the biggest things with fasting is that failure is okay. A common thing to hear from anyone on /r/fasting is that any fast is a successful fast. Failure just means that the next fast is going to be that much easier. With ED, failure isn't immediate and when it is discussed comes off as more of a failure of the self rather than a learning opportunity to grow from.  &amp;#x200B;  I completely believe that fasting and EDs are born from the same personal problems however, I think the approach and communities around the two methods vary wildly in terms of personality and mentality. If I had to summarize /r/fasting in one word, it would be ""positive."" I honestly don't know if there's even a single word that could accurately describe this sub. I'm not saying that that's a bad thing, just that these are two wildly different communities.  &amp;#x200B;  This is my personal experience as someone who has been suffering from an ED for years, and been a part of both communities for months.
