I've put myself back onto a low calorie limit of 500-700, it's not as low or restrictive as it has been in the past but I need to stop binging and purging and this is the only way that works. I'm using the LoseIt app to hold myself accountable about what I'm eating. Particularly when it comes to bad habits.",False,False

After like 10 years of an ED, my main goal now is to just stay under maintenance. So even if I binge a big meal of like 1500 calories, I‚Äôm not super worried about it. Some nights it‚Äôs more and some nights it‚Äôs less, but overall it averages to a deficit and that keeps me from panicking haha.   I don‚Äôt know how long I can keep ‚Äútricking‚Äù my body though. Even a small deficit is a deficit, and I know I can‚Äôt live that way forever. But I‚Äôm damn well gonna try haha",False,False

I know some people find solace in the routine of counting and planning calories, but for me it was terrible.   Now, I just ‚Äúsave‚Äù my calories for dinner and I don‚Äôt have to stress about how many calories it is because it‚Äôs almost definitely under my TDEE.
