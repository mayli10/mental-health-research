Yes I have gained some weight and so will you. But if you have lost the weight once you can lose it again. Just try to forget that the binges ever happened and just go back to your normal lifestyle. I know it may sound hard, but if you keep thinking about it, the more guilty you will feel and you will be  more likely to binge again.",False,False

What's done is done, and worrying about your past actions will only take away from your present goals. There's no ""right"" way to have anorexia; a few binges don't make your eating disorder any less valid. As for your weight, you most definitely will not gain a ton of weight from this. If the scale does show a gain, it's likely water weight and only temporary. Things will be ok, you can survive this!",False,False
