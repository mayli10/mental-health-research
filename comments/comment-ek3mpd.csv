I’m losing weight.   Depending on height, a large amount of people will lose weight on 1,200 a day. I could, but I don’t, because it’s scary.   It is very possible to eat 1,000+ per day and not gain fat. Just don’t go over your TDEE.",False,False

Please note that you are likely underweight from your ED unless you are really young and will therefore indeed gain weight.  With time gaining weight will slow down as the body will develop enough to have as much energy expentidure as your diet.  Please note that the guidelines should also be adjusted according to your height and physical activity but if you are underweight you don't have to pay attention until you are not underweight anymore.",False,False

Around 7000 cals is one kilo fat (not plain fat like the makro fat but human flesh, fat, water and so on, basically to gain around 2 lbs/ 1 kg fat you would have to eat 7000 cals on top of your daily required calorie intake.  but dont forget, if you restrict for quite a time the weight on the scale after you eat a little bit more is mostly water weight. Its not possible to gain really fast, like you dont lose a lot fast.  1000 cals per day is too little for basically everyone, you would have to be a really small sedentary woman for that to be your tdee.",False,False
