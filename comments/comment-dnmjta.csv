They also have a chicken and vegetables for 170 calories.  I also adapted this from a Rachel Ray recipe and it's so good (makes 6 servings, 160 calories each):  Ingredients  * 1lb chicken breast (pound thin) * 1 small zucchini (slice thin) * 28oz can diced tomatoes * 1 small white onion (halve and slice thin) * Montreal steak seasoning * 1/2 cup chicken broth (I use bouillon) * 1/2 tbsp basil * 1/2 tbsp oregano * 1 tbsp balsamic vinegar  Use a deep skillet.  Rub balsamic vinegar into chicken and season with salt, pepper, and montreal steak seasoning. Brown the chicken. Put the onions into the pan and sprinkle with Montreal steak seasoning. Brown the onions and then layer on the bottom of the pan. Add the broth to the pan. Put a thin layer on zucchini over the onions and sprinkle with Montreal steak seasoning. Cover it with the chicken breast, dump the tomatoes on top, add the herbs, and cover and cook till the chicken is cooked through (Probably about 10 minutes).   It's damn good.",False,False
