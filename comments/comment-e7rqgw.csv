I guess they are indeed pretty similar in terms of what they offer and being referred by a GP. I guess when I am ready I will have a talk with him. He knows about my ED and recommend therapy 4x but I refused (too big of a step). Sooo now it is just a matter of feeling ‘ready.’ No idea if this day will ever come though. Again, I really appreciate your answer and sharing your experience, it sounds really positive! Thanks!",False,True

My university offers counselling for students where I was given a list of recommended therapists nearby. Now I'm seeing one once a week and it's completely covered by my insurance, all I had to do was hand in a paper signed by my GP recommending therapy which took about 30 mins altogether, so it was really no hassle. It's been about 3 months now, and even though I still haven't gotten rid of most dysfunctional patterns in my behaviour it has done wonders to my mindset and the way I feel about myself and my ED. Honestly couldn't recommend it enough. I know I 've been probably very lucky to instantly find a therapist I click with, but it feels so so good to have someone to talk to who takes you seriously and knows how to give actually decent advice. Really hope this works out for you, too! Good luck ❤",False,False
