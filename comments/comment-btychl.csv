I think this afternoon I might watch some Ghibli films or something and just chill out. I think I definitely need to get back into my hobbies though",False,True

Nearly half year ago I started to do something that actually makes me *happy* ^((sidenote: started on anti-depressiva as well, I was into a pretty deep depression))   My advice would - first realize you have to do something for it to change - second DO ~~bloody~~ something; find a hobby (I started riding again after years without eventhough I've been doing that my entire life), get something done in your life, so you don't feel as useless: get a dog, walk a neighbor's dog, write a book, take photos and get great at editing WHATEVER    I really hope you get out of that black hole, I totally you feel. I don't wanna sound like I'm so much better now, but at least I don't wanna walk out in front of a bus instead of waking for the green light.   &amp;#x200B;  Hope I dont sound too better-knowing or something!!! *hugs*",False,False
