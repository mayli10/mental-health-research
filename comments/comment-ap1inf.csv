As in, the insulin spike would be greater than if you just ate the carbs on their own.  The people who study this stuff still dont know how it does this :/",False,False

They're not big, so from an emotional standpoint I can look at one and think ""that's all I get?"" but if I eat it and walk away, 100% of the time I realize they're super satiating. Creamy and Crunchy peanut butter are my favorites.   Julain Bakery's Paleo bars and D's Natural No Cow bars might also be good options for you to try too. I like Julain's sunflower butter paleo thin bar and the chocolate-peanut butter and blueberry cobbler no cow flavors. (-:",False,False

In german its Zuckeraustauschstoffe and Süßstoffe. One has Insulin triggers, one not. Like sucralose does not trigger an Insulin spike, its safe for diabetetic people   Could it be that you have a sugar malabsorbtion, like fructose, or sorbitol? You can get problems with sweeteners if so. ",False,False
