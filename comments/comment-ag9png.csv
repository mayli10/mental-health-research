I understand youâ€™re angry, I know how much better it feels to run to this terrible coping mechanism. Im really sorry youâ€™re experiencing this.   I will hopefully suggest that instead of b/p, maybe thereâ€™s something that would help you feel better, or more in control? Perhaps go for a run, do an intense yoga video, read a great book from the library?   I struggle with black and white thinking. I think maybe trying another coping mech while still allowing yourself a reasonable amount of the food you wanna binge on may help. It helps me.   My kinda example: go for a run, get some gummies- have a snack on those. Go to the library, find a great book- pick up a reasonable amount of tbell to eat for dinner (I love their chicken soft tacos like none other!! Maybe even some cinnamon twists!) &amp; distract your distraught mind.   You are so worth being treated well. I believe in your ability to re-route this experience. PM me if you need to talk. ðŸŽ€ðŸ’•",False,False
