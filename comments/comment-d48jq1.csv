Other than that I would recommend tanning outdoors + using a self tanner like others have suggested. Maybe you could try crushing up bronzer with lotion? Or using bronzer to contour collar bones, abs, sides of legs etc?   I always wear tall wedges with my bikini to pool parties to elongate/slim the body.   Maxi dresses&amp; skirts are also great cus u can let ur gut hang, they make you look elongated/slim, and they’re summery/pool party vibe.  Hope this helps! Good luck!",False,False

I think it’s best to do something that helps you “feel skinnier” (for me that’s running, but you may have your own special zone that helps you feel a little better about yourself), and then do something that makes you feel like the best version of yourself- maybe do your nails, give yourself a facial, have a long bath, or put on your “I *always* feel better about myself in this” outfit just to stand in front of the mirror and reassure yourself that you look as good as ever.  Don’t eat anything too heavy or that you know bloats you between now and the party, and you’ll be fine! Have fun :)",False,False
