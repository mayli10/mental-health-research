Lactose intolerance doesn't really affect your breathing or sinuses AFAIK. Minor anaphylaxis, though, definitely can do that. If you can, it'd be worth it to go get an allergy panel done (hell, just do a general foods panel if ya want just to see if you have any latent allergies you didn't know about). If it hasn't killed you yet though you're probably fine lol. I'm allergic to hazelnuts (make my mouth set on fire and my throat close up a bit) but I still binge on nutella once every few months lmao",False,False

Typically breathing problems are allergic reactions, not lactose intolerance reactions. Your doctor would have more insight though.",False,False

I have to go and see if I have haemochromatosis anyway, it just always seems to happen after I've had milk/yoghurt and alcohol, nothing else :(",False,True

I'm severely lactose intolerant and choose to eat plant based yogurts as a preference but you can still eat yogurt. Most people w lactose intolerance can handle 12g of lactose per day and 6oz of greek yogurt only has 4g of lactose. They also make yogurt with lactase added in (so it doesn't cause a reaction), and personally I don't like it but it might be good for you.",False,False
