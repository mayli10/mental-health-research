I have the house to myself but some other people use the bathroom and kitchen sometimes, and so she inspects everything to see if it’s clean. She doesn’t move stuff in my room but the rest of the house isn’t really mine.   My land lord has a good heart, but she’s not always good at communicating. She’s told me to do things a very specific way and then asked the opposite of me the next day. She usually has a valid reason, but she won’t mention it until later so it comes across as a power move at first. She’s made a few odd comments sort of subtly comparing me to her best friend who is also trans, which has also been kind of frustrating. She always try’s to be respectful though, she’ll just say things and it’s obvious she doesn’t realize it’s strange. Her and her boyfriend are generally very unconventional people, which I’m ok with, but it has taken time to get used to.   I’m honestly ok, and I don’t blame them for offering me weed when they had no way of knowing I have health problems. My ED worsens my hypoglycemia and I should have had better discernment before I smoked on an empty stomach. I appreciate your concern &lt;3",False,True

If they are hovering over you in your home you pay for commenting on your appearances , (they are not doing you a personal favor by allowing you to live there if you are PAYING THEM) like some kind of abusive authority figure.    I don't know what to say other than maybe you should not smoke weed with and get some distance form your land lord and consider moving *if you know* you cant have a calm discussion about boundaries with them.   &gt; also I’m underage   :( confused and worried about you...idk, i wouldn't want my LL letting themselves in and lighting stuff, touching stuff. Its my apt/ sanctuary here...maybe there is a culture difference you are ok with that I am not picking up on. It is nice to be worried about/cared for....good luck and don't beat yourself up.",False,False
