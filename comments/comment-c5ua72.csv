Lift while eating the amount of calories that maintain your weight :) it’ll turn squish into muscle without adding to your weight :),False,False

If you do just cardio you aren’t going to get the toned look without some sort of resistance training as well.",False,False

When you’re new to strength training you can gain muscle and lose fat at the same time but you’ll need to take in lots of protein and adequate calories overall. Low restricting is totally incompatible with muscle growth. It doesn’t matter how much you lift if you aren’t supporting the training with diet.,False,False

I'm not looking to build huge muscle, I just want to feel more toned and less soft lol. But I also want to be thin. I never knew they were at odds. Thanks for the info!",False,True

It’s scary at first, but once you get into a routine after a few months you really lean up, even while eating “normal” to “large” portions.  It is a kind of slow process, think at least 3 to 6 months of hard, consistent training to start seeing results. Another commenter linked a couple good subreddits to check out. r/bodyweightfitness is another good one",False,False

There’s lots of good info on r/xxfitness, r/fitness, etc. or just google “hypertrophy program” and pick something.   As for calorie burn—being in a steep caloric deficit will almost definitely present you from building muscle so the goals are at odds with each other. If you build muscle mass your body will use a bit more energy at rest.",False,False
