Whether it's because it's tough to sustain the energy it takes to care, or because your priorities just naturally shift, the amount of fucks you give evaporates and you finally get comfortable in your skin and (heaven forbid) start to like yourself a little. I wish this for you.  &lt;3",False,False

I turn 40 in a few months and I feel better looking than I ever have. I get to travel. I have a wonderful husband. I never thought things would turn out this way. So all I can say is hold on.

I guess my biggest fear is the fact that I've tried *so* hard and even when I succeed, it doesn't last. That's my pattern. So it's disheartening to face the future knowing that about myself. But you're right. Really my only option is to just keep trying.",False,True

Iâ€™m not sure if this will help at all, but I hope it will. If it doesnâ€™t, just know that you arenâ€™t alone. Growing up is scary under the best circumstances. The older I get, the more Iâ€™m convinced that everyone is just fumbling along blindly and hoping things work out. The uncertainty is definitely scary. But you arenâ€™t alone. Donâ€™t feel bad if you donâ€™t know what youâ€™re doing, most people donâ€™t.  To address your post, yes, to my understanding you become solely responsible for your medical decisions when you become 18 (dependent on location?). If you remain on your parentâ€™s insurance, there is a chance that they may receive some kind of billing record when you attend appointments, but they shouldnâ€™t receive any actual medical information, unless you allow it. Iâ€™m not sure if there is a way around the billing thing but itâ€™s something to be aware of, especially if you decide you could use some external accountability. Maybe it could be a stepping stone to build some accountability for your appointments while also developing independence in regards to your medical decisions? If it happens and you donâ€™t want them to even know about appointments, you might need to find your own insurance.  But, yes, as an adult you can decide not to go to appointments, weigh yourself, or eat. You and your parents will still be affected by your choices. Iâ€™d bet theyâ€™d still hurt to watch you hurt yourself, even if youâ€™re no longer living under their roof.  Giving into your ED completely feels like the easy route because of your ED. But your post shows that you know it isnâ€™t really that easy. EDs are self destructive and life-consuming. There really isnâ€™t anything easy about them. So, yes, you could choose to dive headfirst into your ED, but there is nothing truly easy or simple about that choice because that choice deprives you of so many happier outcomes. So, as you face this next step in your life, you should admit to yourself that BOTH decisions are difficult and weight the consequences of each choice.  As for how I cope... this is probably not the most encouraging answer but itâ€™s the only one I have to give: I just keep trying. Sometimes it feels like 2 steps forward, 3 steps backward. But over time, the steps backward start to feel smaller, as Iâ€™ve learned CBT tools to manage my mental health issues. I find ways to hold myself accountable and things to look forward to independent of my mental health issues. I think finding a really good fit with a therapist made a big difference. I used to think getting better was impossible. But I really just keep learning and trying. Even if the task feels impossible, even if you donâ€™t fully succeed, trying will at least result in a net improvement in your quality of life compared to giving up.  The fact that you donâ€™t want to die and that youâ€™re scared of having the responsibility to make this choice shows that, at some level, you understand that this isnâ€™t really an easy decision. It suggests that you really want to choose a healthier path than unrestrained anorexia. Youâ€™ve even identified the main barrier to making the choice you really want: accountability. Identifying this is actually a pretty big deal and something you should be proud of. So, if you canâ€™t trust your ED brain to make the healthier decisions your rational brain want, then you should try and build some ways to hold yourself accountable. Maybe choosing to keep your parents or a trusted friend involved in your appointments? Maybe a reward system for keeping appointments or meeting some healthy goals?  I wish I had all the answers. But it isnâ€™t an easy problem. It really does boil down to choices and consequences. And some part of you wants to make healthier choices or you wouldnâ€™t be so afraid. So the best thing you can do is try to make it as easy as possible to make those healthy choices.  Wishing you the best!",False,False

I think the biggest part of growing up is that you have to make decisions for yourself, it's a mixed blessing for sure.  I don't have the best advice, I think we're all just figuring it out, but people who care about you are still gonna be around.   Just because they legally have no say anymore doesn't mean they aren't looking out for your well being.  It's easy to fall down the rabbit hole, for sure. You just gotta find the thing worth living for and go after it I guess.   Build a life that you want to stick around for. I know it's hard, believe me, but hey, you're gonna have so much freedom now. Ask yourself what you want, and go after it. Something that really helped was this, for me at least: Once you get to your GW, what is it you want to do? And then you go do that shit, now. Or at least, you try to. As much as you can.   I hope everything works out for you. Sending good vibes your wayðŸ’–",False,False

Transitioning to adulthood, having the freedom to make all your own choices (for good and for bad) is difficult under the best circumstances, let alone when you have mental health issues.  As an adult with mental health issues, I hope to provide a fuller, hopefully helpful response this evening. But I just wanted to take a moment and say that I see you and, for whatever itâ€™s worth, this internet stranger is rooting for you.",False,False
