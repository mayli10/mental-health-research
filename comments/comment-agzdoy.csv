Like sometimes I'm right at 23, sometimes 23.5, and then at my biggest I'll be almost 24"" but not quite. It just looks like so much more change, but then the number always ends up being 23"" around. It makes no sense to me. And also I know I could still be smaller because I don't exactly have the flattest belly. If I flex really hard it looks almost completely flat, but other people are way thinner and still manage to be healthy so I know I can be too. Maybe I just need to start working out though. It could just be that I have very little core strength these days. I definitely used to weigh more and have a flatter belly in high school when I was active, so that's probably what the issue is.",False,True
