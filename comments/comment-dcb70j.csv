(It replaced the nonsensical ""MyPyramid,"" which had random vertical stripes that told you basically nothing other than that to be healthy, you should be a multicolored triangle.)  However, it's still p unhelpful in that it doesn't make useful distinctions for people who need basic advice. How big should the plate be? Is the food supposed to cover literally all of the plate? How high should the food be piled? What does ""fruit"" mean (it shouldn't include fruit juice, for one)? Or ""vegetables"" (which really shouldn't include russet potatoes)? Why does the USDA say ""drink water"" and then imply you should be drinking milk at every meal? Why doesn't the protein section make any mention of avoiding red meat? Why is there no mention of the advantages of plant oils over butter?   It's confusing and can be overwhelming for the average consumer, let alone someone with an ED.",False,False
