Defeats the whole purpose because even if purging does make you skinny you will have gross teeth and it will negate it. Give me chubby with pearly whites any day!,False,False

Like half or something. I am way too vain to purge so I just restrict but I looked it up one time to see the stats. Definitely not worth it. Some people seem to purge with laxatives though and that doesn't take ANY calories away so idk what the logic is there.,False,False

I've always been self conscious about body odor - I usually pop a bunch of altoid mints. I used to chew gum, but thanks to excessive chewing and my bingeing habits, I've given myself jaw problems.   There's also breath strips that dissolve on your tounge- but really mouthwash and properly brushing your teeth (and tounge) are the best ways.   And I wouldn't worry about your breath! I'm sure you're partner cares for you regardless of your breath at the time!",False,False

I have every tooth filled, I have had 6, count them 6, root canals done. I have also had my bridges replaced, twice. I even went to Thailand to get my last bridge done because in Canada, it would have cost me $8000 and there it was $2700. Seriously, my dental work has cost me $50,000 over my lifetime, thank gawd  for dental insurance. I'm 43 and I will probably need dentures in the next 10 years.

I wish I could make it stop but only with surgery is that possible. It's horrible. So I really hope no one starts purging (it can even lead to acid reflux!

Root canal and crown alone was 2K not counting the other problems.  This is way before my ED to and i just kind of let my teeth go to shit.  They arent in terrible shape and you could never tell I have had dental problems but ya.  Few times i tried purging but hasnt worked.  Back then I wouldnt put more than 10$ worth of gas in my car but I gladly dropped 2k+ on fixing my teeth.  Same thing right now.  I wont drop 20$ for a haircut but if my teeth needed something i would do it in a heart beat.,False,False
