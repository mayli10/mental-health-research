Don't get me wrong, I really think seeing a doctor would be the best choice, but I understand that trepidation and fear of having ones current situation seen under scrutiny by a GP. ESPECIALLY with a surgery on the horizon.   Please see a therapist, love. They can help you develop tools and strengths to learn how to approach fears of food and bodily insecurity so that you can get yourself to a safe place physically and emotionally.   I'm really proud of you for coming here and asking for help, that's the first step. And you have the strength to keep pushing to get yourself to a place of peace and safety for you and your body. &lt;3",False,False
