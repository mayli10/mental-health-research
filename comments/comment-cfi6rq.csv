Whether it comes from a place of love, confusion or her own self esteem issues, the fact is that it’s not right for her to say things that make you feel any worse about yourself. I know the struggle you’re going through and I just want you to know that no matter what anybody else thinks of your body (be it a complete stranger or your own mother), you should do what feels right to you. Their opinions may hurt, but deep down the only thing that matters is your own. Even if she says she feels embarrassed, deep down I would hope she only really cares that you are safe and that you are happy. Don’t give up on yourself, and try and treat yourself kindly.",False,False
