But maybe maintenance is too much too fast. I could try eating at 1000 instead of 900 for today.   Thank you so much for all the advice!!",False,True

I just think of it like a paycheck Iâ€™m waiting to hit my bank account. Itâ€™s not like you didnâ€™t make the money or the money is never gonna come, you just gotta wait a little longer for it.   You might consider just adding a few hundred calories more if you can even for just a day. If you canâ€™t bear it donâ€™t worry about it, but I know sometimes a day with a few extra calories will trigger a whoosh. I donâ€™t know the scientific explanation for it, I just think of it as the extra pushing everything along ðŸ˜‚  Good luck!",False,False

But thank you so much for the common sense and reassurance!! Iâ€™ll try to eat more veggies today and hopefully over the next couple of days, Iâ€™ll see my weight go down  My only saving grace is that I donâ€™t feel the urge to binge despite not losing while restricting",False,True

You might be at a point in your menstrual cycle (if you have one) where water retention is a problem. I can gain 5-8 lbs that go away as soon as itâ€™s over.   Have you been regular? If youâ€™ve only pooped once recently, you might still be a little backed up. Donâ€™t abuse lax, just some nice fiber from fruits or veg should help move things along.   Finally your body might just be taking some time to catch up, and youâ€™ll see the scale drop over a few days eventually. Iâ€™ve had plateaus where my weight just yeeted a good handful of pounds for no reason.   You *will not* maintain your weight on 900 calories. I know you know this, but Iâ€™m just gonna reenforce it. Unfortunately your body plays by its own rules and is pretty bad at figuring out how to lose weight in accordance with what it should be. Itâ€™s got so much going on between digestion, water, cycles, and other functions that itâ€™s sometimes a bit laggy with weight loss.",False,False
