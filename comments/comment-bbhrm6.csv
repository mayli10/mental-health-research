Nobody ever deserves to feel this way about themselves but you especially are still growing and need to sustain yourself.  I really doubt you're going to gain from 1600, especially if you're already 5'7"" at age 13. Like that's probably still a defecit. If you're basing your numbers on adults then you're going to be off because you're burning more energy just by going thru puberty. I'm glad you don't know how to purge (me neither lol) but if you try and react to a binge by restricting you're just more likely to binge even worse down the line - TRUST ME. It's called reactionary hunger. Just take tomorrow slow - don't tell yourself that you're NOT gonna eat, that builds up too much pressure, just take the time to stop and think about what you need.  You're gonna have a great birthday and you're NOT gonna be a fat pig whether you restrict or not, okay?",False,False
