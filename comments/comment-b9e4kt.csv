Try not to have a set rule of the exact number- this will sound gross but chew until you cant taste the different flavors or if there is only one flavor to begin with, until it is mushy. For me, the food will start sliding down my throat when its been chewed enough-dont try to stop it, just swallow it and continue chewing what's still there until it's all gone.   I feel like I'm being condescending and like 'heres.how a human eats!!1!1!' But I'm not trying to be. Just trying to do a lil harm reduction",False,False

Like I always refused to believe that you could feel full eating a plate of vegetables and tofu for example like everyone said. But when I actually was conscious and chewed about 30 times each time, I was legit stuffed and Iâ€™m not even talking a meal over 300 calories here. And you can kinda from there kinda get accustomed to chewing / savoring a lot and itâ€™ll become second nature. ",False,False

I've switched to eating 4-5 little portions of food and eating them ""dish by dish""   for example today I had a very small slice of toast, a spoon of peanut butter with banana, 4oz of yogurt with strawberries mixed in, and a cup of tea.

It helps to break down food so your stomach settles better, your intestines don't work so hard, and you have nicer poops. ",False,False

What I try to do is really think consciously when I am chewing.   \- Think of how great it tastes, how long it took you to prepare, all of the flavors or textures and elements!   \-Try to take deeper breaths. I notice when I eat fast I'm like not breathing and just inhaling. Chewing, swallowing, and taking a few deep breaths helps me to not rush.   \- Try to be mindful (don't eat while distracted or in a rush). Try to remember this is fuel for your body.   \- If you eat fast, you also probably aren't breaking up your food properly and you're probably getting excess air. Just try to settle down, and remember you're fueling and cherishing your body by feeding it and it wants to enjoy it, too. Not just have whole noodles of pasta or air sucked down lol.  I swear, just trying to chill while eating and realizing there is not a rush makes your meals enjoyable. &lt;3 good luck with recovery! ",False,False
