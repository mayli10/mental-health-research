Now when I eat under 1200 my body thinks it's dying and sends me on a binge. I have to eat six little meals of ca 1700 calories every day or a binge will kick my ass. I'm maintaining because I'm working out 6 days a week but damn. I loved this feeling while restricting. I felt so clean.,False,False

Back in 2011-2014 in college I could thrive off 1000-1300 calories a day (thanks, Dexedrine) I could go to the gym, write papers, work 20-30 hours a week etc. It was great. I mean, eventually I was a mess and was almost passing out daily towards the end of it, it was a good run.  Now if it go more than a few hours without eating or eat less than 1500 calories a day I feel like I’m legit going to fucking day. I can’t concentrate at work, my head pounds, etc. All my bloodwork says I’m fine, my blood glucose is great and stable. I don’t understand wtf my problem is plenty of naturally thin women my height eat under 1200 calories a day without intentional restriction. It’s like my fat cells start to poison me if I deprive them.",False,False
