Like damn some people with Ed‚Äôs don‚Äôt have dysmorphia and they can feel 100% confident and thin and then post a bodycheck without being called an attention seeker because they ‚Äòhave bdd‚Äô,False,True

Maybe it's just me but when I feel fat I definitely do not take body check pics or would even consider posting them.   I also feel like it's weird to be at a dangerously low bmi posting thinspo knowing people are starving themselves to look like that idk. I still like to torture myself by scrolling through Tumblr though (-:",False,False

I'm at the same stats as my previous ""thinspos"" but look totally different. Then on days I do feel okay looking and want to to a photo I worry people are so used to me fat they'll assume I've photo shopped weight off (big headed I know but its litterally from low self esteem) so I don't post or share them anyway.   I'm starting to wonder if the people who post(ed) themselves as thinspo back in the day had ""real"" eating disorder or were just capitalising on being very thin because they knew we/their audience/tumblr would eat it up.  The more I think about it the more paradoxical it seems that anyone could hate themselves enough to starve/we like this and still feel enough pride and self love to share their image with the entire world labled as ""inspiration"" unless they had mania or ego issues as well. Just my theory, though.",False,False
