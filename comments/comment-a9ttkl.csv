And when I cheat (haven't truly binged for a while, woop woop) I tend to have things with dairy. That might have something to do with it. But yeah the bloat is real.   Also, short woman fist bump. Sorry you are going through this in HS. :p ",False,False

God I was and am such a fatass :P   But seriously, I'd have thought I'd just digest it slower. But it makes sense, if you increase the substrate concentration (i.e. food amount) too much, enzymes won't work any faster and a lot of the food won't be digested in the small intestine, hence it won't be absorbed. I'm only in HS...should probably ask my bio teacher lol.",False,False
