There are so many things I love about the Garmin Forerunner 35 and its app (Garmin Connect)! Specifically, I like that it:   * Allows you to specify what workout you're doing (treadmill, outdoor running, cardio, biking, or walking), and keeps track out your daily steps and heart rate. * Has ""intensity minute"" recommendations, which is the amount of minutes per week you should be doing high intensity exercises, and keeps you accountable to that number. *  You can use it without your phone because it has an internal GPS, which runs off of the Garmin GPS network.  * If you have a MyFitnessPal account, it loads up the calories you log, and balances with the calories expended so you know if you are under or over your calories limits.  * If you wear it while you sleep, it tracks your sleep patterns.  * It can also send notifications from your phone (using bluetooth), and alerts you when you get messages or phone calls.   There are some many other great things about this watch, so I'll just finish by saying that it's a great product for the price! I should also mention that the replacement process I went through happened last month, so I can confirm that they still have amazing customer service.",False,False

So it might be worth reaching out to customer service! Though I am not sure if they still have that policy in place or you may have to pay for shipping.,False,False

They're about the same price ($90), and the (distance) data is more accurate because it's based off of GPS instead of an internal pedometer. BEST OF ALL, when mine broke after having it for for almost 2 years, I contacted Garmin to see if there was a fix for this, and they just sent me a replacement. They even paid for the shipping so I could return the broken unit.",False,False
