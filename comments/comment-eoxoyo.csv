I noticed it was getting really out of hand for me and was just contributing to a poor mindset, so I started watching a lot more how-toâ€™s on DMing and campaign writing instead. now my â€˜supersize vs super skinnyâ€™ hour has become â€˜dungeons and dragonsâ€™ hour, and tbh I think itâ€™s helped me a lot.   any creative hobby or any interest that occupies your mind is a good bet. youâ€™ll be interested and then you have something to occupy your time with right after.",False,False
