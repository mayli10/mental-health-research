I realized I could do this shortly after I started purging two years ago. Let me tell you, it is a CURSE. Purging has seeped into every corner of my life, from when I wake up to when I go to bed. Right now, it’s every. Single. Fucking. Day. And it is awful. I truly hope you won’t lean on it as much as I do. ",False,False

I (used to) start off hands free and then finish off with fingers  (small text thats what she said lmao). Its kind of a nightmare though cause it make it that much easier to purge. I havent purged in a couple years bar a slip up now and then but its still my body's automatic response every time I eat or drink and its just making it so that my bulimia is still affecting my health even though I no longer purge.,False,False
