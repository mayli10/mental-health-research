I'm 19, I wanted my eyebrows pierced since I was 16. Hell, maybe I'll even get my nipples pierced. Will I regret later? Who knows? A lot of fun, a lot of regrets, I'll certainly heed your advice and do my best to stay safe.",False,True

Casual sex can be fun and healthy but only if you’re acting on true sexual desires. Right now it seems you’re getting off on being desirable instead of actively desiring the guy. This is called self-objectification and is really common among young women growing up in our culture. It took me years to unlearn it and find out what I actually find sexy instead of being turned on by acting out a guy’s ultimate fantasy. I don’t believe you can have healthy sex until you discover this about yourself. I hope you find out what makes you tick so you can enter a mutually satisfying relationship. Best of luck and stay safe!!!,False,False

Died my hair blonde, got a nose ring, and was at one of my lower weights. I had a lot of fun but also a lot of regrets. I definitely used the validation from men to not gain any weight. And it worked great,  until I got in a relationship and gained 40 pounds (lol rip). But have fun and stay safe dude, there's a lot of shitty people out there.",False,False

We were friends first, and much of the sexual contact has been initiated by me. I always get a “is this okay with you” before he does anything. “I don’t mind” is not an acceptable answer for him, either I say I’m enjoying it or he stops. So that’s been okay...  Everything else though...you caught me. I like this guy, as a friend, because I know we would never be compatible long term. My eating disorder is just changing. I’m not underweight, now I’m just putting my value in sex appeal. I do a lot of squats, I’ve been wearing more push-up bras instead of sports bras. My concept of self-value has just went from being put in being weak and frail to being...whatever this is.  I had my “first kiss” and I felt nothing. Got my first nude, nothing. Got my boobs touched, nothing. Just nothing. I just got some sick satisfaction out of knowing he would be able to cum to pictures of me. I find myself physically revolting, but if someone keeps telling me how they need me to stop texting them because they can’t concentrate with a hard-on...I can almost believe that I have some redeeming qualities.   Oh gosh, this was long. I guess I really needed to vent. Thank you for your comment, I think I’m going to officially end things. I discussed it with him briefly. He’s a great guy. I just want validation, and there’s no room in my world for someone else.   Thank you so much again, I really appreciate your comment.",False,True

You are trying to garner positive attention and validation but it will blow up in your face eventually. I bet you’re even choosing guys that you don’t find respectable or honorable on purpose to avoid catching feelings. By exposing yourself to these men that only care about your physical attributes, you not only validate the part of your eating disorder that says you’re only as good as your looks, but also put yourself in harms way by being around these men. They don’t care about you or your physical safety. What if one of them drugs you or tries to get you to drink too much?  Please keep yourself safe and try to focus on relationships that enrich your life and help you fight your eating disorder, instead of putting yourself in risky situations. Wish you the best of luck.",False,False
