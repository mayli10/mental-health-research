There is always a favourite and no such thing as liking equally when it comes to people...  That he even sees it as a ""fun idea"" is rather hurtful when I personally want only him, and then there is the possibility he already have an idea about who else he'd want...  What you say makes a bit of sense though, thank you for your answer",False,True

It's okay if poly isn't for you. I'm monogamous too. But please talk to him about this if you're worried his willingness means anything negative about you or your relationship. If he's an otherwise affectionate and committed dude, it might've been as low-key as ""seems like a fun idea to try out in case we both like it"".  &gt; and said he didnt need it.  Hold onto this.",False,False
