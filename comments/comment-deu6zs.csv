And I never really thought about it like that but you’re absolutely right it IS like stage fright.   I feel like I can’t take normal sized bites, like it’s the first time I’ve held a utensil, like I’m being stared at, I’ll have food on my face, they will think I’m awful, I’ll try to talk and have food in my mouth, oh crap I haven’t been eating and now it’s the end of the meal and all my food is left, I’m sweating, do I take it to go and look like an idiot and tote it around or do I send it back and look like a horrible bitch who just wastes food, oh crap they are trying to pay for me and I’m just wasting their money.   Well there goes any chance with them :((",False,False

I get so shaky and nervous, almost like I'm speaking in front of a crowd when I have to eat with people. Even worse when I have to talk while eating. It really sucks because I want to try and get to know people but my ED + social anxiety keeps getting in the way.",False,True

I’ve straight up just refused and looked like such a fucking weirdo around people I really like :( I honestly think anxiety is a huge part of my ED tbh....,False,False
