What the actual fuck gives people the idea that it’s okay to say these things? ESPECIALLY if they know your severe history of eating disorders.   And then when people relapse for some reason they can’t figure out WHY.,False,False

Moms really are great at fucking with our body image. Mine has spent my entire life talking about how small she was at my age and calling me a fatass when she’s angry at me (despite the fact that she is bigger than I am now, and beyond lazy.) I tell myself she feels the same pressure I do to be thin and that’s why she acts like that but it doesn’t make it any easier to cope with.",False,False
