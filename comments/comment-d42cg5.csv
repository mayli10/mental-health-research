Does shaming others make her feel better about herself? Is she projecting her own insecurities onto other people in hopes hers get smaller?  If it were me I would never let go of the grudge. Her character has now been proven to be toxic, narcissistic, manipulative and catty. Such people don't deserve your time.",False,False

One of them was fasting and the other got a Starbucks pb sandwich pack while I got a pink drink. The venti is only 200cals but the girl who was fasting was saying Starbucks pink drink was close to 400 and in my mind Iâ€™m like wtf (I was kinda shocked how normies have no awareness of calories like wow... I know the majority of calories in Starbucks drink cuz Iâ€™m neurotic and figured everyone else did too since itâ€™s on the website or the app but this girl was way off, she practically doubled it). I laughed internally but verbally I simply said I liked it store made since it tastes better. She was talking about how she prefers to make homemade versions of Starbucks drinks since itâ€™s cheaper and she can make it lower cals but like yea no wonder you donâ€™t drink since you think itâ€™s freakin 400 cals lmao. Thatâ€™s the cal content of their frapps not their tea/refresher varieties.",False,False
