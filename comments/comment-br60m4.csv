It's not you. Absolutely not. Your husband has issues and none of them is because because of your weight.  I had my first relapse in adult age after this happened to me. Me being skinnier did not prevent him to fuck things up again later. So yeah.",False,False

I hear you hurting. What could hurt even more is settling to be with a person 5 years from now who broke your heart and wasted all of the time while not giving you what you deserve: love and RESPECT. I know when you don't love or respect yourself, it makes it that much harder to choose people who do give that to you. Because we don't feel worthy. I am here to tell you that you have a slimmer chance of feeling worthy one day if you don't cut ties with people who violate fidelity. I am so sorry you are hurting. You do NOT deserve treatment like this. You do not do not do not.",False,False
