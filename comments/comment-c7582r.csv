I’m seriously thinking about calling in sick everyday this week over the binge I had yesterday. I don’t want to be seen in public for a month.,False,False

Before I gained a lot of weight I had similar attitudes, I felt pity for obese people and didn’t understand how anybody could be so “careless” and “lazy”to allow themselves to get to that point. Life humbled me really quick with a lot of health issues and other problems that got me to an obese BMI at a point in time. So many people on Reddit and in real life seem to think fat shaming is helpful. It isn’t, it’s so harmful. All I want to do when someone calls me fat is eat MORE actually, it gives me this defeated thought process of “well obviously people already think I’m fat so who cares if I have pizza for breakfast.”  People always want to assume that everyone that is overweight is overweight because they’re ignorant about nutrition, a lazy slob, or a glutton. That’s simply not true and it’s damaging because for all they know that 250lb person might be eating healthy, they could have been 400lbs at a point in time. They might be already working on it. But that’s not what those redditors choose to see. They always assume the worst of fat people. Nobody gets the benefit of the doubt.   Unlike being a former alcoholic or drug user, people can easily see the damage a food addiction caused your body sometimes long after you’ve recovered and started losing weight. As long as you’re still fat, people still assume you’re engaging in unhealthy behaviors. That makes recovery so much harder. It would be like an alcoholic putting the bottle down just for people to constantly tell them they’re acting drunk all the time when they’re actually completely sober.  I once gained a significant amount of weight because I was suffering from a sleep eating disorder and didn’t realize it. It’s incredibly rare, pops up in times of stress, and worst part is I don’t remember what I ate the next day to try and allow for the calories in my diet plan. I can sometimes notice based on what food is gone in the morning but that’s only what I can readily notice. Yet I still had to listen to people shake their heads in disapproval and make assumptions about what I ate and how I lived my life when I gained the weight. Even though while I was conscious during the day I was eating 1200. Nobody wanted to believe that though. Nobody wanted to even try to entertain the idea that the disorder exists, I’m truly asleep while it’s happening, have no control or recollection of what was eaten, and it’s not my fault that this is happening to me.",False,False

You're not alone. I've also used them for meanspo, so that's not great. Reddit (which has a large Male userbase), and for some reason a lot of men, have this idea that it's super easy to lose/not gain weight and it makes for really toxic beliefs.",False,False

Posts on relationships or advice subs that basically ask “my spouse/friend/acquaintance has gotten big and I don’t like them as much anymore, should I confront them about how they’ve let themselves go so I don’t have to fix my prejudice towards them?” get a lot of replies that say yes, do. The idea that common courtesy extended a person should fluctuate with their weight is mean and shallow, and I would really hope it’s less prominent in general society than here on Reddit. And welcome to ED Anonymous! I hope this becomes a safe space for you. 😊",False,False

I have people constantly getting upset and saying, “Why are you so concerned with something that means so little?” But it’s like, it’s not little..it affects your entire life. People *will* treat you differently if you’re fat. Shit, the people telling me these things themselves mock people for being fat, including me when I was overweight.   I’m in school to become an RD, and it’s still very difficult for me to lose weight. It’s not lack of knowledge. Just, given that I’m so short (and especially now because I just had surgery done and can’t exercise for 1.5 months), it’s very difficult for me to stick to 1,000 Calories a day. I’m sorry, but my appetite is closer to 2,000 Calories a day. And I’m talking about with clean foods that would be a model diet for a dietitian.  I judge fat people too. Like, I could not date a man who was 400+ pounds for instance. I don’t blame people or get upset at them for this fact of life that we’re kind of subconsciously wired to judge different/fat people, but I’d rather people not try to deny it.  Or was pisses me off too is when people tell me “personality is more important than looks”. And I’m like yeah, that’s true, but the two aren’t mutually exclusive. You CAN be both beautiful and have a great personality, like wtf.",False,False
