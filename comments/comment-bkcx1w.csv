I’m terrified he’ll pick up on my eating habits. All of a sudden he just doesn’t want to eat anything. Finally he ate a piece of pizza at my dads house and 2 granola bars at home. I give him a multi vitamin because I’m worried he’s not getting what he needs and he won’t drink pediasure. I want to look into a vitamin my sister in law has that has the equivalent of several servings of fruits and veggies but I can’t remember the name.,False,False

Even people who have 2 cents of human decency need to be careful to avoid passing down unhealthy patterns.",False,False

Bad parents don't give a shit about how their actions are affecting their kids. You and your kids are all gonna be fine!,False,False

DD already sees a lot of my behaviors and i'm terrified how they'll affect her in the long run. i panic if she looks like she's getting chubby and then i hate myself because she's a toddler, that's how they grow.  i don't know how to monitor mealtime. you don't have to finish everything on your plate but don't waste any of the food? junk food is not a trophy but eat your raisins before i give you the chocolate?  what's healthy and what's promoting an eating disorder? omg i can't parent.",False,False

I think a lot about my own mom and her issues surrounding food. She used to bring me to weight watchers with her when I was a teenager. While she lost weight in a healthy way and encouraged me when I expressed that I wanted to lose weight, I think it did some damage to my self esteem. Of course I also watched my older sister go through residential treatment for anorexia when I was 10, so that probably fucked me up more than anything my parents could have done. Being a parent is so difficult. Sometimes I can't believe that I thought it was a good idea to be responsible for molding a human life. I love them so much. I just want to see them grow to be happy and healthy. My daughter is only 4 months old and I tell her every day that she is smart, beautiful, and worthy.",False,True

I don’t know how I’m going to live with myself if I pass on these issues to her. I know I won’t be overt about it like my mom (commenting negative on my body in front of her, commenting on HER body, etc.)  i am determined to keep it from her the best I can and encourage a healthy relationship with food. But with how things are going right now for me I can’t imagine she won’t pick up on it at some point. Makes me hate myself so much.   Also have a husband with his own eating issues. I wonder all the time why the fuck I thought it was a good idea to get married and have a child at the age I did. But I love her so much and want to be a good mom, so I do have some motivation to keep from completely spiraling I guess.",False,False
