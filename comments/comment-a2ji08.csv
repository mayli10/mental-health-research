I drive my husband crazy when grocery shopping because I can spend hours in the store reading labels/googling products/comparing stuff. It’s gotten bad enough that we’ve started doing a lot of our shopping online so that I’m not stuck in Walmart for half a day.",False,False

I feel like people think I’m crazy when I look at nutrition labels of literally all the products and then I am too embarrassed and put things back I really wanted to buy. In general I just feel so WATCHED. I also think the cashier is going to judge me no matter what I buy. Like I’m too scared to buy junky food because then they’ll think I’m so unhealthy, and at the same time I feel embarrassed when I get all my super clean foods because I feel like a wannabe fit person. And I’m also too scared to buy a bunch of diet products because that’s not suspicious at all. So yeah I hate shopping for groceries and never end up getting anything new I want to try :|",False,False

I am honestly the complete opposite and the grocery store is my happy place but it used to give me a panic attack. I saw a therapist in college for this and did cbt. It's so weird bc it used to be the scariest place for me and now I go several times a week. It can get better but if you never feel.comfortable that's okay too. You can always order groceries online! ,False,False
