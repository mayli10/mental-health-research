Is there anything else sport-wise you really enjoy? It really helps to focus on fitness or getting better at your sport as a goal of some sorts. Good luck man, I really hope we can both break out of it for good.",False,False

Binge cause depressed and food makes me happy, binge causes depression, rinse and repeat. Only thing that really works for me is trying to lift my mood a bit, usually force myself to go for a run which really helps mood wise. But also just riding out the urge to binge like a wave. It's hard to be objective in those times but the ability to step back and think 'if I binge now it'll just cause me to be more depressed and binge again tomorrow' and ride out the wave is paramount. For me the urge passes in an hour or so. I'm trying to learn to be able to step back and analyse objectively in those shit times but it's hard.",False,False
