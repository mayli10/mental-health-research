Try compromising by having a talk with them, that you're trying to get better but it's a slow process. Then bring up therapy, that you'll go, but you recover/mental health is something you need to handle at your own pace, not theirs. ",False,False

Back before Ana when I used to eat I never had the pain I have no after I eat so it’s definitely something that has developed. Also recently people are starting to comment that my skin has a yellow glow to it and idk what to make of it. Prob going to see a doctor this week ,False,True

Another thing I believe  that might you sick after eating something it might be because you haven't taken enough calories cause you ben starving yourself.

At this point they don’t wan’t a reason they just wan’t to try and break me with blunt force. they think it’s some sort of sick fucking game of chicken and they will just get me to start eating. I was going out last night and they had taken my keys and said if I didn’t eat something I wasn’t getting them back. I ate half of a banana in front of them and then left. Litterally purged half a banana on the side of the street at like 10pm. It’s not just stubbornness or superficial bullshit. I can’t eat, it causes me physical pain and mentally rapes me ",False,True

Your parents are human too, to see your child be mentally in ruins (if you have an ED you clearly are to some extent, it we’re being real with ourselves) would be soul-destroying.
