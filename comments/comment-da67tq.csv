I think I only gave ina couple times and it always upset me.   Jokes on me though because surprise, I have alopecia so I've gone bald twice and my formerly thick hair is patchy.   I guess it's not quite the same but I like it more than I ever imagined (a few years ago I would have considered losing a limb over cutting my hair) and now I'm free to try styles and colors since I'll probably lose it again at some random time.   But I'm glad yours worked out for you too!",False,False

The good news is that after recovering, it‚Äôs starts growing back pretty fast, at least for me it did. Just make sure to eat good nutrient rich foods.

If I cut it I wouldn't do above my shoulders at most, at least for now.

Do it slowly and gradually so you can get a measure of how short hair looks on you( if you don‚Äôt like it it could be triggering ). I love short hair but be warned that people treat you differently and start making assumptions of your sexuality. I say if you feel for a change, it‚Äôs very freeing but hair takes a while to for from pixie to bob and from bob to shoulder and so on.    Changing our hair is cathartic and I find myself also changing my look when I go through phases. It‚Äôs also really fun. Next thing for me is jet black hair dye or a Gerard way red to channel my inner clown.",False,True

Every time I'm on the Relapse Recovery Wheel‚Ñ¢Ô∏è I do something new to my hair. maybe because half of my hair falls out when I'm gaining weight, maybe I just want to change. I didn't realize it until I was contemplating chopping 9in off last night and noticed the trend.
