I graduated college and work as what people in Ireland would call a professional. I spent all last weekend (bank holiday weekend) playing passive aggressive pin pong with my parents. Their 74 and 67 years old.   It follows the same arch. I exercise, I restrict and I binge drink. Doing it since my first year in college. I graduated and got a good job. I don’t really understand the passive aggressive nature of my parents.     When it come’s to family I love them but I always stayed away from the family back and fourth.   Maybe they think I am bit directionless or it’s their coping mechanism. I am not sure. Maybe this is how people express concern, attachment or love. Its mystery to me.     Hope my sharing helped.",False,False
