They often pretend that they're eating pizza, burgers, fries, and icecream all the time when it's clear that they're not. Em Ratajkowski is a good example and has been posted about a few times recently in this sub.  Sorry, it's probably confusing because the title of the article is dumb. I posted it because the quotes from her in the article are pretty much like ""oh lol yeah I did lots of cocaine and barely ate, sorry for pretending I was eating like a normal human being"". If the post is low effort or otherwise not okay then I'm fine for admins to delete.",False,True

Lots of snarky comments in the article itself about this. I guess I just wish women like her would be honest *at the time* rather than afterwards. Because I think the time lapse is 4 years or something and by now her pretending her thinness was from being healthy will have already done damage to a lot of people's self esteem.   I know that last bit is pretty flawed/simplified and I'm definitely not blaming her for ED's in general or the overall standards women are pressured to meet. It's just each time you get the real truth later it's like well damn.,False,True
