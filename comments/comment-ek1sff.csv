Your ED isn't your fault. All feelings are valid - but another perspective is that if someone had cancer, you wouldn't think them selfish. Anorexia is the same thing. I hope you have a better day today.",False,False

Take comfort in knowing you're not alone and have people you can talk to. Your thoughts, feelings, and emotions are valid.  Not sure if you're the same as me, but I have to track absolutely everything I eat or else I feel sick. Like I feel as if I have completely lost control of my life. So knowing that I can't stop tracking, what has helped me tremendously is also tracking my macronutrients. You'd be surprised as to how much better you'll feel if your diet was balanced, even at a very low caloric intake.  Start slow. Ask for help. You can only go up from here. I wish nothing but the best for you.",False,False

You DO deserve food.  The anorexia voice is telling you that you don't. Food is a basic need, like breathing. I'm sorry you're trapped in thoughts; they are awful. Those thoughts alone are your 'sick enough.' A bmi of 12 is thin enough. You deserve to live.",False,False
