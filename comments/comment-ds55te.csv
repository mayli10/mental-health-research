Your friend is not a professional. Your friend maybe doesnâ€™t have the knowledge to respond appropriately or know what to say. I donâ€™t mean that people donâ€™t care, or that your feelings are not valid. What i mean is that most people are not equipped to handle these disorders and are not professionals so donâ€™t know how serious and traumatic they can be. What response would you have preferred from your friend?",False,False

Thatâ€™s a her problem, not a you problem. I hope you are able to find someone who is kind and supportive that you can open up to. ðŸ’•",False,False
