Nuts and fruit are really nutritious but it's frustrating to see them as something else.  You should try though.  I wouldn't even eat those tiny boxes of raisins in the beginning but took the plunge one day.  I kept them close by for spontaneous moments.  The reality is that a small amount doesn't make any difference.  I don't gain an ounce from them.  It took away the craving as well because the joy of raisins was really playing on mind non-stop.  That little bag honestly won't have a negative effect.  I'm going to shop for a small packet of nuts.  At some point that trail mix will be mine!!!  As they say, small steps.  x",False,False

Raisins are the only ones I eat because they do these tiny boxes for putting in kids lunchboxes at 45 cals a box.  There's only about 12 in it!    My ultimate goal food is a nuts and raisins mix.  Best food of all time.  I want a whole mega massive pack of it.  (Hate currants though).,False,False
