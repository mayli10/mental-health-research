Yes bulimia is a part of your life, but it isn't your life, even though it feels that way. But bulimia loses that privilege today, even if it's just a day. No illusion, it's YOUR day. You deserve it. And I wish you the best possible YOU day. Take care of yourself and try to celebrate with non-food rewards (my personal favourite is a new bath bomb) ðŸ’–",False,False
