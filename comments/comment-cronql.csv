I work in geriatric care and honestly we're always educated on protecting patient rights but in inpatient they didn't seem to care about that. All that mattered was us following the rules.

I felt like a criminal for having an ED, like I was being punished and could never be trusted. Maybe it's just because I grew up in a really strict household and people keeping extremely close watch on me like that puts me on edge",False,False

They stopped doing that tho thank god.",False,False
