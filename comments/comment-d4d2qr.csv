Ngl I’m so goddamn sick of hearing my female friends and even random women on the internet talk about shitty fucking men like this. You. Do. Not. Owe. This. Shitbag. Even. The. Time. Of. Day. And I know he’s probably “usually so nice” and “is only weird about this one thing” but honestly if he says shit that makes you this upset and then tries to double down on it when you explain that to him instead of just *fucking apologizing* then it’s time to throw the whole damn friendship in the trash. Men like this only see women as fucking objects, even platonic friends. Sorry for the swearing and the rant I’m just so tired of these fuckheads who think they know everything just because they’ve got a flimsy little fucking twig between their legs. You deserve better, and you shouldn’t feel bad in the slightest for breaking contact with this scumbag.",False,False

Also the back tracking.  I'm assuming you're a healthy BMI and a size 8 is NOT a weight that any typical person would pull you aside and say they were concerned about your health. It's practically unacceptable to do that to obese/visibly UW people, let alone someone in a standard/below standard American range?  You are valid in your feelings and must decide how to move forward with this person. It sounds like they hurt you and showed no remorse or emotional maturity, therefore I would personally recommend limiting or ending contact.",False,False

He said a lot of things like ""Well I'm sorry but I'm just worried about your health. Your health is my number one concern."" And basically told me that I didn’t want him to be honest with me if he couldn’t say what he said to me. He eventually backtracked and told me that my body wasn't a problem. Like.... okay?   And yeah tbh I don’t even feel like I can look him in the eyes anymore. Idc if he even realizes that what he said was cruel or inappropriate. Just knowing how he sees me is enough to put my body dysmorphia at an all time high.   It's just so hurtful that he literally saw my size 8 self, who is currently sick and dealing with a lot of things, and thought that (in his own admission) that I was ""so fat that it warranted a comment of concern"")",False,True

No matter how caring he seems at other times what he did is not okay, and getting upset with you expressing that can become gaslighting (I don't have enough info here to claim that).  He seems toxic to be making comments about your body and what he likes in a woman when this is platonic. Why in the ever living fuck should it matter his sexual preference doesnt look like you? I'd ask that question outright.",False,False
