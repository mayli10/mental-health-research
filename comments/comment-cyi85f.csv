Right now I‚Äôm too disgusted and can‚Äôt seem to find a good angle. The equivalent of two bags of potatoes later and this bitch will be naked 24/7.,False,False

But I had it even worse, my nose flared way out to the sides and then came back in.  I had it fixed when I was 19, but tbh it didn't really do very much for me lookswise.  There's only one guy in the country who can do it without leaving a scar.  He basically cut out a piece of pie shaped section where my nose meets my face but never cut the skin.  Then he sewed it closed on the inside and pulled the tip out a bit. He inserted a wire mesh so it would stay in place.  My nose doesn't flare out at all.  You could see the scar on the inside of my nose only, and its it's completely faded so you can't see anything.
