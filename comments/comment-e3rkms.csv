It has been happening to me since last night. Also if you don’t typically eat dairy but did yesterday, that will fuck you up. Adults can become lactose intolerant very easily.",False,False

Had the same coffee today as every other day. I think it might be mild food poisoning cuz this is not normal. I’m not super sick, maybe a little. I’m not fasting rn either, I ate a bunch for thanksgiving. I do fast a lot though.   I had dental surgery two weeks ago but didn’t take any narcotics, just Tylenol and ibuprofen. Could it be from stopping that?",False,True

Please be safe fasting op, it is considerably rough on the body.",False,False
