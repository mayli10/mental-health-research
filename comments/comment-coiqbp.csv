But then I gained a bunch of weight and it went away. I would say that I no longer have it. My most recent relapse was definitely fueled by positive reinforcement rather than negative (i.e. “omg it’s possible for me to loom good” vs “I hate my body and I need to remove the fat”). It’s definitely possible and I would say that the anxiety is the easiest way for me to know if I’m relapsing.   Does eating 50cal over my daily budget cause me to hyperventilate? Do I turn down food I love or social interactions because it’s too calorific even if it’s the first day I’m eating decent food in a week? Probablyyy falling back into it.,False,False

For me, my ED is all about control and self-punishment, but it doesn’t help that we live in a diet-obsessed society that idealizes thin bodies. I also have that weird cognitive dissonance of not hating my body but wanting to be thinner and thinner at the same time.",False,False

More of an obsessive-compulsive undercurrent to my food issues but it started in just a very run of the mill CICO weight loss effort (which I've done before to lose a few pounds here and there and never spiraled into an ED so...weee...). What I've found with my doctor, while we're in something of a holding pattern waiting for more specialized treatment, is that him giving me new calorie goals (in gradual increments) has mostly been successful as a short term stopgap measure. Because my need to not disappoint expectations apparently can outweigh my prior fixation on a too-low number range. Lol.",False,False
