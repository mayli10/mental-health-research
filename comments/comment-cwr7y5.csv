I. 15 days late, not pregnant after 2 tests.  Have been severely restricting for over a year now, lost 90lbs and recently ran a half marathon and dealing with a lot of stress.  The perfect storm I'm thinking as to why it's just not showing up suddenly...  I'm trying to eat more, i fucking hate it, it's just exhausting and I hate the feeling of being ""stuffed"" and ""sluggish""  all the time.  Goddamn.  Have been hitting iron rich foods hard though, blackstrap molasses and beets, spinach, etc...  Also lots of nuts and nut butters...  but jesus christ I just cant seem to get more than 1500 calories a day in me still and I feel disgusting and SO full doing it .  ðŸ˜°",False,False

Also iron is really important if youâ€™re trying to get your menstrual cycle back on track, so if you can try to each iron rich foods   mostly you really just need to eat at least maintenance, your body isnâ€™t going to allocate calories to a nonessential process like menstruation if it doesnâ€™t have any to spare",False,False

If you keep starving, you'll keep losing, and every health problem that comes with it. I wish there was a way for me to stay as I am (I'm at my lw) but I know I have to gain if I want my life back. Nobody said it would be easy, it's a huge sacrifice, but whatever. I'd rather be healthy than self-obsessed, so I can be there for the people in my life who have worse problems than I do.",False,False
