A lot of people think olive oil is low in calorie or something. And same on the nuts. People think ""good for you"" is the same thing as ""light"" wrt calories and... it's not lmao  Like coconut oil, avocados, nuts, whole grains, etc. are all absolutely nutritious and part of a healthy diet but you CAN gain weight on them if you don't pay attention to your serving sizes!! The health benefits of food do not negate their calories!!",False,False
