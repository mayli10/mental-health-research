I’d eaten close to this way for years and my antibodies were at 0 but I still felt terrible and even things like probiotics didn’t seem to work. Now I can feel the differences with and without supplements easily. I really feel like T3 was the game changer.,False,False

I went to a specialist (Endocrinologist) and he upped by dosage to bring my tsh closer to a 1 and I lost weight, had tons more energy, and become way more productive.   From my limited understanding it CAN cause weight gain for non-hypothyroidism people who take it because it essentially boost your metabolism and other functions beyond the normal range which would make you need more energy (calories) leading to a higher appetite. If you’re worried go to a specialist, read your blood results, and stay within a safe tsh range...For me I feel best around 1.   tl;de: IF you have hypothyroidism it will help you with weight management, if you’re trying to abuse the drug it could have the adverse effect of what you want.",False,False
