Plunty of people who lose weight in a healthy non dissordered way give themselves self gifts as an incentive (I use to tell myself I'd get a tattoo when I was normal bmi and then never followed through but anyway)   People can have eating disorders but legitimatly need to lose weight. The best way to do that is to have someone in your corner to help you make the healthy choices and spot when we might be using bad coping mechanisms like binging, purging or restricting. To support us through the anxiery and fear that can come with eating. Everyone's ed is going to be a little different and it doesn't sound strange to me that a husband would want his wife to be healthier.  I had to basically spell it out to my husband that I had to lose weight- I was obese and I could not continue down that path and I needed his support and then he was supportive.   Besides, they are married so technically she is also giving herself a gift. ",False,False

He's your husband! You know he's not gonna walk up and out of your life because he suddenly knows the exact number that represents your relationship with gravity. It's just a number to him. It sounds like he really wants to encourage and help you with your goals. I'm sure the only part of this that could possibly elicit any negative emotion in him is that his wife feels like crying! I'm sure that's not what he wants! Congrats on getting your dream job, that's amazing! don't say things like ""I'm not trying hard enough"". frame it this way. You've been putting all your hard work into securing that job, right? You've simply been prioritizing the important things :) Don't be sad love",False,False
