Honestly I’m not trying to argue whether it was true or not. I just posted this because of my frustration and since my boyfriend doesn’t understand, posting here is my best outlet.   I understand our ED brain makes us paranoid but it’s not like I’m unaware of my surroundings/what’s happening around me.   She was sitting by me (same row) in the movie theaters while I was binging on food (the lights are on before the movie starts btw). We somehow ended up in the restroom stalls at the same time and I started purging and she saw me walking out of the the stall and while we were washing our hands she walked out of the restroom she said EW loudly and mumbled a few other things. To avoid seeing her I walked to my seat from another side, and once I left the movie theater from another side we ended up passing by each other and from the corner of my eye I saw her point at me and her husband turned and looked directly at me.  It’s not too hard to pinpoint who’s puking in the restroom when the person comes out of the stall red faced with bloodshot eyes.",False,True

How did you know it was her saying ewww in the bathroom? Did you see her as she was walking out of the restroom? Did she see you come in or out of the restroom? How did she know it was you?   Did she wait to see you walk back into the theater? Did she sit next to you and know your movements?  I am asking this because our ED brain makes us think people are much more aware of us than they really are. Since we are so hyper critical of our weight and our appearance and our actions, then others must. In reality they don’t.  This may be an ED thought more than a real thought.   In your story it’s hard for me to know how she knows it’s you. If you were in a bathroom stall, she would not have seen you and you would not have seen her. She may have smelled any vomit sure, but I don’t know how she could identify you.   If she was watching a movie in a theater, I wonder how she was able to ID you in a busy, dark theater when her attention is on the movie.  This may be a case where ED brain is making us feel more seen than what we really are. It’s not that I don’t believe what happened, I just question all of the assumptions you’ve made without even speaking to these strangers.   I cannot tell you how many times I thought a stranger was looking/talking or referring to me and their attention was absolutely elsewhere. This may be the case here.   Take care.",False,False

I always thought stuff like this was exaggerated and only happened in movies or something so I was a bit taken aback by it. I wish would’ve said something to her but oh well!  I really appreciate everyone’s responses, it made me feel less crappy after it happened.",False,True
