The volume necessary is crazy. Maybe if you ate a big salad as a meal where spinach replaced lettuce it could work.   I know that supplements aren't as good as getting nutrients from food due to the way the body absorbs them and side effects that various supplements may have, but when somebody is getting sick from a vitamin or mineral deficiency I think it's better to take the supplement than to not. I only mentioned the burning problem, butbI'm aware that overreliance on supplements can cause other problems. A healthy diet is always the better choice, but that's not always possible for people with eating disorders. Of course, being able to justify eating french fries all the time was pretty nice for me üòÅ I live in the land of poutine so making them a staple food for my diet has been nice. Personally I tend to be fine eating whatever I want as long as it's healthy and doesn't aggravate my GI problems.",False,False

I spent the whole day being juiced up with potassium, and the nurse telling me how fit i was and how amazing i was for being able to lose weight when the topic came up. she was clueless about why i was there.  this started a series of cardio tests and labwork, and i actually started doing better. i love spinach and leafy greens (i just don't eat them) but they are superfoods for potassium - and ""best"" of all low in calories. i changed my routine to basically eat 500g of spinach a day split up over the day.  i finally got signed off, my long qt corrected itself once back eating better, and my values looked great.  i managed to keep that (somewhat) healthy eating going for a month or so, then relapsed into binge/restrict over the holidays. now i'm back restricting and exercising - setting myself up for another binge that will cause refeeding syndrome and possibly kill me.  why...",False,False

For some reason potassium pills are regulated to be a max of 2% the RDA per pill so that people with medical conditions that require they get less potassium in their diet can still take them. Super dumb if you ask me, but powders don't have the same restriction. A quarter teaspoon is 20% the RDA of potassium so depending on how low your intake is you can take 1/4 to 1/2 a teaspoon per day and be fine. If you carefully track your nutrition you might be able to get away with more, but it's not the best idea. It does have to be taken with food though because if it all settles into one spot in your stomach it can burn the inner lining. I personally put a quarter teaspoon in a meal replacement shake when I use it. They're thick enough to count as food, but they're also small and the ones I get are under 230 calories. Plus, they offer a lot of other vitamins and minerals and the ones I drink are a good source of protein.  Otherwise, if that's not an option, potatoes are the best source of potassium. I believe that bananas have more potassium per volume, but potatoes are much more dense than bananas and so they have more potassium per gram. A medium banana is around 118g and has 16% the RDA of potassium. A medium potato is like 170g, but if you compare 118g of potato to bananas than the calories are around the same with the potato having more potassium at 25% of the RDA.  I just looked it up now to be certain of the numbers, but I remember I originally learned of this because there was a meme that took the climax of Star Wars Episode 3 where Anakin is like ""You underestimate my power."" and Obi-Wan is like ""Don't do it, Anakin!"" then Anakin tries jump over Obi-Wan and gets his legs cut off except they drew Anakin as a banana and Obi-Wan as a potato and Anakin said ""You underestimate my potassium."" then Obi-Wan replied ""Don't do it, Bananakin!"" Great meme. The point is that potatoes are a good tier health food since only 5% of people get enough potassium in their diet and I absolutely recommend french fries as part of a healthy diet. Or baked potato wedges if you're scared of oil.",False,False

I was sort of trying to start recovering best I could on my own... and a part of me is really excited I 'get' to eat again because my ED rationalises that if there is really no way to get out of it, then and only then is it okay to eat.
