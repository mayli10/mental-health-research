I been all weights with all hair lengths.  I freaked out when I dyed my hair black on impulse because i read that black hair on a fatter person can make them look even rounder and chubby but... if you are sick of longer hair, give it a whack! short hair feels really good in the shower.",False,False

I found keeping a side fringe saved my face from looking overly round. Also beanies helped me when I had a day that I thought my face wasn't right. My hair grew out to a bob in under a year so even if it goes wrong you can wear a hat til it evens out.,False,False
