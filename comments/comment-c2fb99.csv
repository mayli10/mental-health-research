Literally where did I say that? I'm saying, yay, being overweight is awesome! I'm saying, first focus on the bingeing. If you don't binge eat, chances are you're going to lose weight...  For me, with my binge eating, therapy was absolutely key and essential. I never saw a dietitian. I never changed my eating outside of my binges. I did not focus on my diet at all. What I did focus on were entirely mental -- how to cope with stress, how to love and take care of myself, how to understand that I was worthy of recovery.  Your original comment had none of the backstory you've since included. It was devoid of explanation or understanding.  For the record, I never downvoted you.",False,False

I didn't say it was easy. But it's very possible if she works at it. It's truly her only healthy option. I found when I went lower carb (didn't ELIMINATE anything), but IF and lower carb worked fucking wonders for my BED AND it let me lose weight to a point I was comfortable with. OP has to eat to live. I'm telling her the best way to do it so she has a chance of getting rid of her problem.   BED fucking sucks. I've lost count of the number of times I laid curled up in a ball of the floor sobbing, begging God to kill me if it couldn't take away the eating disorder. I've been there. I also beat it. You guys can pat her head and tell her it's all gonna be okay, don't worry honey, 200 lbs is nothing! Fine. If she wants her life back, I'll tell her how to ACTUALLY deal with her issue, and be downvoted to fuck for it. You think I'm being an asshole for suggesting she focus on integrating healthy eating habits? She has no other choice. She can't stay where she is. It's a hard road, but it's the only one she has.  Get some good habits going. For the love of God, exercise, it's fucking good for you. I HATE IT, and I still do it, and it makes me feel wonderful (afterward). Therapy is also a good option but imo, the first two matter more. Just my two cents.  Best of luck to OP.",False,False

You’ve come to this sub to ask others for suggestions and share your experience. That is really powerful!   I hear how difficult things are for you, being isolated and not having more options for a therapist who gets what you’re going through. It sounds like you feel like you need to educate them, which isn’t fair. I’d encourage you to be honest with your therapist about your feelings regarding the therapeutic relationship and feeling they don’t understand how you grew up and the trauma you’ve been through. If there are examples of things they’ve said that were hurtful, share those or things they could say that would be helpful, offer those. If you have been in therapy before and there was something that worked for you, share that with the therapist. Don’t hesitate to suggest that they read up on something or ask them to change the method. Some people like handouts, worksheets, others prefer just talking. Maybe with someone that doesn't understand you as well, asking them to teach you some skills to cope with your situation in healthier ways might be worth a try. It could mean having less of a focus in them trying to understand what happened, which might feel better for you. It's hard for me to say since I'm not you and don’t know exactly what your therapy relationship is like.   Some ideas are learning DBT skills, CBT, or ACT (acceptance and commitment therapy). It can depend on the therapists training what they can do. Other ideas are mindfulness, guided imagery, exposure work, therapeutic journaling, and therapeutic art. Some of those are things you could do with YouTube videos (guided imagery, meditation). Eating disorders anonymous website has a step workbook that has questions that you might find helpful for journaling. Workbooks are another great resource, sometimes libraries have them. Amazon used is a good place to check or asking your therapist if they have resources. Often therapists make copies and bring for people to do some work in between sessions.   Workbooks: -finding life beyond trauma by follette and portobello  -managing traumatic stress through art by Cohen, Barnes, &amp; Rankin   Websites: Sidran (trauma), Pandora’s project (trauma message board- name might be slight different), We Bite Back (eating disorder recovery message board)  Goggle: wellness recovery action plan or relapse prevention plan.   Do you have a smartphone or computer with internet access? Is there a library accessible by bus? If you have access in any of those ways, check the websites for EDA, ABA, OA, FA, Smart Recovery and Alsana has online support group at least once a week. The 12 step ones have many per day, some are for smartphone and others for computers. They also have phone meetings. I believe they have meetings that are typing only which would be good if you are logged on in a library. It's a lot of work to look at all the different sites and see which group you think resonates most with you. It is hard to try some new. I'm really glad you're reached out and hope to hear more about how everything goes for you. I am sending encouragement and tons of positive vibes from the East Coast. You can do this. Recovery is up and down. You are walking through it day by day. We take it one day at a time. One slip up does not mean failure or relapse. It is a lapse in recovery and you can put yourself back on track by doing the next right thing.   What would you do differently next time you have that urge? Are there 3 things you could do before you act on the behavior (example- go for a 10 min walk, do a chore like dishes or sweeping, wash my face/face mask). What 3 things would you try? It’s ok if they don't help. Its the trying that's important. You’ll learn what helps by doing that and build up your ability to tolerate distress without acting on behaviors. Be gentle with yourself and acknowledge your efforts with recovery. Maybe keep a list of the things that helped you not act on a behavior and the things that weren’t helpful. I carry a notecard with 10 choices of what I can do first instead. I started with 3. Keep up the great work, you are not alone. We are here for you! You deserve freedom from eating disorder.",False,False

That’s what I suggested. If she exercises she’ll be less stressed/depressed. If she moderates her food intake/sticks to a plan she won’t be obsessed with food. It’s worked fantastically for me, and I dealt with binge eating for years. Tell me, how should she eat? Should she continue binging? Should she starve herself?  Not once did I tell herself to be ashamed or blame herself. I said her binge eating made her overweight. Which is true. And then I told her what to do to help fix her binge eating. Is it hard? Yup. Is it foolproof? No. Is it her only fucking option if she doesn’t want to be obese and obsessed with food? Pretty much.  No one should have to just accept being overweight. And no one should be told they should just love the way their body looks at an uncomfortably high weight. Fuck that noise. She already admitted she feels awful at her weight. So let’s fix THAT. Because it’s TOTALLY okay for her to feel negatively about being uncomfortable in a body that is too large for her comfort level.
