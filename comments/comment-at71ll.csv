Aside from my envy, I genuinely hope she gains weight for the sake of her health; I lover her dearly. I really want to pull out my phone, show her how her BMI is calculated that low, and see if that makes her want to gain some weight, but I don’t know if that might possibly encourage her to lose even more weight.
