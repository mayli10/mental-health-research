I also have these thoughts about FRIENDS I'VE BEEN IN TREATMENT WITH but are in active recovery/have recovered by now. Like I can't help but think they looked better 'back then' which is actually sick because they were ill and really struggling. Don't get me wrong I'm happy for their recovery and how much better they are doing now, but my brain can't help these thoughts.",False,False

I shame every bigger girl than myself in my head but out loud I cheer them and I feel so much like a two-faced bitch. I sometimes judge women based on what they eat or disapprove of their clothing based on their body shape. I hate it but can’t help it. At least I don’t pour out my toxicity and stays there with me.,False,False

Think of them like artificial thoughts placed in your head by ED. My ED's thoughts get loudest and quickest when something is keeping it from doing something.  Someone perceived skinnier than me is stopping me from being the best at being thin, so my ED spits insults about them. Someone urging me to eat is a direct attack on my ED. And sometimes its like my ED possesses me and speaks through me. To me, it's like a demon.",False,False
