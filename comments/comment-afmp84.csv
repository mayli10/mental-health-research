You have such wonderful things to look forward too such as... Stomach surgery to repair your dead intestines.. Involuntarily barfing at extremely inappropriate times.. A fat blotchy face from swollen lymph nodes! Hair loss!! Gall bladder removal surgery... Irreversible esophagus damge! Thin, broken and missing teeth. Constant stomach pain and heart burn! Being alone 24/7! And the best part??? Extreme medical debt but never feeling well enough to work to pay ANY of it off! Wooo hoo!   ",False,False

I wrote a separate about this now though.   Hope you’re doing better now 💛 although I get it if you’re not. Purging is like being on a trainwreck rollercoaster, wish it were as easy as hitting an eject button.",False,False

I think this should be in a separate post. I’ve noticed a lot of users are writing about their urge to purge for the first time and it’s really worrying me. I wish I had this sub before I started the vicious cycle 7 years ago ,False,False

It’ll be raw and you’ll break out in pimples and weird texture  - Swollen glands make your cheeks v chipmunky... my face looks like an amorphous pancake compared to my body and BMI  - Your hands will get scarred and tears and bleeding  - Heartburn and stomach pains 24/7. Gut flora is fucked to high heavens. Burps and farts and lots of bloating. Surprise involuntary regurg  - You may lose the purge high. I don’t feel calm or good or pure like I used to after purging, everytime I near the end of a dissociative binge I absolutely hate and fear the purging after  - You’ll lose electrolytes purging which means more fainting, lightheadedness, poorer concentration in work/study  - I feel (someone correct me if I’m wrong) that most bulimics end up gaining weight even though we’re “””correcting””” our binges. You can’t realistically know if you’ve purged completely, you’ll feel panicky next time when someone interrupts you before your purge session.   - The b/p cycle is atrocious. After you purge a binge, body is still prepped to break down food and so your hunger cues are still massively turned on. It is dangerously easy to get in a b/p cycle in one sitting, I promise you   Please be careful, the harm isn’t worth the temporary good you feel. ",False,False

I’ve been purging for about a year and my body is so damaged, I wish I never started, but I can’t stop. I know it’s hard, but try not to do it again, it’s not worth it. ",False,False
