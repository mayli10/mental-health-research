I'm guessing nobody wants pills to be any bigger than necessary (unless it's a gummy) so I've always figured any calories were limited to whatever was required to make the actual medicine part stick together. Thanks for the confirmation.,False,False

They are made with stearic acid and cellulose to bind them. We are talking about .5 calories per gram and most pills are like half a gram max. Bottom line: youâ€™re fine. Take the meds.,False,False

Easier said then done ik but I promise there are way more cons if you donâ€™t take it then if you do. If you do nothing bad will happen to you I promise,False,False
