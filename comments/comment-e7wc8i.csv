Dead easy, tastes pretty good. They’re a little fluffier/more bread-like in texture than typical pancakes, but they’re an alright imitation, especially with sugarfree syrup adding some moisture",False,False

Some protein powder forms (and flavors) have been more friendly for this than others. It tends to soak up a lot of moisture so tweaking proportions is usually needed. Some powders can also just be shook up with the liquid of your choice.",False,False
