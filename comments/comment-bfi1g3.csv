Objectively I eat ‚Äúa lot‚Äù and get comments on it sometimes but that‚Äôs because I eat high volume low calorie foods and snack throughout the day. For some reason a lot of people don‚Äôt realise how much high volume low cal food you can eat ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è It does feel shitty when people comment on your food but they probably are commenting on volume rather than calorie content",False,False

I decided to rescrict my eating window to a max of 4 hours (one meal+one snack) a day. Yesterday I was having an apple, after I ate one rice cake and a banana.  My mom was like ""will you ever stop eating?"" little did she know that was the first thing I was eating in almost 24h.  Being called out for what I eat makes me feel like shit and by consequence I want to rescrict even more. Fml.",False,False

I‚Äôm so sorry. You should absolutely eat, there is nothing wrong with eating fries after being sick :(  I know my opinion probably doesn‚Äôt help, I reactively starve myself in response to shit like this too, but yeah, that‚Äôs really out of line and frankly insane for your family to have said.",False,False
