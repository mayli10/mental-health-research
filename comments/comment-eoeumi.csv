Banana is good, but i tend to go for a small serving of rice since its cheap.",False,False

Oatmeal is a great suggestion. Sweet potato or squash would be good, too.  For drinks, you really just need to stay hydrated. Drink whatever will encourage you to keep drinking it. If you really aren't eating much at all, you might want to get electrolyte tablets to dissolve in water for after your run. Like, don't just fast, run/sweat, and then chug tons of water. That can put you at risk for hyponatremia.",False,False

My lizard brain is ok with me eating if I‚Äôm using it for exercise fuel because then my body is actually good for something.   I‚Äôm also super competitive so I have running goals and training that I need to do. Oatmeal or something else with slow digesting carbs post run and something caffeinated before I run is my go to.,False,False
