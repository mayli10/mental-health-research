I had the same feeling and now that I'm getting more and more recovered I'm able to look back at pictures where I'm so thin and I can recognize that I just looked sick and scary and bad in general there. I'm so thankful I have nice hair and nails and skin and my period again, even though being happy about that was unthinkable a couple of years ago. Keep pushing, I hope you'll get to a place where you're comfortable with recovery eventually💕",False,False
