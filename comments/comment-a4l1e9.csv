The salad goes first, then the broc/caul, and by the time I get to my veggie burger it's definitely cold and not as tasty but I *have* to eat it last since it's the most calorically dense item. I've also been incorporating a trick I learned on r/loseit to sit on my hands between each bite while I chew.  Also while I'm waiting for my food to cook, I *always* watch SS vs SS, but I never watch that show *while* eating. It's a rule I only ""get"" to watch that show drinking water or tea.",False,False

So if I have a plate of falafels, vegetables and potatoes, I'll eat them separately.  -I eat slowly. *Very* slowly.  -I need something to occupy me when I'm eating. Internet, books, movies, or in worst case.. conversations. There's just no way I can eat without being somewhat distracted.  ",False,False

I’m gonna dip what I’m eating anyway so it kinda makes no sense??? But, it mustn’t touch ",False,False
