I don't know why that person forgot about you. They should have been more thoughtful.   About the ice cream--that's a really low amount of calories! I'm sure if you calculate your maintenance, you could see what a small percent it is. Only you can decide what's better for your mental health, but I'd guess that even with the ice cream you're still at a net loss for the day.",False,False

Usually I'd be saying yes but as it might make you cut, do not get any. It is not worth it.   Go make yourself a sweet cup of tea, if you're hungry find a safe food you can eat. Drink some water, take a hot shower or do anything you find soothing: reading, gaming, call a friend, take a nap. Avoid all triggers whenever possible. You're not a piece of shit. If you want someone to talk to, feel free to message me.",False,False
