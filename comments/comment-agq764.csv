I'll always go for diet soda and drinks if I can, but when it comes to eating something that's 150 calories or having 150 calories of coffee I'll choose the coffee. It takes a long time to drink and fills me up more than the food probably would. I avoid shit like milkshakes or coffee drinks over 250~ calories, as well as juice and plain milk most of the time.",False,False
