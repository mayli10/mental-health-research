Everything is related- I can't fully heal if I'm not completely open  2. Part of the reason in started therapy is so I can practice being vulnerable with someone. I literally can't improve this unless I work on it.   3. My ED is still fairly new. The quicker I nip it in the bud, the less likely the behaviors are to become so deeply ingrained, the easier recovery should be  4. My body is my vessel for the rest of my life. Yes, sometimes I wish for an early death, but i still have to deal with it for the rest of my life. I need to take care of it now so it can carry on better later in life  5. Ignoring my health- I can't financially afford the binges anymore  6. My campus has a system set up to help people deal with eating disorders. It's a large university, I'm sure they deal with a few hundred disordered eating cases a year.  They have the resources in a close/ convenient location for me  7. Idk, my ed seemed to get worse when I started taking antidepressants? If that's the case my medication should be reevaluated  8. I cannot sustain the amount of time and energy I've spent on food. I know recovery also needs time and energy, but hopefully it becomes less taxing with time  9. Living with this as a secret isn't healthy. Confessing these behaviors can help me become more accountable.  10. I know I'm better than this. Maybe I would be able to recover on my own, but it's probably a hell of a lot easier with experienced people to help  11. I have a habit of downplaying my issues. Telling someone else might help me put things in perspective of how serious ed behaviors can be. That way I'm less likely to talk myself out of recovering  12. Objectively, if I knew I had a friend struggling with what I've been dealing with, I'd like them to get help. Why should I treat myself differently?   Sorry these were long. I just kind of copied down my journal entries",False,False

I'm really contemplating trying to tell my therapist and attempting recovery. I made a list of reasons why I don't want to come forward:   1. I'm afraid I'll be referred out to another therapist. I'm a very closed off person and its taken me long enough to get into a place where I even contemplate bringing this up.  2. I don't want to involve other people with my problems. Like, I'm nervous about them sending me to a doctor and a nutritionist- 2 extra people that would know my issues and I have to interact with. It also makes it harder to continue to hide my appointments from the people I  my life   3. Part of me actually likes my ED. I like being able to purge a binge and not gain much weight. I like fasting because I feel like I can finally have control in my life. I like being skinny. (Of course I also don't like these too)  4. I'm terrified of actually being diagnosed with an ED and having that in my file. I feel like I'll be treated differently by medical professionals afterwards. I also am afraid it can stop me from getting things like security clearance  5. I am a very private person. I know everyone struggles with vulnerability, but my inability to be vulnerable has hurt me in a lot of parts of my life. This is one of the last things I've purposely withheld in therapy. It's the last thing that's *just* mine, no one else involved.   6. I don't know if I'm willing to relinquish any control in my life. I don't want people monitoring what I eat or maybe even what I weigh.   7. I'm just like 2-5 lbs from the anorexia criteria (depending on how you define it, 85% ibw or 17.5 bmi). I feel like I've failed at having an actual ed if I don't get there. I know, it's not true- just feels like it.",False,False

I store a lot of body fat in the chest area due to getting my body fat distribution pattern from my mom's side of family. As a result I have noticeable manboobs at any normal BMI despite being a CIS guy (not trans). The hate I feel towards them isn't the dislike I feel towards having a stomach pouch for example, it's a deep hatred about something that doesn't belong being there. I assume it's the same dysphoria trans guys who haven't gotten top surgery yet feel. Because I have always strongly identified as a guy, having anything in the chest area feels alien.  In some cases manboobs are caused by real breast tissue, which means they don't go away no matter how much weight the person loses. Mine luckily tuned out to be just body fat, which means I now finally have a flat chest at a BMI 17.3. They become very noticeable at around BMI 19 and cause bad posture due to me subconsciously trying to hide them by hunching over.  Apart from individual body parts there's the general issue of being more accepted at this weight than higher ones. I've never gotten as much attention from other guys than I'm getting at the weight I'm at now. Having been bullied for my weight in the past (I was nearly obese), it feels unreal to have others say my body is desirable to them. It sucks that I have to continuously restrict myself (and technically have an ED) to stay this weight, but it's the price I pay every day for a flat chest.",False,False
