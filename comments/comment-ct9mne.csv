I just overthought it the rest of the day even tho he probably meant nothing of it and was just doing his job of trying to be friendly.,False,True

Just for insight purposes, we are trained engage in small talk with customers and not be too repetitive about it or have a ""default line"" that we say to everyone. I end up talking to customers about their groceries every so often when I can't think of a much better topic. I stick to recipe talk and raving about my favorite items--not making people defend their purchases.  Your cashier probably thought he was being humorous but did it in a really sloppy and lame way. My guess is that the other staff have issues with him too.",False,False

Dude, don't even worry about what they say... Why would they even comment on the stuff you buy? Is a bis not allowed to buy popcorn and cereal? Maybe he knows that's ED behavior but he probably thought you were really skinny or pretty to make a comment about it. I dunno. I was at Mendocino farms the other day with my bf and I didn't order anything because I hate eating around other people since I end up getting bloated from legit one bite, and I also end up wanting to binge... Public binging is terrible, honestly.   &amp;#x200B;  So I was there and after my bf orders, I kinda just stand back and make a gesture like I'm not buying anything and he makes this weird passive agressive comment like ""and you're not eating, got it"". I was like... okay? I over thought it all day, he just said it in such a condescending way. Like- uh... No, maybe I'll eat later, did you think about that? It was weird- but I know I was over thinking and projecting my insecurities onto someone who was probably just verifying that I wasn't ordering anything so he can proceed with his job.   &amp;#x200B;  People need to not be so judgmental, for real.",False,False
