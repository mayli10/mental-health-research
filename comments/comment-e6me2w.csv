(for an array of reasons) So I don’t think it’s weird at all to meet for something else. A coffee shop is a classic option. I even had a first date that was meeting for a walk in an arboretum.   Honestly, sober people are exactly as fun as responsible drinkers. (And irresponsible drinkers aren’t actually fun at all - they just *think* they are.) No way does meeting somewhere else make you boring! Hope it’s a fun date :)",False,False
