Honestly, I think the message was more neutral than rude. I think it's hard for disordered people to interpret what people say.

She sounds jealous tbh. I bet sheâ€™s not as thin as you think she is and itâ€™s just dysmorphia thatâ€™s skewing your view of her.  Thatâ€™s really exciting though! I totally get that feeling of elation when you put on a piece of goal clothing and realise that you actually look good. Also lol at the low rise jeans, PLEASE let them not be making a come back.

Being practical is not bad per say. However, what matters or is practical to me might be totally different to you. My practical weight for you might have been 20 pounds ago. Does this give me the right to say ""meh"" when you talk about a new milestone you have achieved? It just is inappropriate, especially coming from a friend.  ",False,False

They are just pointing out that when someone reacts differently to how you expect them too, it doesn't always mean something mean is going on.  &amp;#x200B;  I was confused about what you expected as a reaction too. As you've now explained, you hoped she would respond with hearty congratulations. However, she didn't. She responded with surprise about how size 0 was a goal. I feel like a lot of people would react similarly, people who are jealous and can't hide it, people who have been triggered, people who may think that you are unhealthy to focus on a size, people who are annoyed about one thing or another.  Maybe she is just tired of always talking weight with you and doesnt want to tell you? IDK you havn't really explained how you 2 usually congratulate each other/talk. Maybe you are right and she is jealous and so now you have to decide how you feel about that",False,False

That is a huge milestone and I am proud of you!   &amp;#x200B;  I'm sorry your sister responded that way. I feel like if you have never been overweight and had to work your ass off to lose more than vanity weight (10 pounds or less) that you really don't get the effort and the raw emotion that goes into transforming your life. Because thats what it is. You transform your eating, physical activity, your choices, you have to have so much willpower and sustain it over a long enough period of time to lose a substantial amount of weight and KEEP IT OFF.   &amp;#x200B;  Stay proud, at least you can celebrate here!",False,True

I know that the goal of a ""size 0"" is not exactly PC anymore but it is something I have wanted to accomplish for a really long time and despite having an ED I have actually been able to lose this weight the healthy way to about about 90% of it. I have thought about talking to her about it, but I know for her she comes from a place of complete practicality and zero emotion. So I hit my practical weight for her like 10 pounds ago and everything I do after that is just pointless. Not really worth arguing about, she isn't really the warm fuzzy type when it comes to having a heart to heart. ",False,True

Maybe you don't think I should celebrate a ""size 0"" but I celebrate accomplishing goals that I set out for myself. I think being happy with your body and the progress you make towards your goal body, whatever that looks like should be celebrated. If I knew that my friend of 10+ years was working her ass off to get the body of her dreams and she texted me that she reached another goal, I would congratulate her.   She completely understands why it's important to me, she has been my friend for over ten years. We are just finally the same size/I am the smaller one and she doesn't like that. We have never been jealous or competitive friends, and up until this point she has never responded this way. I don't go out of my way to tell people that I have gotten to X amount of weight or this size...except for her. Because she has been my #1 cheerleader in this from the beginning.   Honestly, your comment up until literally the last 3 words sounds condescending especially considering its an eating disorder support sub. ",False,True

But what were you expecting her to respond? Honestly, if one of my friends - eating disordered or not, were sending me elated texts about fitting into a size 0, I would not respond in a congratulatory way either. Because I don't believe fitting into a size zero should be celebrated in itself? But I also hate diet culture, and the fact that we congratulate weight loss sooo. But yeah, I get your best friend. Maybe not the laughing emoji, but I think her response was fair enough. She doesn't understand why this was so important for you, and that's okay.  ",False,False

You don't need the confirmation or permission from anyone else, nor should you require it to feel happy for a goal you have accomplished.  That being said, you probably need a better best friend OR to have a sit down with them and just be honest and sincere about it.
