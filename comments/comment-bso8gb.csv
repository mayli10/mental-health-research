I don't really see it. Her latest video seems very genuine about her jurney and idk.. maybe I'm just too deep to see it but she seems pretty happy when you see her eat and the main factor in EDs is the mental part. Not trying to say you're wrong, it's way too hard to tell but she never struck me as disordered especially compared to other YouTubers.",False,False

I'm not 100% sold on the ""she doesn't swallow"" argument. We'll never know unless she posts an unedited cheat day video, and even then, it would only prove it for that particular cheat day. Regardless on whether or not the cheat days are faked/legit, she still has issues with food but pretends otherwise, which is hugely problematic for someone who has such a large following.",False,False

And she is such a self-righteous bitch about the way she eats. She tries so hard to justify why the way she is eating is normal and it works for her and it's like, just fucking own up to it. If this is the way you want to eat, fine, but don't pretend that it's normal.",False,False

Intermittent fasting is seen as an acceptable form of restriction. There's nothing special about it as a form of fat loss, it's a weight to restrict your intake for the day. Stephanie literally says that she has a ""beast"" appetite, so in order to not gain weight (i.e.e by actually listening to when she is hungry), she practices intermittent fasting. This is NOT intuitive eating.  The swallowing argument can certainly be wrong. I totally agree with you on that. But even if her cheat days are legit, she still displays disordered eating habits and is influencing thousands of people into thinking this is normal. It's not. Restricting and then only allowing yourself to eat the foods you really want once every month or two months IS disordered eating. She has said in a recent-ish cheat day video that she hadn't eaten donuts since her last cheat day. People who have a normal relationship with food would just let themselves eat the fucking donut as part of a normal way of eating. She has food issues and she is wrong for using her platform to showcase them. She has a fucking PhD for Christ's sake. She should be smarter than this.",False,False

You cannot do both at the same time.  Some people definitely can. I've always hated breakfast and been meh about lunch, even as a child, well before I developed disordered eating habits. My parents used to have to bribe me with junky kid-crack foods like toaster strudels just to get me to eat something during the day.  Also, the swallow cuts argument doesn't convince me because it's a common, well accepted editing technique in youtube foodie circles; there's even a video with Shane Dawson where he rescinds his previous criticism of a mukbanger for doing that because Shane had recently done his first mukbang and did similar cuts himself after realizing post-production that it's extremely long and tedious if you leave in all the quiet chewing. Also, Stephanie shows the bloating and weight gain after her cheat days.",False,False

I know that when you're starved food has the priority over everything else - your body is like, I don't give a flying fuck about your boyfriend or other silly stuff, go get some food now girl, we're in dire need of energy here!

The biggest denial I have ever seen. She posted a ""what I eat in a normal day"" video where she literally just eats cottage cheese with sweetener and huge bags of lettuce, and at the end of her cheat day videos she looks so miserable but is continuing to stuff her face with food because she knows it's the only day of the week that she allows herself to eat.  Also, her crazy and disgusting food combinations are indicative of an ED. Gotta get all those flavors in at once. She's not recovered, she just switched EDs.",False,False

She edits her videos so you never actually see her swallow. And even if she's actually swallowing everything she does on her cheat days, she obviously very heavily restricts every other day of her life. She looks godawful right now, and her ""science explained"" videos are a fucking joke for someone who has a PhD.

But she says that the only way she can be normal about food is by having a 7000-12000 calorie cheat day every week? And restricts the rest of the week???? That is literally disordered eating. I absolutely HATE her, because she posts thumbnails of her thin body in her cheat day videos, and it's like, bitch please. You still have an eating disorder, don't fucking pretend otherwise.
