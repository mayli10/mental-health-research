When my insurance changed it was no longer covered tho and he moved me to a generic Adderall as a replacement. While it has helped with my fatigue, I don't really get much else out of it but I can see how someone with actual BED could benefit from the it. It wasn't my proudest moment because I've only ever intentionally abused it from the start and I've got some history with addiction that makes it that much worse because I know what I'm doing.",False,True

I'm only asking because I take Vyvanse for BED, but I don't abuse it, and it's been my miracle pill, so I don't know why you said ""it wasn't my proudest moment"" :/ just curious ",False,False
