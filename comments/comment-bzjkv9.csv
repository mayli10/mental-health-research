Nothing is more triggering for a relapse than hearing someone else talk about how effortless it is for them not to eat/to eat very little.  A friend of mine absolutely has disordered eating but it still messes with me when I'll be going through a rough patch and finding it hard to restrict/fast and they casually mention that they haven't eaten a proper meal in the past three days and are just subsisting on a handful of nuts and they're getting lightheaded. They're 100% NOT doing it for attention, that's just the way they are and I understand why they do it, but they also do get positive attention from other people (myself included) telling them to eat more and look after themselves. Meanwhile I know I'd never get that kind of concern over the same behaviour.  And when someone turns down food when you've already/planned to get some? That shit HURTS",False,False

Im in a ‚Äúfat‚Äù phase right now and I had sex with this new guy I‚Äôm seeing last night and I felt sooo fucking uncomfortable (with my body I mean I still had fun). And I don‚Äôt suspect him of having an ED but he definitely fiends way less than I do about food üòÖüòÖ it just seems so effortless for other people sometimes. Im typing this and I literally just got done binging hehe x,False,False
