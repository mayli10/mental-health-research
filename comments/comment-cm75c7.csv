I was so hungry and drained. Wouldn't call it a binge though. Ate slowly and stopped when full.   In the past, when I've felt hungry enough to do this, I've ended up not gaining what I ""should have"" from it. The whole week, before the overeating, I was fucking hungry. Too hungry to sleep, and constipated to boot. Signs of not eating enough... but I'm supposed to have been in a surplus. But too constipated to bother weighting self.   But I resolved to put a pin in the bulk and make it up, since I'd already cheated \~1000 calories this bulk cycle.   I know better than to try to correct this shit right away. It's 4am, I couldn't sleep for being too hungry, drank some wine, and now there's no way I'll hit my goal for today.   I should eat more and go back to sleep or it'll be worse. I'll binge like I have the other times if I don't. The over eating came from not having allowed myself more to begin with.   idk I'm tipsy from the wine and too hungry to sleep and this is awful",False,False

It was one of the best meals I've had in a long time tbh.   Protip: I know halo top is going out of style but if you microwave those Atkins brownies for like 10 secs and then mix one into a pint of mocha halo top it's the most decadent damn thing you will ever taste that is comprised of ""diet"" dessert food.

For like 3 months I was doing so good. Eating very little and barely thinking about it. Got to a new low weight and then all of a sudden shit hit the fan and I'm eating to the point of discomfort and throwing up twice a day and can't keep my mind off food and away from dark thoughts. I really tried to be kind to myself and allow myself to eat at maintenance since i probs have PMS but i feel like my body is rebelling against me and forcing me to eat way beyond an acceptable ammount. It's like being stuck on a rollercoaster and i have no idea how much longer I've got to ride it out.,False,False
