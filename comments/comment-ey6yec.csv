I don’t know what the right answer to your question is, but maybe you could find a friend to establish some healthy habits with? Something like walking, just getting 30 minutes in a day where you’re outside and moving. If you’re already pretty active, maybe there’s someone irl you can lean on for support?   There are some things we can’t stop (looking at you, aging process) but we can absolutely minimize the “damage.” Friends and family can be a real blessing.",False,False
