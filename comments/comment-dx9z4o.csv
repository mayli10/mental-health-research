The fear of “bad” foods, the obsessive behavior, the constant need to talk about it. It is such bullshit. Dont fall into that trap. Shes using it is a disguise to hide her own issues. Shes unhappy. Dont let that get you down. See right through it! People who are truly “happy all the time” can eat and not feel guilty. Just have empathy for her, dont get sucked into her shitty vortex.",False,False
