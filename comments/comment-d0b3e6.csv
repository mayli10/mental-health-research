I have soooooo much extra skin but as I keep the weight off I have noticed the skin gets less saggy gradually. I struggle with binge eating and was quite obese since I was a child and now I am still riding the obese/overweight line so still have a considerable amount to lose (also 5'9ish). I have tried many strategies over the last 3 years and my current one is lactic acid cream which is supposed to promote cell regeneration and is a chemical exfoliant. I have also down dry brushing and my acupuncturist suggested a natural supplement.    I never took the supplement for long enough (have to take it 6 months straight before seeing an improvement). I am also considering laser treatment.    My answer is that I think time is the biggest factor.,False,False
