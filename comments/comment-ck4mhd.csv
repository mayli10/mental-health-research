Food is good and all but to think about it CONSTANTLY is insanity.  Donâ€™t you have. anything else to think about/focus on like a job or hobbies?  If you stay on this path you will end up dead from obesity caused illnesses.  You need to find your purpose in life.  Eating is not a purpose.  You eat to live not live to eat.,False,False

Her style was something I always attempted to dress like. She always came to her shift with a pack of pop tarts and a bag of chips. Just mindlessly eating them while working on the computer wearing a cute crop top and skinny pants. I literally would stare as she was taking each bite. A fucking pack of pop tarts has 400 cals!!!!!!,False,False

A few months ago I was the skinniest I've ever been in my adult life. I almost reached the weight you should be hospitalized at. Right now I'm slowly gaining the weight back. I do walk a lot though, both for eating disorder reasons (need to burn off that breakfast!!!) and for health reasons.  What I meant by my comment is that before I ate just enough to maintain my weight in the lower average or slightly underweight BMI range. I only ate when I was hungry, and food didn't cross my mind when I wasn't. I didn't think of calories or avoid 'fattening' foods on purpose. My diet was fairly balanced. Now I'm constantly obsessing over food, can't tell if I'm hungry or just nervous (so I don't eat because I'm probably just nervous, right?), feel guilt comparable to how you'd feel after commiting a heinous crime when I eat something I wasn't 'supposed to' and get panic attacks when grocery shopping.",False,False

I used to be one of those people, but I much prefer myself now.  I like knowing how to diet properly, and manage my nutrition to meet my fitness goals. Those skinny people are usually very weak and lacking the basic nutrients to lead a healthy life. They disregard eating fruits and Veg most of the time and just eat one high calorie meal a day",False,False

Not eating if something is a little off always pisses off everyone around me. My family yells at me for being picky.   The forgetting to eat isnâ€™t really forgetting.
