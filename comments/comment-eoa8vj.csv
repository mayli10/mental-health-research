I can feel myself being tired, but I can’t stop because it is so interesting to me and I’m curious and I want to keep knowing. It’s like all of this consuming is a replacement for eating.",False,True

Ever.  Count calories, weigh food, check BMI, look at other people's BMI in other countries, compare, TDEE, losertown, mybodygallery, youtube ""what I eat in a day"", google ""how to water fast for 90 days"" ""how to make water taste like food"" ""how to lose 30 pounds in 1 month"" ""how long can i live without food"" ""how to not be hungry"" count more calories, meal plan all day. It never ends.  It's a blessing as far as a distraction, and also a curse because, I would like a life. I have children. I'd like to play grocery store without counting the calories of imaginary cake mix.",False,False
