That is such an important thing i dont think any of us think about. Im always convinced it isnt my time to recover because im not ready yet. But the idea of small changes are all baby steps towards healing is a very powerful thought,False,False

When you fall off the wagon, it's not going anywhere without you!   I tried to make this my main principle, and it actually kinda works. I realized that my ED came also from some kind of weird ass ""power game"" with myself. This means gaining power and control on something that I didn't even want in the first place, like an intruder in my brain. Like ""OK edgelord listen here, If I'm not going to die you're not going to die, get over it, we're gonna live and YOU ARE GOING TO HATE IT"". That's when I started to make bulimia my bitch, yes she's my bitch now I'm gonna go make some spaghetti now bye I love you",False,False

That was very much needed today.   And the ""no eaties"" is hilariously adorable. Your roommate sounds so so sweet. I'm so glad you two are able to open up to and support each other! That must be such a relief.",False,False

So glad you were brave enough to share with him and listen in return. Y'all are lucky to have each other, and we're lucky for you sharing with us. I feel like these little moments of solidarity and being seen are sometimes the most important.  The messages about consistency and the ability to restart anytime are what I needed to hear tonight. Thanks :)",False,False
