Sadly, that is how I was as a child with my parents. They would make me sit for hours at the table until I ate my food. I am so confuaed lately, but addressing this with a therapist is so exhausting because they often don't take it seriously.",False,True

It’s like, thanks for being insanely thoughtful but....so a lot of times I just throw it out. I don’t know where you are in your recovery but maybe it’s a good thing? Maybe at least eating half is good and healthy, but also if you want to toss it and tell him thank you afterwards you are valid. Take care of you bb and keep that anxiety in check. Wishing you lots of luck and know that you deserve nutrition!",False,False
