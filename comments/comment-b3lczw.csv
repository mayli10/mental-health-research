In high school I fell for my then-best friend, and I truly loved him. So I told him about my feelings and he rejected me. Stopped being my friend and everything. Soon after he ends up dating a cheerleader far skinnier than me. I was hung up over it for years afterwards as he was the first and only guy who ever called me pretty.   Fast forward a few years later and I meet this other guy. We get really close as friends and he develops feelings for me first, which I realize far too late. And when I actually do figure it out he doesn't love me anymore. He starts getting embarassed of me when we go out together and refuses to tag me and show our friends that we're still hanging out. He cuts off friendship afterwards. Soon after that he ends up dating this beautiful girl who is so much prettier and skinnier than me.",False,False
