Each is a complete workout program on its own, and you can do them anywhere!

I would also recommend yoga (perhaps avoid intense Ashtanga or Bikram), because it has a similar effect - but it doesn‚Äôt necessarily feel like a workout. The only thing you have to be mindful is having a coffee/small snack prior to avoid dizziness in certain postures.  On the other spectrum you could try Zumba - which is intense but you can set your own pace and it‚Äôs fun - or cycling classes, because you mostly sit down and it‚Äôs easier to keep your BP up that way (at least for me).",False,False
