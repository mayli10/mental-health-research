If itâ€™s some other aspect of the biscuit as well, could you potentially bring your own thing to have instead? As an alternative option maybe?  Also, itâ€™s amazing that you genuinely want to help with your blood type (and itâ€™s so cool that you can!), but you should *not* have to feel obligated or pressured or guilty or anything like that!!! God. :/   Sounds like youâ€™ve already given so much despite your fear of needles too, which is really pretty wonderful. Itâ€™s 100% alright if you canâ€™t right now, or if youâ€™d rather not for whatever reason! That doesnâ€™t make you selfish at all. ðŸ’›",False,False
