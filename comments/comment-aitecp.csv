We share a membership there and I actually got to try out the members-only upstairs lounge because I had my MIL babysit (the lounge is kid-free which I love)!   The ED-related thing is that I got a bunch of free drinks while we were there. My mom got charged (um rude) but I never did. That *never* happened to me when I was heavy. Ever. And now whenever I go out in public it‚Äôs like people are way nicer to me. I know it‚Äôs not fair that people who are objectively better-looking get preferential treatment, I‚Äôve been on both sides of that coin. But holy hot damn if it isn‚Äôt sickeningly validating for my weight loss when suddenly I drink for free. ",False,False

I had Anorexia Nervosa as a Teen Girl^TM and although my dad was a shitbag about it, my mom never pressed me: she would hold my hand when we stayed up watching Korean soap operas at 2am because we both have insomnia, and she would make me protein shakes instead of breakfast because I hated feeling full.
