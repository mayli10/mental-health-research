I’m still seeing a therapist but probably (definitely) need to see a dietitian but it’s just embarrassing having switched behaviors like this and I don’t want to admit to it you know??,False,True

As you know, ED behaviors suck no matter what, even though some are def glamorized and romanticized more, such as restriction. But it’s all fucking painful - that doesn’t take away the pain/sense of “unfairness” and confusion around it all, but still is helpful to keep in mind.   Do you see an OP team now post-treatment? You’re worth loving, not hating. Food stuff is indeed hard; life stuff is hard. Your struggles are real. Sending so much love and hugs and hope. 💕",False,False
