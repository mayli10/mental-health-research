Insurance is ridiculous with stuff like this. I know so many girls who were discharged far too early because insurance just refused to pay any more. Sorry I couldn't be of more help though",False,False

Three mandatory meals per day plus snacks. They also force feed you high cal sugary foods like milkshakes, pancakes with mandatory syrup, etc. I’m absolutely certain this will make me worse and not better. ",False,True

The people at the facility have been pretty vague about day-to-day and how strict they'll be, but that's most likely because I haven't gotten my labs done yet due to insurance issues. I'm 26 and estranged from my entire family, so I have control over my situation, which is what kinda scares me I guess because I know my judgement is flawed due to my hungry brain moving slower than it should. I also hate the idea of eating 3 meals every day or getting put on a tube. That sounds like a total violation of my personal space lol.   I know you were a teenager but do you know anything about costs? The only facility within a couple hundred miles of me is $90,000 without insurance and if I want insurance to cover it, I'll most likely be put on a 12-15 month waiting list. I just can't imagine how people get help before they die. ",False,True

I won't name the treatment center I went to, but you can DM me for more info if you want.  It was separated into different wards based on levels of care; inpatient, residential, and partial hospitalization program (or PHP). I started on inpatient. We had our weights and vitals taken every morning and bloodwork done thrice a week. We weren't allowed to stand or walk \*at all\* unless we were getting up to get a book or whatever. They were very strict about that on inpatient.  Mealtimes were the worst. The group goes into the dining hall and everyone's food is brought to them. If you did well, you could earn plating privileges, but that usually only happened when you stepped down to residential. Everyone's meals were determined by their dietician, and some dietitians were better than others so it was basically the luck of the draw whether you'd get one who'd give you easy food or not. If you refuse to eat within the allotted time, you're given a supplement, and if you refuse the supplement, you lose privileges. If you refuse food and supplements for 38 hours, you're given the NG tube, and you have to complete all meals for three days to get it out.  I was on inpatient for three weeks, even though I completed all my meals and complied with all the rules. It just took awhile for my body to stabilize enough for them to feel comfortable monitoring me a little less constantly. On res you get a little more freedom, but not much. As patients get closer to their goal weight, they'd be approved for physical activity groups and even get mealplan decreases. When your treatment team thinks you're ready, they'll step you down to PHP which is when you sleep at home and go to treatment in the day. I was on res for 12 weeks because that's how long it took me to get weight-restored (I was severely underweight and had a hypermetabolism. It might not take as long depending on your mealplan and your body).  If you're over 18, you can sign yourself out against medical advice whenever you want with a 72-hour notice. I'm only 17, so I never had that option, but I know I'd have used it if I did.  I hope this was helpful. Feel free to ask any more questions- though like I said, I can only speak from my personal experience.",False,False
