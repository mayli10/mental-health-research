Throughout the day. Go to the pharmacy and get an enema. Read the directions and follow them. Straining for a bowel movement will cause hemmoroids and will complicate matters even more. You can use prune juice too a time tested solution. Water acts as lubrication. An enema does the same thing but is much faster. Water is important for proper bowel movements.,False,False
