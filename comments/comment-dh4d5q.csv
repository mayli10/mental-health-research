Love all the comments from people without kids saying how much they don‚Äôt want this too, makes me feel even better.

The thing is age happens regardless so gravity is gonna get the best of us all at some point or another.",False,False

Probably once breastfeeding us over I'll end up just choosing an even lower gw.   Ofc there are body changes and odc body dysmorphia can exaggerate them. It's a bit of both. :(,False,False
