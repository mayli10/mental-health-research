I only eat with specific forks/spoons, travel with them and everything. My favorite is this tiny stainless steel fork that I use for everything. The number of times I’ve gone through the trash looking for it over the years is embarrassing... even worse is that half the time it’s somewhere else.  Bonus: it’s happened when I’ve been on holiday with other people too. Many (not) fun times have been had, lol",False,False

But yeah, definitely gone through garbage trying to find something I probably should've given up on.  But yknow? It's not absurd that you'd want the tools that make you feel most comfortable. You DID and DO deserve to eat. It's not even that a ""normal"" person would eat with a different utensil - I think any normal person would want to try anything they could think of to find something missing that meant a lot to them. It doesn't matter what that thing is, it's important to you, so it's normal to want to look before you give up.",False,False
