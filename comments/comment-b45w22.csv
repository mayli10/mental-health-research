I can't eat as much wearing one because of the constriction which is good. I also like how tight they feel. It feels like I'm being hugged in a way. I'm also primarily insecure about my stomach. My waist trainer keeps my waist at 24in and my corset is 22in. The corset is more difficult to hide under clothing so I don't wear it as much. But yeah I wear shape wear everyday and love it üòç. I usually buy from what Katie did if you want any recommendations. ",False,False
