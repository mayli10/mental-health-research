I get really comfy sitting up usually with my feet on the floor and spine straight but comfortable. Then I set a timer for 20 min. I start with 3 or 4 deep breaths. In through the nose for a count of 4, hold for a count of 4, out through the mouth for a count of 4, trying to make each breath deeper. Then I start the body check with my toes. I focus on how they feel on the floor, how they feel touching each other, how my socks feel on my skin. Then I imagine they are turning to stone. Becoming heavy and immovable. I focus on the joints and ligaments and relaxing each piece I can. I move my mind up my body and do that to each part I can, legs, knees, torso, arms, fingers, neck, face muscles, etc. letting go of pain I find as I go. If I can say this whole routine out loud in a calm low voice like I‚Äôm leading a group that‚Äôs the best, but I don‚Äôt usually because I don‚Äôt want to wake the husband. Then for the last few minutes I try to practice ‚Äúno mind‚Äù. It‚Äôs really hard but you try to think of nothing. Any thoughts that pop into your head you let float by like clouds. I‚Äôll usually start to feel almost high at this point and I‚Äôll sometimes have what feels like weird dreams. But I keep just trying to bring my mind back to the void. Then the timer chimes, I take a deep breath, stretch and start my day.   But if that doesn‚Äôt work there are some great YouTube videos or the app Unplug has some great routines and will even remind you to mediate if you‚Äôd like, but I believe Unplug has a subscription fee.

Good to know I‚Äôm not the only one who has this! Maybe I‚Äôll give meditation a try, I‚Äôve always wanted to anyways. ",False,False

Back in high school most of my friends wouldn‚Äôt eat breakfast because we all felt queasy/not hungry from being up so early.

Didn‚Äôt matter what I did, or ate, or how I slept. If it was 8:59 or earlier, I was queasy. I stopped telling people early into it and just assumed it was another weird thing about me.   Last year I offhand mentioned it to my therapist as why I don‚Äôt eat breakfast. She stops me and is like, ‚ÄúWait. What? No that‚Äôs not a thing.‚Äù Haha.   She has me practiced meditating first thing in the morning before I even get out of bed. And by golly that worked! She told me I have been such a stressed out perfectionist overachiever for so long, I actually taught my body to wake up stressed on days I had things to do. The only days I ever slept in past 9 was when I had nothing to do that day so my body would wake up in its natural state on those days.   Changed my life. Now I am getting better and recognizing my nausea as a symptom of something and sometimes that something is stress and I just need to breathe or take a break or have a cry. Either way, it was the first time I had connected with my own body with intent in years. ",False,False
