I really think it’s great that it can work for some people, I just don’t think it’s universal and I don’t like seeing it espoused as the only way people can approach a healthy relationship with food",False,False

I'll usually think ""do i want salty or sweet?"" and take it from there. As for meal prepping, I rarely do it. No because of IE but because when I do, I force myself to think about food way more than I like. I agree that doing so is privileged bc my parents often make dinner for me, I go out to eat, and I buy expensive healthy snacks and convince food.",False,True

I think there's a certain level of privilege in being able to say ""I'm going to eat what I (my body) want(s), at the time that I (my body) want(s) it, in the quantity that I (my body) want(s) it."" Like... I have $40 to spend on food a week. What if my body ""craves"" expensive vegan yogurt (which it does tbh lol) every single day? I can't afford that even if I wanted to ""honor"" it. Or what about meal prepping? I meal prep because it's the cheapest/most time effective way for me to manage my food. If I meal prep at the beginning of the week and decide I'm not feeling my lunch one day, am I just supposed to toss it and then buy more food to ""honor my body's cravings"" or whatever?? like these are real questions about IE that no one has been able to (satisfactorily) answer for me so...... hard pass",False,False

I, personally, do weigh more on intuitive eating BUT I have guidelines. For example, I will stray away from salty and carby food late at night bc I will be bloated the next morning. Because of my ED history I do not trust myself, and even if I were to go on an intuitive eating journey and “find my balance” I am very prone to stress and that will mess with my hunger cues - I will get overbearingly HONGRYYY if I am anxious or have no appetite if I am feeling super low. I am, however, aligned with, eat what you want. So, aside from being vegan, I will not deny myself any food. I think that’s a big issue with binges, bc we become very focused on “no” foods and we get this mentality of “okay, I will slip up this time... I will appreciate it now and eat a lot of it, but never again!” So, yea, if I want chips or pancakes or whatever, I will allow myself to get it BUT I will limit the amount and stop when I start feeling full (which was really hard to do initially). What really helped me was eating super healthy food in which the amount doesn’t matter, such as lettuce or potatoes (you have to eat a lotttt of potatoes to get high cal and they’re very dense), and since it was plain and boring, I learned to stop eventually (took a long time though!).   Now, going all in is not something I can speak to. I have never felt the extreme hunger Stephanie describes. I think that is more common in body builders who workout a lot and heavily restrict and have strict rules and macros, with the additional “cheat day” that stretches out the stomach and makes it difficult to stay within a “normal” caloric range. I think it’s great if it works for people, but again I can’t speak to it. I do think eating a normal calorie range would get the same end results eventually, but it would be very tough mentally and would take a lot of self control. I am happy for her, she seems happier, and that’s all that matters!",False,False

Sometimes I track my cals to make sure I'm eating enough but besides that I don't really watch what I eat. I try to eat mostly whole foods not to restrict but because they make me feel more energized and keep my bowel movements on track. With IE I've been able to get obsessive thoughts about food out of my mind and I'm able to enjoy fun food in moderation.,False,True
