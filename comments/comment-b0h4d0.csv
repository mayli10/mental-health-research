In Alaska, there is a HUGE stereotype that natives are dumb, fat, ugly, alcoholics who do nothing but live the lazy life off of government money.  Especially in Anchorage where half the population moved up there from Texas for oil.  I spent so much time trying to ‚Äúnot be like other natives.‚Äù  I‚Äôm really white-passing, I‚Äôve always felt like I had to be thin so no one assumed I was stupid and lazy.  I was so happy in high school when my friend told me ‚Äúyeah but you‚Äôre not really native, you‚Äôre pretty and smart‚Äù (paraphrased) But that also means I get accused of trying to be white all the time too.

So I really do relate to the whole ""people thinking you're trying to whitewash yourself"" thing. Though sometimes I do wonder if I was trying to whitewash myself. At least as a teen. I grew up in a mostly white area in the suburbs. Something my old therapist suggested is that my self-esteem issues and possibly my ED may stem from growing up black with only white friends. The white boys at school never asked me out. I didn't have a boyfriend until I was 22. I didn't get asked to prom. Meanwhile my white friends had boyfriends and whatnot. She suggested I may have internalized that and began thinking I was less than or ugly. When I stumbled across the bullshit that was pro-ana when I was a young impressionable twelve-year-old, I would idolize these white thin models. I was terrified of being ""thicc"" (even though I was never even overweight to begin with). So it's interesting the way internalized anti-blackness/feelings of being ""other"" affected my ED.   I always feel weird speaking about the black community, though, idk. Because like I said, I'm very light skinned and colorism is a huge issue. I get asked ""what are you?"" or have people think I'm Latina or, like I said, mixed race. So I recognize my privilege and definitely have not been through half of what other black girls have been through. Still, I do think mental illness in general but especially EDs are prevalent in the community but not spoken about. A lot of people are STILL under the notion that anorexia is a ""rich white girl"" disease. Or a choice where ""just eat"" is the solution. Or that because someone is overweight, they're just ""eating good"" and people don't even consider BED. Like you said, there is an emphasis on being ""thicc"", not thin. People may not even realize they or a loved one have BED because of lack of knowledge, awareness and cultural norms about being bigger rather than small maybe?",False,False

We greet each other with have you eaten yet?  Try to show our love by going out to eat and overfilling plates at functions.  Super common to be a 'foodie'.  Also.. you must do all of this while being 90lbs.  I see a lot of disordered eating habits among my friends and family.  My mom takes laxatives.. my friends overexercise, undereat, fast, purge, have body dysmorphia etc.  But on the surface they have to portray effortless thinness.  Every one else seems to just accept it as what you gotta do to be thin and it's super taboo to label it as an eating disorder.  Also kind of a nuance.. but I'm southeast asian and have a very different body type from my east asian peers, but I'm expected to conform to the east asian beauty standard ?  Like I have curves- I have breasts and an ass.  My legs are strong. But popular media right now is all *east* asian so I'm expected to be at levels of frail-like thinness that wouldn't make sense for my body type. :/",False,False

As a dark-skinned black woman in a predominantly white area, it is incredibly hard to tune out popular opinions on how people see black women. I‚Äôve held on so closely to being small and petite, as I feel like it is the one attractive and feminine thing about me. Every time I gain a pound, all I see is a stereotype.

I‚Äôve been told I talk white because I don‚Äôt use a lot of slang, when it‚Äôs just the people I was around (family and all) talked that way too. My music taste is usually rock too. My best friend and boyfriend are both white. So I guess I just must hate myself for being black.  It‚Äôs interesting coming from a darker skinned woman because I feel like colorism has a role in it too. One of my college friends briefly had a bout of b/p and she was also light skinned. It‚Äôs as if you‚Äôre thin and light skinned you‚Äôre trying to be white, you‚Äôre thin and dark skinned then you have to be thin cuz they don‚Äôt like dark skin.   It‚Äôs also kind of hard when I look around at school at all the thicc girls and know that I will never have that body type. I‚Äôve always been thin and small framed with a low body fat percentage.
