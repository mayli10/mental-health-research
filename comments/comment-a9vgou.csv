I'd be eating twice the amount of lunch at school than my friends, but my breakfast would be a bowl of cereal and milk or something.

I maintained for a couple months when I needed a break from restricting and found it way easier! Of course you can't go back to your old habits, but you can have way more calories than when you're trying to lose which for me = easier time.

I've been on MFP for like 10 years now so I can do the calories in my head, and since maintaining had me going from my 600-1200 calories per day losing allowance to a 1680 calories per day maintenance allowance, I'd just count up to 1500-1600ish every day in my head and then stop eating. If I went out over a weekend and gained some bloat, I'd do like 1200 for a couple days until my weight stabilized again.

I also had a friend who had been overweight since childhood. I think the biggest difference I noticed was that the overweight friend would finish a normal meal and then immediately eat more on top of it.

I'd seen both friends order the same meal, and while one may leave a bit and offer it to someone else, the other would quickly finish then pay for something else in a vending machine.
