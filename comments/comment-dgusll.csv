They're like scales. It's a mystery and no one will ever know. The health legislation is controlled by Doctors (they're probably getting bribed) using obesity propaganda as an excuse to slap people in the face. They raise the fear levels and keep pressing panic buttons in the media. Until the food manufacturers listen and they re-print the labels to make the public paranoid. The calorie values go up and the food is shrinking,False,False
