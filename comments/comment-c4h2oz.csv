More if you can.  A general rule is 0.5 x weight in lbs is the minimum intake of protein needed for muscle gains. So for example, a person at 140lbs would need at least 70g protein a day to gain.  I built muscle when I was only eating 1200 with high protein, I only managed to get a bit of muscle and overall toning. It was extremely tiring btw, and my hair fell out in clumps.   (If you’re struggling to get the protein intake, tuna is a good high protein low fat food, and so are vegan protein shakes.)   Don’t be scared to eat more, especially if you’re gaining muscle. You’ll look great and have more energy to put into gaining :)",False,False

It’s a whole additional set of things to worry about. Instead of just obsessing over calories now it’s macros too. Instead of just caring about weight I’m now fixated on BF% too. A lot of fitness models, bodybuilding competitors, etc. definitely have EDs :(",False,False

I also lift and I know that my ED behaviors are not at all compatible with achieving my body comp goals. Realistically if you’re restricting (even high restricting) you’re most likely going to lose lean mass. Eating super high protein will help to a point but if your overall calories are too low you’ll lose muscle.   I know for me the actual best course of action would be eating at quite a small deficit (1500-1700 or so) high protein and lifting a ton but that’s rarely what I actually do :(,False,False

If so you may be able to build some muscle while eating at a deficit with very high protein intake. If you aren’t new to lifting you almost definitely cannot gain muscle eating at a deficit.,False,False
