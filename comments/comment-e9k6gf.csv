I've experience that sudden big weight gain overnight before, but usually by the next day I was even lower than the day before. I will stick to this for now, it's just kind of hard. thanks though for the reply, it's very helpful.",False,True

(And I doubt your TDEE is that low! I'm on the taller side but even when UW my BMR if I literally didn't even leave bed for a second or lift a finger all day is still above 1300) if you've been restricting beforehand, it'll be the actual weight of the food, water weight, poop weight, your muscles getting their water stores filled, so many of these things that come with an increase in intake - it will settle and stabilise if you're consistent, I promise!",False,False
