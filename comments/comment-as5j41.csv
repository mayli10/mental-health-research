It was mostly just being really confused and not being able to breathe because of all the coughing.   Oh and I was asleep for literally two whole days and I don’t remember anything about the few days before it peaked. Like today my professor was handing our quizzes back out and I was like “when tf did we take a quiz” even tho I was literally there on Wednesday and took the whole damn quiz. I just don’t remember anything.   But my dr prescribed me 30 25mgs of promethazine ??? Like I took them every 6 hours and still have 20 left so I guess I have that if I ever need to knock myself the fuck out again ,False,True
