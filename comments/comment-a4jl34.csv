When I’m out with friends it sucks that they’ll want to go to a place with little to no safe foods for me so I’ll end up having to drop around ten bucks for a coffee and banana from Starbucks which I now have to go out of my way to get since it’s not usually on the way to where we’re getting food from.,False,True

I will stay up in bed for like 40 minutes going over my options for breakfast.   Yesterday, I had it all planned out before I went to sleep, and the boy made cinnamon rolls before I woke up and wanted me to eat one so bad.  I cried.  And then didn't eat anything till 5pm.  And right now?  Waiting patiently till lunch.  Got it all figured out after thinking about it all morning.    My conversations revolve around food, my thoughts revolve around food.  It's not a good way to live life.  Some days I just wanna pass a sub joint and be like ""Oh snap. A sub sounds good.  Let's eat that for lunch"" instead of meticulously rationalizing the options in my freaking head.",False,False
