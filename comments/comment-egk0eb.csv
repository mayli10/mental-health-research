When I'm restricting, not knowing/counting how many calories there are in something makes me just eat as little as possible out of fear.",False,False

It almost feels like giving myself too much leeway by acknowledging how little I'm eating. I don't weigh myself either. I'm probably just a drama queen and don't actually have any issies with food tbh.,False,False

So I didn't eat that much (example: breakfast was a Piece of bread, one hard boiled egg. As dinner one plate of whatever my mum cooked and dessert was a bite of a snickers bar) and with my calorie knowledge from today I can say I probably didn't eat more than 1000 calories most days. I ate whatever I wanted, didn't have fear foods at all. The only rule was to not eat a lot. The moment I started to count calories and gave myself a calorie limit, the binges started, the feeling of going insane, fear foods, that was the moment I went from being an uneducated person that was losing weight through a diet to a miserable anorexia bitch that was obsessed with food and was scared of noodles. Now I'm in recovery and over the holidays I did exactly what I  did at the beginning... I didn't count and just ate normal portions... I felt so fucking free. Damn. Even lost weight.  It was easier to lose weight without counting. I even became underweight that way. Counting is just making me crazy and makes you binge.",False,False

Not necessarily things low in calories. Like today I had an oatmeal cookie around 1pm and a ‚Äúscoop‚Äù of spaghetti with half a chicken breast around 8pm. Realistically there‚Äôs no way that amount of food totaled to more than 550 calories. Yet I don‚Äôt feel any hungrier than I do on days where I counted calories and ate 700-800/day.  I‚Äôve never really had ‚Äúbinges‚Äù.  I definitely over ate at times but it was more like, I had days eating above maintenance because my meals were too big, and not eating 4000 calories in 1 sitting or like, having an entire sleeve of Oreos. But I can say I don‚Äôt crave anything because I‚Äôm not as controlling with food as I was when I counted calories.   Another user commented something that describes it well, but I think more about the hours that go by until I can eat instead of how many calories I could eat. For some reason, knowing how many calories I could and could not eat always led me to develop fears around food that would make me obsess over them.",False,True

Every time I try now shit gets bad real fast.   I prefer to think about hours where I didn't eat, and after a certain amount of hours I'll eat something. ""Kinda hungry, when did I last eat? 15 hours, eh let me get busy and have one more sleep and see what I weigh then""  The only thing I miss about counting calories is knowing exactly how much I should lose or gain in a day. I enjoy numbers. I wish there was a (free) app that allowed you to track and graph various body measurements instead of just calories and weight.",False,False

fc7awnh,t3_egk0eb,t3_egk0eb,Duskyroses,1,2019-12-27 21:03:01,/r/EDAnonymous/comments/egk0eb/dae_find_it_easier_to_restrict_when_youre_not/fc7awnh/,I find this post really interesting because for me I absolutely must track my calories. the reason is because when I‚Äôm unsure what my deficit is I have no idea how fast I‚Äôm losing. The number one way I stay on track with restricting is by anticipating the exact amount of pounds I‚Äôll have lost by an exact date and I will tell my self not to sabotage that ‚Äúwonderful‚Äù moment.,False,False

When I'm not actively logging my calories it's so much easier to restrict. I'd assumed it would be the opposite, hence I started counting but I was so wrong",False,False

Like normally I‚Äôd eat a home made oat meal cookie and freak out trying to search through my mom‚Äôs recipe book to figure out how many calories were in it and to see how it‚Äôd fit into my daily caloric budget. But now I eat it, and I‚Äôm like, ‚Äúokay, well if this is the only thing I eat from 6am to 5pm, I‚Äôll be fine‚Äù  Feels like the ‚Äúrecovered‚Äù version of still having an ED üòÇ",False,True

During this relapse, I haven‚Äôt been counting calories and I barely have any cravings? Like sure, I‚Äôve overeaten a few times, but most of the time I just don‚Äôt wanna eat a lot. I feel like I‚Äôm less obsessed with food this time around. I also feel like I‚Äôm not as bad this time since I‚Äôm not obsessed with calories, which is keeping me from actually wanting/trying to get better",False,False
