I know the root of this is just disordered thinking and irrational, but it’s comforting to see that I’m not alone.  Yeah, the U.S is a very food-obsessed culture. I’ve never taken that into consideration.",False,True

Like you, I'm paranoid about talking about food/diet/exercise too much. Therefore, I also notice when other people talk about it - healthy people, overweight people on a diet, everyone - they talk about it all the time. More mornings than not, I hear the same people over the cube wall talking about what they made for dinner and sharing recopies. My cube-mates talk about weather or not they went to the gym that morning, or what muscle group they worked on, or what new product they're trying for lunch today.  Believe it or not. Food is strongly ingrained in our culture. The vast majority of social gatherings involve food directly. Not just the holidays, look at the Super Bowl. Everyone is talking about game day snacks and their favorite beer. *Disclaimer, I'm speaking as an American, exclusively. I can't for sure about other countries.*",False,False

Thing is, food is a completely appropriate topic of discussion, but I've so lost touch with how everyone else eats (and social cues in general) it's hard to know where the line is.",False,False

I still overthink everything I say about food/nutrition though...it’s okay if people know I know a lot, but I don’t want anyone realizing just how much thinking about food consumes my every waking moment.

I constantly feel the need to ask others about what they've eaten that day or what they plan on eating later. I also go on and on about the last thing I ate or what I'm having for dinner (mostly this is lies). It only dawned on me recently when my friend asked me why I was obsessed with talking about food all the time. It honestly makes up about 95% of my side of the conversation...,False,False

I feel the intense need to fit in so I talk a ton about food and ask coworkers for recipes and say how much I love *insert food I'll never eat here*  In reality, I don't cook and only consume black coffee, Gerber baby cookies, and psyllium husk caps.
