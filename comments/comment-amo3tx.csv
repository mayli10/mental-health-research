As someone else mentioned, it sounds like a type of food aversion, which is still a neurotic mental issue involving food. I’m only talking about it in these terms because I want you to understand that even though it appears on the surface that you don’t have any of the normally recognized eating disorders DOES NOT mean your situation is any less dangerous.  I’d highly recommend seeing a therapist that specializes in food aversion and eating disorders. None of us can give you medical diagnosis or treatment, so it would be safer to go to someone that has expertise and can interact with you directly. I’d suggest finding someone quickly though, that is a very low BMI, and can quickly cause major health issues.",False,False

If you're not intentionally seeking to be underweight, and you're avoidance of food is because it's unappealing to you rather than because calories are unappealing, you're probably in the clear in that department. Just be careful because not eating enough, even unintentionally, is dangerous. It can cause problems like stomach shrinkage and reflux that will make eating even more unpleasant, and yknow, kill you if it gets bad enough. I'm not sure which foods you find sickening, but maybe go for bland stuff? Nuts are good if you don't like to eat because they're nutritionally dense and, imo, very neutral.   You really should talk about it with your doctor, though. You might uncover a medical conditional, or at the very least you might get to work with a nutritionist to stay safe and figure out what works for you. If the thought of gaining weight is anxiety-inspiring, though, you should look for a psychologist too. ",False,False
