It was never an option until I did it once? And feeling like I HAVE to, because I know I can now, and stupidly because at least to ED brain goblin it's validation that yeah, maybe I AM disordered... ED logic is a monster.   I'm hoping that a weekend where I viably will be watched and in someone's presence breaks the ""streak"" a bit and I can snap myself out of the weird daily habit... I'm sorry you know the struggle - even more so than I do - and I wish the best for you ❤️",False,True

I had (and to some extent still have) an insane fear of throwing up, so I could never see myself purging. But yet, after a very nasty binge years ago, I caved and tried it. I felt terrible afterwards, but I also felt like I had discovered some kind of real life cheat code. I could literally eat whatever and press the magical undo button to make it all go away.  I think what made me fall down the rabbit hole was the feeling of *having* to do it again? Basically, before I had the excuse of never having tried making myself throw up, so who knows if I was even able to do it. But now that option was there, so there's no excuse to *not* do it. ED logic is really fucked up, man.  Anyways, I really hope you don't go down that road. Purging does so much damage to your body, arguably more than all my other ED behaviour. I really wouldn't wish that upon anyone.",False,False
