But that's a valid point :).",False,True

I hope we will both get to a healthier place. Posting this kind of motivated me to try to eat at maintenance/slight deficit and see where it takes me, this intense restriction is not doing any good for me. I guess the worst that could happen would be for me to remain normalweight, it's hard with the anorexia but not the end of the world I guess XD",False,True

(I swear liked it better as EDNOS...the sibilance and roundness of OSFED feels gross to me, lol.) I have also read that under AN, they can specify AN - partial remission. And there’s AN - B/P subtype but I dunno if compensatory restriction falls under the “P”.   This is kinda where I’m at too...weight still ok but engaging in cycles of restriction, intense exercise, then a couple higher calorie days b/c my body is screaming at me and I’m asking myself if I want to go back down this rabbit hole...and then feeling gross, freaking out, and jumping back to restriction. So far I guess my therapist is treating it as derivative from my other issues (BPD, BP2) so no ED dx on my chart presently. My brain fixates on how only getting my AN dx ‘back’ will be ‘good enough’. Which is an emotion the healthier part of me is ashamed of and is a sentiment I’d never foist on any other human...but I guess we’re usually great at offering compassion to all but ourselves.",False,False
