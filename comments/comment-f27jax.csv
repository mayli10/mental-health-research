I can relate to everything though as I binged very similar quantities.  Sadly mum buying binge food is a huge problem for me too &gt;_&lt;  Anyway, thanks for the hugs, Iâ€™m sending support and hugs your way too~ :3",False,False

If you mean purging been there done that, now my body physically refuses to do it :))), I mean even on bad days i don't go more than 3500~ Cal's with a maintenance of 2600-2800, so even though the logicalâ„¢ side of my brain is like ""it's not that bad, 1 lb max"" the rest of me is so fucking done cause I've been bouncing around the same weight for a while now lol. So atleast a day or 2 of restriction to get me to maintenance is necessary man, I can't afford to gain it ðŸ˜­. I didn't buy it, my mum did lol, eat normally or restrict i end up binging either way so I'm fucked both ways ðŸ˜Ž. Also sending hugs your way âŠ‚(ï½¥Ï‰ï½¥*âŠ‚)",False,True

I was 280lbs and I hated it so much and still do. That made me binge eat and then I got fatter. Donâ€™t try and restrict, try and eat normally as restricting will either make your binges worse or youâ€™ll go the other way like me which has its own host of issues. Iâ€™m glad thereâ€™s no more binge food, try to avoid buying it in future.  I know exactly how you feel with the italicised text as thatâ€™s how I feel now with my anorexia. To be honest I was if anything more functional when I binged. And Iâ€™m still fat. &gt;_&lt;",False,False

I'll try and restrict again tomorrow, there's thankfully no more binge food in the fridge so atleast 1 day moderate restriction ideally, wish me luck ðŸ˜”  *Why can't I be a normal functioning person, just study and sleep and eat and workout like normal and just be fucking useful to society smh*",False,True

Now Iâ€™m in basically full-on restriction mode but previously I would ask for toast with jam but make it SIX SLICES.  Personally I donâ€™t believe anyone forgets to eat when overly stressed but instead the people who say that briefly engage in disordered eating during stress for the feeling of control it gives. Iâ€™m definitely one of those people and during stress (even when Iâ€™m in a binging cycle) Iâ€™ll restrict super hard for the control.,False,False
