You end up meeting a lot of people like that in life and can spot them a mile away eventually. Not genuinely cool, but try to fake it. Wouldnâ€™t take that opinion to heart at all.",False,False

Itâ€™s not always easy to see ourselves objectively, so Iâ€™m sure youâ€™re more attractive that you give yourself credit for ðŸ’—",False,True

Honestly Reddit is the worst place to post your picture and ask for opinions - there are so many men here, most of them really young and ignorant, a bunch of guys who haven't even been with women yet but have this incredible unexplained hatred towards them. Please don't take what they said to heart. I think you're beautiful and you're young. And when you get a little older, I hope you can see it too. I'm 10 years older than you and truthfully I've only grown into my features a few years ago, so even if you're not happy with what you see in the mirror now, that might not be your ""final form"" if that makes sense.",False,False

But these people left some pretty nasty messages, haha   For e.g. :  ""Yes white women are for the most part way more attractive than dark skinned women, numerous studies have proven this, and the poster admits to this. Our society is being excessively polite by putting women of color on a pedestal. However black women in particular have more attractive bodies and Asian women have better skin and age less rapidly than white women. I canâ€™t find any advantage that south Asian women have. And this girl is ugly.""  And ""Yeah men are thirsty for everything and anything tbh. Thereâ€™s nothing special about you, Iâ€™m sorry. You have a funny looking face. It honestly looks like you bought a 99cent make up kit and you asked your mummy to do your eyebrows, youâ€™re not attractive. I used to know this Malaysian girl whoâ€™s family was from Sri Lanka, sheâ€™s darker than you and is honestly one of the hottest girls I have ever seen. I call out when I see attraction, but sad truth is most ethnic girls are not pretty. And I never mentioned this but your nose is unattractive""  Thank you so very much, though",False,False
