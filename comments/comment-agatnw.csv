I think I’ll try OMAD at 7pm everyday to keep my mind off food for the rest of the day. And yeah staying home is the worsttt especially when you are stuck doing work instead of being able to distract yourself with more fun stuffs like watching movies or reading etc :\  But I’m glad to see you’re okay!! :),False,True

I try and do IF on workdays... So usually skip breakfast, have lunch about 12 or 1pm. Then dinner at 6pm. I drink ridiculous amounts of tea and water at work to make myself think I'm full. And I'll limit myself to one snack in the afternoon, usually yoghurt or one biscuit cos sugar cravings. Giving myself an eating 'structure' helps me to not snack. Unfortunately my work colleagues are obsessed with food so there's always offers of snacks, and it was horrendous at Christmas with all the chocolate and biscuits! Luckily we recently moved offices and are further away from the shops, so it's harder to impulsively buy snacks, and if i don't bring any in, then I can't snack.   At home, it's so much harder cos snacks everywhere! But since I've started working out it's so much harder to 'allow' myself to snack. But if I do, I try and eat a few seeds/grapes/apple slices.

Video games help a lot too. I genuinely like cleaning and if I throw on a podcast im usually stimulated mentally and physically. Bonus points for drinking tons of coffee so I have the enthusiasm to take on too many projects.   Yesterday I organized the cords behind my tv and it was such a big undertaking it legit took about two hours. Now I’m WAY happier because I didn’t eat and I made a home improvement. ,False,False
