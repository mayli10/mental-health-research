I hope that doesn't screw up me making you feel better lol. You DON'T need to become overweight to be considered recovered. You're only .1 over. Maybe it's just a little bloat today. But hey, it's part of the challenge of recovery and feeling upset over this in no way means you need to give up recovery, it just means you have a new thing to start learning how to cope with.    Take a deep breath! Hug a doggo. Go for a walk. When you're on that walk really pay attention to how you feel. Try to note how good your body feels when you're fueling it properly. That walk is an entirely different experience when restricting. Believe me, I've done it!   I call that my new ""body check"". It's a check-in to make sure I'm listening to my body too, not just my brain.",False,False

You need to be overweight to be considered 'recovered'. Do you have a therapist you work with? How about giving them a shot to help direct your behaviors in a healthy manner to get your weight to a normal BMI? Part of recovery is learning how to regulate your own weight in a healthy way.    Those of us with EDs struggle so hard with this, but that's why help is available to us. You also have the whole community here to help support you. You're loved and you deserve to stay in recovery. ðŸ’™",False,False
