And I want to be free so bad. I can't do this anymore, I need to recover for good this time. No more half-assing it, no more relapses. This has to be it. I have to do this.",False,True

Having panic attacks over very small amounts of food like you're doing currently are so much more detrimental to your physical and mental health than the anxiety of recovery!! You have the power to recover and you'll live so much longer. No one wants to see you die from your eating disorder!!  Sending love and bravery over the internet, you can take those first shaky steps!!",False,False

I'm planning to reach out for help this week but I'm terrified. I'm scared in this inarticulate way I can't express, it's just this awful wordless terror at I don't even know- recovery? inability to recover? food? eating? Idk man. Sorry to ramble.",False,True
