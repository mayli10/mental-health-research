Last project I wanted to do a kintsugi gold filling in the middle of a sculpture but since she wanted us to limit our materials I didn't know what to do. Asked if I could do a gold filling with glue and after explaining for a while she was like I don't really get what you're saying but just go ahead and do it, so I'm getting it set up and much later she comes by and is like yeah I don't want you to use glue and said she thought I was doing it another way the whole time. Whatever, the piece came out alright and I didn't hate it.   Well, this past week we started a new project and I was making the building blocks of it with my jumbled sketch hanging out on the table beside me. She comes by right at the end of class and asks me about the orientation of it and I keep telling her it's one way but she keeps holding it the other way, asking me questions about problems I wouldn't have to deal with because i have it another way in my sketch!! I say it goes one way, and I know what I'm gonna be doing but I just have to build it and see if I like it irl, and as I'm explaining other parts of it she also starts holding those wrong and I'm just like :eyes: she makes a comment that she doesn't understand ""all of that"" referencing my sketch which is why I'm like I'll build it and then see how I like it ... then she asks me another completely offhand question about how the thing will end up being and I short circuit because at this point I'm kind of overwhelmed and i'm not sure if I'm being tested on a social cue? Like, when someone wants you to do something else but they won't outright say it, and want you to be the one to bring it up? I figure it might be this but she doesn't want to say anything because she made a reference to me maybe choosing another secondary material if it doesn't work out ... I laugh in awkwardness and am like, idk, and she outright says in kind of a tone (tm) that ""well you should get that figured out before you go too far!"" It just rubs me wrong because I do have everything build out in my head! My sketches made sense to me and I was trying my best to explain it but she kept changing it when I would put something a certain way!",False,False
