Take it from someone who walks on their lunch break, and walks to and from work, restricts heavily on Monday and Tuesday because it’s a different routine to the weekend. All I can tell you from experience is, no matter how much exercise or dieting you do your mind will always question and pick apart the image it sees in the mirror.    Take the time to re adjust. Holidays can very hard on someone with an ED. ED’s crave routine and sameness but a holiday’s can make you feel your away from everything that makes you feel safe.   The norm for a holiday is for a person to gain weight. You Mom must have been surprised. You were able to stay trim and reduce a little more.   I know it’s easy for me to say and type this reply but the likelihood is you have returned from holiday. You’re tired and a little stressed from traveling and you have the additional stress of your ED. Now you are trying to slip into your old routines and it’s all manifested in the form of self-doubt and what you’re perceiving in the mirror.    I personally never trust the mirror I work from the scales and muscle to fat ratios. BMI is a joke. Just an archaic and out of date concept. Just remember even this will pass. Take it from someone who is dealing with anorexia for a long time. Mirrors are not our friends.",False,False
