I have to have something with a substantial amount of fat, since most of the vitamins are fat soluble and useless without. Shiritaki noodles and lettuce doesn't cut it because I take so many.  Maybe if you just started with a complete mutlivitamin that doesn't tell you to have it with food? I didn't start off with taking all of those at once, I just started with a single multivitamin and gradually added over the years. I never originally ate it with food, either. Some multivitamin brands make you sick without food, but there are also some that don't. I guess just trying different ones? Women's pre-natal pregnancy multivitamins are good, because they often don't require you to eat them with food, and they generally have higher concentrations because they're supplementing for the baby as well. Also, anything that contains fish oil is more likely to make you sick - i'd suggest trying a vegan omega 3 supplement instead. Hope this helps :)",False,False
