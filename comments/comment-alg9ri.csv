I would recommend you use this as an opportunity as much as you can. Easier said than done, of course.  I'd give it a 4 hr window if you can't help yourself. ",False,False

Meds absorb faster on an empty stomach, so if you take them first there’s less risk of you throwing them up.",False,False

Be careful with prolonged-release capsules though as they are designed to take longer than that to absorb fully",False,False
