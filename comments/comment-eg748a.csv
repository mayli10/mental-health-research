Won't it make you anxious and make you feel bad?  But you can try it out. Like ask your loved ones what and how much do they eat and sit down once or twice a week with them and try to eat like them for a day or for, let's say, just lunch. This already will be soooo hard but a little step in the right direction. Definitely look at other people and how they eat. Try to find something that works for you and makes the first steps easier.  Recovery also brings things like weight gain, binges (so eating your tdee is very important. Restriction means binging in the evening now cause your body is scared you're taking the food away again) and more self hatred sometimes when your ed tries to sabotage everything. At least for me it's like this but I don't regret this. After a few weeks my life is so much easier because I have a much friendlier relationship with food. Still not 100% comfortable around it but better than it used to be.  Recovery is very hard and there will be days where you will regret starting it and will want to go back to your old ways... don't listen to your ed. It will try to stop you... be stronger than this little shit.  I wish you the best! And if you have questions or something else, just message me!",False,False

I definitely suggest that family and friends (that you trust) would be involved in helping and supporting you.  Especially in the beginning of recovery I think it’s best to have other people prepare/serve you food. (Like your parents or someone who you feel comfortable with) but make sure to discuss a meal plan so that you will be able to have stable meals on a regular schedule. A “typical” meal plan (at least from what I’ve seen)  is 3 meals and 2-3 snacks in between those meals. maybe consider getting Ensures (or something similar like boost or any other type of nutritional drink) if you think you may need it. They can be really helpful for getting the extra nutrition you need in the beginning.    Now quick disclaimer, I’m still in recovery so I’m probably not the best person to give advice but I’ll try.  I’m no doctor but from what I’ve learned, your body will probably need to relearn how to do some things that it would normally do. Just be patient and continue to nourish your body. Your body wants you to live a long, happy, and healthy life.  It’s really important to start building a good relationship with food, and to challenge yourself whenever your feel ready.  Also start building a good relationship with your body and self image  If you have any questions feel free to ask me.  I feel like a said a lot, so I’m sorry if I overwhelmed you.  I wish you the best of luck!!!",False,False
