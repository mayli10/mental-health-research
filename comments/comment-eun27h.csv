I think I will keep it vague and say I‚Äôve had a bulimia/eating disorder relapse, and only give more information if they ask. I‚Äôll also run everything through a friend and make sure I‚Äôm only saying what it relevant to my current issue. I‚Äôll chase up the counselling session too :)  Thank you again, you‚Äôve been really helpful. Wishing you the best too, good luck with your uni work! üíñüíñ",False,True

So first of all it would be best to get in touch with the counselling team and ask if they've processed your form yet, and explain that you're struggling with negative thoughts and emotions, and detrimental coping mechanisms that are affecting your studies. They need to get you assigned and starting sessions asap.  Secondly, weigh up the costs and benefits of explaining in detail to your tutor. If the things you're having issues with are directly impacting your ability to meet deadlines and expectations, then yes, explain away. For example: I work clinically with women, and have to observe and undertake very intimate procedures with them. I have been struggling with processing sexual trauma from childhood and found myself dissociating, unable to respond appropriately or undertake certain tasks. This is something that I'm considering taking up with my tutor, (without going into too much personal detail) because I want her advice on how to move forward to make sure I meet my clinical grade targets. I would hope there's a way to achieve a bare minimum to reduce the amount I have to be affected until I have a better handle on it, without having to explain every single time why I don't want to do a certain procedure.  I won't, however, be talking about my dietary habits or recent SH, because that's not impacting my ability to work clinically or meet deadlines, I feel. If she questioned it then possibly it would be a discussion to have, more to assure her I'm fit to practice than anything though.   If your grades, attendance and general well-being are taking a hit due to this then there's no harm requesting a meeting in a private environment and letting your tutor know that it's deeply personal and you'd appreciate some support. It may be that they directly get in touch with the counselling team for you to nudge some appointments through sooner, it might be that they have other suggestions that could help. They might ask if you can talk to your family about it, in which case be as honest as you can, because if you don't want your family involved then uni need to know so they don't keep encouraging a partnership that could make you feel worse.   And finally (sorry it's been a long one!) remember to keep advocating for yourself as much as you can. You deserve help and support, you deserve to feel better and you deserve that degree as much as anyone else. Whatever extra support you need to get it is neither here nor there, you're a person with a future that has every right to make the most of it. Wishing you the absolute best ‚ô•Ô∏è",False,False
