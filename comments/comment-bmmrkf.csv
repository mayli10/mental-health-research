Like I'm picturing a super (mentally unhealthy) race of people who can function well while fasting, exercise loads even if they feel like crap, will eat just about anything if they get hungry enough, etc, so it might turn into one giant contest.",False,False

Everyone else will stop eating for pleasure so often and stick to eating for fuel. Imagine: no confrontational office birthday celebrations, no gifts of full-calorie treats from well-meaning friends who expect you to eat it in front of them, no more “working on my bikini body” talk because running from zombies&gt;beach day, no more triggering congratulatory discussions about your weight because you need to be strong and fit enough to survive.   All of this is moot tho because I don’t think I’m any more special than a featured-extra zombie in a cutaway scene, I’m definitely not the protagonist in this life.  ETA: Also nutrition is our hobby/fixation so we could probably adjust to apocalyptic rations much more easily knowing how much we will need to eat each day.",False,False

I’d prefer to be skinny enough to run (from zombies or tsunamis) than painfully full!,False,False
