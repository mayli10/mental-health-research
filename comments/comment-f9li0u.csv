We got to pick topics to discuss every week and it was v helpful to hear other people struggling with the same things I was. I wasn’t ready for recovery so I probably didn’t get as much out of it as I could have, but I would recommend them!",False,False

I would definitely give it a solid chance and if after a few sessions you don’t find it to be helpful to recovery then that’s okay, maybe it’s not for you or maybe the timing is off. but I’d give it a shot!",False,False

Mainly the facilitator speaks and you take turns reading from an A.A. book for the majority of the time. It would be helpful to skim something in advance because that is pretty much the focus of the program. While there’s potential for socializing afterward and you can information about the non-public “closed meetings” or “step meetings” depending on where you are in the process, it’s not group therapy, it’s not a support group, it’s a Program. Some people just go to all of the Anon. meetings without regard for the specific audience because they need to. When I went at (24?) it was maybe a group of eight or so ranging between 18 and 40 years old. I only went to two meetings and left quickly afterward. If I was seeking social support in the future, I would probably use social media/join a discord/find a meetup group, etc. I hope this helped!",False,False
