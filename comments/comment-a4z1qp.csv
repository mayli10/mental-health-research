When my period hits I'm in there faster than you can say ratatouille.  I allow myself to eat whatever on my period though and then go back to restricting when it's done. ,False,False

It sucked to just want a ton of not even that good food.  Other times, I just budget for what I want, like if it's chocolate I'll have 200 cals of chocolate worked into my meal plan, and that might mean forgoing something healthier to make room for the chocolate.",False,False

Yesterday I ate around 1700 calories. Which is below my TDEE, but 600-700 more than I usually eat.  I did manage to work myself down into the 1400’s with yoga &amp; Pilates, and they were also beneficial to get things flowing and eased my cramps.  Today I’m already at 700 and my breasts ACHE and my abs burn so I may just resign myself to a maintenance day.  I absolutely cannot EC stack or even take caffeine pills / 24 hour energy because I’m already anxious and emotional and that’ll take me over the edge.",False,False
