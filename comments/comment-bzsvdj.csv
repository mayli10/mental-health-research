I am really trying to reframe things in my life. Recovery would be one of them.   I guess I wouldn't say I'm in recovery, but I have identified that this is in fact a problem (purging is always a problem, but I had myself convinced I could stop whenever I wanted- NOT true).   Now I'm moving on and trying to take one day at a time. I'm telling myself that one bad day isn't a reason to give up and doesn't erase progress I've made. I don't always believe it, but I know there's truth in it.",False,True

I am terrified of dentists and already had shitty teeth before bulimia. That is my nightmare.   And 100% yes to your tl;dr. I wish I took my ED seriously before I slid down this path.

Didn‚Äôt get real bad til college. Eventually I saw a counselor (not specifically for Ed) and he kinda pointed it out to me.

There is no way out of the consequence of not taking care of yourself. It is just more immediate or the future.   I am quite able to work off a smaller ""binge"" through exercise or being more active (but not in excess, which is also problematic). That's better for your body and reminds you to be more aware of what you're putting in your body.   I binged tonight and I'm purposely trying to stay out at my friends so I won't purge, but I'm horrified that I will back track all the weight loss I've had in the last 2 weeks.",False,True

I would just binge and binge until suddenly my stomach is in so much pain I could barely stand. Then I would look at the containers of food and it feels like someone else did all that.

I know purging speeds tooth damage up and an old friend of mine had all her teeth removed before she was 23 because she purged so much.  &amp;#x200B;  All ED habits are addictive and some seem impossible to kick.  No names mentioned, but I go on mpa to check up on someone on the accountability page.  She's been posting for years and it details how she's got to the point where she's b/p on average 12 times a day and that really makes me anxious about her and she's the only reason I go to that board, to check she's okay.  &amp;#x200B;  tl;dr   I totally agree with this post.
