I’m sorry you are dealing with this❤️",False,False

The phrasing is wonky, but the word still fits.   The use of it as a slur came much later. “Retard” is actually commonly used in music, still. :)",False,False

You can say “my growth has been retarded” to imply your growth has been held back in development some way. However many people in the U.S. now are obsessed with being politically correct. So native speakers tend to just avoid the word now because of the mental implications. But you did use the word in the correct and not offensive manner.,False,False

Your body needs the fat storage to properly create and release the hormones that cause the growth into ~sexual maturity~.   But, there’s options to build muscle for some shape and hormone therapy that’ll help to a point. And clothing can be a boost of confidence to help your silhouette better fit how you’d like.   This is where EDs really blow and fuck your up. Pretty unfair, but it’s the name of the game.",False,False
