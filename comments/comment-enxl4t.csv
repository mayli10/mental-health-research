Maybe try not planning or structuring workouts and just do what feels right? Not sure if this will work in your case but it helped with me.,False,False

I'd start with some low intensity classes (like yoga, stretching, deep breathing/meditation), those will still bring about a lot of health benefits but aren't as high impact or focused on energy burn. Journal how you feel before and after to check in with yourself, and be honest. Set a week every couple of months where you drop down to maybe 0 or 1 class per week, and note if you feel any compulsions or obsession again.   Something else I suggest is to a commitment that you'll bring a protein bar or cliff bar or something and eat it on the way to the class, or half an hour before. To make it more difficult to slip back into restricting or compensating...ect. Also of you have someone (therapist, friend, or SO, or even someone online) that could help you hold yourself accountable to as well? Someone that you can check in with regarding properly fueling yourself for the class/routine you do and check to make sure you aren't becoming obsessive (both of which are very very important for health and fitness even if your brain tries to convince you otherwise!!)",False,False
