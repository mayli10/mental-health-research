There are different exercises that affect your muscles in certain ways (some add muscle mass and some strengthen and tone your muscles). If you do exercises that are meant to build booty, you’re probably gonna build a bit of thigh. But! The nice thing about that is if you combine fat-burning with muscle-strengthening, you wind up with lean and rock-hard legs. Your legs can still be small, but if you don’t have much muscle, they’ll still feel kind of squishy. Add some lean muscle, and your legs won’t have squish. Warning! Muscle weighs more than fat, so you’ll most likely put on a few pounds. But it’s not fat, it’s muscle, and having a low fat and good lean mass still makes you look fit and lean :)",False,False
