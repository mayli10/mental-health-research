He's started expressing his opinions more since I've prodded him and told him how I don't want to guess or have it all about my desires.  There's still a part of me that wants to have a big party and be the center of attention. But even that's probably unhealthy. It feels like when I post something on Instagram, I get a wave of validation, but then emptiness. Or when I think, if I just post the right things on Instagram, all my followers will actually want to be *friends*.  If I pull off an awesome party and look beautiful, people will actually care about me. It's confusing.",False,True

If he wants those people there he needs to actually own and express that and not just expect you to do what he wants without acknowledging that it's a concession for you.,False,False

This is my fiance’s second marriage so he just wants me to have what I want, but I know he’d be disappointed if his family and friends weren’t there. And he has lots of family and lots of friends...",False,True

Unfortunately my boyfriend is pretty dead set on having at least our family there so I'm just gonna have to suck it up :(,False,False

That's such a great reminder.   I feel lots of pressure to host a great, elaborate party, which I think is pretty common. It's discouraging to get downvoted on this, but oh well!",False,True

You don't *have* to do anything you don't want to.  It's yours and your fiance(e)'s day to celebrate your love, and you get to decide the best way to go about it.",False,False
