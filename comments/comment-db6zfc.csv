I'd been casually, slowly relapsing already for the past several months on my own, shaming myself for the amount I'd eat, never buying snack food (snack food and junk food are huge triggers because I have no impulse control). It increased when I got laid off, because for me stress is a huge trigger, specifically financial stress. Whenever money's an issue, the food budget is the first to get axed. So I'm living alone, jobless, going to bed for dinner, taking longer and longer morning walks, tracking calories on my Fitbit.  And then my partner and I move in together, and everything implodes in ED-land. There's snacks and junk food in the house suddenly, so I'm refusing to touch ANY of it, and now money's all muddled and pooled together, so there's food WE bought in the fridge but my brain is screaming at me that it's HIS food because he's the one getting a paycheck and I don't deserve that food, and I was also entirely convinced that because he needs food to take to work or have on hand when he gets home, that I shouldn't be eating _any_ of the leftovers from our meals. He'd also comment on what I ate or if I was getting seconds/not getting seconds, or if I hadn't eaten yet, or if I was hungry too early for dinner, etc. Small talk comments that really triggered me. I also completely lost control of the cooking situation, because he's by far the better cook so he cooks 90% of the meals, and he's certainly a fan of olive oil used liberally and not measuring things. An ED sufferer's worst nightmare, basically.  I eventually got so bad with not eating and over-exercising that I forced myself to come clean to him, and I've been trying to recover since. None of it is his fault, but it's just a difficult environment to navigate.",False,False

She can sometimes make it a lot worse but subtlety supporting some of my wack behaviours. And unintentionally touching parts of me can either feel like hell yeah don’t cut yourself on those hip bones. But can also be like... why is your hand sinking 2 mm into the bulbous flesh at that location.   Just can’t win y’all.,False,False

But as long as your partner is actually a decent fucking human being, they won’t care about your weight as long as you’re healthy.",False,False

Just same, man. But just remember that you are setting your own standards and that your partner loves you.",False,False
