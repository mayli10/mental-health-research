I get it though, there’s many things that I can’t relate to that makes me feel like I’m faking it.  but honestly, the fact that you have c/s and are eating very few calories, or that you’re on these subreddits as a way to get support are enough reasons to say that your struggles are very real and valid.",False,False

For me that’s how it started and it still mostly that.  I rarely binge, maybe twice in the last year rarely.  I purge but it’s more about control and it didn’t start until at least 6 months into my eating disorder.  The reason you see other behaviors on here though is because a lot of the time if you are constantly restricting one of two things happen.  One you lose so much weight and become so weak that you go to the hospital (weather it’s your choice or not.) Or two, your eating disorder morphs and you start doing other things(like binging.). It’s completely unsustainable over any length of time to eat what most people are eating while restricting.  It puts to much strain on your body.  Basically you cannot be purely anorexic for a great deal of time, it’s very rare that someone has met and continues to meet the criteria for anorexia for years.  Some people do, just it at least seems to me that most people end up more in EDNOS area.  ",False,False

I don’t over exercise either, which makes me feel like a phony. I’ve been doing ~400 or fasting too, and even though my BMI isn’t terrifically low our suffering has to count for something right?
