I’m trying to see all the differences from 2 and some shit is so crazy. I was playing one of the pre-made lots and the household all died (before I was FINISHED DOING WHAT I WANTED WITH THEM, rude) but now they’re doing it anyway, just as ghosts, and have adopted living children?? It’s a ride omg I’m so happy. I also uninstalled all the mods/cc I had prior bc I haven’t opened it in so long, everything is outdated, and my computer is old/slow as shit so I figured I’d play the base game “pure” before I tried any of the other shit. I am, after all, just used to Sims 2 lol, and even without anything “special”, it’s so much more advanced!  I’m glad you feel great at least!! It’s definitely frustrating when you drink a lot and don’t get the desired affect. There’s always next time!",False,False

I remind myself that it’s not real, so I don’t count it for losses or gains. It’s pretty easy to do the math and see if you have eaten enough to lose or gain weight (and approx how much weight) so I just try to keep the logic front and center if I’m suddenly 3 lb heavier even though my calorie deficit is enough to lose 1 lb every other day.   Alcohol is dehydrating, so it may actually make you lose water weight overnight, but because you’re dehydrated you might retain water during the next day. So if you only check weight in the morning it shouldn’t be too noticeable, and the retained water you accumulate later in the day should be gone by the next morning.  Maybe it’s because I’ve been dealing with it for 10 years now and I would have gone absolutely nuts by now, but I’ve become a lot more practical and forgiving about that sort of stuff over time.",False,False
