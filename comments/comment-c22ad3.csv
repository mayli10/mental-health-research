My dumbass will probably still continue talking and going out with him, ofc.",False,True

Crazy person logic ftw üëå lol but yeah, you're probably right about bringing it up to him and talking about. I'm just nervous about doing so because I don't want him thinking that I'm self conscious enough to even bring it up again despite that I am. It's a conundrum. Thanks for the good advice, though, I'm going to try talking to him about it later!",False,True

I know what I'd do but it's honestly not good advice - I'd just blank him and if he wonders why I'd probs lose my shit entirely and tell him to never comment on my body again. This is NOT good advice, this is crazy person advice though. You could talk to him about it though, if you still want to see him - tell him that comments like that aren't compliments, no matter what social media says, and that it's generally just not a good idea to comment on someone's body unless you know them REALLY well and know what kind of body they *like* having.  And yeah fuck ""thick"", ""thicc"", and all variants thereof. Fuck that shit so much, I hate it, it sucks, and it's the worst. If I could make it illegal to say, I would.",False,False
