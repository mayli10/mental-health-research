On the flip side with enough water itll be like a fuckin bread loaf in your colon and just clean it all out.,False,False

I actually bought it for make me feel full since it swells up, but anyway it's basically straight fiber. Doesn't fuck me up like stimulant lax does and the fact that it made me actually poop was sort of a surprise, considering how long it's been. The timing is kind of irritating, but that's probably due to the time I take it. Also it isn't painful like stimulant lax is.",False,True
