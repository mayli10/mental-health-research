I appreciate the effort but I'm dealing with some GI issues so I'm preparing meals with only certain ingredients. Oh that's really kind of You but I'm trying to cut out xyz from my diet. You could mention things you do like or are eating right now. Side note: not advocating lying but I validate your not wanting to hurt others feelings and wanting your privacy while you're struggling with complied eating issues. It's really good you recognize they just do this out of care and love. You could show/tell them others ways you'd appreciate them showing that if that idea might work.,False,False
