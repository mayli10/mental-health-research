I'm getting a breast reduction, sometimes  I wish I could get a mastectomy but nobody will do it since I'm not at a breast cancer risk or trans.   gc2b is the safest chest binder you can get. do it as little as you can, only when you go out. I'd suggest baggy shirts and tight sports bras if it is too much at home. never sleep in any form of chest binding, it can mess you up. I feel you so hard here,  good luck.",False,False

My go-to has been wearing very tight bralettes or thin sports bras, which gives a similar effect.   Does anyone have suggestions for what to do about dysmorphia around hips?  I wish there was an equivalent to binders that would make them smaller.",False,False

Binging too tight can malform the ribs and damage your lung capacity permanently. Please read about this before using too tight of a binder. Ribs can bend on the center of the chest and create pressure to lungs and heart. Alternatively/additionally you can use different cut of clothings to make you more comfortable.,False,False

Even now that I’m much smaller and my chest size has gone down a lot I never wear regular bras. Maybe try that to start with before you go straight to binding, and see if it helps at all?",False,False

What I do is basically just wear two sports bras. The first one forward normally, and then the second one backwards. Sometimes I'll also wear three but that's mostly a dysphoria thing and makes it uncomfortably tight, which since you have a small chest wouldn't be needed anyway. It can start forming into your chest after a while and so you may have to adjust every so often but for the most part it still binds. And also a tip would be to use bras that're slightly a size too small if you can.   This is just one way though and it's definitely not as good as having an actual binder but it's what I do, it works pretty well, and I'm *pretty* sure it's safer than other impromptu methods.",False,False

Probably one of the weirder parts of my disorder. I typically only do it after a terrible binge period and it automatically makes me look so much thinner so I don’t have a full mental breakdown   Just be careful with it because when I did it for awhile last year I had back pain and weird breathing issues  I wish I could get my tits removed completely tbh and they’re not even that big,False,False
