Also ty for the tip about the pumps.   The baristas here just seem really snooty. Granted we do have a large homeless population around here but I'm always clean, well dressed.. I feel like they judge me because I usually walk here and walk back home. And only get coffee and just sit on my phone. Although, that could be my anxiety too. *sigh*",False,True

I doubt anyone deliberately sabotaged your drink (tbh I don't think any of my coworkers even know how many calories are in the regular vanilla), but when it's busy or people aren't paying attention mistakes can definitely happen. They should always have a black syrup pump for sugar free and white for regular, so watch out for that.   That said, if you ever feel your drink isn't done correctly, for any reason, tell us!!! It's literally our job to make sure you enjoy your time at Sbux (we also shouldn't be rude to you for hanging out - I'm so sorry about that). But seriously,  no one will question you if you ask for a remake. We won't charge you again or interrogate your need for sugar free or do anything to make you uncomfortable.   I'm so sorry that you felt unsafe there, hopefully it doesn't happen again, but please say something if it does! &lt;3 (also, blonde roast is definitely the best roast)  Edit: grammar",False,False
