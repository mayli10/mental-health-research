I noticed that all of the girls my boyfriend follows on instagram have huge boobs and huge butts, but tiny waists. I noticed he also followed several slim thiccc chicks. He just followed so many girls who look nothing like me. I also snooped/lurked too hard and realized a lot of the porn he watched was with girls who have bodies that aren't anything like mine. I'm petite with very little boobs and a little butt. This made me feel like he would never be attracted to me. And then at one point he said he ""wouldn't mind if I got a boob job"" which I never brought up because I prefer to be flat chested and fragile looking. The whole thing really hurt my feelings and I totally understand what you're feeling dude",False,False

If anything, I see lying as the biggest issue here. Lying = lack of trust, and without trust, there is no relationship.   Yep, that‚Äôs utter bullshit. I recommend you checking out r/pornfree.  I myself was actually dependent upon porn before I met my boyfriend. We were both heavy porn users and have very high libidos, and we actually originally quit porn because the orgasms we received from each other were actually a lot stinger than the ones we received from porn.  And then I realized how fucked up it actually is to get yourself off to other people when you‚Äôre supposed to be in a monogamous relationship, and we both agreed it was at least microcheating, and we both strive to be virtuous and have an ideal relationship, so we both agreed to be pornfree forever.  That being said, we also have sort of an unconventional relationship. We want a traditional, 1950‚Äôs-esque relationship, so we are both accustomed to doing things outside of the norm anyway.  We figured that having an ideal relationship, 100% monogamous relationship is much more important to us than getting a temporary, hedonistic fix from porn.",False,False

Maybe cause I'm past my teenage years but this never bothered me! Like my boyfriend is dating me specifically for a reason, I don't want to wake up in the middle of the night before I have to go to work to have sex... Go watch porn! I see it like reading a book when he's busy. Sure, as his girlfriend I love hearing about his day, but when I'm bored and mentally unstimulated I'm gonna read a book instead of replaying his accounting of why Jason was fired last week....
