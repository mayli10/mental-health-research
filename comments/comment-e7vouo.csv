I definitely relate to the grandparent thing- i never wanted to talk on the phone and both of my grandparents on my dads side passed away this decade. Im sure your grandpa wouldnt want you to hate yourself over this, and recognizes that you loved him even if you had some other issues going on.  I also had no clue Juice Wrld passed away, he was one of my favorite artists as well (also Lil Peep and x too). Are you close with any family members or friends who are understanding? I think reaching out to them and letting them know whats going on can help. Please try to take care of yourself even if its baby steps.",False,False

Do you have someone to reach out to? A family member or a friend?  I have called people at midnight to come to my place bc I was spiraling and honestly it was one of the best decisions of my life, being alone in times like these is the perfect setup for self destruction (at least for me)",False,False
