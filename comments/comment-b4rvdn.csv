The bottle feeding scene too had a strong message but was.... uncomfy   One part I’m glad they included, even though it was probably the toughest to watch, was with the woman that had a miscarriage (it’s been a while since I’ve seen it I don’t remember her name srry). I think showing the awful reality of what living with an ED is like was really important (if I remember correctly she miscarried while purging).  ",False,False

It was super boring and she wasn't leading some glam life. Everyone gets all weird around the bottle feeding thing which was kind of weird.. but as a mother if it were my daughter I wouldn't care how fucking weird I got if she wouldn't eat and was dying. I would do anything! So I understood from that perspective!,False,False

I didn't finish the movie because the scenes between them made me so uncomfortable. I don't know if maybe their dynamic gets resolved in a more positive way by the end, but I thought that was a really poor choice to portray someone like him as a viable relationship partner for the main character. I was really worried while I was watching it about how many impressionable young people might watch that movie and think that his creepy, intrusive, and inappropriate behavior is okay or even romantic.  I also wish the other members of the program were more developed and that there was more conversation around different kinds of eating disorders and how they all have core similarities as well as distinct differences and treatment needs.",False,False

I struggled to take the keanu reeves doctor seriously, he didn’t seem like he actually did anything to help anyone. What was the whole change your name to Eli thing about? I thought they were going down the road of like, examining gender or something and how it relates to ED but it was just never addressed again. ",False,False

I very much liked the dream/vision scene at the end because visions, dreams and introspection are what finally led me to the beginning of genuine recovery. But, some of it I found difficult to watch, I thought the boyfriend was sometimes quite inappropriate and the scene with her mother and the bottle made me feel rather uncomfortable even though it was quite beautiful. My guess would be that she didn’t permanently recover after the end but rather set down the road for recovery/relapse periods that may go on for years or decades like mine did but I have hope that she eventually gets there ☺️",False,False

It had some weird bits I didn't really need to happen, and the actual suffering could've been shown more rather than just a perpetually kinda mean attitude.
