Like massively long and compulsivly frequent bike riding. So she's DEFINITELY normal and not disordered at all which is why she is obsessed with shit talking everyone to make herself seem superior.

Like full on wtf is wrong with her does she need a handler crazy. They are just not normal. So don‚Äôt take anything she says to heart. More that likely it‚Äôs just for attention. I mean, really, someone who eats that many bananas and who is with someone who eats that many durians.
