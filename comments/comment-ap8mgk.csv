Ya know, I'm just reading it over the internet. Do you think there's a possibility she thinks models look unhealthy and that they starve themselves? Is it possible she doesn't want you to look *sick like the models*?  I'm just trying to look for the good in people. Like I said, it's hard for me to tell without context, reading it with the emotionless monotone voice in my head.",False,False

I remember him telling me that I'm destined to go through a chubby phase because that's how it is in our family. Our female cousins, aunts, etc. So I proved him wrong by losing weight. Ever since I haven't been that ""overweight"". He doesn't comment on my appearance, only positive things once in a while.  My mom will say things about her own body, like lament that she's getting fat (she's always been attractive and average weight), and gets really nitpicky about my eating if I'm at their house. She knows I've had an ED and is genuinely concerned, but then she'll say stuff like that I look like a model and how thin I'm getting. She'll say I look skinny (but good) and sounds upset as she says it. She'll ask how much I'm eating. Or how she wishes she was thin. Confusing stuff.  When I gained my weight back after my lowest weight in years and she looked at me with this look of stern satisfaction and said, good, you look very ""healthy"" now.  Geez I so hate the description of ""healthy"".  I love my mom and she's wonderful, but the ED stuff is a killer and really makes these comments sting.  &amp;#x200B;",False,True
