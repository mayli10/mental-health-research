My BFF was UW, and she used to call herself fat in a daily basis. She had shown basic signs of an ED, when she ate she called herself a pig, she never had sweets, and when I was OW she advised me to eat only fruit because she used to do it and it worked. As a person who also has an ED it sucked to hear her calls herself fat because it made me feel more self-conscious, but at the same time I wanted to help her get better. Luckily she's in recovery now.",False,False

It's not a reflection on you in any way - his disorder doesn't think of you just like yours doesn't think of him. I know it still sucks to hear that though.,False,False
