I'm 26 and got diagnosed with anorexia at age 15 and every time my therapist tells me she is proud of me for choosing not to exercise, eating a sugar cookie, or eating a full lunch one day, I feel wrong for taking pride in that. I have a hard time recognizing my successes already because I'm so perfectionistic, but I find it sad that my therapist sees it as a ""success"" that I'm able to eat and do things that everyone else around me does without a second thought. Ugh...that's why recovery is so much better (I'm working towards it slowly) because then you actually get to feel excited about eating for yourself, instead of having to be congratulated for eating by someone else.",False,False
