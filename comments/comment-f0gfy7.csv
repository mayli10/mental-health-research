Clothing sizes have straight up changed eg I am an 8-10 in modern UK clothes sizing but according to my mum's old sewing patterns I'm a 12, however in those days a 12 would have been considered small. My mum was 10-12 when she was young and was considered thin in the way a 6-8 is considered thin today.  I guess the point I'm trying to make is that even if the number on the clothes would be higher if we went back 40 years it doesn't mean that you would be considered ""fat"" due to that number, it would have a different meaning compared to today. I also haven't noticed any sizing changes in the last 10 years of my life wearing adults women's clothing from shops like topshop and UO.  I feel very certain someone who is an M nowadays wouldn't ever be considered an XL. I hope this helps ðŸ’“",False,False
