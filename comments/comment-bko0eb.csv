Tempted by Wacoal, especially in their website they have really good sales. Nordstrom carries them in store as well if you want to try before you buy.   But honestly, especially if you are looking to downplay them, I’d say just wear sports bras. I have a couple by Champion from Target that do a great job of keeping them in check without making them a weird shape, and without bulky straps and stuff that would be visible under clothes. I forgot the model name, but they are thin, very stretchy, racer back style with adjustable bra straps and are $10-15. They compress enough that I am able to wear a 00 button up over them without popping buttons (which none of my bras allow).   Also, Fabletics has a good selection of sports bras in a XXS which equates to a 30” band- although some styles do gap at the armpits because they aren’t meant to hold so much volume.",False,False

A fitted lululemon top is a miracle.  -V necks. Not necessarily to show a bunch of cleavage, but a bit of chest bone showing breaks up the bulk.  -Fitted tank tops at Target, $8 come in a million colors and are very fitted. One under an open cardigan or partially buttoned shirt for coverage.",False,False
