This semester since I haven‚Äôt been binding I haven‚Äôt been purging a lot. But when I do purge it‚Äôs after i eat pretty much any meal. I think I popped a blood vessel in my eye cuz there were red streaks across it and I have cuts in my throat as I throw up blood and have constant throat aches.,False,False

It was hell. I pissed in my pants, got vomit all over me a couple times, pulled out my back, almost ruined my teeth. If you can stop now, do it. Purging is hell. ",False,False

And now I have almost no enamel on my teeth and the bottoms of my teeth stain black very easily. I also have a funky esophageal sphincter. If I am upside down or leaning forward (think downward dog) or doing burpees I get terrible heart burn. And just heartburn and GERD issues in general. I also swell up easily but Idk if I can attribute it to that. And that‚Äôs just the damage I‚Äôve dealt with so far. Haven‚Äôt purged in a few years because I ‚Äúrecovered‚Äù but I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôll have more bodily damage down the road. I stared seeing damage pretty quickly but it lessened the longer I had stopped, just never went away. I‚Äôll have to get new teeth someday. ",False,False

I‚Äôm trying to move away from both heavy restriction and binging/purging habits (faux-recovery because I‚Äôm not weight restoring, so more like minimizing damage), so I‚Äôll keep that in mind!!",False,True
