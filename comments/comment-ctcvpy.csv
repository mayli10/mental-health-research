Had a potluck during a 2 hr meeting the other day and I kept getting up like 3x to get donut holes. It didn’t help that I exercise before work so when I see all those pastries I can devour my whole days worth of calories in small amount of time. But hey that’s what I get for overexercising and undereating. Uncontrollable extreme hunger is a bitch and worse when it’s around amazing food like donuts,False,False

Or stuck in a binge/restrict cycle or some shit? Because funny enough, when you are deprived of nutritions for some time your brain is always “hungry” even through you’re physically full.   I would say try to eat three meals a day but keep it to a real amount of calories needed a day, after a week or so your brain would stop being so damn demanding.",False,False
