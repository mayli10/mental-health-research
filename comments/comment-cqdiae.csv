I will do what I'm supposed to, fill out your worksheets, go to therapy.  And then all my mental health team likes me and thinks I'm doing great and i leave and want to die and go straight back to doing everything.  I don't know if I'll ever get better. I tried really hard to talk to this therapist about the problem this creates and it still didn't work. I can't help projecting that I'm fine. I am not able to be honest about how I'm doing. That is a problem/symptom in itself, it isn't just me not being compliant.   I don't know how compulsive liars get help, because it seems like when you say ""my *problem* is not being able to stop lying about how I'm doing."" they just say ""well I can't help you if you lie to me.""   like yeah, I know. Thats my point.",False,False

I'm the complete opposite of a people-pleaser, so maybe someone else can speak to that... I'm sorry your friends think you're a burden. That's cruel and I'm SURE it's untrue. They don't deserve you. Anyway maybe you can see a therapist at school?",False,False
